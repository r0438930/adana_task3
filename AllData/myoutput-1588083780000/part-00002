Gerrit is used for the code review process of both the operating system and the infrastructure.\n\nThe wiki, containing information regarding installation, support, and development of LineageOS, is also open to contributions through Gerrit. Other Lineage platforms include Crowdin for managing translations, [[GitLab|Gitlab Issues]] for bug tracking, and a stats page, which displays the number of active installations from users which opt-in to report this statistic. There is also an official [[Reddit|subreddit]], r/lineageos, and two [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC channels]] hosted on [[Freenode]] (''#lineageos'' and ''#lineageos-dev'').{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe XDA Developers forums have been used by members of the Lineage community since the first inception of the software, many devices are left unsupported by official releases so community members develop their own Unofficial-ROMs that allow older phones to use Lineage. These unofficial releases are often bundled with software intended to aid the user's experience that would otherwise be unseen in an official release. They also come with known bugs and security issues that may not be seen in official releases.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDuring August 2017 the LineageOS team held a Summer Survey<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lineageos.org/Summer-Survey/|title=Summer Survey|last=LineageOS|website=Lineageos.org|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> in which they asked users for feedback to improve the development of the operating system.

For some permissions, it's possible to set a manual approval each time the permission is requested. It's also possible to find out how often apps use a specific permission. This feature was removed in the 17.1 branch in favor of an equivalent \"permission controller\" based on an hidden AOSP feature.\n* Protected Apps \u2013 Hide specific apps behind a secure lock. This works hand-in-hand with Trebuchet; the app's icon is removed from the launcher, and \"secure folders\" can be created to easily access these applications. A pattern is used to lock these apps.\n* Some \"sensitive numbers\", such as abuse support numbers, are not included in the call log for privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Changelog-10/|title=Changelog 10 - Sensitive numbers and our CVE Tracker|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org}}</ref>\n* Trust - helps to keep the device secure and protects privacy.\n\n==== Developers & power user features ====\n\n* LineageSDK \u2013 a set of APIs for app developers to integrate their apps with LineageOS specific features such as System Profiles, Styles and Weather.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Introducing-the-LineageSDK/|title=Introducing the LineageSDK|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>\n*Lineage Recovery - an AOSP-based recovery for devices with an A/B type system.\n* (Optional) Root \u2013 Permit apps to function with [[Superuser|root access]] to perform advanced tasks. This requires flashing from Recovery either LineageOS's root add-on or a third-party implementation such as Magisk or SuperSU.\n* Telephone call recorder, not available in all countries, due to legal restrictions.\n* Weather providers \u2013 Display the weather in widgets or apps using a weather provider. This functionality is not included by default; a weather provider must be downloaded from the LineageOS Downloads website. App developers can create both providers and consumers of weather data.\n\n==Trust interface==\nAs LineageOS evolved through development, the Trust interface was introduced for all the LineageOS 15.1 builds released since 12 June 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Trust-me/|title=Trust me, I'm an engineer|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org}}</ref> The interface can be found on supported devices under Security and Privacy tab under the Settings option, and enables the user to \"get an overview of the status of core security features and explanations on how to act to make sure the device is secure and the data is private\".\n\nAdditionally, while carrying out any action on the device, the trust icon is displayed, notifying the user that the action is safe.\n\n==Supported devices==\nThe number of devices supported by LineageOS increases with time, being 105 for v15.1 and v16 {{As of|2019|8|25|lc=y|df=US}}.<ref name=\"hudson build targets\"/><ref name=\"devices\">{{cite web|url= http://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/ |title= Devices |website= LineageOS Wiki |access-date= 2019-11-23 }}</ref> Official builds on currently supported development branches are labeled as either \"nightly\", \"weekly\", or \"monthly\".

There is also an official [[Reddit|subreddit]], r/lineageos, and two [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC channels]] hosted on [[Freenode]] (''#lineageos'' and ''#lineageos-dev'').{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe XDA Developers forums have been used by members of the Lineage community since the first inception of the software, many devices are left unsupported by official releases so community members develop their own Unofficial-ROMs that allow older phones to use Lineage. These unofficial releases are often bundled with software intended to aid the user's experience that would otherwise be unseen in an official release. They also come with known bugs and security issues that may not be seen in official releases.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDuring August 2017 the LineageOS team held a Summer Survey<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lineageos.org/Summer-Survey/|title=Summer Survey|last=LineageOS|website=Lineageos.org|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> in which they asked users for feedback to improve the development of the operating system. The results were published<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lineageos.org/Summer-Survey-Results/|title=Summer Survey - Results|last=LineageOS|website=Lineageos.org|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> in October and, according to the team, they used the gathered data to improve the upcoming LineageOS 15 release.

Some of these features are:\n\n==== Customization features ====\n\n* Button customization \u2013 Set custom location for buttons on the navigation bar, or enable on-screen buttons for devices with hardware buttons.\n* Custom Quick-Setting tiles \u2013 Quick Setting Tiles such as \"Caffeine\" preventing the device from sleeping, enabling/disabling Heads Up notifications, \"Ambient Display\" and \"ADB over network\" are present to easily toggle frequently accessed settings.\n* LiveDisplay \u2013 Adjust color temperature for the time of day.\n* Lock screen customization \u2013 The lock screen allows all sorts of customizations, including media cover art, a music visualizer, and double-tap to sleep.\n* Styles \u2013 Set a global dark or light theme mode and customize accent colors. This functionality can also be managed automatically by the system based on wallpaper or time of day (in line with LiveDisplay).\n* System Profiles \u2013 Enable or disable common settings based on the selected profile (For example, a \"Home\" profile and a \"Work\" profile). The profile can be selected either manually or through the use of a \"trigger\", such as upon connecting to a specific WiFi access point, connecting to a Bluetooth device, or tapping an [[Near-field communication|NFC]] tag.\n*Custom pattern sizes \u2013 In addition to Android's 3x3 pattern size, a 4x4, 5x5 or 6x6 size can be used.\n\n==== Security & privacy features ====\n\n* PIN scramble \u2013 For users securing their device with a [[Personal identification number|PIN]], the layout can be scrambled each time the device locks to make it difficult for people to figure out your lock by looking over your shoulder.\n* Privacy guard \u2013 Allow the user to fine-tune what permissions are granted to each application. For some permissions, it's possible to set a manual approval each time the permission is requested. It's also possible to find out how often apps use a specific permission. This feature was removed in the 17.1 branch in favor of an equivalent \"permission controller\" based on an hidden AOSP feature.\n* Protected Apps \u2013 Hide specific apps behind a secure lock. This works hand-in-hand with Trebuchet; the app's icon is removed from the launcher, and \"secure folders\" can be created to easily access these applications. A pattern is used to lock these apps.\n* Some \"sensitive numbers\", such as abuse support numbers, are not included in the call log for privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Changelog-10/|title=Changelog 10 - Sensitive numbers and our CVE Tracker|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org}}</ref>\n* Trust - helps to keep the device secure and protects privacy.\n\n==== Developers & power user features ====\n\n* LineageSDK \u2013 a set of APIs for app developers to integrate their apps with LineageOS specific features such as System Profiles, Styles and Weather.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Introducing-the-LineageSDK/|title=Introducing the LineageSDK|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>\n*Lineage Recovery - an AOSP-based recovery for devices with an A/B type system.\n* (Optional) Root \u2013 Permit apps to function with [[Superuser|root access]] to perform advanced tasks. This requires flashing from Recovery either LineageOS's root add-on or a third-party implementation such as Magisk or SuperSU.\n* Telephone call recorder, not available in all countries, due to legal restrictions.\n* Weather providers \u2013 Display the weather in widgets or apps using a weather provider. This functionality is not included by default; a weather provider must be downloaded from the LineageOS Downloads website. App developers can create both providers and consumers of weather data.\n\n==Trust interface==\nAs LineageOS evolved through development, the Trust interface was introduced for all the LineageOS 15.1 builds released since 12 June 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Trust-me/|title=Trust me, I'm an engineer|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org}}</ref> The interface can be found on supported devices under Security and Privacy tab under the Settings option, and enables the user to \"get an overview of the status of core security features and explanations on how to act to make sure the device is secure and the data is private\".\n\nAdditionally, while carrying out any action on the device, the trust icon is displayed, notifying the user that the action is safe.\n\n==Supported devices==\nThe number of devices supported by LineageOS increases with time, being 105 for v15.1 and v16 {{As of|2019|8|25|lc=y|df=US}}.<ref name=\"hudson build targets\"/><ref name=\"devices\">{{cite web|url= http://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/ |title= Devices |website= LineageOS Wiki |access-date= 2019-11-23 }}</ref> Official builds on currently supported development branches are labeled as either \"nightly\", \"weekly\", or \"monthly\".

Affected builds also had a preinstalled \"Wallet\" app that showed the current balance of LOSCoins.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nMany users mistook the prank for actual [[malware]], and others reportedly found it to be in \"poor taste\". It was especially criticized for being too \"late\" for an April Fool's joke, since many users didn't receive the update until days later, making the jest less obvious.
