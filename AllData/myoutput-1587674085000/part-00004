The division is located on the west side of the [[Tamar River, Tasmania|Tamar River]]. It is named after the town of Rosevears which is located on the river banks near [[Exeter, Tasmania|Exeter]].\n\nThe electoral boundaries include the towns of [[Exter, Tasmania|Exeter]], [[Rowella, Tasmania|Rowella]], [[Sidmouth, Tasmania|Sidmouth]], [[Legana, Tasmania|Legana]], [[Bridgenorth, Tasmania|Bridgenorth]], [[Gravelly Beach, Tasmania|Gravelly Beach]], [[Greens Beach, Tasmania|Greens Beach]], [[Beaconsfield, Tasmania|Beaconsfield]], [[Glengarry, Tasmania|Glengarry]], [[Beauty Point, Tasmania|Beauty point]] and [[Clarence point, Tasmania|Clarence point]].
