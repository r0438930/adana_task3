The statement announced a successor for the defense minister position; retired army general, [[Moosa Ali Jaleel]], will take over the position.\n\nAccording to Defense News, \"police were seen taking away unspecified documents during a raid early on Sunday\" at the defense minister's home. Reportedly, the raid was initiated on suspicions that the defense minister was \"harboring weapons and explosives.\" The minister's sacking could have been related to political infighting, though this remains ambiguous. Nazim did play a major role in ousting of the small island state's first democratically elected leader, Mohamed Nasheed, in 2012. Nasheed stepped down as president after widespread protests by the opposition in which some units of the military and police force (special operations) backed the opposition demonstrators & mutinied . \nNasheed claimed that he'd been ousted in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\n\nMohamed Nazim, was later appointed as Minister of Defense by the Vice President of Nasheed's Government who succeeded him to Presidency.\nHe commanded the defense force's with an iron fist. Many soldiers, including 2 brigadier generals, a colonel and many other non commissioned officers were dismissed from the military service without due trails, after they brought up concern's over mishandling of security forces during the coup d'\u00e9tat and after.\n\nHe was best known for his role during the Male' water crisis. However, with the way how events unfolded, there were allegations that the crisis was engineered to gain popularity that is much needed to further his political ambitions.\n\nAfter his own dismissal, former Defense Minister Nazim, who spoke with the press, noted that the police raid against his home was entirely inappropriate and unwarranted. \"In which country of the world do police kick down the door to a defense minister\u2019s home and proceed to destroy all doors and conduct a raid at 3:30 am while the defense minister is asleep,\" noted Nazim, as quoted by a local news agency. He vowed to remain involved in politics & that he would make the government accountable.\n\nMaldivian police noted that \"lethal weapons\" had been confiscated from the defense minister's home and that Nazim had refused to cooperate with their investigation.\n\nUnder Maldivian law, it is illegal to possess any weapon.\n\nHowever, Mr Nazim was one of the convicts to be released under the Maldives Supreme Court Order issued on 1 February 2018.\n\nAfter President Ibrahim Mohamed was elected as the new President of Maldives in September 2018, the courts in Maldives have reviewed and reversed some of their own verdicts. Hence, Col.rtd. Nazim has now been released from jail and the execution of the previous verdict against him is suspended for the time being. In the meantime, he has joined the Republican Party run by business tycoon Buruma Gasim Ibrahim, who was also the then Speaker of the Maldivian Parliament. Currently, Mr Nazim is an elected member of the Parliament representing Dhangenthi constituency.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Col. Rtd. Nazim said that, the former President of Maldives Mr Yamin Abdul Gayoom and the former Commissioner of Police Mr Hussein Waheed were involved in framing him and putting him behind bars. He vowed to bring both of them before the court.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=11&dcid=15231 presidencymaldives.gov.mv]\n*[http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/20/394008/Maldivian-defense-minister-sacked presstv.ir]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nazim, Mohamed}}\n[[Category:Maldivian military personnel]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Mal\u00e9]]\n[[Category:Government ministers of the Maldives]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2018}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| name = Col rtd Mohamed Nazim\n| image = Michele J.
