He has been a member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba]] since 2003, and he served as Minister of Higher Education from 2009 to 2012; he was promoted to the post of Vice President of the Council of Ministers (deputy Prime Minister) in 2012. A year later, on 24&nbsp;February 2013, he was elected as First Vice President of the Council of State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2013/02/24/ratificado-raul-como-presidente-del-consejo-de-estado/|title=Ratificado Ra\u00fal como presidente del Consejo de Estado y del Consejo de Ministros (+ Fotos)|work=Cubadebate}}</ref>\n\nHe was selected <!-- not a typo: he was elected by the chamber unopposed on 19 Apr to the Council, and selected to the candidacy on 18 Apr, leading to his election through the poll of democratically elected members of the Council--> to succeed [[Ra\u00fal Castro]] as the candidate for President of the Council of State and the Council of Ministers on 18&nbsp;April 2018 and was sworn into office the following day after nationwide polling. His two predecessors in the role were brothers, by blood, and notably his succession from Ra\u00fal Castro represents a clearly non-dynastic form of succession for the Communist Party as well as the [[Republic of Cuba]]. D\u00edaz-Canel is therefore the first president to not be a Castro family member since [[Osvaldo Dortic\u00f3s]] in 1976 and the first leader of the government who is not a Castro since [[Jos\u00e9 Mir\u00f3 Cardona]] in 1959.
