At New River Head, in those days set in the fields of rural Clerkenwell and, importantly, at a higher altitude than the city, a circular reservoir, known as the Round Pond, collected the water. From here it was fed into a network of wooden mains which conveyed water to the cisterns of London. Besides the Round Pond was a single building, known as the Water House. From these beginnings a larger complex gradually developed, with further ponds and buildings covering an area of some {{convert|7|acre}} and bounded by what were to become the streets of Rosebery Avenue, Hardwick Street, Amwell Street and Myddelton Passage.<ref name=bho>{{cite web |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol47/pp165-184 |title=New River Head |work=British History Online |publisher=Institute of Historical Research/University of London |year=2008 |accessdate=27 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1708, a new Upper Pond was constructed on higher ground where [[Claremont Square]] lies today, in order to give a better head of pressure to server more distant areas around the [[West End of London]]. Initially water was pumped to this from the Round Pond by [[windmill]] and [[horse gin]], but in 1768 a [[steam engine]] designed by [[John Smeaton]] was brought into use. In 1785, a [[Boulton & Watt]] engine was added, and over the years replacement engines were installed. These were all housed in the Engine House, on the north-west of the site. In 1820, the New River Company moved its offices, which until then had been located in the [[City of London]], into an enlarged Water House at New River Head, beginning an association of the site with the administration of London's water supply that was to last some 170 years.<ref name=bho/>\n\n[[File:Former Water Board HQ, New River Head - geograph.org.uk - 397025.jpg|thumb|right|Frontage of the water board offices]]\nBetween 1915 and 1920, the Metropolitan Water Board, as successor to the New River Company, constructed a substantial new head office building on the Rosebery Avenue side of the site and across the, by now redundant, Round Pond. This building incorporated a reconstruction of the historical late seventeenth-century ''Oak Room'' from the Water House, which was also demolished as part of the same development. Between 1936 and 1938, the water board added a new water testing laboratory to the site. In 1946, the London end of the New River was truncated to [[Stoke Newington]] with the water being fed into the East Reservoir there, thus removing the operational usage of the site. However the head office and laboratory buildings continued in use by the Metropolitan Water Board and its successor, the Thames Water Authority.<ref name=bho/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://shelford.org/walks/newriver.pdf |title=The New River Path \u2013 a walk linking Hertford with Islington |accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964\u20136, the Charles Allen House, a seven-storey block of staff flats, was added to the north-west corner of the site. Following the [[privatisation]] of the Thames Water Authority in 1989, the head office of Thames Water plc was relocated to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], along with the laboratory facilities. However in the same timescales an operational function returned to the site, with the creation of a shaft and pumping station for the [[Thames Water Ring Main|London Water Ring Main]] on the Amwell Street side of the site.<ref name=bho/>\n\nFollowing the relocation of Thames Water, the head office building and laboratory buidings were converted to apartments, as was the Remus building, a former water meter testing building dating from 1922-4.
