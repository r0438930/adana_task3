'''Melvin Mora Diaz''' (born February 2, 1972) is a [[Venezuelan]] former professional [[baseball]] [[infielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. He played for the [[New York Mets]], [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].

From his debut in 1999 to 2003, Melvin Mora was known as a [[utility player]], playing all three outfield positions, shortstop, and second base. In 2004, the Orioles made Mora their everyday third baseman, a position he occupied through 2009.

==Career==

===New York Mets===
Mora was signed out of Venezuela in 1991. After spending seven years in the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] [[Minor League Baseball|minors]] system and couple of months in [[CPBL]]'s [[Mercuries Tigers]], he signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[New York Mets|Mets]] in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]] and made his major league debut in the [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999 season]]. Mora made himself more valuable by being able to play all three [[outfield]] positions, [[shortstop]], [[second base]] and [[third base|third]].

[[File:Melvin Mora (1999) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Mora with the [[New York Mets]] in 1999]]
In 1999, he scored the winning run of the final game of the year for the Mets on a wild pitch by the Pirates' [[Brad Clontz]], which propelled the [[1999 New York Mets season|Mets]] to a one-game playoff with [[1999 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]], which they won.

===Baltimore Orioles===

====2000&ndash;02====
Melvin Mora was traded by the Mets to Baltimore on July 28, 2000, with two minor league players and [[Mike Kinkade]] for shortstop [[Mike Bordick]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/M/Pmoram002.htm|title=Melvin Mora|accessdate=2009-06-23 |publisher=[[Retrosheet]]}}</ref>

Used as a utility player in Baltimore, Mora showed promise and hints of ability to contribute as an everyday player but struggled to break through. Things changed when an injury-depleted Orioles team used Mora almost exclusively in left field, and Mora responded with the best stretch of his career. He reached base in 32 straight games while using a 23-game hitting streak to temporarily become the [[American League]] batting leader. Finally excelling as a hitter, Mora was chosen for his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] selection. Mora's season was cut short due to injuries (a bruised wrist and a partially torn ligament in his left knee), but finished with a .317 batting average, 15 home runs, and a .418 [[on-base percentage]] in 96 games.

====2003&ndash;04====
Mora's 2003 season proved that he could be a consistent hitter at the major league level. In 2004, Mora became the Orioles' regular third baseman and enjoyed his most productive season in the majors. Mora hit a career-high .340, finishing second in the [[American League|AL]] batting race to [[Ichiro Suzuki]]'s .372 mark; led the league in on-base percentage (.419); ranked 5th in [[slugging average]] (.562) and [[On-base plus slugging|OPS]] (.981); 6th in [[Run (baseball)|runs]] (111), [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (41) and [[times on base]] (264); 8th in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (187), and 9th in [[total bases]] (264). His 27 home runs and 104 RBI were also career-highs, while leading his team in batting average, runs, on-base percentage, slugging average and OPS. At third base, he improved and became more consistent as the season wore on. Mora finished 18th in [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP]] voting and won a [[Silver Slugger Award]].

====2005&ndash;07====
[[File:Melvin Mora Baltimore Orioles.jpg|thumb|Melvin Mora, during a break in the action, playing for Baltimore Orioles in 2006.]]
In 2005, Mora once again hit 27 home runs, although his [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] and on-base percentage dropped. On May 19, 2006 Mora agreed to a three-year, $25M deal that included a no-trade clause because Mora did not want to move his family to another city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2451156 |title=Mora signs three-year, $25M extension with Orioles |accessdate=2009-06-23|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2006-05-19 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref>

In 2006, Mora's home run total dropped to 16, and again dropped in 2007 to 14. Mora also saw his batting average fall to .274 for both seasons.

====2008====
Mora was named American League Player of the Month for August 2008. Mora batted .418 (41-for-98) with 8 home runs and had an MLB leading 32 RBIs in 24 games. He posted a .765 slugging percentage and a .455 on-base percentage, with 17 extra-base hits, including eight doubles. Mora had a 13 multi-hit games in August 2008 and maintained an 8-game hitting streak from August 1–10. On August 17 at [[Comerica Park|Detroit]], Mora went 5-for-6 with two doubles, 2 home runs, 4 runs scored and 6 RBIs during a 16&ndash;8 Orioles win. Overall, Mora had five games in August in which he collected four-or-more RBIs. Mora injured his [[hamstring]] on August 29, 2008, missing the final games of his impressive month.

====2009====
On September 18, 2009, [[Brooks Robinson]] made a rare appearance at Camden Yards to honor Mora for moving into second all-time in games played at third base by an Oriole (behind only the Hall of Famer Brooks, himself). He presented Melvin with the third base from the game he moved into second.

In 2009, he led all major league starting third basemen in [[range factor]], at 3.14.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding/_/position/3b/sort/rangeFactor/order/true \"MLB Player Fielding Stats – As 3b – 2009\"] ESPN, accessed October 6, 2009</ref>

Mora's option was declined by the Orioles on October 29, 2009.

===Colorado Rockies===
On February 5, 2010, the [[Colorado Rockies]] signed Mora to a one-year, $1.275 million contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100131&content_id=8001834&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Rockies agree to one year deal with Mora|accessdate=2010-02-01 |last=Harding |first=Thomas |date=2010-01-31 |publisher=[[MLB]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100205&content_id=8031096&vkey=pr_col&fext=.jsp&c_id=col |title=Rockies agree to terms with Mora |access-date=2010-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212072205/http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100205&content_id=8031096&vkey=pr_col&fext=.jsp&c_id=col |archive-date=2010-02-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He played in 113 games for the NL West third place Rockies (83-79) and batted .285 with seven home runs and 45 RBI.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/morame01.shtml Baseball-Reference.com (player)]</ref><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/COL/2010.shtml Baseball-Reference.com (team)]</ref>

In the Orioles media guide, Mora stated his most embarrassing moment as a player came in his rookie year in 1999 when, knowing little English, he thought his manager [[Bobby Valentine]] had told him to go to left field when he was actually being told to go to second base.

Mora was naturalized as a [[Citizenship of the United States|United States citizen]] in Baltimore on May 10, 2017. He holds U.S.-Venezuela dual citizenship.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/blog/bal-orioles-hall-of-famer-melvin-mora-becomes-u-s-citizen-in-baltimore-20170510-story.html Encina, Eduardo A. \"Orioles Hall of Famer Melvin Mora on becoming U.S. citizen: 'I finally did it,'\" ''The Baltimore Sun'', Wednesday, May 10, 2017.]</ref>

On July 28, 2001, Mora's wife Gisel gave birth to [[multiple births|quintuplets]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The babies, three girls and two boys, were named Genesis Raquel, Jada Priscilla, Rebekah Alesha, Christian Emmanuel, and Matthew David. They also had an older daughter Tatiana before the quintuplets were born.<ref>Klingaman, Mike [http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bal-te.sp.quints21jun21,0,3219617.story \"Mora's abundance of fatherly joy\"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''The Baltimore Sun'', Sunday, June 21, 2009</ref> The family resides in [[Fallston, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Dan|title=Three teams showing interest in Mora, his agent says|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=January 5, 2010|page=3}}</ref>

In the Orioles media guide, Mora stated his most embarrassing moment as a player came in his rookie year in 1999 when, knowing little English, he thought his manager [[Bobby Valentine]] had told him to go to left field when he was actually being told to go to second base.

Mora was naturalized as a [[Citizenship of the United States|United States citizen]] in Baltimore on May 10, 2017. He holds U.S.-Venezuela dual citizenship.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/blog/bal-orioles-hall-of-famer-melvin-mora-becomes-u-s-citizen-in-baltimore-20170510-story.html Encina, Eduardo A. \"Orioles Hall of Famer Melvin Mora on becoming U.S. citizen: 'I finally did it,'\" ''The Baltimore Sun'', Wednesday, May 10, 2017.]</ref>

==History==

The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street.<ref>Eric John Abrahamson and Grant Alger, Persistence and Perspective: Franklin Templeton Investments: The First Sixty Years (San Mateo: Franklin Resources, Inc., 2007, xvii</ref> He named the company for American polymath [[Benjamin Franklin]] because Franklin espoused frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing.<ref name=\"Knapp\">{{cite news |last=Knapp |first=Gwen |title=Charles Johnson, top Giants owner, keeps low profile |newspaper=San Francisco Gate |date=29 September 2012 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/Charles-Johnson-top-Giants-owner-keeps-low-3466803.php |accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref> The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.

After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, [[Charles B. Johnson]] (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. At that time the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million.<ref name=donation>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-Giants-owner-gave-1K-to-PAC-behind-racist-ad-13321897.php|title=SF Giants owner gave $1K to PAC behind racist ad targeting black voters|date=19 October 2018|last=Ravani|first=Sarah|website=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref> Rupert Johnson, Jr., Charlie's brother, joined the company in 1965.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/profile/rupert-johnson-jr/ Forbes: The World's Billionaires: \"Rupert Johnson Jr.\"] April 2015</ref>

Franklin went public in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/mutual-fund-billionaire-gives-250-million-to-yale/|title=Mutual Fund Billionaire Gives $250 Million to Yale|date=30 September 2013|last=Alden|first=William|website=DealBook|access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref> In 1973, the company acquired Winfield & Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin's offices from New York to California. The combined organization had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund began a growth surge that made it Franklin's first billion-dollar fund and launched the company's significant asset growth in the 1980s.

Starting in 1980, the company's total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin's income and bond funds).

In October 1992, Franklin acquired Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. for a reported cost of $913 million, leading to the common name '''Franklin Templeton'''. [[Mutual fund]] pioneer [[John Templeton|Sir John Templeton]] was the owner of Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd together with his son Dr. John Templeton and John Galbraith who together owned 70% of the firm.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ywUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=d5ADAAAAIBAJ&dq=templeton%20galbraith%20%26%20hansberger&pg=3366%2C177263 \"Franklin to acquire Templeton mutual fund\"]''[[Business Times (Kuala Lumpur)|Business Times]]'' (August 3, 1992) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314131124/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ywUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=d5ADAAAAIBAJ&dq=templeton%20galbraith%20%26%20hansberger&pg=3366%2C177263 |date=March 14, 2016 }}</ref>

In November 1996, Heine Securities Corporation, known for the Mutual Series of funds, merged into the Franklin Templeton complex. In October 2000, Franklin acquired Bissett Funds to increase its Canadian presence, and Bissett remains a key brand from Franklin in the Canadian market. The Fiduciary Trust Company was acquired by Franklin Templeton in April 2001.<ref>Eric John Abrahamson and Grant Alger, Persistence and Perspective: Franklin Templeton Investments: The First Sixty Years (San Mateo: Franklin Resources, Inc., 2007)</ref>

==History==

The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street.<ref>Eric John Abrahamson and Grant Alger, Persistence and Perspective: Franklin Templeton Investments: The First Sixty Years (San Mateo: Franklin Resources, Inc., 2007, xvii</ref> He named the company for American polymath [[Benjamin Franklin]] because Franklin espoused frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing.<ref name=\"Knapp\">{{cite news |last=Knapp |first=Gwen |title=Charles Johnson, top Giants owner, keeps low profile |newspaper=San Francisco Gate |date=29 September 2012 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/Charles-Johnson-top-Giants-owner-keeps-low-3466803.php |accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref> The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.

After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, [[Charles B. Johnson]] (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. At that time the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million.<ref name=donation>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-Giants-owner-gave-1K-to-PAC-behind-racist-ad-13321897.php|title=SF Giants owner gave $1K to PAC behind racist ad targeting black voters|date=19 October 2018|last=Ravani|first=Sarah|website=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref> Rupert Johnson, Jr., Charlie's brother, joined the company in 1965.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/profile/rupert-johnson-jr/ Forbes: The World's Billionaires: \"Rupert Johnson Jr.\"] April 2015</ref>

Franklin went public in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/mutual-fund-billionaire-gives-250-million-to-yale/|title=Mutual Fund Billionaire Gives $250 Million to Yale|date=30 September 2013|last=Alden|first=William|website=DealBook|access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref> In 1973, the company acquired Winfield & Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin's offices from New York to California. The combined organization had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund began a growth surge that made it Franklin's first billion-dollar fund and launched the company's significant asset growth in the 1980s.

Starting in 1980, the company's total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin's income and bond funds).

In October 1992, Franklin acquired Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. for a reported cost of $913 million, leading to the common name '''Franklin Templeton'''. [[Mutual fund]] pioneer [[John Templeton|Sir John Templeton]] was the owner of Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd together with his son Dr. John Templeton and John Galbraith who together owned 70% of the firm.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ywUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=d5ADAAAAIBAJ&dq=templeton%20galbraith%20%26%20hansberger&pg=3366%2C177263 \"Franklin to acquire Templeton mutual fund\"]''[[Business Times (Kuala Lumpur)|Business Times]]'' (August 3, 1992) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314131124/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ywUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=d5ADAAAAIBAJ&dq=templeton%20galbraith%20%26%20hansberger&pg=3366%2C177263 |date=March 14, 2016 }}</ref>

In November 1996, Heine Securities Corporation, known for the Mutual Series of funds, merged into the Franklin Templeton complex. In October 2000, Franklin acquired Bissett Funds to increase its Canadian presence, and Bissett remains a key brand from Franklin in the Canadian market. The Fiduciary Trust Company was acquired by Franklin Templeton in April 2001.<ref>Eric John Abrahamson and Grant Alger, Persistence and Perspective: Franklin Templeton Investments: The First Sixty Years (San Mateo: Franklin Resources, Inc., 2007)</ref>

The '''3rd Regiment, Vermont Volunteer Infantry''' (or 3rd VVI) was a three-years infantry regiment in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI Corps]], [[Army of the Potomac]], from July 1861 to July 1865. It was a member of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

==History==
[[File:Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde (1831-1918) of the 3rd Vermont Infantry.jpg|thumb|Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde of the 3rd Vermont Infantry]]
In July 1861, the [[United States Congress]] authorized President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to call out 500,000 men, to serve for three years unless sooner discharged. The 3rd Vermont Infantry was the second of the three years regiments from the state placed in the field as a result of this call. It was organized from militia companies from [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]], [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury (Wells River)]], [[Charleston, Vermont|Charleston]], [[Johnson, Vermont|Johnson]], [[Hartford, Vermont|Hartford]], [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St.Johnsbury]], [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], [[Guildhall, Vermont|Guidhall]], and [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] and [[Calais, Vermont|Calais]].

Governor [[Erastus Fairbanks]]' first choices to command the regiment were Colonel [[John W. Phelps]], soon to relinquish his command of the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], Captain [[Truman Seymour]], 4th U.S. Artillery, a native Vermonter who had been present at the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], and Captain A. V. Colburn, U.S. Army, who later became Assistant Adjutant General of the [[Army of the Potomac]] under General [[George B. McClellan]]. Phelps, however, was serving as commandant of the post at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and the offers to Seymour and Colburn were declined.

The regiment rendezvoused at St. Johnsbury, on the ground of the [[Caledonia County]] Agricultural Society at \"Camp Baxter,\" named in honor of Adjutant and Inspector General [[H. Henry Baxter]]. The regiment mustered into United States service on July 16, 1861, and departed for [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 24, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Breed N. Hyde]]. At [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the regiment's commander, Colonel [[William Farrar Smith]], joined them.

The regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 1861, and on July 27, marched up the Potomac to the [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]], where they built \"[[Fort Lyon (Virginia)|Camp Lyon]].\" They joined at that site the [[6th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th Maine Infantry]], [[Mott's Battery]] and a company of cavalry. By August 12, the [[2nd Vermont Infantry]] and the [[33rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|33rd New York Infantry]] had joined them. 

Major [[Walter W. Cochran]], of [[Bellows Falls]], resigned his commission on August 6 due to a severe attack of fever and ague. Captain [[Wheelock G. Veazey]], of Company A, replaced him. On August 13, Colonel Smith was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers, and Hyde replaced him, now as a full colonel. Veazey was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain [[Thomas O. Seaver]], of Company F, was promoted to major. 

[[File:William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel).jpg|thumb|Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]] of Groton, Vt., better known as [[The Sleeping Sentinel]].]]
It was also here that Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]], known to history as [[the Sleeping Sentinel]], was found asleep at his post on August 31, court-martialed, and sentenced to be executed.  President Lincoln heard about the case, pardoned Scott, and returned him to his unit. William Scott was actually standing before a firing squad when the death sentence and pardon were both read, however no one had told him that he had been pardoned prior to being sent to the firing squad.  Scott later was killed in action at the [[Battle of Lee's Mills]].

On September 3, the units crossed the Chain Bridge, and occupied \"Camp Advance,\" {{convert|1|mi}} in advance of the bridge.  On September 9, Private Scott was scheduled to be executed, but during the proceedings, after the death sentence had been read, a pardon was read, sparing his life. In 1997, the original court-martial and pardon papers were discovered, and authenticated, bringing to an end the controversy over whether President Lincoln had personally signed the pardon, which it turned out he did.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/10/news/asleep-at-his-post-to-be-shot.html]</ref> Scott served faithfully with his regiment until the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], where he was mortally wounded, and was buried in the [[Colonial National Historical Park|national cemetery at Yorktown]].

On September 11, the regiment participated in a reconnaissance to and beyond [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], where it engaged Confederate skirmishers. Returning to the camp, the regiment came under fire from Rosser's battery. A shell fell within the ranks of Company C, killing Private Amos Meserve, mortally wounding William H. Colburn, and injuring five others. On September 25, the regiment participated in another reconnaissance to Lewinsville, but suffered no casualties. Quartermaster [[Redfield Proctor]] resigned from the regiment on this date to accept appointment as Major of the [[5th Vermont Infantry]].

During the next two weeks, the 4th and 5th Vermont regiments joined Smith's division. On October 9, the Vermont regiments moved to Camp Griffin, about four miles from Chain Bridge. Here, on October 24, the [[6th Vermont Infantry]] arrived, completing the initial organization of the \"Old [[Vermont Brigade]].\" 

The history of the regiment from this point on is essentially that of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

The original members of the regiment, who did not reenlist, were mustered out of the service on July 27, 1864. Veterans and recruits were consolidated into six companies, July 25, 1864. One year recruits and others whose term of service was due to expire prior to October 1, 1865, were mustered out on June 19, 1865. The remaining officers and men mustered out of service on July 11.

==Medal of Honor==

Six members of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].

* Alexander M. Beattie, Captain, Co. F, \" removed, under a hot fire, a wounded member of his command to a place of safety,\" at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], June 5, 1864.
* Gardner C. Hawkins, 1st Lieutenant, Co. E, \"when the lines were wavering from the well-directed fire of the enemy, this officer, acting adjutant of the regiment, sprang forward, and with encouraging words cheered the soldiers on and, although dangerously wounded, refused to leave the field until the enemy's works were taken,\" at the [[Battle of Petersburg]], on April 2, 1865.
* [[Willie Johnston (Medal of Honor recipient)|Willie Johnston]], Musician Company D, 3rd Vermont Infantry The second Medal of Honor ever awarded.
* Samuel E. Pingree, Captain, Co. F, \"gallantly led his Co. across a wide, deep creek, drove the enemy from the rifle pits, which were within 2 yards of the farther bank, and remained at the head of his men until a second time severely wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Julian Scott|Julian A. Scott]], Drummer, Co. E, \"crossed the creek under a terrific fire of musketry several times to assist in bringing off the wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Thomas O. Seaver]], Colonel, while \"at the head of 3 regiments and under a most galling fire, attacked and occupied the enemy's works,\" at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania]], May 10, 1864.

The '''3rd Regiment, Vermont Volunteer Infantry''' (or 3rd VVI) was a three-years infantry regiment in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI Corps]], [[Army of the Potomac]], from July 1861 to July 1865. It was a member of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

==History==
[[File:Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde (1831-1918) of the 3rd Vermont Infantry.jpg|thumb|Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde of the 3rd Vermont Infantry]]
In July 1861, the [[United States Congress]] authorized President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to call out 500,000 men, to serve for three years unless sooner discharged. The 3rd Vermont Infantry was the second of the three years regiments from the state placed in the field as a result of this call. It was organized from militia companies from [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]], [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury (Wells River)]], [[Charleston, Vermont|Charleston]], [[Johnson, Vermont|Johnson]], [[Hartford, Vermont|Hartford]], [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St.Johnsbury]], [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], [[Guildhall, Vermont|Guidhall]], and [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] and [[Calais, Vermont|Calais]].

Governor [[Erastus Fairbanks]]' first choices to command the regiment were Colonel [[John W. Phelps]], soon to relinquish his command of the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], Captain [[Truman Seymour]], 4th U.S. Artillery, a native Vermonter who had been present at the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], and Captain A. V. Colburn, U.S. Army, who later became Assistant Adjutant General of the [[Army of the Potomac]] under General [[George B. McClellan]]. Phelps, however, was serving as commandant of the post at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and the offers to Seymour and Colburn were declined.

The regiment rendezvoused at St. Johnsbury, on the ground of the [[Caledonia County]] Agricultural Society at \"Camp Baxter,\" named in honor of Adjutant and Inspector General [[H. Henry Baxter]]. The regiment mustered into United States service on July 16, 1861, and departed for [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 24, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Breed N. Hyde]]. At [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the regiment's commander, Colonel [[William Farrar Smith]], joined them.

The regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 1861, and on July 27, marched up the Potomac to the [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]], where they built \"[[Fort Lyon (Virginia)|Camp Lyon]].\" They joined at that site the [[6th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th Maine Infantry]], [[Mott's Battery]] and a company of cavalry. By August 12, the [[2nd Vermont Infantry]] and the [[33rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|33rd New York Infantry]] had joined them. 

Major [[Walter W. Cochran]], of [[Bellows Falls]], resigned his commission on August 6 due to a severe attack of fever and ague. Captain [[Wheelock G. Veazey]], of Company A, replaced him. On August 13, Colonel Smith was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers, and Hyde replaced him, now as a full colonel. Veazey was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain [[Thomas O. Seaver]], of Company F, was promoted to major. 

[[File:William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel).jpg|thumb|Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]] of Groton, Vt., better known as [[The Sleeping Sentinel]].]]
It was also here that Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]], known to history as [[the Sleeping Sentinel]], was found asleep at his post on August 31, court-martialed, and sentenced to be executed.  President Lincoln heard about the case, pardoned Scott, and returned him to his unit. William Scott was actually standing before a firing squad when the death sentence and pardon were both read, however no one had told him that he had been pardoned prior to being sent to the firing squad.  Scott later was killed in action at the [[Battle of Lee's Mills]].

On September 3, the units crossed the Chain Bridge, and occupied \"Camp Advance,\" {{convert|1|mi}} in advance of the bridge.  On September 9, Private Scott was scheduled to be executed, but during the proceedings, after the death sentence had been read, a pardon was read, sparing his life. In 1997, the original court-martial and pardon papers were discovered, and authenticated, bringing to an end the controversy over whether President Lincoln had personally signed the pardon, which it turned out he did.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/10/news/asleep-at-his-post-to-be-shot.html]</ref> Scott served faithfully with his regiment until the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], where he was mortally wounded, and was buried in the [[Colonial National Historical Park|national cemetery at Yorktown]].

On September 11, the regiment participated in a reconnaissance to and beyond [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], where it engaged Confederate skirmishers. Returning to the camp, the regiment came under fire from Rosser's battery. A shell fell within the ranks of Company C, killing Private Amos Meserve, mortally wounding William H. Colburn, and injuring five others. On September 25, the regiment participated in another reconnaissance to Lewinsville, but suffered no casualties. Quartermaster [[Redfield Proctor]] resigned from the regiment on this date to accept appointment as Major of the [[5th Vermont Infantry]].

During the next two weeks, the 4th and 5th Vermont regiments joined Smith's division. On October 9, the Vermont regiments moved to Camp Griffin, about four miles from Chain Bridge. Here, on October 24, the [[6th Vermont Infantry]] arrived, completing the initial organization of the \"Old [[Vermont Brigade]].\" 

The history of the regiment from this point on is essentially that of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

The original members of the regiment, who did not reenlist, were mustered out of the service on July 27, 1864. Veterans and recruits were consolidated into six companies, July 25, 1864. One year recruits and others whose term of service was due to expire prior to October 1, 1865, were mustered out on June 19, 1865. The remaining officers and men mustered out of service on July 11.

==Medal of Honor==

Six members of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].

* Alexander M. Beattie, Captain, Co. F, \" removed, under a hot fire, a wounded member of his command to a place of safety,\" at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], June 5, 1864.
* Gardner C. Hawkins, 1st Lieutenant, Co. E, \"when the lines were wavering from the well-directed fire of the enemy, this officer, acting adjutant of the regiment, sprang forward, and with encouraging words cheered the soldiers on and, although dangerously wounded, refused to leave the field until the enemy's works were taken,\" at the [[Battle of Petersburg]], on April 2, 1865.
* [[Willie Johnston (Medal of Honor recipient)|Willie Johnston]], Musician Company D, 3rd Vermont Infantry The second Medal of Honor ever awarded.
* Samuel E. Pingree, Captain, Co. F, \"gallantly led his Co. across a wide, deep creek, drove the enemy from the rifle pits, which were within 2 yards of the farther bank, and remained at the head of his men until a second time severely wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Julian Scott|Julian A. Scott]], Drummer, Co. E, \"crossed the creek under a terrific fire of musketry several times to assist in bringing off the wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Thomas O. Seaver]], Colonel, while \"at the head of 3 regiments and under a most galling fire, attacked and occupied the enemy's works,\" at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania]], May 10, 1864.

The '''3rd Regiment, Vermont Volunteer Infantry''' (or 3rd VVI) was a three-years infantry regiment in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI Corps]], [[Army of the Potomac]], from July 1861 to July 1865. It was a member of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

==History==
[[File:Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde (1831-1918) of the 3rd Vermont Infantry.jpg|thumb|Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde of the 3rd Vermont Infantry]]
In July 1861, the [[United States Congress]] authorized President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to call out 500,000 men, to serve for three years unless sooner discharged. The 3rd Vermont Infantry was the second of the three years regiments from the state placed in the field as a result of this call. It was organized from militia companies from [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]], [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury (Wells River)]], [[Charleston, Vermont|Charleston]], [[Johnson, Vermont|Johnson]], [[Hartford, Vermont|Hartford]], [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St.Johnsbury]], [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], [[Guildhall, Vermont|Guidhall]], and [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] and [[Calais, Vermont|Calais]].

Governor [[Erastus Fairbanks]]' first choices to command the regiment were Colonel [[John W. Phelps]], soon to relinquish his command of the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], Captain [[Truman Seymour]], 4th U.S. Artillery, a native Vermonter who had been present at the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], and Captain A. V. Colburn, U.S. Army, who later became Assistant Adjutant General of the [[Army of the Potomac]] under General [[George B. McClellan]]. Phelps, however, was serving as commandant of the post at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and the offers to Seymour and Colburn were declined.

The regiment rendezvoused at St. Johnsbury, on the ground of the [[Caledonia County]] Agricultural Society at \"Camp Baxter,\" named in honor of Adjutant and Inspector General [[H. Henry Baxter]]. The regiment mustered into United States service on July 16, 1861, and departed for [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 24, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Breed N. Hyde]]. At [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the regiment's commander, Colonel [[William Farrar Smith]], joined them.

The regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 1861, and on July 27, marched up the Potomac to the [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]], where they built \"[[Fort Lyon (Virginia)|Camp Lyon]].\" They joined at that site the [[6th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th Maine Infantry]], [[Mott's Battery]] and a company of cavalry. By August 12, the [[2nd Vermont Infantry]] and the [[33rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|33rd New York Infantry]] had joined them. 

Major [[Walter W. Cochran]], of [[Bellows Falls]], resigned his commission on August 6 due to a severe attack of fever and ague. Captain [[Wheelock G. Veazey]], of Company A, replaced him. On August 13, Colonel Smith was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers, and Hyde replaced him, now as a full colonel. Veazey was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain [[Thomas O. Seaver]], of Company F, was promoted to major. 

[[File:William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel).jpg|thumb|Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]] of Groton, Vt., better known as [[The Sleeping Sentinel]].]]
It was also here that Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]], known to history as [[the Sleeping Sentinel]], was found asleep at his post on August 31, court-martialed, and sentenced to be executed.  President Lincoln heard about the case, pardoned Scott, and returned him to his unit. William Scott was actually standing before a firing squad when the death sentence and pardon were both read, however no one had told him that he had been pardoned prior to being sent to the firing squad.  Scott later was killed in action at the [[Battle of Lee's Mills]].

On September 3, the units crossed the Chain Bridge, and occupied \"Camp Advance,\" {{convert|1|mi}} in advance of the bridge.  On September 9, Private Scott was scheduled to be executed, but during the proceedings, after the death sentence had been read, a pardon was read, sparing his life. In 1997, the original court-martial and pardon papers were discovered, and authenticated, bringing to an end the controversy over whether President Lincoln had personally signed the pardon, which it turned out he did.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/10/news/asleep-at-his-post-to-be-shot.html]</ref> Scott served faithfully with his regiment until the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], where he was mortally wounded, and was buried in the [[Colonial National Historical Park|national cemetery at Yorktown]].

On September 11, the regiment participated in a reconnaissance to and beyond [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], where it engaged Confederate skirmishers. Returning to the camp, the regiment came under fire from Rosser's battery. A shell fell within the ranks of Company C, killing Private Amos Meserve, mortally wounding William H. Colburn, and injuring five others. On September 25, the regiment participated in another reconnaissance to Lewinsville, but suffered no casualties. Quartermaster [[Redfield Proctor]] resigned from the regiment on this date to accept appointment as Major of the [[5th Vermont Infantry]].

During the next two weeks, the 4th and 5th Vermont regiments joined Smith's division. On October 9, the Vermont regiments moved to Camp Griffin, about four miles from Chain Bridge. Here, on October 24, the [[6th Vermont Infantry]] arrived, completing the initial organization of the \"Old [[Vermont Brigade]].\" 

The history of the regiment from this point on is essentially that of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

The original members of the regiment, who did not reenlist, were mustered out of the service on July 27, 1864. Veterans and recruits were consolidated into six companies, July 25, 1864. One year recruits and others whose term of service was due to expire prior to October 1, 1865, were mustered out on June 19, 1865. The remaining officers and men mustered out of service on July 11.

==Medal of Honor==

Six members of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].

* Alexander M. Beattie, Captain, Co. F, \" removed, under a hot fire, a wounded member of his command to a place of safety,\" at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], June 5, 1864.
* Gardner C. Hawkins, 1st Lieutenant, Co. E, \"when the lines were wavering from the well-directed fire of the enemy, this officer, acting adjutant of the regiment, sprang forward, and with encouraging words cheered the soldiers on and, although dangerously wounded, refused to leave the field until the enemy's works were taken,\" at the [[Battle of Petersburg]], on April 2, 1865.
* [[Willie Johnston (Medal of Honor recipient)|Willie Johnston]], Musician Company D, 3rd Vermont Infantry The second Medal of Honor ever awarded.
* Samuel E. Pingree, Captain, Co. F, \"gallantly led his Co. across a wide, deep creek, drove the enemy from the rifle pits, which were within 2 yards of the farther bank, and remained at the head of his men until a second time severely wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Julian Scott|Julian A. Scott]], Drummer, Co. E, \"crossed the creek under a terrific fire of musketry several times to assist in bringing off the wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Thomas O. Seaver]], Colonel, while \"at the head of 3 regiments and under a most galling fire, attacked and occupied the enemy's works,\" at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania]], May 10, 1864.

The '''3rd Regiment, Vermont Volunteer Infantry''' (or 3rd VVI) was a three-years infantry regiment in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI Corps]], [[Army of the Potomac]], from July 1861 to July 1865. It was a member of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

==History==
[[File:Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde (1831-1918) of the 3rd Vermont Infantry.jpg|thumb|Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde of the 3rd Vermont Infantry]]
In July 1861, the [[United States Congress]] authorized President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to call out 500,000 men, to serve for three years unless sooner discharged. The 3rd Vermont Infantry was the second of the three years regiments from the state placed in the field as a result of this call. It was organized from militia companies from [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]], [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury (Wells River)]], [[Charleston, Vermont|Charleston]], [[Johnson, Vermont|Johnson]], [[Hartford, Vermont|Hartford]], [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St.Johnsbury]], [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], [[Guildhall, Vermont|Guidhall]], and [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] and [[Calais, Vermont|Calais]].

Governor [[Erastus Fairbanks]]' first choices to command the regiment were Colonel [[John W. Phelps]], soon to relinquish his command of the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], Captain [[Truman Seymour]], 4th U.S. Artillery, a native Vermonter who had been present at the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], and Captain A. V. Colburn, U.S. Army, who later became Assistant Adjutant General of the [[Army of the Potomac]] under General [[George B. McClellan]]. Phelps, however, was serving as commandant of the post at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and the offers to Seymour and Colburn were declined.

The regiment rendezvoused at St. Johnsbury, on the ground of the [[Caledonia County]] Agricultural Society at \"Camp Baxter,\" named in honor of Adjutant and Inspector General [[H. Henry Baxter]]. The regiment mustered into United States service on July 16, 1861, and departed for [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 24, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Breed N. Hyde]]. At [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the regiment's commander, Colonel [[William Farrar Smith]], joined them.

The regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 1861, and on July 27, marched up the Potomac to the [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]], where they built \"[[Fort Lyon (Virginia)|Camp Lyon]].\" They joined at that site the [[6th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th Maine Infantry]], [[Mott's Battery]] and a company of cavalry. By August 12, the [[2nd Vermont Infantry]] and the [[33rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|33rd New York Infantry]] had joined them. 

Major [[Walter W. Cochran]], of [[Bellows Falls]], resigned his commission on August 6 due to a severe attack of fever and ague. Captain [[Wheelock G. Veazey]], of Company A, replaced him. On August 13, Colonel Smith was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers, and Hyde replaced him, now as a full colonel. Veazey was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain [[Thomas O. Seaver]], of Company F, was promoted to major. 

[[File:William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel).jpg|thumb|Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]] of Groton, Vt., better known as [[The Sleeping Sentinel]].]]
It was also here that Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]], known to history as [[the Sleeping Sentinel]], was found asleep at his post on August 31, court-martialed, and sentenced to be executed.  President Lincoln heard about the case, pardoned Scott, and returned him to his unit. William Scott was actually standing before a firing squad when the death sentence and pardon were both read, however no one had told him that he had been pardoned prior to being sent to the firing squad.  Scott later was killed in action at the [[Battle of Lee's Mills]].

On September 3, the units crossed the Chain Bridge, and occupied \"Camp Advance,\" {{convert|1|mi}} in advance of the bridge.  On September 9, Private Scott was scheduled to be executed, but during the proceedings, after the death sentence had been read, a pardon was read, sparing his life. In 1997, the original court-martial and pardon papers were discovered, and authenticated, bringing to an end the controversy over whether President Lincoln had personally signed the pardon, which it turned out he did.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/10/news/asleep-at-his-post-to-be-shot.html]</ref> Scott served faithfully with his regiment until the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], where he was mortally wounded, and was buried in the [[Colonial National Historical Park|national cemetery at Yorktown]].

On September 11, the regiment participated in a reconnaissance to and beyond [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], where it engaged Confederate skirmishers. Returning to the camp, the regiment came under fire from Rosser's battery. A shell fell within the ranks of Company C, killing Private Amos Meserve, mortally wounding William H. Colburn, and injuring five others. On September 25, the regiment participated in another reconnaissance to Lewinsville, but suffered no casualties. Quartermaster [[Redfield Proctor]] resigned from the regiment on this date to accept appointment as Major of the [[5th Vermont Infantry]].

During the next two weeks, the 4th and 5th Vermont regiments joined Smith's division. On October 9, the Vermont regiments moved to Camp Griffin, about four miles from Chain Bridge. Here, on October 24, the [[6th Vermont Infantry]] arrived, completing the initial organization of the \"Old [[Vermont Brigade]].\" 

The history of the regiment from this point on is essentially that of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

The original members of the regiment, who did not reenlist, were mustered out of the service on July 27, 1864. Veterans and recruits were consolidated into six companies, July 25, 1864. One year recruits and others whose term of service was due to expire prior to October 1, 1865, were mustered out on June 19, 1865. The remaining officers and men mustered out of service on July 11.

==Medal of Honor==

Six members of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].

* Alexander M. Beattie, Captain, Co. F, \" removed, under a hot fire, a wounded member of his command to a place of safety,\" at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], June 5, 1864.
* Gardner C. Hawkins, 1st Lieutenant, Co. E, \"when the lines were wavering from the well-directed fire of the enemy, this officer, acting adjutant of the regiment, sprang forward, and with encouraging words cheered the soldiers on and, although dangerously wounded, refused to leave the field until the enemy's works were taken,\" at the [[Battle of Petersburg]], on April 2, 1865.
* [[Willie Johnston (Medal of Honor recipient)|Willie Johnston]], Musician Company D, 3rd Vermont Infantry The second Medal of Honor ever awarded.
* Samuel E. Pingree, Captain, Co. F, \"gallantly led his Co. across a wide, deep creek, drove the enemy from the rifle pits, which were within 2 yards of the farther bank, and remained at the head of his men until a second time severely wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Julian Scott|Julian A. Scott]], Drummer, Co. E, \"crossed the creek under a terrific fire of musketry several times to assist in bringing off the wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Thomas O. Seaver]], Colonel, while \"at the head of 3 regiments and under a most galling fire, attacked and occupied the enemy's works,\" at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania]], May 10, 1864.

'''Tanya Atwater''' (Born 1942) is an American [[geophysicist]] and [[Marine geology|marine geologist]], who specializes in [[plate tectonics]]. She is particularly renowned for her early research on the [[plate tectonic]] history of western North America.

==Early life and education==
Atwater was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1942.<ref name=PSU>{{cite web |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth520/book/export/html/1752 |title=Tanya Atwater |publisher=John A. Dutton e-Education Institute |first=Tanya |last=Atwater |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> Her father was an engineer and her mother was a botanist. She is one of four siblings. Atwater was one of the first women to research the [[Seabed|ocean floor]] in terms of its [[Geology]].{{sfn|Atwater|2017}}

Atwater began her education in 1960 at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], then received her B.A. in Geophysics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1965.<ref>{{citation|last=Gates|first=Alexander E.|chapter=\"Atwater, Tanya\" |title=A to Z of earth scientists|year=2003|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|isbn=978-0816045808 |pages=10–12}}</ref> She earned a Ph.D. (1972) in [[marine geophysics]] from [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], [[University of California, San Diego]]. She is director of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] Educational Multimedia Visualization Center where she is an emerita professor of geological sciences. She was a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] before joining the faculty at UCSB in 1980. Atwater retired from UCSB in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=EMVC Web Page|url=http://emvc.geol.ucsb.edu}}</ref>

==Career==
Atwater was a professor of [[tectonics]], in the Department of Geological Sciences at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] before retiring. She authored and co-authored 50 articles in international journals, professional volumes, and major reports. Seven of these papers were published in the journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' or ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. In 1975, she became a fellow of the [[American Geophysical Union]] for her work in [[tectonophysics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tanya M. Atwater|url=https://honors.agu.org/honorsfellow/1324-atwater/|publisher=American Geophysical Union|access-date=2 December 2017}}</ref> From 1975 to 1977, Atwater was a Sloan Postdoctoral Fellowship Recipient in Physics.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=\"Atwater, Tanya\"|title=Postdoctoral Pathways: Preparation, Holding Pattern of Jumping off point?|year=2012| publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Maryland|isbn=978-1421403632}}</ref> In 1984, she won the Encouragement Award from the [[Association for Women Geoscientists]].{{sfn|Atwater2|2017}} Atwater is a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] <ref name='foo'>{{cite web|title=Tanya Atwater|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/1376.html|publisher=National Academies of Science|access-date=1 December 2017}}</ref> for her contributions to marine geophysics and [[tectonics]]. In 2019 she received the highest award of the [[Geological Society of America]], the Penrose Medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/About/awards/About_Awards/GSA/Awards/About_GSA_Awards.aspx#penrose|title=The Penrose Medal|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

===Scientific discoveries===

Atwater was involved in oceanographic expeditions using deep towed instruments to explore the ocean floor. To date, she has participated in 12 deep water dives in the deep-ocean submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]''.  She researched the volcano-tectonic processes responsible for creating new oceanic crust at [[Mid-ocean ridge|seafloor spreading centers]].  In 1968, she co-authored a research paper featuring groundbreaking work into the faulted nature of spreading centers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Menard |first1=H.W. |last2=Atwater |first2= T.M. | year=1968 |title=Changes in direction of sea floor spreading| journal=Nature| volume=219|issue=5153 | pages=463–467|bibcode=1968Natur.219..463M|doi=10.1038/219463a0}}</ref> With [[Jack Corliss]], [[Fred Spiess]], and [[Kenneth C. Macdonald|Kenneth Macdonald]], she played key roles in expeditions that uncovered the distinct biology of ocean floor warm springs, which led to the discovery during the [[RISE project]] of the high temperature black smokers, undersea [[hydrothermal vent]]s.

In Atwater's research on [[Propagating Rifts]] near the [[Galápagos Islands|Galapagos Islands]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Atwater |first=Tanya | year=1981 |title=Propagating rifts in seafloor spreading patterns| journal=Nature| volume=290|issue=5803 | pages=185–186|bibcode=1981Natur.290..185A|doi=10.1038/290185a0}}</ref> she discovered that propagating rifts were created when spreading centers along the seafloor were disturbed by tectonic movement or [[magma]] and therefore had to change direction to realign. This helped to explain the complex pattern of the seafloor.

Atwater is perhaps best known for her work on the [[plate tectonic]] history of western North America.  She wrote two major research papers outlining the history of plate tectonic evolution of North America and tectonic problems of the [[San Andreas Fault]], which assisted in documenting the history of the [[San Andreas Fault Line]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter | year=1973 |title=Relative motion of the Pacific and North American plates deduced from sea-floor spreading in the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific Oceans| publisher=R. L. Kovach and A. Nur, eds., Proc. of the Conf. on Tectonic Problems of the San Andreas Fault: Stanford University Publication| volume=13 | pages=136–148}}</ref>

She also studied geometric evolution, integrating and comparing the global plate motion records with the regional continental geologic records.  She found emerging relationships that revealed the origins of many large-scale geologic features (e.g. [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], [[Death Valley]], [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade]] volcanoes, [[California Coast Ranges]]).<ref name=\"foo\"/>

Atwater research paper, Implications of Plate [[Tectonics]] for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America,<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\">{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya | year=1970 |title=Implications of Plate Tectonics for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume=81 | issue=12 | pages=3513–3536|bibcode=1970GSAB...81.3513A |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1970)81[3513:IOPTFT]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> established the essential framework for the plate tectonics of western North America.  In her work, she explains that approximately 40 million years ago, the [[Farallon Plate]] was subducting underneath the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]].  The lower half of the Farallon plate was entirely subducted under Southern California and the upper half did not sink, which eventually became known as the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]].Since the southern section of Farallon completely disappeared, the boundary of southern California was now between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The [[San Andreas Fault]] is unique because it acts as a major fault line as well as a border between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]].<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\"/> She updated this work in 1989.<ref>Atwater, T. M. 1989. “Plate tectonic history of the northeast Pacific and western North America”. In ''The geology of North America: The northeastern Pacific Ocean and Hawaii'', Edited by: Winterer, E. L., Hussong, D. M. and Decker, R. W. Vol. N, 21–72. Boulder, CO: Geol. Soc. Amer.</ref>

Atwater is interested in communication and education at all levels. She has developed electronic multi-media (Educational Multimedia Visualization Center at UCSB) to enhance geologic visualization and understanding, particularly related to the histories of tectonic plates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atwater.faculty.geol.ucsb.edu |website=Tanya Atwater Home Page |accessdate=13 August 2019|title=Tanya Atwater Homepage }}</ref>

'''Tanya Atwater''' (Born 1942) is an American [[geophysicist]] and [[Marine geology|marine geologist]], who specializes in [[plate tectonics]]. She is particularly renowned for her early research on the [[plate tectonic]] history of western North America.

==Early life and education==
Atwater was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on August 27, 1942.<ref name=PSU>{{cite web |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth520/book/export/html/1752 |title=Tanya Atwater |publisher=John A. Dutton e-Education Institute |first=Tanya |last=Atwater |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> Her father was an engineer and her mother was a botanist. She is one of four siblings. Atwater was one of the first women to research the ocean floor in terms of its [[Geology]].{{sfn|Atwater|2017}}

Atwater began her education in 1960 at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], then received her B.A. in Geophysics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1965.<ref>{{citation|last=Gates|first=Alexander E.|chapter=\"Atwater, Tanya\" |title=A to Z of earth scientists|year=2003|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|isbn=978-0816045808 |pages=10–12}}</ref> She earned a Ph.D. (1972) in [[marine geophysics]] from [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], [[University of California, San Diego]]. She is director of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] Educational Multimedia Visualization Center where she is an emerita professor of geological sciences. She was a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] before joining the faculty at UCSB in 1980. Atwater retired from UCSB in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=EMVC Web Page|url=http://emvc.geol.ucsb.edu}}</ref>

==Career==
Atwater was a professor of [[tectonics]], in the Department of Geological Sciences at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] before retiring. She authored and co-authored 50 articles in international journals, professional volumes, and major reports. Seven of these papers were published in the journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' or ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. In 1975, she became a fellow of the [[American Geophysical Union]] for her work in [[tectonophysics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tanya M. Atwater|url=https://honors.agu.org/honorsfellow/1324-atwater/|publisher=American Geophysical Union|access-date=2 December 2017}}</ref> From 1975 to 1977, Atwater was a Sloan Postdoctoral Fellowship Recipient in Physics.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=\"Atwater, Tanya\"|title=Postdoctoral Pathways: Preparation, Holding Pattern of Jumping off point?|year=2012| publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Maryland|isbn=978-1421403632}}</ref> In 1984, she won the Encouragement Award from the [[Association for Women Geoscientists]].{{sfn|Atwater2|2017}} Atwater is a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] <ref name='foo'>{{cite web|title=Tanya Atwater|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/1376.html|publisher=National Academies of Science|access-date=1 December 2017}}</ref> for her contributions to marine geophysics and [[tectonics]]. In 2019 she received the highest award of the [[Geological Society of America]], the Penrose Medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/About/awards/About_Awards/GSA/Awards/About_GSA_Awards.aspx#penrose|title=The Penrose Medal|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

===Scientific discoveries===

Atwater was involved in oceanographic expeditions using deep towed instruments to explore the ocean floor. To date, she has participated in 12 deep water dives in the deep-ocean submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]''.  She researched the volcano-tectonic processes responsible for creating new oceanic crust at [[Mid-ocean ridge|seafloor spreading centers]].  In 1968, she co-authored a research paper featuring groundbreaking work into the faulted nature of spreading centers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Menard |first1=H.W. |last2=Atwater |first2= T.M. | year=1968 |title=Changes in direction of sea floor spreading| journal=Nature| volume=219|issue=5153 | pages=463–467|bibcode=1968Natur.219..463M|doi=10.1038/219463a0}}</ref> With [[Jack Corliss]], [[Fred Spiess]], and [[Kenneth C. Macdonald|Kenneth Macdonald]], she played key roles in expeditions that uncovered the distinct biology of ocean floor warm springs, which led to the discovery during the [[RISE project]] of the high temperature black smokers, undersea [[hydrothermal vent]]s.

In Atwater's research on [[Propagating Rifts]] near the [[Galápagos Islands|Galapagos Islands]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Atwater |first=Tanya | year=1981 |title=Propagating rifts in seafloor spreading patterns| journal=Nature| volume=290|issue=5803 | pages=185–186|bibcode=1981Natur.290..185A|doi=10.1038/290185a0}}</ref> she discovered that propagating rifts were created when spreading centers along the seafloor were disturbed by tectonic movement or [[magma]] and therefore had to change direction to realign. This helped to explain the complex pattern of the seafloor.

Atwater is perhaps best known for her work on the [[plate tectonic]] history of western North America.  She wrote two major research papers outlining the history of plate tectonic evolution of North America and tectonic problems of the [[San Andreas Fault]], which assisted in documenting the history of the [[San Andreas Fault Line]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter | year=1973 |title=Relative motion of the Pacific and North American plates deduced from sea-floor spreading in the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific Oceans| publisher=R. L. Kovach and A. Nur, eds., Proc. of the Conf. on Tectonic Problems of the San Andreas Fault: Stanford University Publication| volume=13 | pages=136–148}}</ref>

She also studied geometric evolution, integrating and comparing the global plate motion records with the regional continental geologic records.  She found emerging relationships that revealed the origins of many large-scale geologic features (e.g. [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], [[Death Valley]], [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade]] volcanoes, [[California Coast Ranges]]).<ref name=\"foo\"/>

Atwater published a research paper, Implications of Plate [[Tectonics]] for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America.<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\">{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya | year=1970 |title=Implications of Plate Tectonics for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume=81 | issue=12 | pages=3513–3536|bibcode=1970GSAB...81.3513A |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1970)81[3513:IOPTFT]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref>  In her work, she explains that approximately 40 million years ago, the [[Farallon Plate]] was subducting underneath the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]].  The lower half of the Farallon plate was entirely subducted under Southern California and the upper half did not sink, which eventually became known as the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]].Since the southern section of Farallon completely disappeared, the boundary of southern California was now between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The [[San Andreas Fault]] is unique because it acts as a major fault line as well as a border between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]].<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\"/> She updated this work in 1989.<ref>Atwater, T. M. 1989. “Plate tectonic history of the northeast Pacific and western North America”. In ''The geology of North America: The northeastern Pacific Ocean and Hawaii'', Edited by: Winterer, E. L., Hussong, D. M. and Decker, R. W. Vol. N, 21–72. Boulder, CO: Geol. Soc. Amer.</ref>

Atwater is interested in communication and education at all levels. She has developed electronic multi-media to enhance geologic visualization and understanding, particularly related to the histories of tectonic plates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atwater.faculty.geol.ucsb.edu |website=Tanya Atwater Home Page |accessdate=13 August 2019|title=Tanya Atwater Homepage }}</ref>

'''Militia organizations in the United States''' are private organizations that include [[paramilitary]] or similar elements. These groups may refer to themselves as '''[[Militia (United States)|militia]]''', '''unorganized militia''',<ref>Mulloy, Darren (2004) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aaBKyuLRjR0C American Extremism: History, Politics and the Militia Movement]'', Routledge.</ref> and '''[[Constitutional militia movement|constitutional militia]]'''.<ref>Williams, David C.

==History==
Militia have been a nessesary private organization since the formation of the United States. 

During the 1990s public attention to the militia movement began to grow.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] on April 19, 1995, the second anniversary of the Waco fire, drew nationwide attention to the militia movement as [[Timothy McVeigh]] was erroneously associated with the [[Michigan Militia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} This increased public scrutiny and law enforcement pressure, and brought in more recruits due to the heightened awareness of the movement.<ref name=\"MILITIA\">[http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/milnatbl.html Militia Nation] Chip Berlet and Matthew N. Lyons ''Progressive Magazine''</ref>

In March 1996, agents of the FBI and other law enforcement organizations surrounded the {{convert|960|acre|ha|sing=on}} eastern [[Montana]] \"Justus Township\" compound of the [[Montana Freemen]]. The Freemen were a [[Sovereign Citizen Movement|Sovereign Citizen]] group that included elements of the [[Christian Identity]] ideology, espoused [[common law]] legal theories, and rejected the legitimacy of the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name=\"RIGHT\"/> Montana legislator Carl Ohs mediated through the standoff. Both [[Randy Weaver]] (one of the besieged at [[Ruby Ridge]]) and [[Bo Gritz]] (a civilian negotiator at Ruby Ridge) had attempted to talk to the group but had given up in frustration, as did Colorado Senator [[Charlie Duke]] when he had attempted negotiations.<ref name=\"SURRENDER\">[http://www.cnn.com/US/9606/13/freemen.11p/ Freemen surrender peacefully to FBI] ''Cable News Network'' June 14, 1996</ref> A break finally came when far right leaders abandoned the group to their fate.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E5D61739F936A25755C0A960958260 Freemen Were Alone] ''New York Times'' June 15, 1996</ref> The group surrendered peacefully after an 81-day standoff and 14 of the Freemen faced criminal charges relating to circulating millions of dollars in bogus checks and threatening the life of a federal judge.<ref name=\"SURRENDER\"/> The peaceful resolution of this and other standoffs after Ruby Ridge and Waco have been credited by some to the creation of the Critical Incident Response Group ([[CIRG]]) in the U.S. Department of Justice in 1994.<ref>Christopher Whitcomb, ''Cold Zero: Inside the FBI Hostage Rescue Team''. {{ISBN|0-552-14788-5}}. (Covers [[Ruby Ridge]], [[Waco Siege]] and creation of [[CIRG]].)</ref>

A 1999 US Department of Justice analysis of the potential militia threat at the Millennium conceded that the vast majority of militias were reactive (not proactive) and posed no threat.<ref>United States Department of Justice, \"Operation Megiddo\", November 2, 1999, page 22; cited in Robert H. Churchill, \"Arming for the Last Battle: Secular and Religious Millennial Impulses within the Militia Movement\", 1999 Annual Conference of the Center for Millennial Studies, Boston University, Boston, MA, November 9, 1999.</ref> By 2001, the militia movement seemed to be in decline, having peaked in 1996 with 858 groups.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1325330.stm | work=BBC News | title=Militias 'in retreat' | date=May 11, 2001}}</ref> With the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|post-2007 global financial crisis]] and the election of [[Barack Obama]] to the United States presidency in 2008, militia activity has experienced a resurgence.<ref name=carter2012>{{cite book | editor=Carter, Gregg Lee | title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law, Volume 1 | chapter=Militias | pages=575–6 | year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/07/10602763-election-economy-spark-explosive-growth-of-militias?lite|title=Election, economy spark explosive growth of militias|author=Stephanie Schendel|date=2012-03-07|publisher=NBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/americas/americas-militiamen-resurgent-since-obama-election|title=America's militiamen resurgent since Obama election|author=Nicholas Kimbrell|publisher=The National}}</ref> Militia groups have recently been involved in several high-profile standoffs, including [[Bundy standoff|the Bundy Standoff]] in 2014 and the [[Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge]] in 2016 amid a renewed rise in anti-government militia movements.

===Legal legitimacy===
The United States Constitution provides for and defines the formation, training and use of these Mitlitia in every city, county and state to provide defense against governmmet tyrany or overreach.  They are authorized by the United States constitution and are a vital part of citizens maintaing strict control over public servants. (Senators, House members, all employees of state and local services are considered public servants) Without the formation of militia enough force could not be mustered to defeat a tyranical government.

'''Militia organizations in the United States''' are private organizations that include [[paramilitary]] or similar elements. These groups may refer to themselves as '''[[Militia (United States)|militia]]''', '''unorganized militia''',<ref>Mulloy, Darren (2004) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aaBKyuLRjR0C American Extremism: History, Politics and the Militia Movement]'', Routledge.</ref> and '''[[Constitutional militia movement|constitutional militia]]'''.<ref>Williams, David C.

While groups such as the [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]] existed as early as the 1980s,<ref name=\"CAMO\"/> the movement gained momentum after controversial standoffs with government agents in the early 1990s. By the mid-1990s, groups were active in all 50 US states, with membership estimated at between 20,000 and 60,000.<ref name=\"RIGHT\">Berlet, Chip & Lyons, Matthew (2000).

==History==
Although the [[Far right|far-right]] [[patriot movement]] had long been a fringe factor in American politics,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} cultural factors paved the way for the wide-scale growth of the ideological militia movement.  The catalysts came in the form of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s 1992 shootout with [[Randy Weaver]] at [[Ruby Ridge]], and the government's 1993 [[Waco siege|siege]] and eventual destruction of [[David Koresh]]'s compound and the [[Branch Davidians]] at Mt. Carmel in [[Waco, Texas]].<ref name=\"ANGRY\">[http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/dj_mili.html Rise Of Citizen Militias: Angry White Guys With Guns] Daniel Junas ''CovertAction Quarterly'' April 24, 1995</ref><ref>[[Morris Dees]], ''Gathering Storm: America's Militia Threat''.

{{quote|The militia movement is a right-wing movement that arose following controversial standoffs in the 1990s. It inherited paramilitary traditions of earlier groups, especially the conspiratorial, anti-government [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]]. The militia movement claims that militia groups are sanctioned by law but uncontrolled by government; in fact, they are designed to oppose a tyrannical government. The movement's ideology has led some adherents to commit criminal acts, including stockpiling illegal weapons and explosives and plotting to destroy buildings or assassinate public officials, as well as lesser confrontations.}}

During the 1990s public attention to the militia movement began to grow.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] on April 19, 1995, the second anniversary of the Waco fire, drew nationwide attention to the militia movement as [[Timothy McVeigh]] was erroneously associated with the [[Michigan Militia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} This increased public scrutiny and law enforcement pressure, and brought in more recruits due to the heightened awareness of the movement.<ref name=\"MILITIA\">[http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/milnatbl.html Militia Nation] Chip Berlet and Matthew N.

In March 1996, agents of the FBI and other law enforcement organizations surrounded the {{convert|960|acre|ha|sing=on}} eastern [[Montana]] \"Justus Township\" compound of the [[Montana Freemen]]. The Freemen were a [[Sovereign Citizen Movement|Sovereign Citizen]] group that included elements of the [[Christian Identity]] ideology, espoused [[common law]] legal theories, and rejected the legitimacy of the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name=\"RIGHT\"/> Montana legislator Carl Ohs mediated through the standoff. Both [[Randy Weaver]] (one of the besieged at [[Ruby Ridge]]) and [[Bo Gritz]] (a civilian negotiator at Ruby Ridge) had attempted to talk to the group but had given up in frustration, as did Colorado Senator [[Charlie Duke]] when he had attempted negotiations.<ref name=\"SURRENDER\">[http://www.cnn.com/US/9606/13/freemen.11p/ Freemen surrender peacefully to FBI] ''Cable News Network'' June 14, 1996</ref> A break finally came when far right leaders abandoned the group to their fate.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E5D61739F936A25755C0A960958260 Freemen Were Alone] ''New York Times'' June 15, 1996</ref> The group surrendered peacefully after an 81-day standoff and 14 of the Freemen faced criminal charges relating to circulating millions of dollars in bogus checks and threatening the life of a federal judge.<ref name=\"SURRENDER\"/> The peaceful resolution of this and other standoffs after Ruby Ridge and Waco have been credited by some to the creation of the Critical Incident Response Group ([[CIRG]]) in the U.S. Department of Justice in 1994.<ref>Christopher Whitcomb, ''Cold Zero: Inside the FBI Hostage Rescue Team''. {{ISBN|0-552-14788-5}}.

===Legal legitimacy===
Most militia organizations envisage themselves as legally legitimate organizations authorized under constitutional and statute law, specifically references in state and federal law to an \"unorganized militia\".{{fact|date=January 2020}} Others subscribe to the \"insurrection theory\" which describes the right of the [[body politic]] to rebel against the established government in the face of tyranny. (In the 1951 case ''[[Dennis v. United States]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the insurrection theory, stating that as long as the government provides for free elections and trials by jury, \"political self-defense\" cannot be undertaken.)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hardaway|first1=Robert|title=The Inconvenient Militia Clause of the Second Amendment: Why the Supreme Court Declines to Resolve the Debate over the Right to Bear Arms|journal=St. John's Journal of Legal Commentary|date=2002|issue=16}}</ref>

===Opposition to the government===
While militia organizations have a variety of ideologies and objectives, with many high profile organizations espousing [[Tax protester|anti-tax]], [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration]], [[Survivalism|survivalist]], [[Sovereign citizen movement|sovereign citizen]], [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian]], land rights and [[Neo-Confederate|southern restoration]] views,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} they generally share a common belief in the imminent or actual rise of a tyrannical government in the [[United States]] which, they believe, must be confronted through armed force.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hannaford|first1=Alex|title=The truth behind America's 'civilian militias'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7944563/The-truth-behind-Americas-civilian-militias.html|accessdate=4 January 2016|work=Daily Telegraph|date=19 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Militia History and Law FAQ|url=http://archive.adl.org/mwd/faq3.html|website=adl.org|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref> Some believe in the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order conspiracy theory]].<ref>[https://think.kera.org/2016/08/30/the-hate-map-of-america/ The Hate Map Of America] - Interview with Mark Potok, investigative reporter for the Southern Poverty Law Center</ref>

== History ==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2012}}
[[Image:Mount Washington, from the Conway Road.jpg|thumb|left|Mount Washington in 1872]]
Chartered in 1765 by Colonial Governor [[Benning Wentworth]], the town is named for [[Henry Seymour Conway]], ambitious son of a prominent [[English people|English]] family, who was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at age 20, fought at [[Battle of Culloden|Culloden]], and became [[Secretary of state (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]]. Early settlers called the area [[Pequawket]] (known colloquially as Pigwacket), adopting the name of the [[Abenaki]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] village which stretched down the [[Saco River]] to its [[stockade]]d center at [[Fryeburg, Maine]].

North Conway is in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], with [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] to the northwest. The rugged terrain became popular in the 19th century with artists. Their paintings were known collectively as [[White Mountain art]], which in turn attracted tourists to the area, particularly after the [[Portsmouth, Great Falls & Conway Railroad]] extended service in 1872 to North Conway. In 1874, the line [[North Conway Depot and Railroad Yard|built a]] [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] [[Train station|depot]], designed by [[Nathaniel J. Bradlee]]. In 1932, \"snow trains\" began carrying enthusiasts to \"the birthplace of American [[alpine skiing|skiing]],\" as North Conway is known.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Increasing automobile travel brought the decline of trains. The railroad, then part of the [[Boston and Maine Railroad|Boston & Maine]], abandoned passenger service to the area in 1961 and [[freight]] service in 1972. Subsequently, the [[Conway Scenic Railroad]] was established. Today, the line offers visitors a tour of the region, including [[Crawford Notch]]. The station is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In the late 1980s, the [[White Mountain Airport (New Hampshire)|White Mountain Airport]] closed and was redeveloped as a large outlet mall called [[Settlers' Green Outlet Village]]. Continued growth through the 1990s and 2000s in North Conway and the villages nearby made Conway the most populous community in [[Carroll County, New Hampshire|Carroll County]]. Traffic congestion led to an overhaul of the road system, including widening [[New Hampshire Route 16|Route 16]] through North Conway village and constructing a road parallel to Route 16 to allow traffic to move between [[Redstone, New Hampshire|Redstone]] and [[Intervale, New Hampshire|Intervale]] uninterrupted. A [[Conway Bypass (New Hampshire)|bypass]] of the area is being developed.

North Conway remains a popular destination due to its shopping, recreation, and attractions.

North Conway and its surrounding towns offer [[hiking]] in the [[White Mountain National Forest]]. The area is a major [[rock climbing]] destination in the [[northeastern United States]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~doc/climbing/cathedralwhitehorse/| title=Cathedral and Whitehorse Ledges| publisher=Dartmouth Outing Club| accessdate=June 22, 2010}}</ref> particularly Cathedral Ledge in Echo Lake State Park.

Unlike nearby White Horse Ledge, another rock climbing site, Cathedral Ledge has an automobile road to the summit, which provides fine views of the Saco River Valley.

In late September through early October, tourists arrive to see the [[autumn foliage]] on the surrounding mountains and forests. The [[Conway Scenic Railroad]] features train rides that leave from the village's [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] station. In the winter, the village is the nighttime destination for [[skiing|skiers]] visiting the area resorts, including North Conway's own [[Cranmore Mountain Resort|Cranmore Mountain]] as well as nearby [[Attitash]] Resort, [[Black Mountain Ski Area (New Hampshire)|Black Mountain]] and [[Wildcat Mountain Ski Area|Wildcat Mountain]].

== History ==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2012}}
[[Image:Mount Washington, from the Conway Road.jpg|thumb|left|Mount Washington in 1872]]
Chartered in 1765 by Colonial Governor [[Benning Wentworth]], the town is named for [[Henry Seymour Conway]], ambitious son of a prominent [[English people|English]] family, who was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at age 20, fought at [[Battle of Culloden|Culloden]], and became [[Secretary of state (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]]. Early settlers called the area [[Pequawket]] (known colloquially as Pigwacket), adopting the name of the [[Abenaki]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] village which stretched down the [[Saco River]] to its [[stockade]]d center at [[Fryeburg, Maine]].

North Conway is in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], with [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] to the northwest. The rugged terrain became popular in the 19th century with artists. Their paintings were known collectively as [[White Mountain art]], which in turn attracted tourists to the area, particularly after the [[Portsmouth, Great Falls & Conway Railroad]] extended service in 1872 to North Conway. In 1874, the line [[North Conway Depot and Railroad Yard|built a]] [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] [[Train station|depot]], designed by [[Nathaniel J. Bradlee]]. In 1932, \"snow trains\" began carrying enthusiasts to \"the birthplace of American [[alpine skiing|skiing]],\" as North Conway is known.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Increasing automobile travel brought the decline of trains. The railroad, then part of the [[Boston and Maine Railroad|Boston & Maine]], abandoned passenger service to the area in 1961 and [[freight]] service in 1972. Subsequently, the [[Conway Scenic Railroad]] was established. Today, the line offers visitors a tour of the region, including [[Crawford Notch]]. The station is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In the late 1980s, the [[White Mountain Airport (New Hampshire)|White Mountain Airport]] closed and was redeveloped as a large outlet mall called [[Settlers' Green Outlet Village]]. Continued growth through the 1990s and 2000s in North Conway and the villages nearby made Conway the most populous community in [[Carroll County, New Hampshire|Carroll County]]. Traffic congestion led to an overhaul of the road system, including widening [[New Hampshire Route 16|Route 16]] through North Conway village and constructing a road parallel to Route 16 to allow traffic to move between [[Redstone, New Hampshire|Redstone]] and [[Intervale, New Hampshire|Intervale]] uninterrupted. A [[Conway Bypass (New Hampshire)|bypass]] of the area is being developed.

North Conway remains a popular destination due to its shopping, recreation, and attractions.

}}
''Jealous Ones Still Envy 2'' received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]] who found Joe trying too hard to recapture ''[[Jealous Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.)|J.O.S.E.]]''{{'}}s commercial success while appealing to a younger hip-hop audience. Mariel Concepcion of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' praised the production for being energetic and versatile for Joe to rap over, saying that \"the Bronx-bred rapper again proves that he's got a knack for infectious beats.\"<ref name=\"Billboard\"/> Sean A. Malcolm of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' said that despite some tracks feeling dull and monotonous, he praised Joe for maintaining his New York roots while mixing it with his newfound Miami influence through his performance, concluding that \"Sequels rarely live up to the original, and ''J.O.S.E. 2'' is no exception. But, in the end, with his string of hits, Fat Joe still remains one to envy.\"<ref name=\"XXL\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries said that the album follows the same formula as ''J.O.S.E.'', noticing the tracks' high-end production and star-worthy featured artists saying, \"The track list is right-sized and the rhymes are amusing the whole way through, making the title the only thing left to gripe about.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>

Steve 'Flash' Juon of ''RapReviews'' was mixed towards the album, noting that Joe goes back and forth delivering sub-standard lyrics over production that's commercially tasteful, saying that, \"I suppose Joe can't be blamed for trying to stay trendy so he doesn't become irrelevant, but in working hard to combat his complacency he's gone the opposite direction and become the one thing no rapper should ever be - the old dude in the room everybody's snickering at because he thinks he's being cool when he's not.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> Andres Tardio of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' said that despite tracks like \"Congratulations\", \"One\" and \"Joey Don't Do It\" having eclectic production and sharp lyricism, the album falters with an overabundance of [[Auto-Tune]] over anonymous club tracks, saying that, \"Though ''J.O.S.E. 2'' shines when Joe is not chasing formulaic records, the cookie cutter style he often uses makes this album lose its impact.\"<ref name=\"HHDX\"/>

''Vibe'' editor Chris Yuscavage found it inferior to Joe's 2001 commercial breakthrough saying, \"With ''J.O.S.E. 2'', he tried to emulate that feeling by selecting a host of commercially-viable producers (Jim Jonsin, Rico Love and–''gulp''–Ron Browz, included) and failed ''miserably'' by deviating away from his core fan base.

''Jealous Ones Still Envy 2'' received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]] who found Joe trying too hard to recapture ''[[Jealous Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.)|J.O.S.E.]]''{{'}}s commercial success while appealing to a younger hip-hop audience. Mariel Concepcion of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' praised the production for being energetic and versatile for Joe to rap over, saying that \"the Bronx-bred rapper again proves that he's got a knack for infectious beats.\"<ref name=\"Billboard\"/> Sean A. Malcolm of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' said that despite some tracks feeling dull and monotonous, he praised Joe for maintaining his New York roots while mixing it with his newfound Miami influence through his performance, concluding that \"Sequels rarely live up to the original, and ''J.O.S.E. 2'' is no exception. But, in the end, with his string of hits, Fat Joe still remains one to envy.\"<ref name=\"XXL\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries said that the album follows the same formula as ''J.O.S.E.'', noticing the tracks' high-end production and star-worthy featured artists saying, \"The track list is right-sized and the rhymes are amusing the whole way through, making the title the only thing left to gripe about.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>

Steve 'Flash' Juon of ''RapReviews'' was mixed towards the album, noting that Joe goes back and forth delivering sub-standard lyrics over production that's commercially tasteful, saying that, \"I suppose Joe can't be blamed for trying to stay trendy so he doesn't become irrelevant, but in working hard to combat his complacency he's gone the opposite direction and become the one thing no rapper should ever be - the old dude in the room everybody's snickering at because he thinks he's being cool when he's not.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> Andres Tardio of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' said that despite tracks like \"Congratulations\", \"One\" and \"Joey Don't Do It\" having eclectic production and sharp lyricism, the album falters with an overabundance of [[Auto-Tune]] over anonymous club tracks, saying that, \"Though ''J.O.S.E. 2'' shines when Joe is not chasing formulaic records, the cookie cutter style he often uses makes this album lose its impact.\"<ref name=\"HHDX\"/>

===Sales and legacy===
''Jealous Ones Still Envy 2'' debuted at number 73 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for the week of October 24, 2009<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/2009-10-24 |title=Billboard 200: Week of October 24, 2009 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=January 22, 2016}}</ref> and only sold 8,300 copies for its first week<ref>{{cite web|author=BallerStatus News Staff |url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2009/10/15/the-charts-fat-joe-fails-to-make-impact-with-jose-2/ |title=The Charts: Fat Joe Fails To Make Impact With ''J.O.S.E. 2'' |website=BallerStatus |date=October 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2016}}</ref> before leaving the chart the next week.

''Vibe'' editor Chris Yuscavage found it inferior to Joe's 2001 commercial breakthrough saying, \"With ''J.O.S.E. 2'', he tried to emulate that feeling by selecting a host of commercially-viable producers (Jim Jonsin, Rico Love and–''gulp''–Ron Browz, included) and failed ''miserably'' by deviating away from his core fan base.

Free parking is available in the lots adjacent to the tracks on the north and south side. One [[parking garage]] north of the station was built in 1996 on a former freight spur.<ref>[http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/Ronkonkoma/MP48-49%20ronk.jpg Ronkonkoma Milepost 48-49; Emery map - October 1957]</ref><ref>[http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/Ronkonkoma/ronkwyenorth78.jpg View Wye North (1978 Photo by Steve Lynch)]</ref> The station has a total of about 6,100 parking spaces.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Long Island Rail Road |date=March 4, 2010 |title=Ronkonkoma Parking Lot Renovation Completed; Almost 300 New Spots Now Available |url=http://mta.info/mta/news/releases/?en=100304-LIRR23 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> As of May 2011, 63 trains connecting to [[New York City]] stop at this station every weekday, while an additional nine make connections with stations to the east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mta.info/lirr/Timetable/Station/RonkonkomaKO3.pdf |title=LIRR schedule for Ronkonkama |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
Ronkonkoma Station was originally built as '''Lake Ronkonkoma''' station in 1883 as a replacement for the 1843-built '''Lakeland''' station designed to serve both [[Lakeland, Suffolk County, New York|Lakeland]] and [[Ronkonkoma, New York]], as well as the 1853-built '''Hermanville''' station, designed for a former community along the south side of the tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arrts-arrchives.com/hermannville.html|title=HERMANNVILLE|work=arrts-arrchives.com}}</ref>

===Lake Road and Lakeland stations===
'''Lakeland''' was originally built in 1843 as '''Lake Road''' station. It was named for and located on Lake Road (now Pond Road), a street that once ran from [[Oakdale, New York|Oakdale]] to the east side of [[Lake Ronkonkoma (lake)|Lake Ronkonkoma]] itself. By 1850 it was moved to the Dr. E. F. Peck General Store on the northwest corner of what is today Ocean Avenue and Lakeland Street. A freight house existed along the tracks close to Pine Avenue. Edgar Fenn Peck owned land as far south as [[Sayville, New York|Sayville]], and in 1851 sold the store and the land to a developer named Charles Wood, who turned his land into a development named Lakeland Farms, which today includes land in Oakdale, [[Bohemia, New York|Bohemia]], and what is now [[Ronkonkoma, New York|Ronkonkoma]].<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/hermannville.html Lake Road station, Hermanville station, Lake station, Lakeland station, Lakeland Farms, and Wood Lawn, Long Island  (Arrt's Arrchive)]</ref> The original Lake Road station operated simultaneously with the one at the general store on Ocean Avenue, and at some point was renamed \"Lake station,\" until eventually being phased out. No record of the original station's existence can be found after 1857.

===Hermanville station===
'''Hermanville''' or '''Hermannville''' was another station stop along the [[Greenport Branch]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]], located east of the former Lake Road Station. It first appeared on an 1850 map of the Long Island Rail Road.<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images3/HERMANNVILLEmapLIeast.jpg Hermannville Map]</ref> The station had one side platform, and two tracks. An 1852 advertisement for Hermanville in a few books mention the Long Island Rail Road.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_G_pJck2iTsC&pg=PA252&lpg=PA252&dq=hermanville+long+island+railroad+station&source=bl&ots=ipLDdvLiGQ&sig=aXT8Ie0VDj5nSApETMkoIIyq4nY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s_shVdb9KMu8ggSx1ICQDw&sqi=2&ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=hermanville%20long%20island%20railroad%20station&f=false The Cultivator by Luther Tucker Advertisement for Hermannvile mentioning Long Island Railroad]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=21tKAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA247&lpg=PA247&dq=hermanville+long+island+railroad+station&source=bl&ots=KQPT8t6mvQ&sig=ZFGUkxO7sjXJnzZpmMZPaUNBSX4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lPwhVYexOMPLsAWahoG4Aw&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=hermanville%20long%20island%20railroad%20station&f=false The Genesee Farmer advertisement for Hermanville]</ref> Hermannville also made an appearance on the 1855 Colton map.<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images2/1855coltonCENTRE.jpg 1855 Hermannville Map]</ref> On the Map of The Village of Hermannville, Town of Islip, Suffolk County, Long Island, Hemannville station<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images3/HERMANNVILLEtraineb.jpg Hermanville Station]</ref> is shown as being at the intersection of the Main Line and Herman Avenue,<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images3/HERMANNVILLEmapWrr.jpg Hermannville Map]</ref><ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images3/HERMANNVILLEdescr.jpg Hermannville description]</ref> which today is part of the Ronkonkoma Yard.

===After Lakeland===
'''Lake Ronkonkoma''' station replaced Lakeland station in 1883 and was designed to serve both [[Lakeland, Suffolk County, New York|Lakeland]] and [[Ronkonkoma, New York]]. At some point, the word \"Lake\" was dropped from the station name. The station house was burned in 1934 and a temporary rectangular one-story building with a gabled roof was used until September 1937, when the second Ronkonkoma station was completed. Throughout much of the 20th Century, it also served as a sizeable freight hub for Central Suffolk County.

Since December 28, 1987, it has been the east end of the Main Line electrification<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/Ronkonkoma/ronkelectrification.htm|title=LIRR Ronkonkoma Electrification 1987|work=trainsarefun.com}}</ref> but stations east of Ronkonkoma have been modified for future electrification. The 1937 station was used for storage until it was razed in 1994 when part of the parking lot was extended westward. The current station was designed by architect Richard Henry Behr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhbpc.com/commercial/ronkonkoma/com_ronk3.htm|title=Richard Henry Behr Architect P.C.|work=rhbpc.com}}</ref> Ronkonkoma Yard is also located east of the station, in close proximity to the former [[Holbrook (LIRR station)|Holbrook]] station, which was torn down in 1962,<ref>[http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/Ronkonkoma/MP49-50%20ronk.jpg Ronkonkoma/Holbrook Milepost 49-50; Emery map (TrainsAreFun.com)]</ref> and has taken in commuters from the former [[Holtsville (LIRR station)|Holtsville]] station since March 16, 1998.

==Station layout==
This station is set up using the [[Spanish solution]] with three high-level platforms, each 12 cars long. Platform B, an [[island platform]], facilitates a [[cross-platform interchange]] when a Ronkonkoma Branch train and a Greenport train arrive at the same time (a move also known as \"The Greenport Scoot\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcaetrain.org/articles/operating/greensport/index.html|title=e-Train - TCA, Toy Trains, Train Collectors Association|work=tcaetrain.org}}</ref>

==Mid-Suffolk Yard==
East of the Ronkonkoma station is a 12-track train-storage yard called the Ronkonkoma Yard. As this is the eastern end of the electrified portion of the Main Line, the yard stores the [[electric multiple unit]]s that are used on the Ronkonkoma Branch.<ref name=MTA-MidSuffolk/>

In preparation for the LIRR's [[East Side Access]] expansion to [[Grand Central Terminal]], the MTA is adding 11 new tracks to the yard, for a total of 23 tracks.<ref name=MTA-MidSuffolk>{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/midsuffolkyard/index.htm |title=Mid-Suffolk Yard |work=mta.info}}</ref> The expansion will use space already owned by the MTA located immediately to the south of the existing rail yard and north of [[Long Island MacArthur Airport|MacArthur Airport]]. The increase in storage space will allow the MTA to increase peak-hour service to Manhattan. The project is budgeted for $128.0 million.<ref name=\"Jan 2013\">{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/archive/130128_1330_CPOC.pdf#page=8 |title=MTA Capital Program Oversight Meeting |date=January 2013 |accessdate=May 24, 2018|work=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]] |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |page=8}}</ref><ref name=\"Nov 2017\">{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/archive/140623_1345_CPOC.pdf#page=35 |title=MTA Long Island Rail Road Committee Meeting |date=November 2017 |accessdate=May 24, 2018|work=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]] |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |page=35}}</ref><ref name=\"schedule\">{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/midsuffolkyard/schedule.htm|title=Mid-Suffolk Yard Schedule|last=|first=|date=|work=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=November 2, 2015}}</ref> Locations in Deer Park, Central Islip, and Yaphank were also considered for the construction of the yard.

'''Ronkonkoma''' is a major [[train station|railroad station]] and transportation hub along the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] in [[Ronkonkoma, New York]]. The station is the eastern [[terminal station|terminus]] of the [[Ronkonkoma Branch]] and the western terminus of the [[Greenport Branch]].

The station is located on Lakeland Street or Railroad Avenue North across from the intersection of Hawkins Avenue, and has parking facilities and other amenities that extend beyond the central location. Free parking is available in the lots adjacent to the tracks on the north and south side. One [[parking garage]] north of the station was built in 1996 on a former freight spur.<ref>[http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/Ronkonkoma/MP48-49%20ronk.jpg Ronkonkoma Milepost 48-49; Emery map - October 1957]</ref><ref>[http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/Ronkonkoma/ronkwyenorth78.jpg View Wye North (1978 Photo by Steve Lynch)]</ref> The station has a total of about 6,100 parking spaces.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Long Island Rail Road |date=March 4, 2010 |title=Ronkonkoma Parking Lot Renovation Completed; Almost 300 New Spots Now Available |url=http://mta.info/mta/news/releases/?en=100304-LIRR23 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> As of May 2011, 63 trains connecting to [[New York City]] stop at this station every weekday, while an additional nine make connections with stations to the east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mta.info/lirr/Timetable/Station/RonkonkomaKO3.pdf |title=LIRR schedule for Ronkonkama |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
Ronkonkoma Station was originally built as '''Lake Ronkonkoma''' station in 1883 as a replacement for the 1843-built '''Lakeland''' station designed to serve both [[Lakeland, Suffolk County, New York|Lakeland]] and [[Ronkonkoma, New York]], as well as the 1853-built '''Hermanville''' station, designed for a former community along the south side of the tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arrts-arrchives.com/hermannville.html|title=HERMANNVILLE|work=arrts-arrchives.com}}</ref>

===Lake Road and Lakeland stations===
'''Lakeland''' was originally built in 1843 as '''Lake Road''' station. It was named for and located on Lake Road (now Pond Road), a street that once ran from [[Oakdale, New York|Oakdale]] to the east side of [[Lake Ronkonkoma (lake)|Lake Ronkonkoma]] itself. By 1850 it was moved to the Dr. E. F. Peck General Store on the northwest corner of what is today Ocean Avenue and Lakeland Street. A freight house existed along the tracks close to Pine Avenue. Edgar Fenn Peck owned land as far south as [[Sayville, New York|Sayville]], and in 1851 sold the store and the land to a developer named Charles Wood, who turned his land into a development named Lakeland Farms, which today includes land in Oakdale, [[Bohemia, New York|Bohemia]], and what is now [[Ronkonkoma, New York|Ronkonkoma]].<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/hermannville.html Lake Road station, Hermanville station, Lake station, Lakeland station, Lakeland Farms, and Wood Lawn, Long Island  (Arrt's Arrchive)]</ref> The original Lake Road station operated simultaneously with the one at the general store on Ocean Avenue, and at some point was renamed \"Lake station,\" until eventually being phased out. No record of the original station's existence can be found after 1857.

===Hermanville station===
'''Hermanville''' or '''Hermannville''' was another station stop along the [[Greenport Branch]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]], located east of the former Lake Road Station. It first appeared on an 1850 map of the Long Island Rail Road.<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images3/HERMANNVILLEmapLIeast.jpg Hermannville Map]</ref> The station had one side platform, and two tracks. An 1852 advertisement for Hermanville in a few books mention the Long Island Rail Road.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_G_pJck2iTsC&pg=PA252&lpg=PA252&dq=hermanville+long+island+railroad+station&source=bl&ots=ipLDdvLiGQ&sig=aXT8Ie0VDj5nSApETMkoIIyq4nY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s_shVdb9KMu8ggSx1ICQDw&sqi=2&ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=hermanville%20long%20island%20railroad%20station&f=false The Cultivator by Luther Tucker Advertisement for Hermannvile mentioning Long Island Railroad]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=21tKAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA247&lpg=PA247&dq=hermanville+long+island+railroad+station&source=bl&ots=KQPT8t6mvQ&sig=ZFGUkxO7sjXJnzZpmMZPaUNBSX4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lPwhVYexOMPLsAWahoG4Aw&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=hermanville%20long%20island%20railroad%20station&f=false The Genesee Farmer advertisement for Hermanville]</ref> Hermannville also made an appearance on the 1855 Colton map.<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images2/1855coltonCENTRE.jpg 1855 Hermannville Map]</ref> On the Map of The Village of Hermannville, Town of Islip, Suffolk County, Long Island, Hemannville station<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images3/HERMANNVILLEtraineb.jpg Hermanville Station]</ref> is shown as being at the intersection of the Main Line and Herman Avenue,<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images3/HERMANNVILLEmapWrr.jpg Hermannville Map]</ref><ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images3/HERMANNVILLEdescr.jpg Hermannville description]</ref> which today is part of the Ronkonkoma Yard.

===After Lakeland===
'''Lake Ronkonkoma''' station replaced Lakeland station in 1883 and was designed to serve both [[Lakeland, Suffolk County, New York|Lakeland]] and [[Ronkonkoma, New York]]. At some point, the word \"Lake\" was dropped from the station name. The station house was burned in 1934 and a temporary rectangular one-story building with a gabled roof was used until September 1937, when the second Ronkonkoma station was completed. Throughout much of the 20th Century, it also served as a sizeable freight hub for Central Suffolk County.

Since December 28, 1987, it has been the east end of the Main Line electrification<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/Ronkonkoma/ronkelectrification.htm|title=LIRR Ronkonkoma Electrification 1987|work=trainsarefun.com}}</ref> but stations east of Ronkonkoma have been modified for future electrification. The 1937 station was used for storage until it was razed in 1994 when part of the parking lot was extended westward. The current station was designed by architect Richard Henry Behr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhbpc.com/commercial/ronkonkoma/com_ronk3.htm|title=Richard Henry Behr Architect P.C.|work=rhbpc.com}}</ref> Ronkonkoma Yard is also located east of the station, in close proximity to the former [[Holbrook (LIRR station)|Holbrook]] station, which was torn down in 1962,<ref>[http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/Ronkonkoma/MP49-50%20ronk.jpg Ronkonkoma/Holbrook Milepost 49-50; Emery map (TrainsAreFun.com)]</ref> and has taken in commuters from the former [[Holtsville (LIRR station)|Holtsville]] station since March 16, 1998.

==Mid-Suffolk Yard==
East of the Ronkonkoma station is a 12-track train-storage yard called the Ronkonkoma Yard. As this is the eastern end of the electrified portion of the Main Line, the yard stores the [[electric multiple unit]]s that are used on the Ronkonkoma Branch.<ref name=MTA-MidSuffolk/>

In preparation for the LIRR's [[East Side Access]] expansion to [[Grand Central Terminal]], the MTA is adding 11 new tracks to the yard, for a total of 23 tracks.<ref name=MTA-MidSuffolk>{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/midsuffolkyard/index.htm |title=Mid-Suffolk Yard |work=mta.info}}</ref> The expansion will use space already owned by the MTA located immediately to the south of the existing rail yard and north of [[Long Island MacArthur Airport|MacArthur Airport]].

The number of '''Chinese people in Kazakhstan''' varies through the centuries. There have been various migrations of [[Ethnic minorities of China|ethnic minorities from China]] to Kazakhstan in the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as that of the [[Dungan people]] (Hui) fleeing [[Qing Dynasty]] forces after [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|a failed 1862–1877 rebellion]] in [[northwest China]], or the Uyghur and [[Kazakh exodus from Xinjiang]] during the 1950s [[Great Leap Forward]]; however, their descendants do not consider themselves to be \"[[Chinese people]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Laruelle|Peyrouse|2009|p=104}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=39}}</ref> The modern wave of migration from China only dates back to the early 1990s.<ref name=\"Sadovskaya2007a\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2007|p=159}}</ref>

As a result of centuries-old migrations from China, distinct ethnic diasporas emerged in Kazakhstan: Uyghurs – 246.449 people (2010),   Dungans (Hui) – 51.577 people (2010),  and Han Chinese – 3.424 people (2009). <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2017a\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2017|p=162-170}}</ref> The Han Chinese is a highly urbanized ethnic group: 80% live in the cities, predominantly in Almaty, Nur-Sultan (former Astana) and Karaganda, and is well educated: 48.2% of Han have higher (university) and vocational education. <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2017b\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2017|p=170}}</ref>

==Migration history==
During the [[Mongol Empire]], Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers.<ref name=\"Biran2005\">{{cite book|author=Michal Biran|title=The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B934LaVBaz8C&pg=PA96#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=15 September 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84226-6|pages=96–}}</ref> The Daoist Chinese master [[Qiu Chuji]] travelled through Kazakhstan to meet Genghis Khan in Afghanistan.

China and Kazakhstan agreed on visa-free travel in early 1992, which led to 150 to 200 Chinese citizens entering Kazakhstan each day and not returning to China. Most are believed to have simply used Kazakhstan as a transit point to Europe. Visa-free travel was terminated in 1993.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2007|p=151}}</ref> The border between the two countries remained strictly controlled and highly militarised until the 1995 China–Kazakhstan Joint Declaration, following which [[People's Liberation Army]] units in the region were redeployed to the borders with Tajikistan and Afghanistan in southern Xinjiang.<ref>{{harvnb|Parham|2004|pp=58–59}}</ref> Starting from them, many Chinese traders began flowing into Kazakhstan.<ref name=\"Parham2004\">{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=61}}</ref> When the Kazakhstani government first opened a consulate in Ürümqi in 1997, it did not even issue visas to local people, but by 2004 it was possible for Chinese people to obtain business visas with an invitation from an organisation in Kazakhstan.<ref>{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=89}}</ref> 

Some Kazakhstan popular media reports claimed there were as many as 300,000 Chinese people in Kazakhstan by the year 2000.<ref name=\"Parham2004\" /> An article from China's official [[Xinhua News Agency]] repeated this same number in 2009.<ref name=\"Xinhua\">{{citation|url=http://www.xj.xinhuanet.com/2009-04/01/content_16127856.htm|date=2009-04-01|accessdate=2009-04-17|author=马敏/Ma Min|title=新疆《哈萨克斯坦华侨报》通过哈方注册 4月底创刊/Xinjiang 'Kazakhstan Overseas Chinese Newspaper' Passes Kazakhstan Registration; To Begin Publishing at Month's end|periodical=Xinhua News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720032152/http://www.xj.xinhuanet.com/2009-04/01/content_16127856.htm|archive-date=2011-07-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, official entrance statistics by the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan showed only 46.0 thou in 2000, 91.5 thou in 2005, 134.9 thou in 2010 and 239.6 thou visitors from China in Kazakhstan in 2014 <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2016g\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=40}}</ref>. Among visitors are citizens of various ethnicities: Han, Kazakhs, Uighurs, Dungans (Hui), Uzbeks, Koreans and others. They arrive with various purposes: official and business visits, private, tourism, labour, transit <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2016a\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=41-43}}</ref>.

==Business and employment==
The recruitment of the working force from China, largely entering the country as employees of Chinese companies, dates back to 1993. 559 workers from China entered the country according to governmentally approved quota for attracting the foreign labour force. This grew to 1,457 by 2004, 5,008 by 2006 and 10,104 by 2010, making up 22% of the total foreign labour. <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2016c\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=44-45}}</ref>. Initially, most were concentrated in Almaty, but more are spreading out to southern and western Kazakhstan as well. They are commonly employed in energy and construction companies.<ref name=\"Sadovskaya2007\" /> Some Chinese who have officially entered the country on short-term business visas for the purpose of trade are also in reality employed as labourers by Chinese companies.<ref name=\"Sadovskaya2007b\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2007|p=157}}</ref>

In the 2000s, independent entrepreneurs running import-export businesses, as well as larger investors, began to become more active.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2007|p=155}}</ref> Most of the products which Chinese traders sell are purchased in the special economic zones in the Xinjiang border regions.<ref>{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=90}}</ref> Over 4,000 Chinese firms or Kazakhstani firms with some Chinese investors are officially registered with the government; however, {{asof|2006|lc=on}}, only 213 were active.<ref>{{harvnb|Syroezhkin|2009|p=43}}</ref>

There is a Chinese bazaar in Almaty, the Barakholka Bazaar, which in addition to selling general Chinese-made products such as electronics or foodstuffs to local people, also sells products aimed at Chinese people such as Chinese pop music or Chinese-language newspapers. These are not in evidence in other urban areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Parham|2004|pp=79–80}}</ref> It came to be dominated by Uyghur and Dungan traders in the 1990s; it is actually located near the site of a former Dungan ''kolkhoz''<ref>{{harvnb|Laruelle|Peyrouse|2009|p=98}}</ref> and the areas of traditional Uyghur settlement in Almaty - ''Zarya Vostoka'' village <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2016d\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=64}}</ref>

The Dungan have often played an intermediary role in business ventures between migrants from China and local people.<ref>{{harvnb|Laruelle|Peyrouse|2009|p=110}}</ref>

==Media==
A Xinjiang-based [[free newspaper]] aimed at Chinese people in Kazakhstan, the ''Hāsàkèsītǎn Huáqiáo Bào'' (哈萨克斯坦华侨报, literally \"Kazakhstan Chinese Emigrant Newspaper\"), received permission from the Kazakhstan government in April 2009 to begin publication. The editors plan to publish it bilingually in both Russian and Chinese, with two issues of eight pages each per month. It is printed by the same department responsible for the ''[[Xinjiang Economic Daily]]''.<ref name=\"Xinhua\"/>

==Ethnic Kazakhs among the migrants==
{{main|Oralman}}
The Kazakh government has sought to promote permanent relocation of ethnic Kazakhs from abroad in Kazakhstan by providing them with financial assistance and land grants in border areas <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2016e\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=52-56}}</ref>. However, this eventually requires them to give up their Chinese nationality and right of residence; according to Xinjiang media, many later come to regret this move <ref name=\"Parham2004a\">{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=93}}</ref>. Kazakhs repariating from China have expressed that they experience difficulty integrating because they are more familiar with the Arabic orthography for the Kazakh language as used in China, rather than the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] one used in Kazakhstan.  Further, they often speak only Chinese, and very rarely any Russian, as a second language<ref name=\"Sadovskaya2007a\" /><ref name=\"Parham2004b\">{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=94}}</ref>. Kazakh repatriates from China tend to find jobs at Chinese companies or joint ventures.<ref name=\"Sadovskaya2007a\" />

According to the official data, in 1995-2014, Kazakhstan citizenship was granted in total to 73,800 individuals from China, of who 73,713 were Kazakh repatriates; 13 – Han Chinese, and 73 – other ethnicities (as of January 1, 2015)  <ref>{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=52}}</ref>.

Since 1991 and until October 1, 2019, 1.057 mln ethnic Kazakh repatriates arrived to Kazakhstan. The number of oralmans from China was 13.2%, or around 139.6 thou people <ref>{{harvnb|Iztileuov|2019}}</ref>.
Most are concentrated around Almaty and [[East Kazakhstan Province]].<ref name=\"Sadovskaya2007b\" /> They form the majority of teachers of the Chinese language at Kazakhstani universities.<ref>{{harvnb|Laruelle|Peyrouse|2009|pp=116–117}}</ref>

==Inter-ethnic relations==
Kazakhstanis generally express neutral attitudes towards Chinese migrants (55% of respondents in 2007). In 2012 this share with indifferent attitudes shrunk up to 44%, and the share of those with “poor” attitudes increased from 15 to 33%; respondents with positive attitudes accounted for 23% (26% in 2007) <ref>{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=84-85}}</ref>.

There is even some opposition to the presence or further migration of Uyghurs or Kazakhs from Xinjiang, because of the perception that their presence may draw more Chinese influence into the country as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=81}}</ref> A 2009 proposal by the Chinese government to lease one million hectares of steppe for cultivation of [[soybean]]s sparked a series of protests in Almaty in December and January over the possibility that Chinese labourers would be brought to the country to work the land.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Prospect_Of_Chinese_Farmers_Brings_Controversy_To_Kazakh_Soil/1906896.html|last=Pannier|first=Bruce|date=2009-12-17|accessdate=2010-01-03|title=Prospect of Chinese Farmers Brings Controversy to Kazakh Soil|periodical=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8489024.stm|periodical=BBC News|date=2010-01-31|accessdate=2010-02-01|title=Kazakhs protest against China farmland lease|first=Rayhan|last=Demytrie}}</ref>

According to the 2012 sociological survey, higher tolerance to Chinese migrants is observed among ethnic minorities and Russians, those aged 18-29 and 30-39, and respondents with higher educational levels <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2016f\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=86}}</ref>. There is a popular perception that a large and rapidly growing number of Chinese people marry Kazakhstani citizens to obtain permanent residency in the country, but in fact, there were only 74 such marriages between 1991 and 2007.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2007|p=160}}</ref>

There is even some opposition to the presence or further migration of Uyghurs or Kazakhs from Xinjiang, because of the perception that their presence may draw more Chinese influence into the country as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=81}}</ref> A 2009 proposal by the Chinese government to lease one million hectares of steppe for cultivation of [[soybean]]s sparked a series of protests in Almaty in December and January over the possibility that Chinese labourers would be brought to the country to work the land.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Prospect_Of_Chinese_Farmers_Brings_Controversy_To_Kazakh_Soil/1906896.html|last=Pannier|first=Bruce|date=2009-12-17|accessdate=2010-01-03|title=Prospect of Chinese Farmers Brings Controversy to Kazakh Soil|periodical=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8489024.stm|periodical=BBC News|date=2010-01-31|accessdate=2010-02-01|title=Kazakhs protest against China farmland lease|first=Rayhan|last=Demytrie}}</ref>

According to the 2012 sociological survey, higher tolerance to Chinese migrants is observed among ethnic minorities and Russians, those aged 18-29 and 30-39, and respondents with higher educational levels <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2016f\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=86}}</ref>. There is a popular perception that a large and rapidly growing number of Chinese people marry Kazakhstani citizens to obtain permanent residency in the country, but in fact, there were only 74 such marriages between 1991 and 2007.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2007|p=160}}</ref>

Founded in 1955 in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]] as an agency of the [[Bible Presbyterian Church]], Covenant College and [[Covenant Theological Seminary]] moved its campus to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] the following year. Following a split among the Bible Presbyterians, it became affiliated with the [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church (established 1956)|Bible Presbyterian Church-Columbus Synod]] (renamed the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in 1961). In 1964, it separated from the [[Covenant Theological Seminary|seminary]], moving to [[Lookout Mountain]], in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>William F. Hull, ''Lookout Mountain'', Arcadia Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|0738566446}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a_9BzBPDW50C&pg=PA94 p. 94.]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.covenant.edu/welcome/history.php |title=Covenant College History |accessdate=2007-08-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070719124605/http://www.covenant.edu/welcome/history.php |archivedate=2007-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1965, it was the site of the merger between the Evangelical Presbyterian Church and the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod]] to form the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod]].

==Campus==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2019}}
The campus is located at the top of [[Lookout Mountain]] in [[Dade County, Georgia]], near the city of [[Lookout Mountain, Georgia]], which is in [[Walker County, Georgia]].

===Carter Hall===
Carter Hall is the signature building on campus. It was originally named [[The Lookout Mountain Hotel]] and was built in 1928 by the Dinkler Hotel Corporation and run by [[Paul Carter (entrepreneur)|Paul Carter]], for whom the building is now named. It has been rumored, although not confirmed, that [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] spent their honeymoon there.<ref>https://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/10/5/309757/Covenant-College-Renovation-Latest.aspx</ref> It was popularly known as the \"Castle in the Clouds.\" However, since it was completed less than a year before the [[Great Depression]], the hotel soon went bankrupt. It opened and closed several times prior to 1960, when it shut down for the last time. Bill Brock, the grandfather of the college's fourth president, Frank Brock, served on the original board of the hotel.<ref>{{cite_book|chapter=The Spirit of the Mountain |chapterurl=http://oldmoneynewsouth.com/ |title=Old Money, New South  |author=Dean Arnold |publisher=Chattanooga Historical Foundation |year=2006}}</ref>

Both the exterior and interior of Carter Hall are Austro-Bavarian Gothic revival in style. The building has had two towers in its history. The first tower was similar in design to the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] (Cathedral of Our Lady) in Munich. Poor maintenance before acquisition by the college required it to be rebuilt. The new tower, though considerably simpler in style, maintains the architectural style of the original tower.  {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Covenant College bought the building in 1964, upon relocating to [[Lookout Mountain]]. During the first few years of Covenant's operation on the mountain, all the functions of the college were contained within Carter Hall. At that time, it housed the [[chapel]], the library, the classrooms, the professors' offices, dorm rooms, the dining hall, and administrative offices. Today, it has all of these except the library, as well as a snack bar and the campus bookstore, as well as the mailroom.<ref>https://www.covenant.edu/students/residence/carter</ref>

The current halls of Carter are 5th South and Borderlands (men's), 4th North, Central and South (women's), 3rd North, Central and South (women's), 2nd Central and 2nd South (men's).

From 2015 to 2017, Carter underwent significant renovations. They included improving the stucco, fixing insulation and moisture issues, and renovating the tower.<ref>https://archpaper.com/2018/01/rehabilitating-lookout-mountains-historic-castle-clouds/#gallery-0-slide-0</ref><ref>https://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/10/5/309757/Covenant-College-Renovation-Latest.aspx</ref>

===Founders Hall===
Founders Hall contains three wings, each named for members of the founding generation of Covenant College.

Belz Hall, the first to be built, was completed in 1972, is named after pastor and Christian educator Max Belz, a member of Covenant College's original board of trustees. Belz Hall houses approximately 100 students and was originally a men's dorm. In 1990 and 1993 two new wings were added to the structure, and the building was renamed Founders Residence Hall. Currently the dorm halls for Belz are as follows: Ekklesia (a men's hall on the main floor), Brethren (a men's hall on the second floor), 1st Belz (a men's hall on the first floor), and Catacombs (a men's floor on the basement level).

Schmidt Hall, completed in 1990, is named in honor of Rudy and Collyn Schmidt, co-founders and long-time friends of the college, involved in virtually every dimension of college life since its inception. The dorm halls in Schmidt include Balcony (a women's hall on the fourth floor), Jungle (a women's hall on the main floor), and Jubilee (a women's hall on the second floor).

Rayburn Hall was completed in 1993 and is named for Robert G. Rayburn, the founding president of Covenant College. The dorm halls in Rayburn include Highlands (a women's hall on the fourth floor), Gracewell (a women's hall on the main floor), and Blackwatch (a men's hall on the second floor).

===Maclellan/Rymer Hall===
The Maclellan wing of the hall, built in 1998, was named in honor of the Maclellan Foundation, a longtime supporter of Covenant College. The dorm halls in Maclellan wing of the building include Sutherland (a men's hall on the second floor), Suburbs (a men's hall on the third floor), Rowan (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Halcyon (a women's hall on the fifth floor).
The Rymer wing of the building, completed in 2000, was given by Ann Caudle Rymer and her son, S. Bradford Rymer, Jr. The dorm halls in the Rymer wing include The Five Points (a men's hall on the second floor), Lawrence (a men's hall on the third floor), Harambe! (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Chi Alpha (a women's hall on the fifth floor).

===Andreas Hall===
\"Andreas Hall, completed in 2007 as part of the BUILD campaign, is located slightly south of Maclellan/Rymer Hall, and is the newest addition to the college's residence halls. It is named for Lowell Andreas, a recent financial supporter of Covenant College. It houses over 100 students and is four stories tall.
The dorm halls in Andreas include Ithaca (a men's hall on the second floor), Bloodfield (a men's hall on the second floor), Ruhama (a women's hall on the third floor), Kallah (a women's hall on the third floor), The Fritz (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Imani (a women's hall on the fourth floor).\" (this whole paragraph was written by the fbi, its a complete lie. i repeat andreas does not exist, dont go to where they say the building andreas is, because its not there.)

==Campus==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2019}}
The campus is located at the top of [[Lookout Mountain]] in [[Dade County, Georgia]], near the city of [[Lookout Mountain, Georgia]], which is in [[Walker County, Georgia]].

===Carter Hall===
Carter Hall is the signature building on campus. It was originally named [[The Lookout Mountain Hotel]] and was built in 1928 by the Dinkler Hotel Corporation and run by [[Paul Carter (entrepreneur)|Paul Carter]], for whom the building is now named. It has been rumored, although not confirmed, that [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] spent their honeymoon there.<ref>https://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/10/5/309757/Covenant-College-Renovation-Latest.aspx</ref> It was popularly known as the \"Castle in the Clouds.\" However, since it was completed less than a year before the [[Great Depression]], the hotel soon went bankrupt. It opened and closed several times prior to 1960, when it shut down for the last time. Bill Brock, the grandfather of the college's fourth president, Frank Brock, served on the original board of the hotel.<ref>{{cite_book|chapter=The Spirit of the Mountain |chapterurl=http://oldmoneynewsouth.com/ |title=Old Money, New South  |author=Dean Arnold |publisher=Chattanooga Historical Foundation |year=2006}}</ref>

Both the exterior and interior of Carter Hall are Austro-Bavarian Gothic revival in style. The building has had two towers in its history. The first tower was similar in design to the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] (Cathedral of Our Lady) in Munich. Poor maintenance before acquisition by the college required it to be rebuilt. The new tower, though considerably simpler in style, maintains the architectural style of the original tower.  {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Covenant College bought the building in 1964, upon relocating to [[Lookout Mountain]]. During the first few years of Covenant's operation on the mountain, all the functions of the college were contained within Carter Hall. At that time, it housed the [[chapel]], the library, the classrooms, the professors' offices, dorm rooms, the dining hall, and administrative offices. Today, it has all of these except the library, as well as a snack bar and the campus bookstore, as well as the mailroom.<ref>https://www.covenant.edu/students/residence/carter</ref>

The current halls of Carter are 5th South and Borderlands (men's), 4th North, Central and South (women's), 3rd North, Central and South (women's), 2nd Central and 2nd South (men's).

From 2015 to 2017, Carter underwent significant renovations. They included improving the stucco, fixing insulation and moisture issues, and renovating the tower.<ref>https://archpaper.com/2018/01/rehabilitating-lookout-mountains-historic-castle-clouds/#gallery-0-slide-0</ref><ref>https://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/10/5/309757/Covenant-College-Renovation-Latest.aspx</ref>

===Founders Hall===
Founders Hall contains three wings, each named for members of the founding generation of Covenant College.

Belz Hall, the first to be built, was completed in 1972, is named after pastor and Christian educator Max Belz, a member of Covenant College's original board of trustees. Belz Hall houses approximately 100 students and was originally a men's dorm. In 1990 and 1993 two new wings were added to the structure, and the building was renamed Founders Residence Hall. Currently the dorm halls for Belz are as follows: Ekklesia (a men's hall on the main floor), Brethren (a men's hall on the second floor), 1st Belz (a men's hall on the first floor), and Catacombs (a men's floor on the basement level).

Schmidt Hall, completed in 1990, is named in honor of Rudy and Collyn Schmidt, co-founders and long-time friends of the college, involved in virtually every dimension of college life since its inception. The dorm halls in Schmidt include Balcony (a women's hall on the fourth floor), Jungle (a women's hall on the main floor), and Jubilee (a women's hall on the second floor).

Rayburn Hall was completed in 1993 and is named for Robert G. Rayburn, the founding president of Covenant College. The dorm halls in Rayburn include Highlands (a women's hall on the fourth floor), Gracewell (a women's hall on the main floor), and Blackwatch (a men's hall on the second floor).

===Maclellan/Rymer Hall===
The Maclellan wing of the hall, built in 1998, was named in honor of the Maclellan Foundation, a longtime supporter of Covenant College. The dorm halls in Maclellan wing of the building include Sutherland (a men's hall on the second floor), Suburbs (a men's hall on the third floor), Rowan (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Halcyon (a women's hall on the fifth floor).
The Rymer wing of the building, completed in 2000, was given by Ann Caudle Rymer and her son, S. Bradford Rymer, Jr. The dorm halls in the Rymer wing include The Five Points (a men's hall on the second floor), Lawrence (a men's hall on the third floor), Harambe! (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Chi Alpha (a women's hall on the fifth floor).

===Andreas Hall===
Andreas Hall, completed in 2007 as part of the BUILD campaign, is located slightly south of Maclellan/Rymer Hall, and is the newest addition to the college's residence halls. It is named for Lowell Andreas, a recent financial supporter of Covenant College. It houses over 100 students and is four stories tall.
The dorm halls in Andreas include Ithaca (a men's hall on the second floor), Bloodfield (a men's hall on the second floor), Ruhama (a women's hall on the third floor), Kallah (a women's hall on the third floor), The Fritz (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Imani (a women's hall on the fourth floor).

The '''3rd Regiment, Vermont Volunteer Infantry''' (or 3rd VVI) was a three-years infantry regiment in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI Corps]], [[Army of the Potomac]], from July 1861 to July 1865. It was a member of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

==History==
[[File:Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde (1831-1918) of the 3rd Vermont Infantry.jpg|thumb|Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde of the 3rd Vermont Infantry]]
In July 1861, the [[United States Congress]] authorized President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to call out 500,000 men, to serve for three years unless sooner discharged. The 3rd Vermont Infantry was the second of the three years regiments from the state placed in the field as a result of this call. It was organized from militia companies from [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]], [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury (Wells River)]], [[Charleston, Vermont|Charleston]], [[Johnson, Vermont|Johnson]], [[Hartford, Vermont|Hartford]], [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St.Johnsbury]], [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], [[Guildhall, Vermont|Guidhall]], and [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] and [[Calais, Vermont|Calais]].

Governor [[Erastus Fairbanks]]' first choices to command the regiment were Colonel [[John W. Phelps]], soon to relinquish his command of the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], Captain [[Truman Seymour]], 4th U.S. Artillery, a native Vermonter who had been present at the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], and Captain A. V. Colburn, U.S. Army, who later became Assistant Adjutant General of the [[Army of the Potomac]] under General [[George B. McClellan]]. Phelps, however, was serving as commandant of the post at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and the offers to Seymour and Colburn were declined.

The regiment rendezvoused at St. Johnsbury, on the ground of the [[Caledonia County]] Agricultural Society at \"Camp Baxter,\" named in honor of Adjutant and Inspector General [[H. Henry Baxter]]. The regiment mustered into United States service on July 16, 1861, and departed for [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 24, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Breed N. Hyde]]. At [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the regiment's commander, Colonel [[William Farrar Smith]], joined them.

The regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 1861, and on July 27, marched up the Potomac to the [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]], where they built \"[[Fort Lyon (Virginia)|Camp Lyon]].\" They joined at that site the [[6th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th Maine Infantry]], [[Mott's Battery]] and a company of cavalry. By August 12, the [[2nd Vermont Infantry]] and the [[33rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|33rd New York Infantry]] had joined them. 

Major [[Walter W. Cochran]], of [[Bellows Falls]], resigned his commission on August 6 due to a severe attack of fever and ague. Captain [[Wheelock G. Veazey]], of Company A, replaced him. On August 13, Colonel Smith was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers, and Hyde replaced him, now as a full colonel. Veazey was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain [[Thomas O. Seaver]], of Company F, was promoted to major. 

[[File:William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel).jpg|thumb|Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]] of Groton, Vt., better known as [[The Sleeping Sentinel]].]]
It was also here that Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]], known to history as [[the Sleeping Sentinel]], was found asleep at his post on August 31, court-martialed, and sentenced to be executed.  President Lincoln heard about the case, pardoned Scott, and returned him to his unit. William Scott was actually standing before a firing squad when the death sentence and pardon were both read, however no one had told him that he had been pardoned prior to being sent to the firing squad.  Scott later was killed in action at the [[Battle of Lee's Mills]].

On September 3, the units crossed the Chain Bridge, and occupied \"Camp Advance,\" {{convert|1|mi}} in advance of the bridge.  On September 9, Private Scott was scheduled to be executed, but during the proceedings, after the death sentence had been read, a pardon was read, sparing his life. In 1997, the original court-martial and pardon papers were discovered, and authenticated, bringing to an end the controversy over whether President Lincoln had personally signed the pardon, which it turned out he did.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/10/news/asleep-at-his-post-to-be-shot.html]</ref> Scott served faithfully with his regiment until the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], where he was mortally wounded, and was buried in the [[Colonial National Historical Park|national cemetery at Yorktown]].

On September 11, the regiment participated in a reconnaissance to and beyond [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], where it engaged Confederate skirmishers. Returning to the camp, the regiment came under fire from Rosser's battery. A shell fell within the ranks of Company C, killing Private Amos Meserve, mortally wounding William H. Colburn, and injuring five others. On September 25, the regiment participated in another reconnaissance to Lewinsville, but suffered no casualties. Quartermaster [[Redfield Proctor]] resigned from the regiment on this date to accept appointment as Major of the [[5th Vermont Infantry]].

During the next two weeks, the 4th and 5th Vermont regiments joined Smith's division. On October 9, the Vermont regiments moved to Camp Griffin, about four miles from Chain Bridge. Here, on October 24, the [[6th Vermont Infantry]] arrived, completing the initial organization of the \"Old [[Vermont Brigade]].\" 

The history of the regiment from this point on is essentially that of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

The original members of the regiment, who did not reenlist, were mustered out of the service on July 27, 1864. Veterans and recruits were consolidated into six companies, July 25, 1864. One year recruits and others whose term of service was due to expire prior to October 1, 1865, were mustered out on June 19, 1865. The remaining officers and men mustered out of service on July 11.

==Medal of Honor==

Six members of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].

* Alexander M. Beattie, Captain, Co. F, \" removed, under a hot fire, a wounded member of his command to a place of safety,\" at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], June 5, 1864.
* Gardner C. Hawkins, 1st Lieutenant, Co. E, \"when the lines were wavering from the well-directed fire of the enemy, this officer, acting adjutant of the regiment, sprang forward, and with encouraging words cheered the soldiers on and, although dangerously wounded, refused to leave the field until the enemy's works were taken,\" at the [[Battle of Petersburg]], on April 2, 1865.
* [[Willie Johnston (Medal of Honor recipient)|Willie Johnston]], Musician Company D, 3rd Vermont Infantry The second Medal of Honor ever awarded.
* Samuel E. Pingree, Captain, Co. F, \"gallantly led his Co. across a wide, deep creek, drove the enemy from the rifle pits, which were within 2 yards of the farther bank, and remained at the head of his men until a second time severely wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Julian Scott|Julian A. Scott]], Drummer, Co. E, \"crossed the creek under a terrific fire of musketry several times to assist in bringing off the wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Thomas O. Seaver]], Colonel, while \"at the head of 3 regiments and under a most galling fire, attacked and occupied the enemy's works,\" at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania]], May 10, 1864.

The '''3rd Regiment, Vermont Volunteer Infantry''' (or 3rd VVI) was a three-years infantry regiment in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI Corps]], [[Army of the Potomac]], from July 1861 to July 1865. It was a member of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

==History==
[[File:Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde (1831-1918) of the 3rd Vermont Infantry.jpg|thumb|Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde of the 3rd Vermont Infantry]]
In July 1861, the [[United States Congress]] authorized President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to call out 500,000 men, to serve for three years unless sooner discharged. The 3rd Vermont Infantry was the second of the three years regiments from the state placed in the field as a result of this call. It was organized from militia companies from [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]], [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury (Wells River)]], [[Charleston, Vermont|Charleston]], [[Johnson, Vermont|Johnson]], [[Hartford, Vermont|Hartford]], [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St.Johnsbury]], [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], [[Guildhall, Vermont|Guidhall]], and [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] and [[Calais, Vermont|Calais]].

Governor [[Erastus Fairbanks]]' first choices to command the regiment were Colonel [[John W. Phelps]], soon to relinquish his command of the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], Captain [[Truman Seymour]], 4th U.S. Artillery, a native Vermonter who had been present at the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], and Captain A. V. Colburn, U.S. Army, who later became Assistant Adjutant General of the [[Army of the Potomac]] under General [[George B. McClellan]]. Phelps, however, was serving as commandant of the post at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and the offers to Seymour and Colburn were declined.

The regiment rendezvoused at St. Johnsbury, on the ground of the [[Caledonia County]] Agricultural Society at \"Camp Baxter,\" named in honor of Adjutant and Inspector General [[H. Henry Baxter]]. The regiment mustered into United States service on July 16, 1861, and departed for [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 24, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Breed N. Hyde]]. At [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the regiment's commander, Colonel [[William Farrar Smith]], joined them.

The regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 1861, and on July 27, marched up the Potomac to the [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]], where they built \"[[Fort Lyon (Virginia)|Camp Lyon]].\" They joined at that site the [[6th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th Maine Infantry]], [[Mott's Battery]] and a company of cavalry. By August 12, the [[2nd Vermont Infantry]] and the [[33rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|33rd New York Infantry]] had joined them. 

Major [[Walter W. Cochran]], of [[Bellows Falls]], resigned his commission on August 6 due to a severe attack of fever and ague. Captain [[Wheelock G. Veazey]], of Company A, replaced him. On August 13, Colonel Smith was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers, and Hyde replaced him, now as a full colonel. Veazey was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain [[Thomas O. Seaver]], of Company F, was promoted to major. 

[[File:William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel).jpg|thumb|Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]] of Groton, Vt., better known as [[The Sleeping Sentinel]].]]
It was also here that Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]], known to history as [[the Sleeping Sentinel]], was found asleep at his post on August 31, court-martialed, and sentenced to be executed.  President Lincoln heard about the case, pardoned Scott, and returned him to his unit. William Scott was actually standing before a firing squad when the death sentence and pardon were both read, however no one had told him that he had been pardoned prior to being sent to the firing squad.  Scott later was killed in action at the [[Battle of Lee's Mills]].

On September 3, the units crossed the Chain Bridge, and occupied \"Camp Advance,\" {{convert|1|mi}} in advance of the bridge.  On September 9, Private Scott was scheduled to be executed, but during the proceedings, after the death sentence had been read, a pardon was read, sparing his life. In 1997, the original court-martial and pardon papers were discovered, and authenticated, bringing to an end the controversy over whether President Lincoln had personally signed the pardon, which it turned out he did.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/10/news/asleep-at-his-post-to-be-shot.html]</ref> Scott served faithfully with his regiment until the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], where he was mortally wounded, and was buried in the [[Colonial National Historical Park|national cemetery at Yorktown]].

On September 11, the regiment participated in a reconnaissance to and beyond [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], where it engaged Confederate skirmishers. Returning to the camp, the regiment came under fire from Rosser's battery. A shell fell within the ranks of Company C, killing Private Amos Meserve, mortally wounding William H. Colburn, and injuring five others. On September 25, the regiment participated in another reconnaissance to Lewinsville, but suffered no casualties. Quartermaster [[Redfield Proctor]] resigned from the regiment on this date to accept appointment as Major of the [[5th Vermont Infantry]].

During the next two weeks, the 4th and 5th Vermont regiments joined Smith's division. On October 9, the Vermont regiments moved to Camp Griffin, about four miles from Chain Bridge. Here, on October 24, the [[6th Vermont Infantry]] arrived, completing the initial organization of the \"Old [[Vermont Brigade]].\" 

The history of the regiment from this point on is essentially that of the [[Vermont Brigade]].

The original members of the regiment, who did not reenlist, were mustered out of the service on July 27, 1864. Veterans and recruits were consolidated into six companies, July 25, 1864. One year recruits and others whose term of service was due to expire prior to October 1, 1865, were mustered out on June 19, 1865. The remaining officers and men mustered out of service on July 11.

==Medal of Honor==

Six members of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].

* Alexander M. Beattie, Captain, Co. F, \" removed, under a hot fire, a wounded member of his command to a place of safety,\" at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], June 5, 1864.
* Gardner C. Hawkins, 1st Lieutenant, Co. E, \"when the lines were wavering from the well-directed fire of the enemy, this officer, acting adjutant of the regiment, sprang forward, and with encouraging words cheered the soldiers on and, although dangerously wounded, refused to leave the field until the enemy's works were taken,\" at the [[Battle of Petersburg]], on April 2, 1865.
* [[Willie Johnston (Medal of Honor recipient)|Willie Johnston]], Musician Company D, 3rd Vermont Infantry The second Medal of Honor ever awarded.
* Samuel E. Pingree, Captain, Co. F, \"gallantly led his Co. across a wide, deep creek, drove the enemy from the rifle pits, which were within 2 yards of the farther bank, and remained at the head of his men until a second time severely wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Julian Scott|Julian A. Scott]], Drummer, Co. E, \"crossed the creek under a terrific fire of musketry several times to assist in bringing off the wounded,\" at the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], April 16, 1862.
* [[Thomas O. Seaver]], Colonel, while \"at the head of 3 regiments and under a most galling fire, attacked and occupied the enemy's works,\" at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania]], May 10, 1864.

On 14 March, 7 cases confirmed in the country. Five of the new confirmed cases have had direct contact with the first two cases.

On March 24, the Burkina Faso Ministry of Health confirmed 114 cases of COVID-19 in Burkina Faso, 89 in [[Ouagadougou]], 4 in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]], 2 in [[Dedougou]], 2 in [[Boromo]], and 1 in [[Houndé]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wakatsera.com/coronavirus-au-burkina-64-cas-trois-deces/|title=Coronavirus au Burkina: 114 cas, quatre décès et sept guerris|last=Boureima|date=2020-03-24|website=Wakat Séra|language=fr-FR|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>

On March 30, with 12 deaths, Burkina Faso has the most fatalities in sub-Saharan Africa. Burkina Faso has just one hospital currently configured to receive coronavirus patients, and it only has a handful of ventilators. At least six government ministers have since tested positive for the virus, as have two foreign ambassadors, from Italy and the United States. A single testing laboratory in Bobo-Dioulasso – a five-hour drive from the capital of Ouagdougou – means suspected cases all over the country have to wait at least 12 hours for results. The government said it wants to establish a second laboratory in Ouagadougou but has no one qualified to set up the equipment in the country. With borders sealed, the process of bringing in an outsider is being delayed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/2020/03/30/burkina-faso-coronavirus-crisis|title=Coronavirus in crisis-hit Burkina Faso|date=2020-03-30|website=The New Humanitarian|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

Water shortages are a particular challenge in Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso's coronavirus curfew stopped those in poor areas from accessing communal fountains that only flow at night in the dry season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-04-10/coronavirus-curfew-creates-water-shortage-for-burkina-fasos-poorest|title=Coronavirus Curfew Creates Water Shortage for Burkina Faso's Poorest|last=Prentice|first=Alessandra|date=April 10, 2020|website=US News & World Report|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 Apr 2020}}</ref> A lack of water also makes washing hands and general hygiene difficult. In the past year, armed groups have devastated villages in the north and east of Burkina Faso, leaving more than 800,000 people displaced. They have fled to urban centers or sites designated for internally displaced people (IDPs), where overcrowding and lack of access to water are huge problems for families and host communities. Hygiene measures, such as frequent hand washing with soap and water, wearing a mask, and social distancing don't translate into reality for displaced people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/stories/water-engineer-tries-work-miracles-burkina-faso-midst-coronavirus-crisis/|title=A water engineer tries to work miracles in Burkina Faso in the midst of the coronavirus crisis|website=www.oxfamamerica.org|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>

Approximately 350,000 people in [[Burkina Faso]] urgently need access to sufficient water and shelter facilities to aid them in coping desert-like conditions faced in the isolated parts of Burkina Faso. The [[UN Refugee Agency]] warned of more lives to possibly fall at risk in the Burkina Faso Centre Nord and Sahel regions. These places have been pointed out as they shelter hundreds of people displaced from their homes, including small children.<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2020/4/5e8c3b614/unhcr-warns-chronic-lack-resources-contributing-new-crisis-burkina-faso.html|title=UNHCR warns chronic lack of resources contributing to new crisis in Burkina Faso|accessdate=7 April 2020|website=UNHCR}}</ref>

On March 24, the Burkina Faso Ministry of Health confirmed 114 cases of COVID-19 in Burkina Faso, 89 in [[Ouagadougou]], 4 in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]], 2 in [[Dedougou]], 2 in [[Boromo]], and 1 in [[Houndé]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wakatsera.com/coronavirus-au-burkina-64-cas-trois-deces/|title=Coronavirus au Burkina: 114 cas, quatre décès et sept guerris|last=Boureima|date=2020-03-24|website=Wakat Séra|language=fr-FR|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>

On March 30, with 12 deaths, Burkina Faso has the most fatalities in sub-Saharan Africa. Burkina Faso has just one hospital currently configured to receive coronavirus patients, and it only has a handful of ventilators. At least six government ministers have since tested positive for the virus, as have two foreign ambassadors, from Italy and the United States. A single testing laboratory in Bobo-Dioulasso – a five-hour drive from the capital of Ouagdougou – means suspected cases all over the country have to wait at least 12 hours for results. The government said it wants to establish a second laboratory in Ouagadougou but has no one qualified to set up the equipment in the country. With borders sealed, the process of bringing in an outsider is being delayed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/2020/03/30/burkina-faso-coronavirus-crisis|title=Coronavirus in crisis-hit Burkina Faso|date=2020-03-30|website=The New Humanitarian|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

Water shortages are a particular challenge in Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso's coronavirus curfew stopped those in poor areas from accessing communal fountains that only flow at night in the dry season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-04-10/coronavirus-curfew-creates-water-shortage-for-burkina-fasos-poorest|title=Coronavirus Curfew Creates Water Shortage for Burkina Faso's Poorest|last=Prentice|first=Alessandra|date=April 10, 2020|website=US News & World Report|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 Apr 2020}}</ref> A lack of water also makes washing hands and general hygiene difficult. In the past year, armed groups have devastated villages in the north and east of Burkina Faso, leaving more than 800,000 people displaced. They have fled to urban centers or sites designated for internally displaced people (IDPs), where overcrowding and lack of access to water are huge problems for families and host communities. Hygiene measures, such as frequent hand washing with soap and water, wearing a mask, and social distancing don’t translate into reality for displaced people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/stories/water-engineer-tries-work-miracles-burkina-faso-midst-coronavirus-crisis/|title=A water engineer tries to work miracles in Burkina Faso in the midst of the coronavirus crisis|website=www.oxfamamerica.org|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>

Approximately 350,000 people in [[Burkina Faso]] urgently need access to sufficient water and shelter facilities to aid them in coping desert-like conditions faced in the isolated parts of Burkina Faso. The [[UN Refugee Agency]] warned of more lives to possibly fall at risk in the Burkina Faso Centre Nord and Sahel regions. These places have been pointed out as they shelter hundreds of people displaced from their homes, including small children.<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2020/4/5e8c3b614/unhcr-warns-chronic-lack-resources-contributing-new-crisis-burkina-faso.html|title=UNHCR warns chronic lack of resources contributing to new crisis in Burkina Faso|accessdate=7 April 2020|website=UNHCR}}</ref>

She subsequently made appearances in films such as ''[[A Vacation in Hell]]'', ''[[Licence to Kill]]'', ''[[Mallrats]]'', ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'', and the television series ''[[Jane the Virgin]]''<ref name=AllMovie>[http://www.allmovie.com/artist/p4034 \"Priscilla Barnes\"], AllMovie.com; retrieved August 12, 2013.</ref>and ''[[Highway To Heaven]]''.

==Early life==
Barnes was born December 7, 1954 (some sources list 1952 or 1955) in [[Fort Dix, New Jersey]],<ref>[https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/barnes-priscilla-1952-joann-witty \"Barnes, Priscilla 1952(?)– (Joann Witty)\"].

After graduating from [[Antelope Valley High School]] at age 17, she relocated to [[San Diego]], working as a waitress and a dancer.<ref name=People/>

==Career==
===Early career===
Barnes' first break came when [[Bob Hope]] saw her in a local fashion show and invited her to join his troupe for a 1973 performance at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] She subsequently moved to [[Los Angeles]] to attempt a career in show business in earnest.<ref name=People/> She appeared as an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]] in ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|The New Original Wonder Woman]]'' alongside [[Lynda Carter]] as the title character. Her second break came at 19 when she met [[Peter Falk]] at Pips. Six months later he gave her a one-line part in an episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', which led to a series of bit parts in films like ''[[The Seniors]]'' (1978) and ''Delta Fox'' (1979).

While working as a hostess at a Hollywood nightclub, Barnes posed nude for the \"Pet of the Month\" photo layout in the March 1976 issue of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine under the pseudonym '''Joann Witty'''. ''Penthouse'' later wanted to republish the photos under Barnes' real name in 1982 after she had become famous in ''Three's Company''. The dispute ended up in court, as Penthouse wanted a judge to rule on the legality of publishing the pictures using her real name. At issue was a handwritten addendum to the standard model release contract that all models sign. When Penthouse lost the initial case, they appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal court mostly sided with Barnes and ruled that the handwritten addendum was legally binding and that Penthouse could not republish the photos using her real name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/792/f2d/943/penthouse-international-ltd-v-barnes|title=Penthouse International, Ltd, a New York Corporation,plaintiff/appellant, v.

In 1980, Barnes landed a supporting role in ''[[Sunday Lovers]]''.<ref name=People/>

===''Three's Company''===
In 1981, Barnes was cast as Terri Alden on ''[[Three's Company]]'' after [[Jenilee Harrison]] served as interim replacement to [[Suzanne Somers]], who had left the series as a result of contractual dispute with producers. The part, which is Barnes' most notable role, brought her instant public recognition. 

In the 1998 TV program ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'', Barnes called ''Three's Company'' the \"three worst years\" of her life. Barnes revealed that after shooting a couple of episodes of the show, she felt \"uncomfortable\" on the set and asked, unsuccessfully, to be released from her contract. 

She remained friends with co-stars [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Richard Kline]], with whom she made public appearances.<ref>''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]: Three's Company''.

'''Priscilla Anne Barnes''' (born December 7, 1954) is an American actress, who may be best known in her role as [[Terri Alden]] on ''[[Three's Company]]'', the permanent replacement for [[Suzanne Somers]]. She subsequently made appearances in films such as ''[[A Vacation in Hell]]'', ''[[Licence to Kill]]'', ''[[Mallrats]]'', ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'', and the television series ''[[Jane the Virgin]]''<ref name=AllMovie>[http://www.allmovie.com/artist/p4034 \"Priscilla Barnes\"], AllMovie.com; retrieved August 12, 2013.</ref>and ''[[Highway To Heaven]]''.

==Early life==
Barnes was born December 7, 1954 (some sources list 1952 or 1955) in [[Fort Dix, New Jersey]],<ref>[https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/barnes-priscilla-1952-joann-witty \"Barnes, Priscilla 1952(?)– (Joann Witty)\"].

Vol. 16, No. 24|date=December 14, 1981}}</ref> the third of four children of a father who was a major in the [[United States Air Force]] and her mother a homemaker. Her childhood was marked by a series of moves across various military bases in the United States before her family settled in [[Lancaster, California]]. After graduating from [[Antelope Valley High School]] at age 17, she relocated to [[San Diego]], working as a waitress and a dancer.<ref name=People/>

==Career==
===Early career===
Barnes' first break came when [[Bob Hope]] saw her in a local fashion show and invited her to join his troupe for a 1973 performance at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] She subsequently moved to [[Los Angeles]] to attempt a career in show business in earnest.<ref name=People/> She appeared as an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]] in ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|The New Original Wonder Woman]]'' alongside [[Lynda Carter]] as the title character. Her second break came at 19 when she met [[Peter Falk]] at Pips. Six months later he gave her a one-line part in an episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', which led to a series of bit parts in films like ''[[The Seniors]]'' (1978) and ''Delta Fox'' (1979).

While working as a hostess at a Hollywood nightclub, Barnes posed nude for the \"Pet of the Month\" photo layout in the March 1976 issue of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine under the pseudonym '''Joann Witty'''. ''Penthouse'' later wanted to republish the photos under Barnes' real name in 1982 after she had become famous in ''Three's Company''. The dispute ended up in court, as Penthouse wanted a judge to rule on the legality of publishing the pictures using her real name. At issue was a handwritten addendum to the standard model release contract that all models sign. When Penthouse lost the initial case, they appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal court mostly sided with Barnes and ruled that the handwritten addendum was legally binding and that Penthouse could not republish the photos using her real name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/792/f2d/943/penthouse-international-ltd-v-barnes|title=Penthouse International, Ltd, a New York Corporation,plaintiff/appellant, v.

In 1980, Barnes landed a supporting role in ''[[Sunday Lovers]]''.<ref name=People/>

===''Three's Company''===
In 1981, Barnes was cast as Terri Alden on ''[[Three's Company]]'' after [[Jenilee Harrison]] served as interim replacement to [[Suzanne Somers]], who had left the series as a result of contractual dispute with producers. The part, which is Barnes' most notable role, brought her instant public recognition. 

In the 1998 TV program ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'', Barnes called ''Three's Company'' the \"three worst years\" of her life. Barnes revealed that after shooting a couple of episodes of the show, she felt \"uncomfortable\" on the set and asked, unsuccessfully, to be released from her contract. 

She remained friends with co-stars [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Richard Kline]], with whom she made public appearances.<ref>''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]: Three's Company''.

'''Adolph Zukor''' (January 7, 1873 – June 10, 1976)<ref name=ANBO>{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Matthew|title=Zukor, Adolph|work=American National Biography Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=February 2000}}</ref> was an Austro-Hungarian-born American film producer best known as one of the three founders of [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"WVobit\">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'' (June 16, 1976), p. 76.</ref>

==Early life==
Zukor was born to a [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Ricse]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], which was then a part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Empire. At a young age he became an orphan so he decided to immigrate to the US. He sailed from [[Hamburg]] on the s/s Rugia on March 1<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/hamburgpl_full/?name=Adolf_Zucker&birth=1873&birth_x=0-0-0&departure=1891-3-1&departure_x=0-0-0&name_x=1_1|title=Ancestry. Com|last=Passenger list}}</ref> and arrived in New York City under the name '''Adolf Zuckery''' on March 16, 1891.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/categories/40/?name=Adolf_Zuckery&birth=1873&arrival=1891-3_new+york+city-new+york-usa_1652382&arrival_x=_1-0&birth_x=0&name_x=1_1|title=Ancestry.com|last=1891 passenger list}}</ref> Like most immigrants, he began modestly. After having landed in New York City, he started working in an [[upholstery]] shop. A friend then got him a job as an apprentice at a [[furrier]].

Zukor stayed in New York City for two years. When he left to become a \"contract\" worker, sewing fur pieces and selling them himself, he was twenty years old and an accomplished designer. He was young and adventuresome, and the 1893 [[Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] drew him to the Midwest. There he started a fur business. In the second season of operation, Zukor's Novelty Fur Company expanded to 25 men and opened a branch.<ref name=\"gabler\">{{cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=An empire of their own: how the Jews invented Hollywood|year=1988|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-56808-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/empireoftheirown00gabl/page/16 16]|edition=1st|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/empireoftheirown00gabl/page/16}}</ref>

Historian [[Neal Gabler]] wrote, \"one of the stubborn fallacies of movie history is that the men who created the film industry were all impoverished young vulgarians...\" Zukor clearly didn't fit this profile. By 1903, he already looked and lived like a wealthy young [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]], and he certainly earned the income of one. He had a commodious apartment at 111th Street and Seventh Avenue in [[New York City]]'s wealthy German-Jewish section\".<ref name=\"gabler\"/>

In 1918, he moved to [[New City, New York|New City, Rockland County, New York]], where he purchased 300 acres of land from [[Lawrence Abraham]], heir to the A&S Department Stores. Abraham had already built a sizable house, a nine-hole golf course and a swimming pool on this property. Two years later, Zukor bought an additional 500 acres, built a night house, guest house, movie theater, locker room, greenhouses, garages, staff quarters and hired golf architect [[A.W. Tillinghast]] to build an 18-hole championship golf course. Today, Zukor's estate is the private [[Paramount Country Club]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trager|first=James|title=The people's chronology: a year-by-year record of human events from prehistory to the present|url=https://archive.org/details/mes00jame|url-access=registration|year=1979|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=Austin, Texas, United States|page=[https://archive.org/details/mes00jame/page/823 823]}}</ref>

==Early movie career==
In 1903, he became involved in the [[film|motion picture]] industry when his cousin, Max Goldstein, approached him for a loan to invest in a chain of theaters. These theaters were started by [[Mitchell Mark]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] and hosted [[Edisonia Hall]]. Mark needed investors to expand his chain of theaters. Zukor gave Goldstein the loan and formed a partnership with Mark and Morris Kohn, a friend of Zukor's who also invested in the theaters. Zukor, Mark, and Kohn opened a [[Amusement arcade#Penny arcade|penny arcade]] operating as The [[Automatic Vaudeville Company]] on 14th Street in New York City. They soon opened branches in [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], with funding by [[Marcus Loew]].<ref>Albin Krebs, [https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0107.html \"Adolph Zukor Is Dead at 103; Built Paramount Movie Empire\"], ''The New York Times'', June 11, 1976</ref><ref>Ed Solero, [http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/17576 \"Crystal Hall\"], ''Cinema Treasures''</ref>

In 1912, Adolph Zukor established [[Famous Players Film Company]]—advertising \"Famous Players in Famous Plays\"—as the American distribution company for the [[France|French]] film production ''[[Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth]]'' starring [[Sarah Bernhardt]].<ref name=\"TIMWU2010\">[[Tim Wu|Wu, Tim]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iM6sos2U554C&printsec=frontcover ''The Master Switch : The Rise and Fall of Information Empires''], New York : Alfred A.

Their primary goal was to bring noted stage actors to the screen and Zukor went on to produce ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1913 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1913). He purchased an [[Armory (military)|armory]] on 26th Street in Manhattan and converted it into [[Chelsea Studios]], a movie studio that is still used today.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231&dq=%22221+West+26th%22&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22221%20West%2026th%22&f=false New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York - Richard Alleman - Broadway (February 1, 2005)] {{ISBN|0-7679-1634-4}}</ref>

In 1916, the company merged with [[Jesse L. Lasky]]'s company to form [[Famous Players-Lasky]].

==Paramount Pictures==
The [[Paramount Pictures Corporation]] was formed to distribute films made by Famous Players-Lasky, and a dozen smaller companies pulled into Zukor's corporate giant. The consolidations led to the formation of a nationwide film distribution system.

In 1917, Zukor acquired 50% of [[Lewis J. Selznick]]'s Select Pictures which led Selznick's publicity to wane. Later, however, Selznick bought out Zukor's share of Select Pictures.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety109-1933-01#page/n283/mode/1up|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Lewis J. Selznick|date=January 31, 1933|page=2}}</ref>

Zukor shed most of his early partners; the Frohman brothers, Hodkinson and Goldwyn were out by 1917.

In 1919, the company bought 135 theaters in the Southern states, making the producing concern the first that guaranteed exhibition of its own product in its own theaters.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0107.html |title=Adolph Zukor Is Dead at 103; Built Paramount Movie Empire |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2019-09-14}}</ref> He revolutionized the film industry by organizing production, distribution, and exhibition within a single company.

Zukor believed in stars.  He signed many of the leading early stars, including [[Mary Pickford]], [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle]], Marguerite Clark, Pauline Frederick, Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, and Wallace Reid. With so many important players, Zukor also pioneered \"[[Block booking|Block Booking]]\" for Paramount Pictures, which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star's films had to buy a year's worth of other Paramount productions. It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s, but which led the government to pursue it on antitrust grounds for more than 20 years.

Zukor was the driving force behind Paramount's success. Through the teens and twenties, he also built the Publix Theatres Corporation, a chain of nearly 2000 screens. He also ran two production studios, one in Astoria, New York (now the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]]) and the other in Hollywood, California.

In 1926, Zukor hired independent producer B. P. Schulberg, who had an unerring eye for new talent, to run the new West Coast operations. They purchased the Robert Brunton Studios, a 26-acre facility at 5451 Marathon Street for US$1 million.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> In 1927, Famous Players-Lasky took the name Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation. Three years later, because of the importance of the Publix Theatres, it became Paramount Publix Corporation.

Zukor was now turning out 60 features a year. He made deals to show them all in theaters controlled by [[Loew's|Loew's Enterprises]], and also continued to add more theaters to his own chain. By 1920 he was in a position to charge what he wished for film rentals. Thus he pioneered the concept, now the accepted practice in the film industry, by which the distributor charges the exhibitor a percentage of box-office receipts.

Zukor, ever the impresario,  bought a huge plot of ground at Broadway and 43d Street, over objections of his board of directors, to build the Paramount Theater and office building, a 39-story building that had its grand opening in 1926. He managed to keep stars like Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson, and most important of all, Mary Pickford, under contract and happy to stay at Paramount.   At one point Miss Pickford told Zukor: \"You know, for years I've dreamed of making $20,000 a year before I was 20, and I'll be 20 very soon.\"

\"I could take a hint,\" Zukor recalled wryly. \"She got the $20,000, and before long I was paying her $100,000 a year. Mary was a terrific businessman.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>

Zukor was, primarily, also a businessman. \"He did not take the same personal, down-to-the-last-detail interest in the making of his movies that producer-executives such as Samuel Goldwyn and Louis B. Mayer did,\" wrote ''The New York Times'' in Zukor's obit at the age of 103.   He became an early investor in radio, taking a 50 percent interest in the new [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] in 1928, but selling it within a few years.

Partner Lasky hung on until 1932,  when Paramount nearly collapsed in the Depression years, and he was blamed for this and tossed out.  The following year, Paramount went into receivership.  Zukor's over-expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases were ultimately at fault. A bank-mandated reorganization team kept the company intact, and, miraculously, Zukor was kept on. In 1935, Paramount-Publix theater chain went bankrupt. In 1936, Barney Balaban became president, and Zukor was bumped up to chairman of the board. In this role, Zukor reorganized the company as Paramount Pictures, Inc. and was able to successfully bring the studio out of bankruptcy.

He eventually spent most of his time in New York, but spent the winter months in  Hollywood to check on his studio.  He served as president until 1936 when he was elevated to chairman of the board. He retired from Paramount Pictures in 1959 and in 1964 stepped down as chairman and assumed Chairman Emeritus status,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875915,00.html |title=Personalities: Jun. 12, 1964 - TIME |publisher=Content.time.com |date=1964-06-12 |accessdate=2019-09-14}}</ref> a position he held up until his death at the age of 103 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

'''Adolph Zukor''' (January 7, 1873 – June 10, 1976)<ref name=ANBO>{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Matthew|title=Zukor, Adolph|work=American National Biography Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=February 2000}}</ref> was an Austro-Hungarian-born American film producer best known as one of the three founders of [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"WVobit\">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'' (June 16, 1976), p. 76.</ref>

==Early life==
Zukor was born to a [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Ricse]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], which was then a part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Empire. At a young age he became an orphan so he decided to immigrate to the US. He sailed from [[Hamburg]] on the s/s Rugia on March 1<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/hamburgpl_full/?name=Adolf_Zucker&birth=1873&birth_x=0-0-0&departure=1891-3-1&departure_x=0-0-0&name_x=1_1|title=Ancestry. Com|last=Passenger list}}</ref> and arrived in New York City under the name '''Adolf Zuckery''' on March 16, 1891.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/categories/40/?name=Adolf_Zuckery&birth=1873&arrival=1891-3_new+york+city-new+york-usa_1652382&arrival_x=_1-0&birth_x=0&name_x=1_1|title=Ancestry.com|last=1891 passenger list}}</ref> Like most immigrants, he began modestly. After having landed in New York City, he started working in an [[upholstery]] shop. A friend then got him a job as an apprentice at a [[furrier]].

Zukor stayed in New York City for two years. When he left to become a \"contract\" worker, sewing fur pieces and selling them himself, he was twenty years old and an accomplished designer. He was young and adventuresome, and the 1893 [[Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] drew him to the Midwest. There he started a fur business. In the second season of operation, Zukor's Novelty Fur Company expanded to 25 men and opened a branch.<ref name=\"gabler\">{{cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=An empire of their own: how the Jews invented Hollywood|year=1988|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-56808-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/empireoftheirown00gabl/page/16 16]|edition=1st|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/empireoftheirown00gabl/page/16}}</ref>

Historian [[Neal Gabler]] wrote, \"one of the stubborn fallacies of movie history is that the men who created the film industry were all impoverished young vulgarians...\" Zukor clearly didn't fit this profile. By 1903, he already looked and lived like a wealthy young [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]], and he certainly earned the income of one. He had a commodious apartment at 111th Street and Seventh Avenue in [[New York City]]'s wealthy German-Jewish section\".<ref name=\"gabler\"/>

In 1918, he moved to [[New City, New York|New City, Rockland County, New York]], where he purchased 300 acres of land from [[Lawrence Abraham]], heir to the A&S Department Stores. Abraham had already built a sizable house, a nine-hole golf course and a swimming pool on this property. Two years later, Zukor bought an additional 500 acres, built a night house, guest house, movie theater, locker room, greenhouses, garages, staff quarters and hired golf architect [[A.W. Tillinghast]] to build an 18-hole championship golf course. Today, Zukor's estate is the private [[Paramount Country Club]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trager|first=James|title=The people's chronology: a year-by-year record of human events from prehistory to the present|url=https://archive.org/details/mes00jame|url-access=registration|year=1979|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=Austin, Texas, United States|page=[https://archive.org/details/mes00jame/page/823 823]}}</ref>

==Early movie career==
In 1903, he became involved in the [[film|motion picture]] industry when his cousin, Max Goldstein, approached him for a loan to invest in a chain of theaters. These theaters were started by [[Mitchell Mark]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] and hosted [[Edisonia Hall]]. Mark needed investors to expand his chain of theaters. Zukor gave Goldstein the loan and formed a partnership with Mark and Morris Kohn, a friend of Zukor's who also invested in the theaters. Zukor, Mark, and Kohn opened a [[Amusement arcade#Penny arcade|penny arcade]] operating as The Automatic Vaudeville Company on 14th Street in New York City. They soon opened branches in [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], with funding by [[Marcus Loew]].<ref>Albin Krebs, [https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0107.html \"Adolph Zukor Is Dead at 103; Built Paramount Movie Empire\"], ''The New York Times'', June 11, 1976</ref><ref>Ed Solero, [http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/17576 \"Crystal Hall\"], ''Cinema Treasures''</ref>

== Life and work ==
Li was born in [[Shanghai, China]].
