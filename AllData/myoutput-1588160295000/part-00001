From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\nFor 2016, the competition has increased to 24 teams. In 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by [[Scotland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and the inclusion of [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]]. The new president of [[UEFA]], [[Michel Platini]], was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's Executive Committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7479293.stm |title=Uefa sets deadline over Euro 2012 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> On 25 September, it was announced by [[Franz Beckenbauer]] that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7636495.stm |title=Uefa to expand Euro Championship |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in [[1960 European Nations' Cup|1960]] and [[1964 European Nations' Cup|1964]] through home and away [[Playoffs#Association football|play-offs]]; from [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968]] through a combination of both [[Tournament#Group tournaments|qualifying groups]] and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]], the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n===Qualifying===\n{{Main|UEFA European Championship qualifying}}\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using [[Seed (sports)|seeding]]. Seeded teams include reigning champions, and other teams on the basis of their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n# Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n# Average goal difference.\n# Average number of goals scored.\n# Average number of away goals scored.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For [[UEFA Euro 2020]], the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the [[UEFA Nations League]]. As with most leagues, [[Three points for a win|the points are awarded as three for a win]], one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n# Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Results of all group matches:\n## Superior goal difference\n## Higher number of goals scored\n## Higher number of goals scored away from home\n## Fair play conduct.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\n===Final tournament===\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 tournament]]. They were joint hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], the winners and the highest ranked second placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, subject to qualification, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying]]. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using [[UEFA coefficient|coefficients]] as a basis.\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.<ref name=\"regulations 2016\"/>\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progresses to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] are employed to separate the two teams.

Though there is no longer a [[third place play-off]], UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2006/08 |url=http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/19079.pdf |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=11 July 2016 |location=2.08 |page=3 |format=PDF}}</ref> and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2010\u201312 |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/euro/91/87/57/918757_download.pdf |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=4 July 2012 |location=3.08 |page=4 |format=PDF}}</ref> However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.<ref name=\"regulations 2016\">{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2014\u201316 |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/uefaorg/Regulations/02/03/92/81/2039281_DOWNLOAD.pdf |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=2 September 2016 |location=4.08 |page=11 |format=PDF}}</ref> Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.\n\n==Format==\n\n===The competition===\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\nFor 2016, the competition has increased to 24 teams. In 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by [[Scotland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and the inclusion of [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]]. The new president of [[UEFA]], [[Michel Platini]], was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's Executive Committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7479293.stm |title=Uefa sets deadline over Euro 2012 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> On 25 September, it was announced by [[Franz Beckenbauer]] that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7636495.stm |title=Uefa to expand Euro Championship |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in [[1960 European Nations' Cup|1960]] and [[1964 European Nations' Cup|1964]] through home and away [[Playoffs#Association football|play-offs]]; from [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968]] through a combination of both [[Tournament#Group tournaments|qualifying groups]] and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]], the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n===Qualifying===\n{{Main|UEFA European Championship qualifying}}\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using [[Seed (sports)|seeding]]. Seeded teams include reigning champions, and other teams on the basis of their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n# Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n# Average goal difference.\n# Average number of goals scored.\n# Average number of away goals scored.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For [[UEFA Euro 2020]], the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the [[UEFA Nations League]]. As with most leagues, [[Three points for a win|the points are awarded as three for a win]], one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n# Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Results of all group matches:\n## Superior goal difference\n## Higher number of goals scored\n## Higher number of goals scored away from home\n## Fair play conduct.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\n===Final tournament===\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 tournament]]. They were joint hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], the winners and the highest ranked second placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, subject to qualification, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying]]. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using [[UEFA coefficient|coefficients]] as a basis.\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.<ref name=\"regulations 2016\"/>\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progresses to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the [[FIFA World Cup]], this tournament no longer has a [[third place playoff]].\n\n==Results==\n{{See also|List of UEFA European Championship finals}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;
