Search engines provide access to their own data with services such as Google Analytics,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/|title=Analytics Tools & Solutions for Your Business - Google Analytics|website=marketingplatform.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}</ref> Google Trends and Google Insights. Third party services must collect their data from [[ISP]]'s, [[phoning home]] software, or from [[web scraping|scraping]] search engines. Getting traffic statistics from ISP's and phone homes provides for broader reporting of [[web traffic]] in addition to search analytics. Services that perform keyword monitoring only scrape a limited set of search results depending on their clients' needs. Services providing reverse search however, must scrape a large set of keywords from the search engines, usually in the millions, to find the keywords that everyone is using.\n\nSince search results, especially advertisements, differ depending on where you are searching from, data collection methods have to account for geographic location. Keyword monitors do this more easily since they typically know what location their client is targeting. However, to get an exhaustive reverse search, several locations need to be scraped for the same keyword.\n\n==Accuracy==\nSearch analytics accuracy depends on service being used, data collection method, and data freshness. Google releases its own data, but only in an aggregated way and often without assigning absolute values such as number of visitors to its graphs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/trends/about.html |title=About Google Trends&nbsp;\u2013 Google Trends |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref> [[internet service provider|ISP]] logs and phone home methods are accurate for the population they sample, so sample size and [[demographics]] must be adequate to accurately represent the larger population. Scraping results can be highly accurate, especially when looking at the non-paid, [[organic search|organic]] search results. Paid results, from [[Google Adwords]] for example, are often different for the same search depending on the time, geographic location, and history of searches from a particular computer. This means that scraping advertisers can be hit or miss.\n\n==Market conditions==\nTaking a look at Google Insights to gauge the popularity of these services shows that compared to searches for the term [[Adwords]] (Google's popular search ad system), use of search analytics services is still very low, around 1-25% as of Oct. 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=adwords%2Cgoogle%20trends%2Cspyfu%2Ckeyword%20spy%2Cgoogle%20insights&cmpt=q |title=Google Trends |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref> This could point to a large opportunity for the users and makers of search analytics given that services have existed since 2004 with several new services being started since.\n\n==Calculations==\n:Sessions with Search = The number of sessions that used your site's search function at least once.\n:Percentage of sessions that used internal search = Sessions with Search / Total Sessions.\n:Total Unique Searches = The total number of times your site search was used.
