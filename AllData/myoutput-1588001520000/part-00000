The series features [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]], [[James Naughton]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Mark Lenard]], and [[Booth Colman]]. It is based on the 1968 movie ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' and its [[Planet of the Apes|sequels]], which were based on the novel ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]'' by [[Pierre Boulle]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe series begins with the June 14, 3085<Ref>\"Earthtime\" [''sic''] shown on-screen in the opening credit sequence.</ref> crash of an Earth spaceship that encountered a time warp while approaching Alpha Centauri on August 19, 1980.<ref>\"Shiptime\" [''sic''] shown on-screen in the opening credit sequence.</ref> The spaceship is manned by three astronauts, one of whom has died in the crash. The other two astronauts, Colonel Alan Virdon and Major Peter J. Burke, are unconscious but are rescued by a human who carries them to an old bomb shelter. After the human opens a book containing historical text and pictures of Earth circa 2500, the two astronauts are convinced that they are indeed on a future Earth.\n\nThe crash is also witnessed by a young chimpanzee who tells [[Veska|his father]], a village official who alerts the authorities. Ape councilor Zaius (an analog of the [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Dr. Zaius|character]] from the [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|original movie]]), notes that another such incident occurred ten years earlier. He orders the chief gorilla, Security Chief Urko, to find the humans and bring them back alive. Zaius wants to find out as much as he can about the humans before they are eventually killed. Zaius doesn't trust Urko to follow his orders and bring back any surviving humans, so he sends along his newly hired chimpanzee assistant, Galen.\n\nBoth Virdon and Burke go back to their ship to check the ship's chronometer. They are more than 1000 years in the future from when they left Earth. Virdon insists on retrieving the ship's flight log in the hopes that they will be able to analyze it and be able to return to their own time period, but while they are at the ship, they are captured, and the old man is subsequently killed by a group of apes.\n\nGalen finds the human book that the old man had been carrying. He reads parts of the book and begins to doubt the history that he has been told: apes have always been dominant, and humans have always been inferior and subservient. When Galen finds out that Urko has arranged for the two astronauts to escape and be killed in the attempt, he stops the shooter and helps the humans escape. During the escape, a guard is killed, and Galen is found standing over him with a gun in his hand.\n\nGalen discusses the book that he found with Zaius, who then accuses him of heresy. Galen is sentenced to death for his crime. Then Virdon and Burke find out about his sentence and rescue Galen. They are all then declared enemies of the state and become fugitives. The three fugitives thereafter wander around the territory that used to be the western United States having various encounters with apes, humans, and old human civilization ruins.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Planet of the Apes cast 1974.JPG|thumb|180px|Back row: [[James Naughton]] and [[Roddy McDowall]]; front: [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]]  (1974).]]\n[[File:Ron Harper Wayne Foster Zina Bethune Planet of the Apes 1974.JPG|thumb|180px|L-R: Wayne Foster, [[Zina Bethune]] and [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]]. ]]\n[[File:Ron Harper Roddy McDowall Planet of the Apes 1974.JPG|thumb|180px|Ron Harper and Roddy McDowall.]]\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as Galen, a young chimpanzee that is sent by Zaius with Urko to ensure the safety of two humans that have survived a crash landing on Earth.

The chief of the town sacrifices unwilling humans to their god in a temple during a cult type ceremony. This temple turns out to be an ancient ruin where a poisonous invisible gas is located (likely [[phosgene]] or [[diphosgene]] circa WWI Germany). Later, the chief (wearing a costumed [[gas mask]]) is discovered to be building an arsenal of gas bombs and a distillery to produce poisonous gas ceramic containers. He claims the moral right to use these weapons to rid the world of the ape threat.\n\nThis controversial episode involved the creation of poisonous gas as a [[weapon of mass destruction]]. During the time of the [[Vietnam War]] protests, the [[Agent Orange]] controversy, the [[Yom Kippur War]], the [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the enactment of the [[War Powers Resolution]] by US Congress, CBS likely decided not to broadcast this episode during a holiday season with by such domestic and international conflicts.\n\n'''Note:''' Several sources including the Fox DVD release and the book ''Timeline of the Planet of the Apes'' by Rich Handley list \"The Liberator\" as an unbroadcast episode. The ''Timeline'' book also states that it wasn't broadcast in the United States until the early 1990s on the [[Sci-Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]]. However, it is listed as having been broadcast on December 6, 1974 in the books ''Planet of the Apes Revisited'' by Joe Russo, Larry Landsman and Edward Gross, and ''Planet of the Apes as American Myth'' by Eric Greene. \n}} \n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=CDAD00\n |Title=Up Above the World So High\n |DirectedBy=[[John Meredyth Lucas]]\n |WrittenBy=[[Shimon Wincelberg|S.

Jacobs]] as early as 1971. Because of the success of the movies, the idea of a television series was delayed until after the completion of ''[[Battle for the Planet of the Apes]]'' during the first half of 1973.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |year=1998|title=Behind the Planet of the Apes|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Image Entertainment]]}}</ref> However, soon after the premiere of ''Battle'', Jacobs died, and his production company APJAC Productions sold all ''Planet of the Apes'' rights and privileges to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Natalie Trundy: Monkey Business on the Planet of the Apes|journal=Planet of the Apes|date=April 19, 1975|issue=26|page=18|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|url=http://pota.goatley.com/comics/potauk026_part2.pdf|accessdate=May 29, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106171859/http://pota.goatley.com/comics/potauk026_part2.pdf|archivedate=January 6, 2009}}</ref> Subsequently, television rights for the first three ''Planet of the Apes'' movies were sold to [[CBS]] and broadcast successfully during September 1973.  Based largely on high viewership of \"movie-of-the-week\" television broadcasts of the first few movies, CBS began to disfavor other contenders for a new science-fiction series, including [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s [[Genesis II (film)|''Genesis II'']] (1973) and favor proposals for a ''Planet of the Apes'' television series.<ref>Alexander, David, \"Star Trek Creator\", ROC Books, an imprint of Dutton Signet, a division of Penguin Books USA, New York, June 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-451-45418-8}}, pp. 398-403.</ref> Fox and CBS then continued Jacob's plans of a series the next year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hofstede|first=David|title=Planet of the Apes: An Unofficial Companion|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|location=[[Toronto]]|isbn=1550224468|page=57|date=January 1, 2000}}</ref>\n\nCBS ordered 14 episodes of ''Planet of the Apes'' to be produced.

[[Earle Hagen]] composed the scores for \"The Legacy\" and \"Tomorrow's Tide,\" while Richard LaSalle wrote an original score for \"The Trap.\" In addition, three episodes received partial scores - Hagen composed one for \"The Surgeon,\" LaSalle composed \"The Deception,\" and music supervisor [[Lionel Newman]] composed his only music for the series with \"The Interrogation\" (those last three, like the other episodes, were otherwise tracked with the music composed previously).\n\n===Intrada album===\n\nIn 2005, [[Intrada]] released an album featuring [[Lalo Schifrin]]'s beginning and ending

The show was canceled after half a season because of poor ratings due at least partly to direct competition by [[NBC]]'s ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' and ''[[Chico and the Man]]''. Only thirteen of its fourteen episodes were broadcast; all 14 episodes were later included in the [[DVD]] box set. It was later shown in reruns on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]].\n\nThe series was broadcast in Britain by 13 of the 14 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] companies from 13 October 1974 each Sunday, until 18 January 1975. [[Scottish Television]] (STV) never broadcast it during 1974/75, opting to broadcast ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' instead.  The show was repeated in many regions from September 1975 until 1978, but was still not broadcast by STV. The series then received its first UK-wide transmissions on [[Channel 4]] in 1994, and later the [[Syfy (UK and Ireland)|Sci Fi Channel]]. The television movie compilations have also been screened on [[Sky Movies]], [[True Movies]], [[True Entertainment]] (which also broadcast the show in original form) and [[Horror Channel]].\n\nDuring 2019, [[MeTV]] began broadcasting the series as part of its late Saturday Night \"Red Eye Sci-Fi\" block.\n\n==Telefilms==\nIn 1980, several episodes of the series were edited into five made-for-television movies.\n\n* ''Back to the Planet of the Apes'' (\"Escape from Tomorrow\" & \"The Trap\")<ref>Handley, Rich. \"Timeline of the Planet of the Apes: The Definitive Chronology\". Hasslein Books, 2008, p. 254.</ref>\n* ''Forgotten City of the Planet of the Apes'' (\"Gladiators\" & \"Legacy\")\n* ''Treachery and Greed on the Planet of the Apes'' (\"Horse Race\" & \"The Tyrant\")\n* ''Life, Liberty and Pursuit on the Planet of the Apes'' (\"The Surgeon\" & \"The Interrogation\")\n* ''Farewell to the Planet of the Apes'' (\"Tomorrow's Tide\" & \"Up Above The World So High\")\n\nWhen the ''Planet of the Apes'' telefilms began syndication, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[owned and operated]] stations, who bought them for their afternoon movie programs (with titles such as ''[[The 4:30 Movie]]''), asked Roddy McDowall to re-create his role of Galen in a series of new beginnings and endings specifically for these stations, billed as \"The New Planet of the Apes\". The introductions created originally by 20th Century Fox to begin each film were replaced by a now-aged Galen (McDowall) examining the events of the telefilms. The beginnings and endings revealed Virdon and Burke's final fates: \"They found their computer in another city and disappeared into space as suddenly as they\u2019d arrived\". According to \"TV Zone Special #17\" (1995 issue) McDowall filmed these \"two years after the demise of the first run episodes of the Planet of the Apes television series\", which would be December 1976. The ABC openings and closings of these telefilms were neither broadcast by other stations nor included on any home media release.<ref>{{cite web|title=Galen's Last Appearance \u2013 Transcripts|url=http://potatv.kassidyrae.com/galenslastappearance.html|publisher=POTATV|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Spinoffs==\nMost of the books and [[Planet of the Apes (comic book)|comics]] based on ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' are based on the movies, not the television series. However, there are some titles that do involve the television show characters:\n\nNovelizations: Four novelizations of episodes, written by [[George Alec Effinger]], were published by Award Books. Their titles are:\n* ''Planet of the Apes #1: Man the Fugitive''.\n* ''Planet of the Apes #2: Escape From Tomorrow''.\n* ''Planet of the Apes #3: Journey Into Terror''.\n* ''Planet of the Apes #4: Lord of the Apes''.\n\nBritish Annuals: Brown-Watson Books published three hardcover annuals featuring original stories about Virdon, Burke and Galen. These stories are a combination of comic strips and short fiction.\n\nAudio Adventures\u2014Power Records produced four audio-only adventures based on the TV show. Their titles were:\n* ''Mountain of the Delphi''\n* ''Battle of Two Worlds''\n* ''Dawn of the Tree People''\n* ''Volcano''\n\nArgentine Comics: Seven Spanish-language comics were published in Argentina, written by Jorge Claudio Morhain and Richard Barreiro and illustrated by Sergio Mulko and T. Toledo. Released only in Argentina, they have never been published officially in English. However, PDFs of the comics, translated to English by fans, are available at Kassidy Rae's site (see link below).\n\nFilmstrip Story: Chad Valley, a U.K. toy company, produced 32 short film-based comic strips containing an original TV-series-era story, presented as the Chad Valley Picture Show Planet of the Apes Sliderama Projector (very similar to the many Give-a-Show projector sets of the 1970s). These strips are extremely rare and difficult to find.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|0071033|Planet of the Apes}}\n* {{tv.com show|planet-of-the-apes|Planet of the Apes}}\n* [http://potatv.kassidyrae.com Kassidy's POTA Television Series Site] - Galen's final TV appearance, Argentine comics, screencaps, collectibles, articles, photos, books, stories and more\n* [http://www.storiesfromchalo.info/ Stories From Chalo] a POTA TV website\n* [http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/%7Epdownes/potatv/potatv.html Mez's UK site] - an older POTA TV site \n* [http://pota.goatley.com Hunter's ''Planet of the Apes'' Archive] \u2013 Extensive fan site with information on all original films and series, with full television scripts, comics and other relevant material\n* [http://www.potamediaarchive.com ''Planet of the Apes'' Media Archive] \u2013 Multi-media website\n* [http://www.theforbidden-zone.com ''Planet of the Apes'': The Forbidden Zone] \u2013 One of the oldest and most complete ''Planet of the Apes'' sites\n* {{IMDb title|0071184|Back to the Planet of the Apes}}\n* {{IMDb title|0200646|Forgotten City of the Planet of the Apes}}\n* {{IMDb title|0394835|Treachery and Greed on the Planet of the Apes}}\n* {{IMDb title|0394832|Life, Liberty and Pursuit on the Planet of the Apes}}\n* {{IMDb title|0379782|Farewell to the Planet of the Apes}}\n\n{{Planet of the Apes}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Alpha Centauri in fiction]]\n[[Category:Planet of the Apes]]\n[[Category:CBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television]]\n[[Category:1970s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:1974 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1974 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:Television shows about apes]]\n[[Category:Television series set in the future]]\n[[Category:Live action television programs based on films]]\n[[Category:Television series based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Interquel television series]]                                          \n[[Category:Post-apocalyptic television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1980]]\n[[Category:Television series set in the 4th millennium]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name          = Planet of the Apes\n| image              = Planet of the Apes DVD Cover.jpg\n| caption            = DVD cover art\n| runtime            = 50 minutes\n| developer          = Anthony Wilson\n| executive_producer = [[Herbert Hirschman]]\n| producer           = [[Stan Hough]]\n| starring           = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Roddy McDowall]]\n* [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]]\n* [[James Naughton]]\n* [[Mark Lenard]]\n}}\n| composer           = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Lalo Schifrin]]\n* [[Earle Hagen]]\n* Richard LaSalle\n}}\n| country            = United States\n| network            = [[CBS]]\n| company            = [[20th Century Fox Television]]\n| distributor        = [[20th Television]]\n| first_aired        = {{Start date|1974|9|13}}\n| last_aired         = {{End date|1974|12|20}}\n| num_episodes       = 14\n}}\n\n'''''Planet of the Apes''''' is a 1974 American [[science fiction]] television series that was broadcast by [[CBS]]. The series features [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]], [[James Naughton]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Mark Lenard]], and [[Booth Colman]]. It is based on the 1968 movie ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' and its [[Planet of the Apes|sequels]], which were based on the novel ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]'' by [[Pierre Boulle]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe series begins with the June 14, 3085<Ref>\"Earthtime\" [''sic''] shown on-screen in the opening credit sequence.</ref> crash of an Earth spaceship that encountered a time warp while approaching Alpha Centauri on August 19, 1980.<ref>\"Shiptime\" [''sic''] shown on-screen in the opening credit sequence.</ref> The spaceship is manned by three astronauts, one of whom has died in the crash. The other two astronauts, Colonel Alan Virdon and Major Peter J. Burke, are unconscious but are rescued by a human who carries them to an old bomb shelter. After the human opens a book containing historical text and pictures of Earth circa 2500, the two astronauts are convinced that they are indeed on a future Earth.\n\nThe crash is also witnessed by a young chimpanzee who tells [[Veska|his father]], a village official who alerts the authorities. Ape councilor Zaius (an analog of the [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Dr. Zaius|character]] from the [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|original movie]]), notes that another such incident occurred ten years earlier. He orders the chief gorilla, Security Chief Urko, to find the humans and bring them back alive. Zaius wants to find out as much as he can about the humans before they are eventually killed. Zaius doesn't trust Urko to follow his orders and bring back any surviving humans, so he sends along his newly hired chimpanzee assistant, Galen.\n\nBoth Virdon and Burke go back to their ship to check the ship's chronometer. They are more than 1000 years in the future from when they left Earth. Virdon insists on retrieving the ship's flight log in the hopes that they will be able to analyze it and be able to return to their own time period, but while they are at the ship, they are captured, and the old man is subsequently killed by a group of apes.\n\nGalen finds the human book that the old man had been carrying. He reads parts of the book and begins to doubt the history that he has been told: apes have always been dominant, and humans have always been inferior and subservient. When Galen finds out that Urko has arranged for the two astronauts to escape and be killed in the attempt, he stops the shooter and helps the humans escape. During the escape, a guard is killed, and Galen is found standing over him with a gun in his hand.\n\nGalen discusses the book that he found with Zaius, who then accuses him of heresy. Galen is sentenced to death for his crime. Then Virdon and Burke find out about his sentence and rescue Galen. They are all then declared enemies of the state and become fugitives. The three fugitives thereafter wander around the territory that used to be the western United States having various encounters with apes, humans, and old human civilization ruins.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Planet of the Apes cast 1974.JPG|thumb|180px|Back row: [[James Naughton]] and [[Roddy McDowall]]; front: [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]]  (1974).]]\n[[File:Ron Harper Wayne Foster Zina Bethune Planet of the Apes 1974.JPG|thumb|180px|L-R: Wayne Foster, [[Zina Bethune]] and [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]]. ]]\n[[File:Ron Harper Roddy McDowall Planet of the Apes 1974.JPG|thumb|180px|Ron Harper and Roddy McDowall.]]\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as Galen, a young chimpanzee that is sent by Zaius with Urko to ensure the safety of two humans that have survived a crash landing on Earth.

He claims the moral right to use these weapons to rid the world of the ape threat.\n\nThis controversial episode involved the creation of poisonous gas as a [[weapon of mass destruction]]. During the time of the [[Vietnam War]] protests, the [[Agent Orange]] controversy, the [[Yom Kippur War]], the [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the enactment of the [[War Powers Resolution]] by US Congress, CBS likely decided not to broadcast this episode during a holiday season with by such domestic and international conflicts.\n\n'''Note:''' Several sources including the Fox DVD release and the book ''Timeline of the Planet of the Apes'' by Rich Handley list \"The Liberator\" as an unbroadcast episode.

[[Earle Hagen]] composed the scores for \"The Legacy\" and \"Tomorrow's Tide,\" while Richard LaSalle wrote an original score for \"The Trap.\" In addition, three episodes received partial scores - Hagen composed one for \"The Surgeon,\" LaSalle composed \"The Deception,\" and music supervisor [[Lionel Newman]] composed his only music for the series with \"The Interrogation\" (those last three, like the other episodes, were otherwise tracked with the music composed previously).\n\n===Intrada album===\n\nIn 2005, [[Intrada]] released an album featuring [[Lalo Schifrin]]'s beginning and ending music along with all three of Schifrin's scores and [[Earle Hagen]]'s \"The Legacy.\" The album also includes the logo music for [[Twentieth Century Fox|Twentieth Century-Fox Television]] by [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]].\n\n{{Track listing\n| total_length = 68:46\n| collapsed = yes\n| title1 = Main Title\n| length1 = 1:16\n| title2 = ''Escape From Tomorrow'': The Spaceship\n| length2

The show was canceled after half a season because of poor ratings due at least partly to direct competition by [[NBC]]'s ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' and ''[[Chico and the Man]]''. Only thirteen of its fourteen episodes were broadcast; all 14 episodes were later included in the [[DVD]] box set. It was later shown in reruns on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]].\n\nThe series was broadcast in Britain by 13 of the 14 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] companies from 13 October 1974 each Sunday, until 18 January 1975. [[Scottish Television]] (STV) never broadcasted it during 1974/75, opting to broadcast ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' instead.  The show was repeated in many regions from September 1975 until 1978, but was still not broadcasted by STV. The series then received its first UK-wide transmissions on [[Channel 4]] in 1994, and later the [[Syfy (UK and Ireland)|Sci Fi Channel]]. The television movie compilations have also been screened on [[Sky Movies]], [[True Movies]], [[True Entertainment]] (which also broadcasted the show in original form) and [[Horror Channel]].\n\nDuring 2019, [[MeTV]] began broadcasting the series as part of its late Saturday Night \"Red Eye Sci-Fi\" block.\n\n==Telefilms==\nIn 1980, several episodes of the series were edited into five made-for-television movies.\n\n* ''Back to the Planet of the Apes'' (\"Escape from Tomorrow\" & \"The Trap\")<ref>Handley, Rich. \"Timeline of the Planet of the Apes: The Definitive Chronology\". Hasslein Books, 2008, p. 254.</ref>\n* ''Forgotten City of the Planet of the Apes'' (\"Gladiators\" & \"Legacy\")\n* ''Treachery and Greed on the Planet of the Apes'' (\"Horse Race\" & \"The Tyrant\")\n* ''Life, Liberty and Pursuit on the Planet of the Apes'' (\"The Surgeon\" & \"The Interrogation\")\n* ''Farewell to the Planet of the Apes'' (\"Tomorrow's Tide\" & \"Up Above The World So High\")\n\nWhen the ''Planet of the Apes'' telefilms began syndication, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[owned and operated]] stations, who bought them for their afternoon movie programs (with titles such as ''[[The 4:30 Movie]]''), asked Roddy McDowall to re-create his role of Galen in a series of new beginnings and endings specifically for these stations, billed as \"The New Planet of the Apes\". The introductions created originally by 20th Century Fox to begin each film were replaced by a now-aged Galen (McDowall) examining the events of the telefilms. The beginnings and endings revealed Virdon and Burke's final fates: \"They found their computer in another city and disappeared into space as suddenly as they\u2019d arrived\". According to \"TV Zone Special #17\" (1995 issue) McDowall filmed these \"two years after the demise of the first run episodes of the Planet of the Apes television series\", which would be December 1976. The ABC openings and closings of these telefilms were neither broadcasted by other stations nor included on any home media release.<ref>{{cite web|title=Galen's Last Appearance \u2013 Transcripts|url=http://potatv.kassidyrae.com/galenslastappearance.html|publisher=POTATV|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Spinoffs==\nMost of the books and [[Planet of the Apes (comic book)|comics]] based on ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' are based on the movies, not the television series. However, there are some titles that do involve the television show characters:\n\nNovelizations: Four novelizations of episodes, written by [[George Alec Effinger]], were published by Award Books. Their titles are:\n* ''Planet of the Apes #1: Man the Fugitive''.\n* ''Planet of the Apes #2: Escape From Tomorrow''.\n* ''Planet of the Apes #3: Journey Into Terror''.\n* ''Planet of the Apes #4: Lord of the Apes''.\n\nBritish Annuals: Brown-Watson Books published three hardcover annuals featuring original stories about Virdon, Burke and Galen. These stories are a combination of comic strips and short fiction.\n\nAudio Adventures\u2014Power Records produced four audio-only adventures based on the TV show. Their titles were:\n* ''Mountain of the Delphi''\n* ''Battle of Two Worlds''\n* ''Dawn of the Tree People''\n* ''Volcano''\n\nArgentine Comics: Seven Spanish-language comics were published in Argentina, written by Jorge Claudio Morhain and Richard Barreiro and illustrated by Sergio Mulko and T. Toledo. Released only in Argentina, they have never been published officially in English. However, PDFs of the comics, translated to English by fans, are available at Kassidy Rae's site (see link below).\n\nFilmstrip Story: Chad Valley, a U.K. toy company, produced 32 short film-based comic strips containing an original TV-series-era story, presented as the Chad Valley Picture Show Planet of the Apes Sliderama Projector (very similar to the many Give-a-Show projector sets of the 1970s). These strips are extremely rare and difficult to find.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|0071033|Planet of the Apes}}\n* {{tv.com show|planet-of-the-apes|Planet of the Apes}}\n* [http://potatv.kassidyrae.com Kassidy's POTA Television Series Site] - Galen's final TV appearance, Argentine comics, screencaps, collectibles, articles, photos, books, stories and more\n* [http://www.storiesfromchalo.info/ Stories From Chalo] a POTA TV website\n* [http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/%7Epdownes/potatv/potatv.html Mez's UK site] - an older POTA TV site \n* [http://pota.goatley.com Hunter's ''Planet of the Apes'' Archive] \u2013 Extensive fan site with information on all original films and series, with full television scripts, comics and other relevant material\n* [http://www.potamediaarchive.com ''Planet of the Apes'' Media Archive] \u2013 Multi-media website\n* [http://www.theforbidden-zone.com ''Planet of the Apes'': The Forbidden Zone] \u2013 One of the oldest and most complete ''Planet of the Apes'' sites\n* {{IMDb title|0071184|Back to the Planet of the Apes}}\n* {{IMDb title|0200646|Forgotten City of the Planet of the Apes}}\n* {{IMDb title|0394835|Treachery and Greed on the Planet of the Apes}}\n* {{IMDb title|0394832|Life, Liberty and Pursuit on the Planet of the Apes}}\n* {{IMDb title|0379782|Farewell to the Planet of the Apes}}\n\n{{Planet of the Apes}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Alpha Centauri in fiction]]\n[[Category:Planet of the Apes]]\n[[Category:CBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television]]\n[[Category:1970s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:1974 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1974 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:Television shows about apes]]\n[[Category:Television series set in the future]]\n[[Category:Live action television programs based on films]]\n[[Category:Television series based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Interquel television series]]                                          \n[[Category:Post-apocalyptic television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1980]]\n[[Category:Television series set in the 4th millennium]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "broadcasted > broadcast", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_(TV_series)"}
