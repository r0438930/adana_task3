J. Morrone (2006) defines the Amazonian subregion in this broader sense, divided into the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] provinces of Guyana, Humid Guyana, Napo, Imeri, Roraima, Amap\u00e1, V\u00e1rzea, Ucayali, Madeira, Tapaj\u00f3s-Xingu, Par\u00e1, Yungas and Pantanal.{{sfn|Abad-Franch|Monteiro|2007|p=2}}{{sfn|Morrone|2006}}\nThe [[World Wildlife Fund]] takes a similar scope, where the Amazon biome includes the [[Guiana Shield]] rain forests in the north and the [[Chiquitano dry forests]] of Bolivia.{{sfn|Intro: Amazon Ecoregions and Ecology \u2013 Yale}}\n\nThe biome covers parts of Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.{{sfn|About the Amazon \u2013 WWF Global}}\nIn Brazil the biome covers more than {{convert|4100000|km2}} and covers all or parts of the states of [[Acre (state)|Acre]], [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], [[Roraima]], [[Rond\u00f4nia]], [[Par\u00e1]], [[Amap\u00e1]], [[Maranh\u00e3o]], [[Tocantins]] and [[Mato Grosso]].{{sfn|Tosta|Coutinho|2015|p=9}}\nThe Amazon biome covers 49.29% of Brazil.{{sfn|Tosta|Coutinho|2015|p=297}}\n16% of the biome is in Peru.\nAs of 2015 about 23.4% of Peru's Amazon biome was protected, but of this less than half was fully protected.{{sfn|Wuerthner|Crist|Butler|2015|p=}}\n\n==Physical environment==\n===Terrain===\n[[File:Cerros de Mavecure (Guain\u00eda, Colombia).JPG|thumb|[[Cerros de Mavecure]] in the [[Guiana Shield]] in Colombia]]\nMuch of the terrain of the Amazon biome, particularly around the rivers, is lowland plains.\nThe [[Guiana Shield]] is an area of highlands along the border between Brazil and Venezuela and Guyana.\nThe southern Amazonian highlands cross parts of Rondonia and Mato Grosso  and the southern parts of Amazonas and Para.{{sfn|Tosta|Coutinho|2015|p=10}}\n\nThe Amazon basin is crossed by ridges or \"paleoarches\" that connect the Guiana and [[Brazilian shield|Brazilian]] shields and divide it into geological sub-basins.\nThey are the Iquitos or Jutai Arch in Peru and [[Acre (state)|Acre]], the Carauari Arch across the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] and [[Solim\u00f5es River|Solim\u00f5es]], the Purus Arch to the west of [[Manaus]], the Monte Alegre Arch to the west of the [[Tapaj\u00f3s]] and the Gurupa Arch to the west of [[Maraj\u00f3]]. \nUnder the Paleoarch model, paleobasins between the arches form centers for biological diversification.\nThus the Iquitos arch is considered the main reason for the different species of frogs and rodents and different forest types on either side of the ridge.{{sfn|Patterson|Costa|2012|p=269}}\n\n===Soil===\n\nThe soil is generally very poor in nutrients, and areas that have been deforested often are unsuitable for agriculture or pasture.{{sfn|Pena}} A large part of the [[phosphorus]] necessary for life is blown by the wind from Africa; as [[Diatomaceous earth|diatomeous dust]] from the [[Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression]]{{sfn|Yu|2015|pp=1984\u20131991}} and as smoke due to biomass burning in Africa.{{sfn|Barkley|Prospero |Mahowald |Hamilton|2019}}\nThere are wide regional variations in soil types.\nThus 20% of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] basin is covered by [[podzol]]s and 55% by [[acrisol]]s and [[ferralsol]]s, with the remainder covered by alluvial and litholic soils and scattered areas of hydromorphic [[plinthosol]]s.\nIn the biome as a whole podzols cover just {{convert|136000|km2}}, or 2.7% of the area.{{sfn|Pereira|Monies|Lucas|Melfi|2016|p=332}}\n\n===Climate===\nIn Brazil the average temperature of the biome is {{convert|22|to|26|C}} and average rainfall is {{convert|2300|mm}}, but there are wide variations from one region to another.{{sfn|Hilty|2012|p=46}}\nThe biome as a whole has annual rainfall from {{convert|1500|to|3000|mm}}, about half of which is carried by winds from the Atlantic, and the other half from [[evapotranspiration]] within the biome.\nThere are wide variations in total rainfall and distribution of rainfall throughout the year.{{sfn|About the Amazon \u2013 WWF Global}}\n\n===Water===\n[[File:De m\u00e3os dadas.jpg|thumb|White water of the [[Solim\u00f5es River|Solim\u00f5es]] and black water of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] converge to form the [[Amazon River]] ]]\nThe Amazon watershed covers about {{convert|5846100|km2}}.{{sfn|Pena}}\nThe [[Amazon River]] accounts for 15\u201316% of the total water discharged by rivers into the oceans of the world.{{sfn|About the Amazon \u2013 WWF Global}}\nRivers may be [[blackwater river|blackwater]], [[Whitewater river (river type)|whitewater]] or clearwater.\nThus the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] (\"Black River\") has clear, jet-black water caused by decomposition of organic matter in swamps along its margins, combined with low levels of silt.\nThe [[Branco River|Rio Branco]] (\"White River\") and the Amazon itself have yellowish waters loaded with silt.{{sfn|Negro River \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}\nThe Tahuayo River in the [[Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Regional Conservation Area]] of Peru is classed as a blackwater river, but often has similar chemistry to the whitewater rivers of the region since it is in the Amazon River floodplain, and receives water from the Amazon.{{sfn|Penn|Neise}}\n\nThe Amazon and its major tributaries such as the [[Xingu River|Xingu]], [[Tapaj\u00f3s]], [[Madeira River|Madeira]], [[Purus River|Purus]] and [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] form barriers to the [[geodispersal]] of plants, animals and even insects. Thus the [[white-fronted capuchin]] (''Cebus albifrons'') and [[hairy saki]] (''Pithecia hirsuta'') are found west of the Tapaj\u00f3s, while the [[white-nosed saki]] (''Chiropotes albinasus'')  is only found east of the river.{{sfn|Sears, Robin.

Legal mostly occupy cerrado areas, not the Amazon biome.{{sfn|Barbosa|2015|p=23}}\nA statement by [[Cargill]] in 2006 said, \"Soy occupies less than 0.6 percent of the land in the Amazon biome today,
