Usually it is fitted with a [[rubber]] [[stopper (plug)|stopper]] and a [[fermentation lock]] to prevent [[bacteria]] and [[oxygen]] from entering during the fermentation process.\n\nDuring the [[homebrewing]] process, a primary carboy is used for fermentation. Once primary fermentation is complete, the beer is either transferred to a secondary carboy for conditioning or it can be transferred directly to bottles for conditioning. (This process of transferring is usually called [[racking]].)\n\n[[Polypropylene]] carboys are also commonly used in laboratories to transfer purified water. They are typically filled at the top and have a spigot at the bottom for dispensing.\n\n==Laboratory==\nIn modern laboratories, carboys are usually made of plastic, though traditionally were (and still are in many university settings) made of ferric glass or other shatter-resistant glasses immune to acid corrosion or [[halide]] staining common in older plastic formulations. They are used to store large quantities of liquids, such as [[solvent]]s or [[deionised water]]. In these applications, a tap may be included for dispensing. Carboys are also used to collect and store waste solvents. Collecting waste solvents in plastic carboys is preferable to reusing glass [[Winchester (bottle)|Winchesters]] due to the lesser chance of breakage if a solution is placed in an incorrectly labeled carboy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fermentation (food)]]\n* [[Jerrycan]] \u2013 another large-sized fluid container\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Carboys}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Carboy}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Demijohn}}\n* [http://www.bottlebooks.com/demijohn/big_bottles_big_history_demijohn.htm Big Bottles Big History: Demijohns and Carboys]\n\n{{packaging}}\n\n[[Category:Vessels]]\n[[Category:Homebrewing]]\n[[Category:Laboratory glassware]]\n[[Category:Wine packaging and storage]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Demijohn}}\n[[File:Clickon Water Dispenser.jpg|thumb|right|Water Dispenser with large plastic bottles]]\n[[Image:CarboyHomebrew.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|A {{convert|6.5|usgal|l|0}} glass carboy acting as a fermentation vessel for beer.
