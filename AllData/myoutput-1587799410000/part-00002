The French fleet was led by [[Contre-amiral]] [[Pierre Martin (French Navy officer)|Pierre Martin]] and comprised 14 (later 13) [[ships of the line]] while the British [[Royal Navy]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] fleet, under Vice-Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]] mustered 13 ships of the line. The battle ended with a minor British-Neapolitan  victory and the capture of two French ships.\n\nThe battle was part of a naval campaign in the spring of 1795, during which Martin sought to assert French control over the waters off Southern France. These had been effectively ceded to the British 18 months earlier when the British captured the French Mediterranean naval base of [[Toulon]]. Although it was recaptured at an ensuing [[Siege of Toulon|siege]], the main French Mediterranean fleet had been burned in the harbour. Only half the fleet was salvageable and as repairs continued in Toulon, the British used their dominance to [[invasion of Corsica (1794)|invade and capture]] the island of [[Corsica]] during 1794. By the start of 1795 enough French ships were in fighting condition that Martin felt able to make limited cruises in the Ligurian Sea. At the start of March 1795 he sailed for [[Genoa]], [[Action of 7 March 1795|encountering and capturing]] a British ship of the line ''en route''. Off Genoa Martin found himself pursued by Hotham's fleet and, after two days of manoeuvres in calm weather, the French admiral turned back towards the French coast.\n\nHotham pursued, and on 13 March his leading ships caught the French rearguard. For two days Martin's rearmost ships fought a series of running engagements with the British fleet in which several ships from both sides were badly damaged. Martin's flagship the 120-gun [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Sans Culotte'']] lost contact with the battle overnight, and after a brief resumption of the battle the following morning he gave orders to withdraw. Two French ships, {{ship|French ship|\u00c7a Ira|1781|2}} and {{ship|French ship|Censeur|1782|2}}, were left behind, overwhelmed, and forced to surrender by the British. Hotham was urged by his subordinate, Captain [[Horatio Nelson]], to continue pursuit, but refused and withdrew his fleet for repairs. One British ship, {{HMS|Illustrious|1789|6}}, was later wrecked on the Italian coast. Martin sent his damaged ships into Toulon for repairs and anchored the rest of the fleet in the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res]] in preparations for further operations; four months later the fleets fought a second engagement, the [[Battle of the Hy\u00e8res Islands]], which also ended in a minor British victory.\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[French Revolutionary Wars]] expanded significantly in February 1793 when the [[National Convention]] of the newly-formed [[First French Republic|French Republic]] declared war on the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref name=\"RG14\">Gardiner, p.14</ref> To defend British commercial interests in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], a [[Royal Navy]] fleet was assembled and sent to [[blockade]] the French Mediterranean Fleet in their main port of [[Toulon]] on the Southern coast of France.<ref name=\"WJ65\">James, p.65</ref> On arrival in August 1793, the British fleet found that Toulon was in a state of upheaval due to the [[Reign of Terror]], and the British commander [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] persuaded the citizens to declare for the [[House of Bourbon|French Royalist]] cause and allow British forces to seize the town and the French fleet.<ref name=\"BI178\">Ireland, p.178</ref> Republican forces [[Siege of Toulon|laid siege]] to the city and four months of heavy fighting followed until the Royalists and their allies were expelled on 18 December. During the chaotic evacuation of the city most of the French Mediterranean fleet was set on fire by British and Spanish boarding parties.<ref name=\"RG105\">Gardiner, p.105</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath, the British launched an [[Invasion of Corsica (1794)|invasion of Corsica]] while the French set about rebuilding their fleet.<ref name=\"WJ254\"/> Due to failures by Spanish landing parties, many of the naval stores in Toulon had survived the fire as had more than half of the fleet, although many ships were badly damaged.<ref name=\"WLC212\">Clowes, p.212</ref> For most of 1794 the surviving French ships remained in harbour, the new commander [[Contre-amiral]] [[Pierre Martin (French Navy officer)|Pierre Martin]] leading a [[Martin's cruise of 1794|brief sally in June]] with seven [[ships of the line]] which was forced to shelter at [[Golfe-Juan|Gourjean Bay]] to escape an attack by Lord Hood's fleet.<ref name=\"RG116\">Gardiner, p.116</ref> Problems stemming from the [[French Revolution]] several years earlier meant that the French fleet was suffering severe reductions in experience and morale in comparison with the British fleet.<ref name=\"BI74\">Ireland, p.74</ref>\n\nBy 1795 the full surviving strength of the French Mediterranean Fleet had been restored, Martin mustering 15 ships of the line and six [[frigates]] for an operation in the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The purpose of this operation is uncertain; the report of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] to the National Convention stated that the fleet was at sea to secure shipping lines in the Mediterranean,<ref name=troude425/> while other sources indicate that an [[amphibious landing]] in Corsica was the intention. Such an operation is mentioned in the correspondence of [[Repr\u00e9sentant en mission]] from the National Convention, [[\u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Letourneur]], sent to provide political oversight for the fleet. This plan was also indicated by the numbers of troopships assembling in Toulon,<ref name=troude425>Troude, p.425</ref> although these vessels did not leave harbour during the operation. Historian [[Adolphe Thiers]] has suggested that the objective may have been a demonstration of force against [[Rome]], following the lynching of French ambassador [[Nicolas Jean Hugon de Bassville|Nicolas Bassville]] there two years earlier.<ref>Thiers, ''Histoire de la R\u00e9volution'', vol.7.</ref>\n\n==Martin's cruise==\n{{see also|Order of battle at the Battle of Genoa}}\nMartin was reluctant to leave Toulon until he could be certain that the lax British [[blockade]] of the port had been temporarily retired.<ref name=\"WJ254\">James, p.254</ref> Hood had been replaced in late 1794 by his deputy Vice-Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], who based his ships in [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|San Fiorenzo Bay]] on the northern coast of Corsica during the winter.<ref name=\"WLC267\">Clowes, p.267</ref> There they had attempted partial refits and one ship, {{HMS|Berwick|1775|6}}, had been badly damaged due to poor handling during a [[gale]]. In late February Hotham sailed for more extensive repairs at [[Livorno|Leghorn]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], leaving ''Berwick'' behind.<ref name=\"WJ254\"/> Martin received news of Hotham's departure at the start of March, and sailed from Toulon on 3 March.<ref name=\"WLC268\">Clowes, p.268</ref>\n\nThe French fleet faced a series of gales, and it took four days to reach the Corsican coast; two ships were partly dismasted during the passage.<ref name=\"WJ255\">James, p.255</ref> There Martin's scouts discovered the damaged ''Berwick'' limping around [[Cap Corse]] with [[jury masts]]. Recognising his superiority, Martin detached a squadron of frigates and ships of the line to chase ''Berwick'' and [[Action of 7 March 1795|a short battle]] developed in which the fleeing ''Berwick'' fought the frigate [[French frigate Alceste (1780)|''Alceste'']].<ref name=troude426>Troude, p.426</ref> Both ships took damage in the encounter, but as ''Alceste'' dropped back, a [[bar shot]] tore the head off Captain Adam Littlejohn on ''Berwick''.<ref name=\"WJ255\"/> With other ships coming into range, ''Berwick'' unable to escape and their captain dead, the surviving officers decided to surrender. Martin ordered the captured ''Berwick'' and the damaged ''Alceste'' to detach for the protected anchorage at Gourjean Bay, while his fleet continued eastwards into the [[Gulf of Genoa]].<ref name=\"WJ257\">James, p.257</ref>\n\nOn same day as the capture of ''Berwick'', news of the French departure from Toulon reached Hotham at Leghorn from Genoa, with reports that the French had passed [[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite]] on 6 March, heading east.<ref name=\"WLC268\"/> This was corroborated by the scouting [[sloop]] {{HMS|Moselle|1793|6}}, which reported the French to the north-west, heading south. Within a day Hotham's fleet was ready to sail, leaving the harbour in the early morning of 9 March.<ref name=\"WJ256\">James, p.256</ref> Hotham believed that the French target was Corsica, and sent the [[brig]] {{HMS|Tarleton|1782|6}} under Commander [[Charles Brisbane]] to warn Littlejohn and arrange a rendezvous with ''Berwick'' off Cap Corse. On the evening of 9 March ''Tarleton'' returned with the news of the capture of ''Berwick'', causing Hotham to veer north-west in his course.<ref name=\"WJ256\"/> The following day the frigates scouting ahead of the British fleet discovered Martin's fleet off [[Cape Noli]] in the Gulf of Genoa, steering westwards, back towards Toulon.<ref name=\"WLC269\">Clowes, p.269</ref>\n\n==Chase==\nThe weather was calm, and it was not until 11 March that ships from the main body of the British fleet sighted the French, now south and to [[windward]] of the British. The lead ship in Hotham's fleet at this time was {{HMS|Princess Royal|1773|6}}, leading a vanguard some 5 or {{convert|6|nmi|km}} ahead of the main body of the fleet.<ref name=\"WJ257\"/> Contact was lost for a time, but re-established on 12 March when Martin brought his fleet about. Martin advanced to within {{convert|3|nmi|km}} of ''Princess Royal'' before [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]] away to [[larboard]].<ref name=\"WLC269\"/> The weather remained calm with choppy seas which made manoeuvring very difficult and prevented either fleet from closing for battle; when presented with the opportunity to attack, Martin declined.<ref name=\"CF73\">Forester, p.73</ref>\n\nA breeze from the south in the evening gave Hotham the opportunity to form up his fleet into a [[line of battle]] with the van to the west, the French to the southwest.<ref name=\"WJ257\"/> The night was characterised by heavy [[squalls]], and the French ship [[French ship Mercure (1783)|''Mercure'']] lost a topmast; the damaged ship detached to join ''Berwick'' at Gourjean Bay, accompanied by a frigate, while continuing to steer his fleet to the west away from the British.<ref name=\"WLC270\">Clowes, p.270</ref> At 08:00 the following morning another of Martin's ships, the large 80-gun {{ship|French ship|\u00c7a Ira|1781|2}} from the rearguard of the French fleet, collided with the neighbouring [[French ship Languedoc (1766)|''Victoire'']] and its fore and main topmasts collapsed overboard.<ref name=\"RG116\"/>\n\nBy the morning of 13 March it had become clear to Hotham that Martin had no intention of engaging the British fleet, and the British admiral decided to authorise a general chase, permitting his captains to break from the line and pursue the French to the best of their ships' ability.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13766|pages=305|date=7 April 1795}}</ref> The leading ship of the chase was a frigate, the 36-gun [[HMS Inconstant (1783)|HMS ''Inconstant'']] under Captain [[Thomas Fremantle (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Fremantle]], which reached the damaged ''\u00c7a Ira'' within an hour of the collision and opened fire at close range on the larboard quarter.<ref name=\"WLC270\"/>\n\nSeeing that ''\u00c7a Ira'' was under threat, the French frigate [[French ship Vestale (1756)|''Vestale'']] attacked ''Inconstant'' from a distance, pulled past the British ship and attached a tow line to the limping ship of the line.<ref name=\"WJ257\"/> Fremantle brought his ship around and fired into ''\u00c7a Ira'' again, but on this occasion was exposed to the main [[broadside]] of the French ship and was subject to cannon-fire which caused casualties of three killed and 14 wounded, as well as significant damage. Unable to continue the action, Fremantle pulled back for repairs.<ref name=\"WJ258\">James, p.258</ref> The attack by ''Inconstant'' had allowed other British ships to join the action, so that at 10:45 the 64-gun [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] under Captain [[Horatio Nelson]] was able to open fire on the French ship.<ref name=\"WLC270\"/>\n\n''Agamemnon'', supported briefly by [[HMS Captain (1787)|HMS ''Captain'']] under Captain [[Samuel Reeve (Royal Navy officer)|Samuel Reeve]], retained contact with ''\u00c7a Ira'', firing on the French ship at long range for three and a half hours.<ref name=\"WJ258\"/> Nelson had been able to position his ship off the stern of ''\u00c7a Ira'' and weave back and forth behind the French ship, unleashing a devastating [[raking fire]].<ref name=\"GB89\">Bennett, p.89</ref> The attack killed or wounded 110 crew on the French ship, and shattered the masts and rigging. Nelson had just seven men wounded in the encounter.<ref name=\"CF74\">Forester, p.74</ref> Efforts by ''Sans Culotte'' and [[HMS Donegal (1798)|''Barra'']] to intervene were driven off and ''\u00c7a Ira'' was severely damaged by ''Agamemnon''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fire. Eventually parts of the French centre dropped back in support and Hotham ordered Nelson to fall back rather than risk being overwhelmed.<ref name=\"GB42\">Bennett, p.42</ref> While this combat continued other British ships had come up, [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']] and [[HMS Egmont (1768)|HMS ''Egmont'']] engaging three French ships, including [[French ship Commerce de Bordeaux (1785)|''Timol\u00e9on'']] and Martin's flagship the 120-gun [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Sans Culotte'']].<ref name=\"WJ258\"/> ''Egmont'' was hampered during the engagement by an explosion of a bursting cannon on the lower deck, which caused nearly 30 casualties among the gun crews.<ref name=\"WJ260\"/> Hotham's fleet was unable to fully engage with the retreating French throughout the day however, and when night fell both fleets continued westwards, the French withdrawing with the British line in pursuit.<ref name=\"LG1\"/>\n\n==Battle rejoined==\nDuring the night Martin and Letourneur transferred from ''Sans Culotte'' to the frigate [[French frigate Friponne (1780)|''Friponne'']], which allowed them to move through the fleet more easily and direct operations more effectively, and was part of French standing orders when in a fleet battle.<ref>Troude, vol., p. 427</ref> Orders were given for the French fleet, now in full retreat towards Toulon, to sail close to the wind on the larboard tack away from the British.<ref name=\"WJ258\"/> For unexplained reasons ''Sans Culotte'' did not follow these orders and dropped out of the fleet during the night,<ref name=\"WLC270\"/> while ''\u00c7a Ira'' dropped further and further behind the main body of the French force. To better protect the damaged ship, ''Vestale'' was withdrawn and replaced with the ship of the line {{ship|French ship|Censeur|1782|2}}, towing ''\u00c7a Ira'' back towards Toulon.<ref name=\"WJ258\"/>\n\nIn the morning the fleets were manoeuvring {{convert|21|nmi|km}} southwest of Genoa, the British closing on the French line to the west. ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur'' had fallen a long way back from the French fleet, and Hotham sent his fastest ships in pursuit, propelled by a northwesterly breeze. By 06:30 ''Bedford'' and ''Captain'' had caught up with the French stragglers, ''Captain'' in the lead fighting both for 15 minutes before ''Bedford'' reached the engagement.<ref name=\"WJ258\"/> ''Captain'' suffered severe damage to its rigging, sails and masts and by 07:50 was unmanageable and drifting out of the action, and was towed to safety.<ref name=\"WLC271\">Clowes, p.271</ref> Shortly afterwards ''Bedford'' too was forced to withdraw with extensive damage to the sailing rig. Both French ships had also been badly damaged, and were left drifting out of control, unable to unite with Martin's main fleet.<ref name=\"LG1\"/>\n\nMartin sought to defend his beleaguered rearmost ships, and gave orders for his line to [[jibe|wear in succession]] so as to cut between the British fleet and the badly damaged ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur'', which were now threatened by the recently arrived [[HMS Illustrious (1789)|HMS ''Illustrious'']] and [[HMS Courageux (1761)|HMS ''Courageux'']].<ref name=\"WJ259\">James, p.259</ref> Both fleets were by this point beset by a period of calm weather which made manoeuvres difficult, and the French turn caught [[HMS Lowestoft (1761)|HMS ''Lowestoft'']] by surprise, the frigate suddenly under the guns of the leading French ship [[French ship Duquesne (1787)|''Duquesne'']] under Captain [[Zacharie Allemand]].<ref name=\"WJ259\"/> Allemand fired on the frigate, and Captain [[Benjamin Hallowell Carew|Benjamin Hallowell]], aware that he could not effectively respond, sent his entire crew below decks to protect them from the French gunfire. ''Lowestoft'' was badly damaged in sails and rigging, but was saved from further loss by the arrival of the Neapolitan frigate [[Neapolitan ship Minerva|''Minerva'']] which interceded with ''Duquesne''.<ref name=\"WLC271\"/>\n\nIn turning, Allemand failed to follow orders effectively, meaning that instead of passing to leeward of the British ships, between the enemy and ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur'', he passed to windward, sailing down the other side of the British vanguard.<ref name=\"WJ260\">James, p.260</ref> Hotham had succeed in interposing his ships between the shattered French ships and Martin's main fleet, and it seemed that a close general action was inevitable.<ref name=\"CF75\">Forester, p.75</ref> At 08:00 Allemand engaged ''Illustrious'' and then ''Courageux'', ''Duquesne'' joined in the attack by ''Victoire'' and [[HMS Tonnant (1798)|''Tonnant'']],<ref name=\"WJ260\"/> and the British ships supported more distantly by ''Agamemnon'' and ''Princess Royal''.<ref name=\"GB43\">Bennett, p.43</ref> For an hour the French and British vanguards exchanged heavy fire, with ''Illustrious'' taking the worst of the exchange, drifting out of the battle heavily damaged; the mainmast had collapsed onto the mizzen mast and both had fallen over the side, while the ship's crew had suffered 90 casualties.<ref name=\"WJ261\">James, p.261</ref> ''Courageux'' was the next to suffer, similarly losing two masts and with the hull shattered by French shot.<ref name=\"WLC271\"/> Captain [[Augustus Montgomery (Royal Navy officer)|Augustus Montgomery]]'s crew had lost nearly 50 sailors killed and wounded.<ref name=\"WJ261\"/> The French ships in this exchange were reported as firing [[heated shot]], although it had little effect on the battle.<ref name=\"RG116\"/> Allemand's van squadron then pulled away from the drifting British ships, which were unsupported by the becalmed British fleet.<ref name=\"WLC271\"/>\n\nThe rest of the French fleet had not followed Allemand, and turned away, the van following. This left the battered ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur'' trapped on the far side of the British fleet, Martin abandoning them to their fate. Isolated, these ships surrendered at 10:05.<ref name=\"GB43\"/> Without British pursuit, concerted long range firing finally ceased at 14:00; Hotham had decided that addressing the severe damage to his van ships and securing the prizes was more important than continuing the action and tacked his fleet away from Martin's rapidly disappearing ships. Nelson believed that by abandoning the prizes and disabled ships and closely following the French, Hotham could force an action which might destroy the entire French fleet. So convinced was the British captain that he took a boat to Hotham's flagship [[HMS Britannia (1762)|HMS ''Britannia'']] to try and persuade the admiral. Hotham refused, replying that \"We must be contented, we have done very well\".<ref name=\"GB43\"/> No amount of appeals by Nelson or Rear-Admiral [[Samuel Goodall]] on ''Princess Royal'' could move Hotham to continue the action, and soon the French were out of sight.<ref name=\"CF75\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nHotham gathered his prizes and dismasted ships and turned eastwards for the anchorage in the [[Gulf of La Spezia]].<ref name=\"WJ264\">James, p.264</ref> All of his battle line had been in action and taken casualties, with the heaviest losses aboard the badly damaged and partially dismasted ''Illustrious'' and ''Courageux''. ''Captain'', ''Bedford'', ''Egmont'' and [[HMS Windsor Castle|HMS ''Windsor Castle'']] were also damaged, all suffering more than 20 casualties.<ref name=\"WJ261\"/> British and Neapolitan total losses amounted to 74 killed in action and 284 wounded. French losses were not fully accounted in the aftermath of the battle, although the cumulative total on the shattered ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur'' was listed in British accounts as approximately 400 casualties. {{Cref2|Note A}} Among the surviving French ships casualties are not known with precision, but ''Duquesne'', ''Victoire'', ''Tonnant'' and ''Timol\u00e9on'' were all recorded as being badly damaged.<ref name=\"WJ261\"/>\n\nHotham's ships anchored in the Gulf of La Spezia after the action, and on 17 March were struck by a heavy gale, in which the damaged ''Illustrious'' broke its tow rope to the frigate {{HMS|Meleager|1785|6}} and began to drift towards the coast.<ref name=\"WLC273\">Clowes, p.273</ref> The ship's jury masts were lost overboard and the many holes in the hull allowed water to pour into the ship. At 13:30 the ship's situation was worsened when a loaded cannon fired accidentally, blowing off the gunport and blasting a large hole in the ship from the inside. This rendered ''Illustrious'' unmanageable, and by 14:00 the Italian coast was clearly visible to the east. His ship drifting dangerously inshore, at 14:30 Captain [[Thomas Frederick (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Frederick]] gave control to a sailor on board who claimed to have navigated the region and knew a safe anchorage.<ref name=\"WJ264\"/> For five hours ''Illustrious'' struggled to avoid disaster, but at 19:30 the ship [[Ship grounding|grounded]] near [[Avenza]]. Frederick attempted to anchor in an effort to save the ship, but this failed due to battle damage and strong winds and waves tore the rudder off at 22:30.<ref name=\"WJ265\">James, p.265</ref>\n\nThe following morning ''Tarleton'' came alongside the irreparably damaged ''Illustrious'', although it was not until 20 March that the weather had abated sufficiently to permit the evacuation to begin. ''Tarleton'', ''Lowestoft'', [[HMS Romulus (1785)|HMS ''Romulus'']], and teams of [[ship's boat]]s, successfully removed all of the crew and most of the ship's stores without casualties. Once the wreck had been cleared, it was set on fire and abandoned.<ref name=\"TG11\">Grocott, p.11</ref> The surviving fleet remained at La Spezia for a week effecting basic repairs, before sailing for San Fiorenzo on 25 March. Refits lasted until 18 April, at which point Hotham returned to Leghorn.<ref name=\"WLC273\"/> Both prizes were commissioned into the Royal Navy at San Fiorenzo under their original names, although neither had long careers; ''Censeur'' was sent to escort a convoy to Britain in the late summer of 1795, still in a damaged state, and was attacked, isolated and recaptured by a French squadron off [[Cape St. Vincent]] at the [[Action of 7 October 1795]].<ref name=\"WJ274\">James, p.274</ref> ''\u00c7a Ira'' survived only a little longer, catching fire accidentally while at anchor off San Fiorenzo on 11 April 1796 and being completely destroyed, although only four of the 600 crew were killed.<ref name=\"TG33\">Grocott, p.33</ref>\n\nMartin retreated to Hy\u00e8res after the battle, joined shortly afterwards by the damaged ships from Gourjean Bay and the flagship from Genoa.<ref name=\"WJ265\"/> After separating during the night of 13 March, ''Sans Culotte'' had sought to rejoin the French fleet but been sighted and chased by a Spanish squadron, sheltering in the neutral port until the route back to France was clear.<ref name=\"WJ265\"/> Martin sent the most damaged ships back to Toulon for refit, remaining at anchor off Hy\u00e8res with 11 ships of the line until April, when he too returned to port, joined by reinforcements from the French Atlantic Fleet.<ref name=\"WJ266\">James, p.266</ref> The captains of ''Sans Culottes'', ''Mercure'' and ''Duquesne'' were reprimanded by Martin for failing to follow his orders, but subsequently cleared of misconduct by a jury, which also highly commended the captains of ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur''.<ref name=troude431>Troude, p.431</ref> He did not sail again until June, and was caught by Hotham once more in early July.

The French fleet was led by [[Contre-amiral]] [[Pierre Martin (French Navy officer)|Pierre Martin]] and comprised 14 (later 13) [[ships of the line]] while the British [[Royal Navy]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] fleet, under Vice-Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]] mustered 13 ships of the line. The battle ended with a minor British-Neapolitan  victory and the capture of two French ships.\n\nThe battle was part of a naval campaign in the spring of 1795, during which Martin sought to assert French control over the waters off Southern France. These had been effectively ceded to the British 18 months earlier when the British captured the French Mediterranean naval base of [[Toulon]]. Although it was recaptured at an ensuing [[Siege of Toulon|siege]], the main French Mediterranean fleet had been burned in the harbour. Only half the fleet was salvageable and as repairs continued in Toulon, the British used their dominance to [[invasion of Corsica (1794)|invade and capture]] the island of [[Corsica]] during 1794. By the start of 1795 enough French ships were in fighting condition that Martin felt able to make limited cruises in the Ligurian Sea. At the start of March 1795 he sailed for [[Genoa]], [[Action of 7 March 1795|encountering and capturing]] a British ship of the line ''en route''. Off Genoa Martin found himself pursued by Hotham's fleet and, after two days of manoeuvres in calm weather, the French admiral turned back towards the French coast.\n\nHotham pursued, and on 13 March his leading ships caught the French rearguard. For two days Martin's rearmost ships fought a series of running engagements with the British fleet in which several ships from both sides were badly damaged. Martin's flagship the 120-gun [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Sans Culotte'']] lost contact with the battle overnight, and after a brief resumption of the battle the following morning he gave orders to withdraw. Two French ships, {{ship|French ship|\u00c7a Ira|1781|2}} and {{ship|French ship|Censeur|1782|2}}, were left behind, overwhelmed, and forced to surrender by the British. Hotham was urged by his subordinate, Captain [[Horatio Nelson]], to continue pursuit, but refused and withdrew his fleet for repairs. One British ship, {{HMS|Illustrious|1789|6}}, was later wrecked on the Italian coast. Martin sent his damaged ships into Toulon for repairs and anchored the rest of the fleet in the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res]] in preparations for further operations; four months later the fleets fought a second engagement, the [[Battle of the Hy\u00e8res Islands]], which also ended in a minor British victory.\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[French Revolutionary Wars]] expanded significantly in February 1793 when the [[National Convention]] of the newly-formed [[First French Republic|French Republic]] declared war on the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref name=\"RG14\">Gardiner, p.14</ref> To defend British commercial interests in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], a [[Royal Navy]] fleet was assembled and sent to [[blockade]] the French Mediterranean Fleet in their main port of [[Toulon]] on the Southern coast of France.<ref name=\"WJ65\">James, p.65</ref> On arrival in August 1793, the British fleet found that Toulon was in a state of upheaval due to the [[Reign of Terror]], and the British commander [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] persuaded the citizens to declare for the [[House of Bourbon|French Royalist]] cause and allow British forces to seize the town and the French fleet.<ref name=\"BI178\">Ireland, p.178</ref> Republican forces [[Siege of Toulon|laid siege]] to the city and four months of heavy fighting followed until the Royalists and their allies were expelled on 18 December. During the chaotic evacuation of the city most of the French Mediterranean fleet was set on fire by British and Spanish boarding parties.<ref name=\"RG105\">Gardiner, p.105</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath, the British launched an [[Invasion of Corsica (1794)|invasion of Corsica]] while the French set about rebuilding their fleet.<ref name=\"WJ254\"/> Due to failures by Spanish landing parties, many of the naval stores in Toulon had survived the fire as had more than half of the fleet, although many ships were badly damaged.<ref name=\"WLC212\">Clowes, p.212</ref> For most of 1794 the surviving French ships remained in harbour, the new commander [[Contre-amiral]] [[Pierre Martin (French Navy officer)|Pierre Martin]] leading a [[Martin's cruise of 1794|brief sally in June]] with seven [[ships of the line]] which was forced to shelter at [[Golfe-Juan|Gourjean Bay]] to escape an attack by Lord Hood's fleet.<ref name=\"RG116\">Gardiner, p.116</ref> Problems stemming from the [[French Revolution]] several years earlier meant that the French fleet was suffering severe reductions in experience and morale in comparison with the British fleet.<ref name=\"BI74\">Ireland, p.74</ref>\n\nBy 1795 the full surviving strength of the French Mediterranean Fleet had been restored, Martin mustering 15 ships of the line and six [[frigates]] for an operation in the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The purpose of this operation is uncertain; the report of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] to the National Convention stated that the fleet was at sea to secure shipping lines in the Mediterranean,<ref name=troude425/> while other sources indicate that an [[amphibious landing]] in Corsica was the intention. Such an operation is mentioned in the correspondence of [[Repr\u00e9sentant en mission]] from the National Convention, [[\u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Letourneur]], sent to provide political oversight for the fleet. This plan was also indicated by the numbers of troopships assembling in Toulon,<ref name=troude425>Troude, p.425</ref> although these vessels did not leave harbour during the operation. Historian [[Adolphe Thiers]] has suggested that the objective may have been a demonstration of force against [[Rome]], following the lynching of French ambassador [[Nicolas Jean Hugon de Bassville|Nicolas Bassville]] there two years earlier.<ref>Thiers, ''Histoire de la R\u00e9volution'', vol.7.</ref>\n\n==Martin's cruise==\n{{see also|Order of battle at the Battle of Genoa}}\nMartin was reluctant to leave Toulon until he could be certain that the lax British [[blockade]] of the port had been temporarily retired.<ref name=\"WJ254\">James, p.254</ref> Hood had been replaced in late 1794 by his deputy Vice-Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], who based his ships in [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|San Fiorenzo Bay]] on the northern coast of Corsica during the winter.<ref name=\"WLC267\">Clowes, p.267</ref> There they had attempted partial refits and one ship, {{HMS|Berwick|1775|6}}, had been badly damaged due to poor handling during a [[gale]]. In late February Hotham sailed for more extensive repairs at [[Livorno|Leghorn]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], leaving ''Berwick'' behind.<ref name=\"WJ254\"/> Martin received news of Hotham's departure at the start of March, and sailed from Toulon on 3 March.<ref name=\"WLC268\">Clowes, p.268</ref>\n\nThe French fleet faced a series of gales, and it took four days to reach the Corsican coast; two ships were partly dismasted during the passage.<ref name=\"WJ255\">James, p.255</ref> There Martin's scouts discovered the damaged ''Berwick'' limping around [[Cap Corse]] with [[jury masts]]. Recognising his superiority, Martin detached a squadron of frigates and ships of the line to chase ''Berwick'' and [[Action of 7 March 1795|a short battle]] developed in which the fleeing ''Berwick'' fought the frigate [[French frigate Alceste (1780)|''Alceste'']].<ref name=troude426>Troude, p.426</ref> Both ships took damage in the encounter, but as ''Alceste'' dropped back, a [[bar shot]] tore the head off Captain Adam Littlejohn on ''Berwick''.<ref name=\"WJ255\"/> With other ships coming into range, ''Berwick'' unable to escape and their captain dead, the surviving officers decided to surrender. Martin ordered the captured ''Berwick'' and the damaged ''Alceste'' to detach for the protected anchorage at Gourjean Bay, while his fleet continued eastwards into the [[Gulf of Genoa]].<ref name=\"WJ257\">James, p.257</ref>\n\nOn same day as the capture of ''Berwick'', news of the French departure from Toulon reached Hotham at Leghorn from Genoa, with reports that the French had passed [[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite]] on 6 March, heading east.<ref name=\"WLC268\"/> This was corroborated by the scouting [[sloop]] {{HMS|Moselle|1793|6}}, which reported the French to the north-west, heading south. Within a day Hotham's fleet was ready to sail, leaving the harbour in the early morning of 9 March.<ref name=\"WJ256\">James, p.256</ref> Hotham believed that the French target was Corsica, and sent the [[brig]] {{HMS|Tarleton|1782|6}} under Commander [[Charles Brisbane]] to warn Littlejohn and arrange a rendezvous with ''Berwick'' off Cap Corse. On the evening of 9 March ''Tarleton'' returned with the news of the capture of ''Berwick'', causing Hotham to veer north-west in his course.<ref name=\"WJ256\"/> The following day the frigates scouting ahead of the British fleet discovered Martin's fleet off [[Cape Noli]] in the Gulf of Genoa, steering westwards, back towards Toulon.<ref name=\"WLC269\">Clowes, p.269</ref>\n\n==Chase==\nThe weather was calm, and it was not until 11 March that ships from the main body of the British fleet sighted the French, now south and to [[windward]] of the British. The lead ship in Hotham's fleet at this time was {{HMS|Princess Royal|1773|6}}, leading a vanguard some 5 or {{convert|6|nmi|km}} ahead of the main body of the fleet.<ref name=\"WJ257\"/> Contact was lost for a time, but re-established on 12 March when Martin brought his fleet about. Martin advanced to within {{convert|3|nmi|km}} of ''Princess Royal'' before [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]] away to [[larboard]].<ref name=\"WLC269\"/> The weather remained calm with choppy seas which made manoeuvring very difficult and prevented either fleet from closing for battle; when presented with the opportunity to attack, Martin declined.<ref name=\"CF73\">Forester, p.73</ref>\n\nA breeze from the south in the evening gave Hotham the opportunity to form up his fleet into a [[line of battle]] with the van to the west, the French to the southwest.<ref name=\"WJ257\"/> The night was characterised by heavy [[squalls]], and the French ship [[French ship Mercure (1783)|''Mercure'']] lost a topmast; the damaged ship detached to join ''Berwick'' at Gourjean Bay, accompanied by a frigate, while continuing to steer his fleet to the west away from the British.<ref name=\"WLC270\">Clowes, p.270</ref> At 08:00 the following morning another of Martin's ships, the large 80-gun {{ship|French ship|\u00c7a Ira|1781|2}} from the rearguard of the French fleet, collided with the neighbouring [[French ship Languedoc (1766)|''Victoire'']] and its fore and main topmasts collapsed overboard.<ref name=\"RG116\"/>\n\nBy the morning of 13 March it had become clear to Hotham that Martin had no intention of engaging the British fleet, and the British admiral decided to authorise a general chase, permitting his captains to break from the line and pursue the French to the best of their ships' ability.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13766|pages=305|date=7 April 1795}}</ref> The leading ship of the chase was a frigate, the 36-gun [[HMS Inconstant (1783)|HMS ''Inconstant'']] under Captain [[Thomas Fremantle (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Fremantle]], which reached the damaged ''\u00c7a Ira'' within an hour of the collision and opened fire at close range on the larboard quarter.<ref name=\"WLC270\"/>\n\nSeeing that ''\u00c7a Ira'' was under threat, the French frigate [[French ship Vestale (1756)|''Vestale'']] attacked ''Inconstant'' from a distance, pulled past the British ship and attached a tow line to the limping ship of the line.<ref name=\"WJ257\"/> Fremantle brought his ship around and fired into ''\u00c7a Ira'' again, but on this occasion was exposed to the main [[broadside]] of the French ship and was subject to cannon-fire which caused casualties of three killed and 14 wounded, as well as significant damage. Unable to continue the action, Fremantle pulled back for repairs.<ref name=\"WJ258\">James, p.258</ref> The attack by ''Inconstant'' had allowed other British ships to join the action, so that at 10:45 the 64-gun [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] under Captain [[Horatio Nelson]] was able to open fire on the French ship.<ref name=\"WLC270\"/>\n\n''Agamemnon'', supported briefly by [[HMS Captain (1787)|HMS ''Captain'']] under Captain [[Samuel Reeve (Royal Navy officer)|Samuel Reeve]], retained contact with ''\u00c7a Ira'', firing on the French ship at long range for three and a half hours.<ref name=\"WJ258\"/> Nelson had been able to position his ship off the stern of ''\u00c7a Ira'' and weave back and forth behind the French ship, unleashing a devastating [[raking fire]].<ref name=\"GB89\">Bennett, p.89</ref> The attack killed or wounded 110 crew on the French ship, and shattered the masts and rigging. Nelson had just seven men wounded in the encounter.<ref name=\"CF74\">Forester, p.74</ref> Efforts by ''Sans Culotte'' and [[HMS Donegal (1798)|''Barra'']] to intervene were driven off and ''\u00c7a Ira'' was severely damaged by ''Agamemnon''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fire. Eventually parts of the French centre dropped back in support and Hotham ordered Nelson to fall back rather than risk being overwhelmed.<ref name=\"GB42\">Bennett, p.42</ref> While this combat continued other British ships had come up, [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']] and [[HMS Egmont (1768)|HMS ''Egmont'']] engaging three French ships, including [[French ship Commerce de Bordeaux (1785)|''Timol\u00e9on'']] and Martin's flagship the 120-gun [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Sans Culotte'']].<ref name=\"WJ258\"/> ''Egmont'' was hampered during the engagement by an explosion of a bursting cannon on the lower deck, which caused nearly 30 casualties among the gun crews.<ref name=\"WJ260\"/> Hotham's fleet was unable to fully engage with the retreating French throughout the day however, and when night fell both fleets continued westwards, the French withdrawing with the British line in pursuit.<ref name=\"LG1\"/>\n\n==Battle rejoined==\nDuring the night Martin and Letourneur transferred from ''Sans Culotte'' to the frigate [[French frigate Friponne (1780)|''Friponne'']], which allowed them to move through the fleet more easily and direct operations more effectively, and was part of French standing orders when in a fleet battle.<ref>Troude, vol., p. 427</ref> Orders were given for the French fleet, now in full retreat towards Toulon, to sail close to the wind on the larboard tack away from the British.<ref name=\"WJ258\"/> For unexplained reasons ''Sans Culotte'' did not follow these orders and dropped out of the fleet during the night,<ref name=\"WLC270\"/> while ''\u00c7a Ira'' dropped further and further behind the main body of the French force. To better protect the damaged ship, ''Vestale'' was withdrawn and replaced with the ship of the line {{ship|French ship|Censeur|1782|2}}, towing ''\u00c7a Ira'' back towards Toulon.<ref name=\"WJ258\"/>\n\nIn the morning the fleets were manoeuvring {{convert|21|nmi|km}} southwest of Genoa, the British closing on the French line to the west. ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur'' had fallen a long way back from the French fleet, and Hotham sent his fastest ships in pursuit, propelled by a northwesterly breeze. By 06:30 ''Bedford'' and ''Captain'' had caught up with the French stragglers, ''Captain'' in the lead fighting both for 15 minutes before ''Bedford'' reached the engagement.<ref name=\"WJ258\"/> ''Captain'' suffered severe damage to its rigging, sails and masts and by 07:50 was unmanageable and drifting out of the action, and was towed to safety.<ref name=\"WLC271\">Clowes, p.271</ref> Shortly afterwards ''Bedford'' too was forced to withdraw with extensive damage to the sailing rig. Both French ships had also been badly damaged, and were left drifting out of control, unable to unite with Martin's main fleet.<ref name=\"LG1\"/>\n\nMartin sought to defend his beleaguered rearmost ships, and gave orders for his line to [[jibe|wear in succession]] so as to cut between the British fleet and the badly damaged ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur'', which were now threatened by the recently arrived [[HMS Illustrious (1789)|HMS ''Illustrious'']] and [[HMS Courageux (1761)|HMS ''Courageux'']].<ref name=\"WJ259\">James, p.259</ref> Both fleets were by this point beset by a period of calm weather which made manoeuvres difficult, and the French turn caught [[HMS Lowestoft (1761)|HMS ''Lowestoft'']] by surprise, the frigate suddenly under the guns of the leading French ship [[French ship Duquesne (1787)|''Duquesne'']] under Captain [[Zacharie Allemand]].<ref name=\"WJ259\"/> Allemand fired on the frigate, and Captain [[Benjamin Hallowell Carew|Benjamin Hallowell]], aware that he could not effectively respond, sent his entire crew below decks to protect them from the French gunfire. ''Lowestoft'' was badly damaged in sails and rigging, but was saved from further loss by the arrival of the Neapolitan frigate [[Neapolitan ship Minerva|''Minerva'']] which interceded with ''Duquesne''.<ref name=\"WLC271\"/>\n\nIn turning, Allemand failed to follow orders effectively, meaning that instead of passing to leeward of the British ships, between the enemy and ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur'', he passed to windward, sailing down the other side of the British vanguard.<ref name=\"WJ260\">James, p.260</ref> Hotham had succeed in interposing his ships between the shattered French ships and Martin's main fleet, and it seemed that a close general action was inevitable.<ref name=\"CF75\">Forester, p.75</ref> At 08:00 Allemand engaged ''Illustrious'' and then ''Courageux'', ''Duquesne'' joined in the attack by ''Victoire'' and [[HMS Tonnant (1798)|''Tonnant'']],<ref name=\"WJ260\"/> and the British ships supported more distantly by ''Agamemnon'' and ''Princess Royal''.<ref name=\"GB43\">Bennett, p.43</ref> For an hour the French and British vanguards exchanged heavy fire, with ''Illustrious'' taking the worst of the exchange, drifting out of the battle heavily damaged; the mainmast had collapsed onto the mizzen mast and both had fallen over the side, while the ship's crew had suffered 90 casualties.<ref name=\"WJ261\">James, p.261</ref> ''Courageux'' was the next to suffer, similarly losing two masts and with the hull shattered by French shot.<ref name=\"WLC271\"/> Captain [[Augustus Montgomery (Royal Navy officer)|Augustus Montgomery]]'s crew had lost nearly 50 sailors killed and wounded.<ref name=\"WJ261\"/> The French ships in this exchange were reported as firing [[heated shot]], although it had little effect on the battle.<ref name=\"RG116\"/> Allemand's van squadron then pulled away from the drifting British ships, which were unsupported by the becalmed British fleet.<ref name=\"WLC271\"/>\n\nThe rest of the French fleet had not followed Allemand, and turned away, the van following. This left the battered ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur'' trapped on the far side of the British fleet, Martin abandoning them to their fate. Isolated, these ships surrendered at 10:05.<ref name=\"GB43\"/> Without British pursuit, concerted long range firing finally ceased at 14:00; Hotham had decided that addressing the severe damage to his van ships and securing the prizes was more important than continuing the action and tacked his fleet away from Martin's rapidly disappearing ships. Nelson believed that by abandoning the prizes and disabled ships and closely following the French, Hotham could force an action which might destroy the entire French fleet. So convinced was the British captain that he took a boat to Hotham's flagship [[HMS Britannia (1762)|HMS ''Britannia'']] to try and persuade the admiral. Hotham refused, replying that \"We must be contented, we have done very well\".<ref name=\"GB43\"/> No amount of appeals by Nelson or Rear-Admiral [[Samuel Goodall]] on ''Princess Royal'' could move Hotham to continue the action, and soon the French were out of sight.<ref name=\"CF75\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nHotham gathered his prizes and dismasted ships and turned eastwards for the anchorage in the [[Gulf of La Spezia]].<ref name=\"WJ264\">James, p.264</ref> All of his battle line had been in action and taken casualties, with the heaviest losses aboard the badly damaged and partially dismasted ''Illustrious'' and ''Courageux''. ''Captain'', ''Bedford'', ''Egmont'' and [[HMS Windsor Castle|HMS ''Windsor Castle'']] were also damaged, all suffering more than 20 casualties.<ref name=\"WJ261\"/> British and Neapolitan total losses amounted to 74 killed in action and 284 wounded. French losses were not fully accounted in the aftermath of the battle, although the cumulative total on the shattered ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur'' was listed in British accounts as approximately 400 casualties. {{Cref2|Note A}} Among the surviving French ships casualties are not known with precision, but ''Duquesne'', ''Victoire'', ''Tonnant'' and ''Timol\u00e9on'' were all recorded as being badly damaged.<ref name=\"WJ261\"/>\n\nHotham's ships anchored in the Gulf of La Spezia after the action, and on 17 March were struck by a heavy gale, in which the damaged ''Illustrious'' broke its tow rope to the frigate {{HMS|Meleager|1785|6}} and began to drift towards the coast.<ref name=\"WLC273\">Clowes, p.273</ref> The ship's jury masts were lost overboard and the many holes in the hull allowed water to pour into the ship. At 13:30 the ship's situation was worsened when a loaded cannon fired accidentally, blowing off the gunport and blasting a large hole in the ship from the inside. This rendered ''Illustrious'' unmanageable, and by 14:00 the Italian coast was clearly visible to the east. His ship drifting dangerously inshore, at 14:30 Captain [[Thomas Frederick (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Frederick]] gave control to a sailor on board who claimed to have navigated the region and knew a safe anchorage.<ref name=\"WJ264\"/> For five hours ''Illustrious'' struggled to avoid disaster, but at 19:30 the ship [[Ship grounding|grounded]] near [[Avenza]]. Frederick attempted to anchor in an effort to save the ship, but this failed due to battle damage and strong winds and waves tore the rudder off at 22:30.<ref name=\"WJ265\">James, p.265</ref>\n\nThe following morning ''Tarleton'' came alongside the irreparably damaged ''Illustrious'', although it was not until 20 March that the weather had abated sufficiently to permit the evacuation to begin. ''Tarleton'', ''Lowestoft'', [[HMS Romulus (1785)|HMS ''Romulus'']], and teams of [[ship's boat]]s, successfully removed all of the crew and most of the ship's stores without casualties. Once the wreck had been cleared, it was set on fire and abandoned.<ref name=\"TG11\">Grocott, p.11</ref> The surviving fleet remained at La Spezia for a week effecting basic repairs, before sailing for San Fiorenzo on 25 March. Refits lasted until 18 April, at which point Hotham returned to Leghorn.<ref name=\"WLC273\"/> Both prizes were commissioned into the Royal Navy at San Fiorenzo under their original names, although neither had long careers; ''Censeur'' was sent to escort a convoy to Britain in the late summer of 1795, still in a damaged state, and was attacked, isolated and recaptured by a French squadron off [[Cape St. Vincent]] at the [[Action of 7 October 1795]].<ref name=\"WJ274\">James, p.274</ref> ''\u00c7a Ira'' survived only a little longer, catching fire accidentally while at anchor off San Fiorenzo on 11 April 1796 and being completely destroyed, although only four of the 600 crew were killed.<ref name=\"TG33\">Grocott, p.33</ref>\n\nMartin retreated to Hy\u00e8res after the battle, joined shortly afterwards by the damaged ships from Gourjean Bay and the flagship from Genoa.<ref name=\"WJ265\"/> After separating during the night of 13 March, ''Sans Culotte'' had sought to rejoin the French fleet but been sighted and chased by a Spanish squadron, sheltering in the neutral port until the route back to France was clear.<ref name=\"WJ265\"/> Martin sent the most damaged ships back to Toulon for refit, remaining at anchor off Hy\u00e8res with 11 ships of the line until April, when he too returned to port, joined by reinforcements from the French Atlantic Fleet.<ref name=\"WJ266\">James, p.266</ref> The captains of ''Sans Culottes'', ''Mercure'' and ''Duquesne'' were reprimanded by Martin for failing to follow his orders, but subsequently cleared of misconduct by a jury, which also highly commended the captains of ''\u00c7a Ira'' and ''Censeur''.<ref name=troude431>Troude, p.431</ref> He did not sail again until June, and was caught by Hotham once more in early July. Retreating towards Hy\u00e8res, the French fleet was pursued by the British, and the rearmost ship [[French ship Alcide (1782)|''Alcide'']] was overrun and destroyed at the [[Battle of the Hy\u00e8res Islands]].<ref name=\"NM163\">Mostert, p.163</ref>\n\nAlthough the battle was a British victory, Nelson was privately scathing of Hotham's refusal to renew the action, writing that \"I could never have called it well ''done''\".<ref name=\"GB43\"/> [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]], British ambassador to the [[Kingdom of Naples]], shared Nelson's opinion, writing that \"I can, ''entre nous'', perceive that my old friend Hotham is not quite awake enough for such a command as that of the King's fleet in the Mediterranean.\"<ref name=\"GB44\">Bennett, p.44</ref> Hotham believed his actions vindicated by the prevention of possible French landings on Corsica and was preoccupied by events on land, where a peace treaty between France and Tuscany placed access to the harbour at Leghorn in jeopardy.<ref name=\"NM162\">Mostert, p.162</ref> Historians have criticised Hotham's timidity, [[William Laird Clowes]] writing in 1900 stated that \"it was an unsatisfactory victory. Hotham took two ships of the line but gained little credit, seeing that he might have, and should have, done much more.\"<ref name=\"WLC272\">Clowes, p.272</ref> More than five decades after the battle the [[Admiralty]] recognised the action with a clasp  attached to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=20939|pages=236\u2013245|date=26 January 1849}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-alpha}}\n{{Cnote2|Note A|'''Note A:''' French casualties in the battle are uncertain.
