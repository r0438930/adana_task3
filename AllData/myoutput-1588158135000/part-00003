After a brief sojourn in London as a visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Art (1995\u20131997) where he was exposed particularly to [[African art]], he returned to Korea with an abruptly different style from the traditional work of his early years, fusing both western and eastern design in his work. The \"Dream\" series (1995) was one of his first exhibits to gain international recognition, and fused traditional Asian vessel shapes and punch'ong glazes decorated with abstract patterns reminiscent of Asian [[calligraphy]] or [[ink wash painting]]s.
