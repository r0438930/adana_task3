[[John Williams]] described him as \"one of the great American masters of light orchestral music.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leroyanderson.com/accolades.php|title=Quotations about Leroy Anderson|website=leroyanderson.com}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Swedish parents, Anderson was given his first piano lessons by his mother, who was a church organist. He continued studying piano at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]]. In 1925 Anderson entered Harvard College, where he studied musical harmony with Walter Spalding, counterpoint with [[Edward Ballantine]], canon and fugue with [[William Clifford Heilman|William C. Heilman]], orchestration with [[Edward Burlingame Hill|Edward B. Hill]] and [[Walter Piston]], composition, also with Piston, and double bass with [[Gaston Dufresne]]. He also studied organ with Henry Gideon. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, [[Latin honors|magna cum laude]] in 1929 and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">\"Syncopated Clock, Indeed\"; Janet Frank, The American Scholar, Summer 2008, Phi Beta Kappa Society</ref> In Harvard University Graduate School, he studied composition with Walter Piston and [[George Enescu]] and received a Master of Arts in Music in 1930.<ref name=\"leroyanderson1\">{{cite web |first=Eleanor |last=Anderson |author2=Rolf Anderson |url=http://www.leroyanderson.com/biography.php |title=Official Biography &gt; American Composer and Conductor of Light Concert Music |publisher=Leroy Anderson |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAnderson continued studying at Harvard, working towards a PhD in German and Scandinavian languages; Anderson spoke English and Swedish during his youth, and eventually became fluent in Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, German, French, Italian, and Portuguese.\n\nAt the time he was working as organist and choir director at the East Milton [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]], leading the Harvard University Band, and conducting and arranging for dance bands around Boston. In 1936 his arrangements came to the attention of [[Arthur Fiedler]], who asked to see any original compositions that he could use in his concerts as the 18th conductor of the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] at [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Biography/Bio.htm |title=Leroy Anderson biographical material |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Anderson's first work was the 1938 ''Jazz Pizzicato'', but at just over ninety seconds the piece was too short for a three-minute 78 rpm single of the period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_JPizzicato.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Jazz Pizzicato |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Fiedler suggested writing a companion piece, and Anderson wrote ''Jazz Legato'' later that same year. The combined recording went on to become one of Anderson's signature compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_JLegato.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Jazz Legato |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1942 Anderson joined the United States Army, and was assigned in Iceland with the [[Counterintelligence Corps|U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps]] as a translator and interpreter;<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> in 1945 he was reassigned to [[the Pentagon]] as Chief of the Scandinavian Desk of Military Intelligence. His duties did not, however, prevent him from composing, and in 1945 he wrote \"[[The Syncopated Clock]]\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_SClock.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 The Syncopated Clock |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> and \"Promenade\". Anderson became a reserve officer and was recalled to active duty for the Korean War. He wrote his first hit, \"[[Blue Tango]]\", In 1951, earning a Golden Disc and the No. 1 spot on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].\n\nHis pieces and his recordings during the 1950s conducting a studio orchestra were immense commercial successes. \"Blue Tango\" was the first instrumental recording ever to sell one million copies. His most famous pieces are probably \"[[Sleigh Ride]]\" and \"The Syncopated Clock\". In February 1951, [[WCBS-TV]] in New York City selected \"The Syncopated Clock\" as the theme song for ''The Late Show'', the WCBS late-night movie, using [[Percy Faith]]'s recording. [[Mitchell Parish]] added words to \"The Syncopated Clock\", and later wrote lyrics for other Anderson tunes, including \"Sleigh Ride\", which was not written as a Christmas piece, but as a work that describes a winter event. Anderson started the work during a heat wave in August 1946. The Boston Pops' recording of it was the first pure orchestral piece to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Music chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_SRide.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Sleigh Ride |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> From 1952 to 1961, Anderson's composition \"Plink, Plank, Plunk!\" was used as the theme for the CBS panel show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.\n\nAnderson's musical style employs creative instrumental effects and occasionally makes use of sound-generating items such as typewriters and sandpaper.\n\nAnderson wrote his Piano Concerto in C in 1953 but withdrew it, feeling that it had weak spots. The Anderson family decided to publish the work in 1988. [[Erich Kunzel]] and the [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra]] released the first recording of this work; four other recordings, including one for piano and organ, have since been released.\n\nIn 1958, Anderson composed the music for the Broadway show ''[[Goldilocks (musical)|Goldilocks]]'' with orchestrations by [[Philip J. Lang]]. Even though it earned two Tony awards, ''Goldilocks'' did not achieve commercial success. Anderson never wrote another musical, preferring instead to continue writing orchestral miniatures. His pieces, including \"[[The Typewriter]]\", \"Bugler's Holiday\", and \"[[A Trumpeter's Lullaby]]\" are performed by orchestras and bands ranging from school groups to professional organizations.\n\nAnderson would occasionally appear on the Boston Pops regular concerts on PBS to conduct his own music while Fiedler would sit on the sidelines. For \"The Typewriter\" Fiedler would don a green eyeshade, roll up his sleeves, and mime working on an old typewriter while the orchestra played.\n\nAnderson was initiated as an honorary member of the Gamma Omega chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] at Indiana State University in 1969.\n\n==Death==\nIn 1975, Anderson died of cancer in Woodbury, Connecticut<ref name=\"leroyanderson1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/061/000109731/ |title=Leroy Anderson |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> and was buried there.<ref>{{Find a Grave |grid=1807 |name=Leroy Anderson |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nFor his contribution to the recording industry, Leroy Anderson has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1620 Vine Street.

Previously, Los Angeles station [[KABC-TV]] used the song as its sign-off theme at the end of broadcast days in the 1980s, and [[Mantovani]]'s recording of the song had been the closing theme for WABC-TV's ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' for much of the 1970s. \"Forgotten Dreams\" was used as a recurring theme in the French film ''[[Populaire (film)|Populaire]]'' (2012).\n\n''The Typewriter'' was used as the theme song for ''Esto no tiene nombre'', a Puerto Rican television comedy program \u2013 loosely based on the TV series ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' \u2013 produced by [[Tommy Mu\u00f1iz]] between the late 1960s and late 1970s.

In 1936 his arrangements came to the attention of [[Arthur Fiedler]], who asked to see any original compositions that he could use in his concerts as the 18th conductor of the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] at [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Biography/Bio.htm |title=Leroy Anderson biographical material |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Anderson's first work was the 1938 ''Jazz Pizzicato'', but at just over ninety seconds the piece was too short for a three-minute 78 rpm single of the period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_JPizzicato.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Jazz Pizzicato |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Fiedler suggested writing a companion piece, and Anderson wrote ''Jazz Legato'' later that same year. The combined recording went on to become one of Anderson's signature compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_JLegato.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Jazz Legato |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1942 Anderson joined the United States Army, and was assigned in Iceland with the [[Counterintelligence Corps|U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps]] as a translator and interpreter;<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> in 1945 he was reassigned to [[the Pentagon]] as Chief of the Scandinavian Desk of Military Intelligence. His duties did not, however, prevent him from composing, and in 1945 he wrote \"[[The Syncopated Clock]]\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_SClock.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 The Syncopated Clock |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> and \"Promenade\". Anderson became a reserve officer and was recalled to active duty for the Korean War. He wrote his first hit, \"[[Blue Tango]]\", In 1951, earning a Golden Disc and the No. 1 spot on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].\n\nHis pieces and his recordings during the 1950s conducting a studio orchestra were immense commercial successes. \"Blue Tango\" was the first instrumental recording ever to sell one million copies. His most famous pieces are probably \"[[Sleigh Ride]]\" and \"The Syncopated Clock\". In February 1951, [[WCBS-TV]] in New York City selected \"The Syncopated Clock\" as the theme song for ''The Late Show'', the WCBS late-night movie, using [[Percy Faith]]'s recording. [[Mitchell Parish]] added words to \"The Syncopated Clock\", and later wrote lyrics for other Anderson tunes, including \"Sleigh Ride\", which was not written as a Christmas piece, but as a work that describes a winter event. Anderson started the work during a heat wave in August 1946. The Boston Pops' recording of it was the first pure orchestral piece to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Music chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Video&Music/Compositions_SRide.htm |title=Compositions \u2013 Sleigh Ride |publisher=PBS |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> From 1952 to 1961, Anderson's composition \"Plink, Plank, Plunk!\" was used as the theme for the CBS panel show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.\n\nAnderson's musical style employs creative instrumental effects and occasionally makes use of sound-generating items such as typewriters and sandpaper.\n\nAnderson wrote his Piano Concerto in C in 1953 but withdrew it, feeling that it had weak spots. The Anderson family decided to publish the work in 1988. [[Erich Kunzel]] and the [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra]] released the first recording of this work; four other recordings, including one for piano and organ, have since been released.\n\nIn 1958, Anderson composed the music for the Broadway show ''[[Goldilocks (musical)|Goldilocks]]'' with orchestrations by [[Philip J. Lang]]. Even though it earned two Tony awards, ''Goldilocks'' did not achieve commercial success. Anderson never wrote another musical, preferring instead to continue writing orchestral miniatures. His pieces, including \"[[The Typewriter]]\", \"Bugler's Holiday\", and \"[[A Trumpeter's Lullaby]]\" are performed by orchestras and bands ranging from school groups to professional organizations.\n\nAnderson would occasionally appear on the Boston Pops regular concerts on PBS to conduct his own music while Fiedler would sit on the sidelines. For \"The Typewriter\" Fiedler would don a green eyeshade, roll up his sleeves, and mime working on an old typewriter while the orchestra played.\n\nAnderson was initiated as an honorary member of the Gamma Omega chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] at Indiana State University in 1969.\n\n==Death==\nIn 1975, Anderson died of cancer in Woodbury, Connecticut<ref name=\"leroyanderson1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/061/000109731/ |title=Leroy Anderson |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> and was buried there.<ref>{{Find a Grave |grid=1807 |name=Leroy Anderson |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nFor his contribution to the recording industry, Leroy Anderson has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1620 Vine Street. He was posthumously inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1988, and his music continues to be a staple of \"pops\" orchestra repertoire. In 1995 the new headquarters of the Harvard University Band was named the Anderson Band Center in honor of Leroy Anderson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leroyandersonfoundation.org/cambridge.php |title=Leroy Anderson Foundation, Cambridge Massachusetts, Birthplace of Leroy Anderson [1908\u20131975&#93; |publisher=Leroyandersonfoundation.org |date= |access-date=2012-05-01}}</ref> The Leroy Anderson House in Woodbury, Connecticut has been placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>\"Leroy Anderson house, Woodbury\", Connecticut Preservation News, May/June 2013, Volume XXXVI, No. 3, page 9, CT Trust for Historic Preservation.</ref>\n\nIn 2006, one of his piano works, \"Forgotten Dreams\", written in 1954, became the background for a British TV advertisement for mobile phone company \"3\".
