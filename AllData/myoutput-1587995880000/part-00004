The North Eastern declined to be involved so the promoters of the railway sought assistance from the [[Midland Railway]] instead.  With some support from the Midland Railway, a company, the Guiseley, Yeadon & Rawdon, was formed and obtained, in 1885, an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|act of parliament]] to build a branch line from Rawdon Junction to Yeadon - a distance of just over one mile.{{sfnp|Joy|1984|p=72}}  In 1891 the company obtained parliamentary approval for an extension of the line to Headingley.  At the same time the company changed its name to the Guiseley, Yeadon & Headingley Railway Company.

During the [[Second World War]] there was an increase in  freight traffic due to an [[Avro]] aircraft factory being established at nearby [[Leeds Bradford International Airport#Wartime use|Leeds-Bradford airport]] but in spite of this demand the line was closed as a wartime economy measure in 1944.{{sfnp|Joy|1984|p=73}}  After the war the line reopened but the amount of traffic was never great and a decision was made to close both the station and the branch line.
