Prior to the invention of mass market [[gramophone record]]s (developed in 1892) and [[radio broadcasting]] (first commercially done ca. 1919\u201320), people mainly listened to music at live [[Classical music]] concerts or [[musical theatre]] shows, which were too expensive for many lower-income people; on early [[phonograph]] players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, using [[sheet music]], which required the ability hello to sing, play, and read music. These were skills that tended to be limited to [[middle class|middle-class]] and [[upper class|upper-class]] individuals. With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of [[song]]s and musical pieces from around the globe. This enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of [[Classical music]] [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[opera]]s that they would not be able to hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in their region. I \n\n[[Sound recording]] was also a major influence on the development of [[popular music]] genres, because it enabled recordings of [[song]]s and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide. The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including [[vinyl record]]s, [[compact cassette]]s, compdact discos (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, [[digital audio]] recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the [[Internet]], using [[file sharing]] of [[digital audio]] recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Arditi|first1=David|title=iTunes: Breaking Barriers and Building Walls|journal=Popular Music and Society|volume=37|issue=4|pages=408\u2013424|doi=10.1080/03007766.2013.810849|year=2014|hdl=10106/27052|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The introduction of [[multitrack recording]] in 1955 and the use of [[audio console|mixing]] had a major influence on [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]], because it enabled [[record producer]]s to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.<ref>Watson, Allan. ''Cultural Production in and Beyond the Recording Studio''. Routledge, 2014. (Multitrack recording and mixing made the recording \"...studio a tool of musical composition\" in which producers could \"...create a reality which could not actually exist\" in a live performance. p. 25)</ref> The development of [[sound recording]] and [[audio engineering]] technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the [[Musique concr\u00e8te]] (1949) and [[acousmatic]]<ref>Schaeffer, P. (1966), Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.</ref> (1955) schools of electronic composition. In the 1970s, [[African-American]] [[hip hop music]]ians began to use the [[phonograph|record turntable]] as a musical instrument, creating rhythmic and percussive \"[[scratching]]\" effects by manipulating a [[vinyl record]] on the turntable.\n\nIn Beethoven's and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s time in the 19th century, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as [[Berlioz]] and [[Mahler]], the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer. [[Saxophone]]s were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as [[Vaughan Williams]]' Symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|No.6]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|9]] and [[William Walton]]'s [[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|''Belshazzar's Feast'']], and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. Twentieth-century orchestras  generally include a [[string section]], [[woodwinds]], [[brass instruments]], [[percussion]], [[piano]], [[celesta|celeste]], [[harp]](s),<ref name=\"classical-orchestra-description-page\">{{cite web|title=The Classical Orchestra Description Page|url=http://www.classiccat.net/iv/orchestra.info.php|accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref> with other instruments called for occasionally, such as [[electric guitar]]<ref>Lagnella, David. ''The Composer's Guide to the Electric Guitar''. Mel Bay Publications, 2003. (Ex. Composers Tim Brady, Steve Mackey, Rhys Chatham, Ren\u00e9 Lussie, Glenn Branca, Scott Johnson and Eliot Sharp used the electric guitar in their chamber works and orchestral works, p. 5)</ref> and [[electric bass]].<ref>Walker-Hall, Helen.

Composer Margaret Harris-Schofield wrote ''Piano Concerto No. 2'' in 1971, scored for solo piano, full orchestra, electric bass and drums. p. 35)</ref>\n\nThe 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles. Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of [[altered chord]]s and [[extended chord]]s in 1940s-era [[Bebop jazz]]. The development of powerful, loud [[guitar amplifier]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]]s in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show. Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of [[jazz]] and [[rock music]] to create [[jazz fusion]]). As well, composers and musicians used new [[music technology (electric)|electric]], [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices]]. In the 1980s, some styles of music, such as [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[house music]] were created largely with [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. Faster modes of transportation such as [[jet flight]] allowed musicians and fans to travel more widely to perform or hear shows, which increased the spread of musical styles.\n\n==Classical==\n{{Main|20th-century classical music}}\n[[Image:Stravinsky picasso.png|upright|thumb|Composer [[Igor Stravinsky]] as drawn by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]]]\n\n===Modernism===\n{{Main|Modernism (music)}}\nIn the early 20th century, many composers, including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini]], and [[Edward Elgar]], continued to work in forms and in a musical language that derived from the 19th century. However, [[modernism]] in music became increasingly prominent and important; among the most important [[Modernism (music)|modernists]] were [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Claude Debussy]], and post-[[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss]], who experimented with form, tonality and orchestration.<ref name=\"Botstein 2001.\">Botstein 2001.</ref> [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], and [[Franz Schreker|Schreker]] were already recognized before 1914 as modernists, and [[Charles Ives|Ives]] was retrospectively also included in this category for his challenges to the uses of tonality.<ref name=\"Botstein 2001.\"/> Composers such as [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], and [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] combined classical and jazz idioms.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wooten|first1=Roy|title=Classical Music Meets American Jazz|url=http://nmaam.org/2016/04/20/classical-music-meets-american-jazz/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807163225/http://nmaam.org/2016/04/20/classical-music-meets-american-jazz/|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 August 2016|website=National Museum of African American Music|publisher=National Museum of African American Music|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Nationalism===\n{{Main|Nationalism (music)}}\nLate-Romantic and modernist nationalism was found also in British, American, and Latin-American music of the early 20th century. Composers such as [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Alberto Ginastera]], [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Silvestre Revueltas]], and [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] used folk themes collected by themselves or others in many of their major compositions.\n\n===Microtonal music===\n{{Main|Microtonal music}}\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, composers such as [[Juli\u00e1n Carrillo]], [[Mildred Couper]], [[Alois H\u00e1ba]], [[Charles Ives]], [[Erwin Schulhoff]], [[Ivan Wyschnegradsky]] turned their attention to [[quarter tone]]s (24 equal intervals per octave), and other finer divisions. In the middle of the century composers such as [[Harry Partch]] and [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] explored [[just intonation]]. In the second half of the century, prominent composers employing microtonality included [[Easley Blackwood, Jr.]], [[Wendy Carlos]], [[Adriaan Fokker]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Ezra Sims]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].\n\n===Neoclassicism===\n{{Main|Neoclassical music}}\nA dominant trend in music composed from 1923 to 1950 was neoclassicism, a reaction against the exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism which revived the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles. There were three distinct \"schools\" of neoclassicism, associated with [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Similar sympathies in the second half of the century are generally subsumed under the heading \"[[Postmodern music|postmodernism]]\".<ref>Whittall 2001.</ref>\n\n===Experimental music===\n{{Main|Experimental music}}\nA compositional tradition arose in the mid-20th century\u2014particularly in North America\u2014called \"experimental music\". Its most famous and influential exponent was [[John Cage]] (1912\u20131992).<ref>Grant 2003, 174</ref> According to Cage, \"an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen\",<ref>Cage 1961, 39</ref> and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an unpredictable action.<ref>Mauceri 1997, 197.</ref>\nSome of the composers who influenced [[John Cage]] were [[Erik Satie]] (1866\u20131925), [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874\u20131951) and [[Henry Dixon Cowell]] (1897\u20131965).\n\n===Minimalism===\n{{Main|Minimal music}}\nMinimalist music, involving a simplification of materials and intensive repetition of motives began in the late 1950s with the composers [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Philip Glass]]. Later, minimalism was adapted to a more traditional symphonic setting by composers including Reich, Glass, and [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]]. Minimalism was practiced heavily throughout the latter half of the century and has carried over into the 21st century, as well as composers like [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]], [[Henryk G\u00f3recki]] and [[John Tavener]] working in the ''[[holy minimalism]]'' variant. For more examples see ''[[List of 20th-century classical composers]]''.\n\n===Contemporary classical music===\n{{Main|Contemporary classical music}}\n\nContemporary classical music can be understood as belonging to the period that started in the mid-1970s to early 1990s, which includes [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].<ref>Botstein \"[http://www.grovemusic.com Modernism]\" \u00a79: The Late 20th Century (subscription access).</ref> However, the term  may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.<ref>\"Contemporary\" in Du Noyer 2003, 272.</ref>\n\nMany composers working in the early 21st century were prominent figures in the 20th century. Some younger composers such as [[Oliver Knussen]], [[Wolfgang Rihm]], [[Georg Friedrich Haas]], [[Judith Weir]], [[George Benson]], [[Richard Barrett (composer)|Richard Barrett]], [[Simon Bainbridge]], [[John Luther Adams]], [[Toshio Hosokawa]], [[Bright Sheng]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Tan Dun]], [[Magnus Lindberg]], [[Philippe Manoury]], [[Olga Neuwirth]], [[Rebecca Saunders]], [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]], [[Hanspeter Kyburz]], [[James MacMillan]], [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]], [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s]], [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Dalbavie]], [[Unsuk Chin]], [[Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf]], and [[Michael Daugherty]] did not rise to prominence until late in the 20th century. For more examples see ''[[List of 21st-century classical composers]]''.\n\n==Electronic music==\n[[File:Stockhausen 1991 Studio.jpg|thumb|[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] in the electronic-music studio of [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]], Cologne in 1991]]\n{{Main|Electronic music}}\n\nFor centuries, instrumental music had either been created by singing, or using [[music technology#Mechanical|mechanical music technologies]], such as drawing a bow across a string that is strung on a hollow instrument or plucking taut gut or metal strings ([[string instruments]]), constricting vibrating air ([[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] and [[Brass instrument|brass]]) or hitting something to make rhythmic sounds ([[percussion instrument]]s). In the early twentieth century, [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic devices]] were invented that were capable of generating sound electronically, without an initial mechanical source of vibration. As early as the 1930s, composers such as [[Olivier Messiaen]] incorporated electronic instruments into live performance. While [[sound recording]] technology is often associated with the key role it played in enabling the creation and mass marketing of [[popular music]], new electric and electronic sound recording technology was used to produce art music, as well. The [[musique concr\u00e8te]] (French: \u201cconcrete music\u201d), developed about 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer and his associates, was an experimental technique using recorded sounds as raw material.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musique concr\u00e8te \u2013 Musical composition technique|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/musique-concrete|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the years following [[World War II]], some composers were quick to adopt developing electronic technology. Electronic music was embraced by composers such as [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Henri Pousseur]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], [[Ernst Krenek]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Herbert Br\u00fcn]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]]. In the 1950s the film industry also began to make extensive use of electronic [[soundtrack]]s. Major rock groups that were early adopters of synthesizers include [[The Moody Blues]], [[The Beatles]],<ref>W.

This is in contrast to [[old-time music]], in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment. Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid [[tempo]]s and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex [[chord change]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=A short History of Bluegrass Music|url=http://renoandharrell.com/content/short-history-bluegrass-music|website=Reno & Harrell|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre. [[Traditional bluegrass]] has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being [[Bill Monroe]]. [[Progressive bluegrass]] groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock & roll. Examples include [[Cadillac Sky]] and [[Bearfoot (American band)|Bearfoot]]. \"[[Bluegrass gospel]]\" has emerged as a third subgenre, which uses [[Christianity|Christian]] lyrics, soulful three- or four-part [[harmony]] singing, and sometimes the playing of [[instrumentals]]. A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as [[The Grascals]] and [[Mountain Heart]], bands from this subgenre typically have more than one lead singer. Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide. Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe characterized the genre as: \"[[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Baptists|Baptist]].

Prior to the invention of mass market [[gramophone record]]s (developed in 1892) and [[radio broadcasting]] (first commercially done ca. 1919\u201320), people mainly listened to music at live [[Classical music]] concerts or [[musical theatre]] shows, which were too expensive for many lower-income people; on early [[phonograph]] players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, using [[sheet music]], which required the ability to sing, play, and read music. These were skills that tended to be limited to [[middle class|middle-class]] and [[upper class|upper-class]] individuals. With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of [[song]]s and musical pieces from around the globe. This enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of [[Classical music]] [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[opera]]s that they would not be able to hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in their region.\n\n[[Sound recording]] was also a major influence on the development of [[popular music]] genres, because it enabled recordings of [[song]]s and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide. The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including [[vinyl record]]s, [[compact cassette]]s, [[compact disc]]s (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, [[digital audio]] recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the [[Internet]], using [[file sharing]] of [[digital audio]] recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Arditi|first1=David|title=iTunes: Breaking Barriers and Building Walls|journal=Popular Music and Society|volume=37|issue=4|pages=408\u2013424|doi=10.1080/03007766.2013.810849|year=2014|hdl=10106/27052|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The introduction of [[multitrack recording]] in 1955 and the use of [[audio console|mixing]] had a major influence on [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]], because it enabled [[record producer]]s to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.<ref>Watson, Allan. ''Cultural Production in and Beyond the Recording Studio''. Routledge, 2014. (Multitrack recording and mixing made the recording \"...studio a tool of musical composition\" in which producers could \"...create a reality which could not actually exist\" in a live performance. p. 25)</ref> The development of [[sound recording]] and [[audio engineering]] technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the [[Musique concr\u00e8te]] (1949) and [[acousmatic]]<ref>Schaeffer, P. (1966), Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.</ref> (1955) schools of electronic composition. In the 1970s, [[African-American]] [[hip hop music]]ians began to use the [[phonograph|record turntable]] as a musical instrument, creating rhythmic and percussive \"[[scratching]]\" effects by manipulating a [[vinyl record]] on the turntable.\n\nIn Beethoven's and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s time in the 19th century, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as [[Berlioz]] and [[Mahler]], the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer. [[Saxophone]]s were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as [[Vaughan Williams]]' Symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|No.6]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|9]] and [[William Walton]]'s [[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|''Belshazzar's Feast'']], and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. Twentieth-century orchestras  generally include a [[string section]], [[woodwinds]], [[brass instruments]], [[percussion]], [[piano]], [[celesta|celeste]], [[harp]](s),<ref name=\"classical-orchestra-description-page\">{{cite web|title=The Classical Orchestra Description Page|url=http://www.classiccat.net/iv/orchestra.info.php|accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref> with other instruments called for occasionally, such as [[electric guitar]]<ref>Lagnella, David. ''The Composer's Guide to the Electric Guitar''. Mel Bay Publications, 2003. (Ex. Composers Tim Brady, Steve Mackey, Rhys Chatham, Ren\u00e9 Lussie, Glenn Branca, Scott Johnson and Eliot Sharp used the electric guitar in their chamber works and orchestral works, p. 5)</ref> and [[electric bass]].<ref>Walker-Hall, Helen.

Composer Margaret Harris-Schofield wrote ''Piano Concerto No. 2'' in 1971, scored for solo piano, full orchestra, electric bass and drums. p. 35)</ref>\n\nThe 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles. Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of [[altered chord]]s and [[extended chord]]s in 1940s-era [[Bebop jazz]]. The development of powerful, loud [[guitar amplifier]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]]s in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show. Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of [[jazz]] and [[rock music]] to create [[jazz fusion]]). As well, composers and musicians used new [[music technology (electric)|electric]], [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices]]. In the 1980s, some styles of music, such as [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[house music]] were created largely with [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. Faster modes of transportation such as [[jet flight]] allowed musicians and fans to travel more widely to perform or hear shows, which increased the spread of musical styles.\n\n==Classical==\n{{Main|20th-century classical music}}\n[[Image:Stravinsky picasso.png|upright|thumb|Composer [[Igor Stravinsky]] as drawn by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]]]\n\n===Modernism===\n{{Main|Modernism (music)}}\nIn the early 20th century, many composers, including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini]], and [[Edward Elgar]], continued to work in forms and in a musical language that derived from the 19th century. However, [[modernism]] in music became increasingly prominent and important; among the most important [[Modernism (music)|modernists]] were [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Claude Debussy]], and post-[[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss]], who experimented with form, tonality and orchestration.<ref name=\"Botstein 2001.\">Botstein 2001.</ref> [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], and [[Franz Schreker|Schreker]] were already recognized before 1914 as modernists, and [[Charles Ives|Ives]] was retrospectively also included in this category for his challenges to the uses of tonality.<ref name=\"Botstein 2001.\"/> Composers such as [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], and [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] combined classical and jazz idioms.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wooten|first1=Roy|title=Classical Music Meets American Jazz|url=http://nmaam.org/2016/04/20/classical-music-meets-american-jazz/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807163225/http://nmaam.org/2016/04/20/classical-music-meets-american-jazz/|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 August 2016|website=National Museum of African American Music|publisher=National Museum of African American Music|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Nationalism===\n{{Main|Nationalism (music)}}\nLate-Romantic and modernist nationalism was found also in British, American, and Latin-American music of the early 20th century. Composers such as [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Alberto Ginastera]], [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Silvestre Revueltas]], and [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] used folk themes collected by themselves or others in many of their major compositions.\n\n===Microtonal music===\n{{Main|Microtonal music}}\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, composers such as [[Juli\u00e1n Carrillo]], [[Mildred Couper]], [[Alois H\u00e1ba]], [[Charles Ives]], [[Erwin Schulhoff]], [[Ivan Wyschnegradsky]] turned their attention to [[quarter tone]]s (24 equal intervals per octave), and other finer divisions. In the middle of the century composers such as [[Harry Partch]] and [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] explored [[just intonation]]. In the second half of the century, prominent composers employing microtonality included [[Easley Blackwood, Jr.]], [[Wendy Carlos]], [[Adriaan Fokker]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Ezra Sims]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].\n\n===Neoclassicism===\n{{Main|Neoclassical music}}\nA dominant trend in music composed from 1923 to 1950 was neoclassicism, a reaction against the exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism which revived the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles. There were three distinct \"schools\" of neoclassicism, associated with [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Similar sympathies in the second half of the century are generally subsumed under the heading \"[[Postmodern music|postmodernism]]\".<ref>Whittall 2001.</ref>\n\n===Experimental music===\n{{Main|Experimental music}}\nA compositional tradition arose in the mid-20th century\u2014particularly in North America\u2014called \"experimental music\". Its most famous and influential exponent was [[John Cage]] (1912\u20131992).<ref>Grant 2003, 174</ref> According to Cage, \"an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen\",<ref>Cage 1961, 39</ref> and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an unpredictable action.<ref>Mauceri 1997, 197.</ref>\nSome of the composers who influenced [[John Cage]] were [[Erik Satie]] (1866\u20131925), [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874\u20131951) and [[Henry Dixon Cowell]] (1897\u20131965).\n\n===Minimalism===\n{{Main|Minimal music}}\nMinimalist music, involving a simplification of materials and intensive repetition of motives began in the late 1950s with the composers [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Philip Glass]]. Later, minimalism was adapted to a more traditional symphonic setting by composers including Reich, Glass, and [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]]. Minimalism was practiced heavily throughout the latter half of the century and has carried over into the 21st century, as well as composers like [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]], [[Henryk G\u00f3recki]] and [[John Tavener]] working in the ''[[holy minimalism]]'' variant. For more examples see ''[[List of 20th-century classical composers]]''.\n\n===Contemporary classical music===\n{{Main|Contemporary classical music}}\n\nContemporary classical music can be understood as belonging to the period that started in the mid-1970s to early 1990s, which includes [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].<ref>Botstein \"[http://www.grovemusic.com Modernism]\" \u00a79: The Late 20th Century (subscription access).</ref> However, the term  may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.<ref>\"Contemporary\" in Du Noyer 2003, 272.</ref>\n\nMany composers working in the early 21st century were prominent figures in the 20th century. Some younger composers such as [[Oliver Knussen]], [[Wolfgang Rihm]], [[Georg Friedrich Haas]], [[Judith Weir]], [[George Benson]], [[Richard Barrett (composer)|Richard Barrett]], [[Simon Bainbridge]], [[John Luther Adams]], [[Toshio Hosokawa]], [[Bright Sheng]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Tan Dun]], [[Magnus Lindberg]], [[Philippe Manoury]], [[Olga Neuwirth]], [[Rebecca Saunders]], [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]], [[Hanspeter Kyburz]], [[James MacMillan]], [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]], [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s]], [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Dalbavie]], [[Unsuk Chin]], [[Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf]], and [[Michael Daugherty]] did not rise to prominence until late in the 20th century. For more examples see ''[[List of 21st-century classical composers]]''.\n\n==Electronic music==\n[[File:Stockhausen 1991 Studio.jpg|thumb|[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] in the electronic-music studio of [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]], Cologne in 1991]]\n{{Main|Electronic music}}\n\nFor centuries, instrumental music had either been created by singing, or using [[music technology#Mechanical|mechanical music technologies]], such as drawing a bow across a string that is strung on a hollow instrument or plucking taut gut or metal strings ([[string instruments]]), constricting vibrating air ([[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] and [[Brass instrument|brass]]) or hitting something to make rhythmic sounds ([[percussion instrument]]s). In the early twentieth century, [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic devices]] were invented that were capable of generating sound electronically, without an initial mechanical source of vibration. As early as the 1930s, composers such as [[Olivier Messiaen]] incorporated electronic instruments into live performance. While [[sound recording]] technology is often associated with the key role it played in enabling the creation and mass marketing of [[popular music]], new electric and electronic sound recording technology was used to produce art music, as well. The [[musique concr\u00e8te]] (French: \u201cconcrete music\u201d), developed about 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer and his associates, was an experimental technique using recorded sounds as raw material.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musique concr\u00e8te \u2013 Musical composition technique|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/musique-concrete|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the years following [[World War II]], some composers were quick to adopt developing electronic technology. Electronic music was embraced by composers such as [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Henri Pousseur]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], [[Ernst Krenek]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Herbert Br\u00fcn]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]]. In the 1950s the film industry also began to make extensive use of electronic [[soundtrack]]s.

This is in contrast to [[old-time music]], in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment. Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid [[tempo]]s and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex [[chord change]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=A short History of Bluegrass Music|url=http://renoandharrell.com/content/short-history-bluegrass-music|website=Reno & Harrell|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre. [[Traditional bluegrass]] has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being [[Bill Monroe]]. [[Progressive bluegrass]] groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock & roll. Examples include [[Cadillac Sky]] and [[Bearfoot (American band)|Bearfoot]]. \"[[Bluegrass gospel]]\" has emerged as a third subgenre, which uses [[Christianity|Christian]] lyrics, soulful three- or four-part [[harmony]] singing, and sometimes the playing of [[instrumentals]]. A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as [[The Grascals]] and [[Mountain Heart]], bands from this subgenre typically have more than one lead singer. Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide. Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe characterized the genre as: \"[[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Baptists|Baptist]].
