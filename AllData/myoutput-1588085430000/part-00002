She is the wife of villain [[Mr. Freeze]], and was introduced in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.\n\nNora Fries made her first live action debut in the movie ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', played by supermodel [[Vendela Kirsebom|Vendela Kirsebom Thomessen]]. She has also appeared in the [[Gotham (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', portrayed by [[Kristen Hager]], and the 2018 [[Arrowverse]] crossover event ''[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]'', portrayed by [[Cassandra Jean|Cassandra Jean Amell]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===[[DC animated universe|DC Animated Universe]] (1992-2006)===\nAfter marrying Victor Fries, a [[cryogenics]] researcher working for GothCorp, Nora is diagnosed with a [[terminal illness]]. Fries uses the company's equipment to cryogenically freeze his wife until a cure can be found. GothCorp CEO Ferris Boyle cuts the funding and later goes into Fries' laboratory to shut down the project personally with some security guards. According to \u201cHeart of Ice\u201d, Nora is presumed dead after the resulting scuffle, which destroys the lab. However, in the episode \"Deep Freeze\" Nora is revealed to still be alive within her chamber.\n\nVictor, who has by then become Mr. Freeze, eventually retrieves Nora's chamber and keeps it in his cave in the [[Arctic]] until ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', when Nora's chamber is broken. No longer frozen, Nora does not have long to live. In desperation, Freeze bribes an old colleague into helping her. This leads to Freeze hunting down [[Barbara Gordon]], one of the few women on hospital records with Nora's rare blood type. Freeze plans to use Barbara for a fatal [[organ transplant]] to save Nora, but Batman intervenes. Nora is ultimately cured by Dr. Lyle Johnston of [[Wayne Enterprises]].\n\nAccording to ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' episode \"Cold Comfort\", Nora waits for the missing and presumed dead Freeze for some time before she decides to marry her doctor Francis D'Anjou. This subplot is expanded in ''[[Batman Adventures]]'', a comic series based on ''Batman: The Animated Series'', with one issue seeing Freeze working with Nightwing and Batgirl to stop a criminal who has abducted Francis D'Anjou out of recognition of Nora's feelings for him. \n\nIn Volume 2, after Nora receives a letter from Victor, D'Anjou is frozen in their home in an attack from Victor's technology. Batman and the police believe that Mr. Freeze was behind the attack and are suspicious of both his and Nora's intentions when Nora gets a ticket to the Arctic Circle. [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] discovers that the attack was set up by D'Anjou himself in an attempt to frame Victor and make Nora hate him. D'Anjou is quickly defeated and arrested by Nightwing. In the Arctic Circle, Nora reunites with Victor to confirm he wasn't behind the attack and confesses that she never truly loved Francis as she embraces him. Batman and Batgirl arrive to apprehend Victor, who chooses to fight back thinking Batman will arrest him for his other crimes even if he isn't responsible for D'Anjou's attack. During their fight, Batman causes Victor's suit to overload which leaves his head to fall into the Arctic Ocean, devastating Nora. After talking to her incarcerated ex-husband and Victor's former assistant Koonak (whom Victor looked after following the death of Koonak's parents), Nora returns to the Arctic Circle, hoping to find Victor's head.\n\nThe web cartoon ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' also reveals that Nora has a younger sister named Dora Smithy. Dora is very close to Nora and hates Victor Fries for keeping her sister in a [[coma]]. Dora's campaign against costumed [[vigilante]]s and villains results in her becoming one herself in the series finale.\n\nBy the time of ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', Nora is not seen; however, when Mr. Freeze (whose frozen body slows his aging to an almost [[Immortality|immortal]] level) returns to his normal human self of Victor Fries in the episode \"Meltdown\", he starts a Nora Fries Foundation in memory of his wife.\n\nNora Fries has never had a [[voice actress]] on appearances in the animated series, she is always unconscious (usually floating in the cryogenic tank); the only time she is seen awake is in photographs and at the end of ''Batman & Mr. Freeze: Subzero'', when a report is shown of her recovery.\n\n===Comic books===\n====Falling ill====\nNora is an attractive and gentle girl. She meets Victor Fries in a strict boarding school and later marries him. Shortly after their marriage, Nora falls terminally ill.

Mr. Freeze has been working to find a cure for Nora after freezing Harley and claiming his territory in \"New New Gotham\". When Harley's plans to get revenge on Freeze ends in her capture, Mr. Freeze tries to use her as his first human subject to test for a cure. In order to save herself, Harley persuades Freeze to spare her after mentioning that her friend, [[Poison Ivy (character) |Poison Ivy]], could find a cure for his wife. After witnessing Freeze's strange behavior with Nora's frozen body, Harley comes to the conclusion that Freeze froze Nora after she decided to leave him and that he had made up her disease as a means to justify it. Harley defrosts her body and breaks Freeze's gun only to find he had been telling the truth. She is eventually cured by Poison Ivy, though at the cost of Mr. Freeze's life, who sacrificed himself to give her the cure via a blood transfusion.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Thawing Hearts|episode-link=|series=Harley Quinn|series-link=Harley Quinn (TV series)|network=DC Universe|date=April 24, 2020|season=2|number=4|last=Hyndman|first=Tom}}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nNora Fries is played by supermodel [[Vendela Kirsebom|Vendela Kirsebom Thomessen]] in the 1997 movie ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''. She is cryogenically frozen throughout the movie and has no dialogue. In the film, she suffers from a fictional illness called MacGregor's Syndrome. Batman reveals that she has the most advanced stages of this disease, for which Mr. Freeze has yet to find a cure. [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] pulls the plug on Nora\u2019s cryogenic tank in an attempt to kill her and have Frozen to herself. Nora lives, however, as her cryo-chamber was restored in time, and [[Batman]] has her sent to [[Arkham Asylum]] so that [[Mr. Freeze]] can continue his research for a cure during his imprisonment there.\n\n===Video games===\n\n* Nora Fries appears in ''[[Batman: The Enemy Within]]''. Her body is kept frozen in Mr. Freeze's part of The Pact's hideout. When infiltrating the Pact on [[Amanda Waller]]'s behalf, Bruce Wayne can win Mr. Freeze over through promises to cure his wife Nora Fries after making sure the cryogenic technology was not damaged by the EMP that was accidentally set off by \"John Doe.\"\n\n* Nora Fries is mentioned in ''[[Injustice 2]]'' in pre-battle dialogue by Mister Freeze who is researching a way to cure Nora.\n\n* Nora is the default female name for the sole survivor in ''[[Fallout 4]]'' who is cryogenically frozen at the beginning of the video game.\n\n==== ''Batman: Arkham'' ====\nNora Fries appears in most games in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' series.\n\n*Chronologically, she first appears in the ''Cold Cold Heart'' [[Downloadable content|DLC]] for ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', in cryostasis. In this continuity, her terminal disease is [[Huntington's Chorea]]. Victor Fries made a deal with Ferris Boyle, secretly developing weapons for GothCorp in exchange for Boyle devoting his company's resources to finding a cure. However, when Fries discovered that Boyle never intended to uphold his end of the deal, Boyle removed Nora from his lab to another section. The struggle that followed resulted in the accident that transformed Victor into the villain Mr. Freeze, bent on saving his wife at all costs and exacting revenge on Boyle. Freeze kidnaps Boyle to force him to release Nora. When Nora's chamber begins to lose power, Boyle tries to stop Freeze from saving her, intent on forcing Freeze to watch his wife die. Batman intervenes, however, and saves Nora while subduing Boyle.\n*In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', Nora is still in cryostasis, and Mr. Freeze is said to have been working on a cure for her while imprisoned in the titular mega-prison. However, the prison's warden, [[Hugo Strange|Dr. Hugo Strange]], had Nora's cryogenics chamber stolen and delivered to the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], who demand that Freeze creates a cure for the Joker's disease in exchange for returning her. Upon being saved by Batman from the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s clutches, Freeze asks him to find Nora's chamber in Arkham City in exchange for developing a cure for the Joker's disease, which Batman also suffers from, having been infected by the Joker. The player can find Nora and relay her location to Mr. Freeze in a side mission, aptly named \"Heart of Ice\". Nora's biography states that she was a gifted dancer. Mr. Freeze's interview tapes recount his first meeting Nora at a reform school and marrying her soon after, only to realize Nora was terminally ill. He tried to put her in a state of cryogenic sleep until a cure could be found. Ferris Boyle discovered the experiment and tried to stop it, claiming that Victor was illegally using GothCorp property. Victor attacked Boyle, who knocked him into a vat of cryogenic chemicals and left him to die. Victor then became  Mr. Freeze and planned on murdering Boyle and reclaiming his wife. At first, Batman tried to stop him, not knowing his intentions, but eventually learned of Boyle's actions and helped Freeze to be reunited with Nora, while stopping him from killing Boyle, who was exposed and arrested, leading to Freeze being grateful to Batman. After the completion of the side mission, Nora is last seen reunited with Freeze, who thanks Batman for finding her.\n\n* Nora appears again in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Cissy Jones]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/cissyspeaks/status/791685444710768640]</ref> She appears in the \"Season of Infamy\" DLC pack, in the side mission \"In From the Cold\". Members of [[Arkham Knight]]'s militia steal Nora's cryogenics chamber to try to force Mr. Freeze to kill Batman for them. Batman helps Freeze track down the chamber. When he finds it, he is forced to release Nora. Nora tells Victor that she no longer wants him to try and save her. Mr. Freeze sacrifices his equipment to stop the militia and he is reunited with Nora. Mr. Freeze removes his helmet and informs his wife that they have mere days to live. They then sail away together and Batman tells [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] not to track their ship and to let them go.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nNora Fries is featured in the ''[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]'' digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Nora_Fries_(New_Earth) Nora Fries] at the DC Database\n* [https://dcanimated.fancom.com/wiki/Nora_Fries Nora Fries] at [http://dcanimated.wikia.com/wiki/DCAU_Wiki the DC Animated Universe Wiki]\n\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{DC Animated Universe}}\n{{Batman: The Animated Series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fries, Nora}}\n[[Category:Fictional cryonically preserved characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional necromancers]]\n[[Category:Batman: The Animated Series characters]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Female characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bruce Timm]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Paul Dini]]\n[[Category:DC animated universe characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics character\n|image=Nora Fries.jpg\n|caption=Cover art of ''Detective Comics'' #1014 (October 2019).
