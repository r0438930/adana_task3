Oxford University Press, 26 July 2008.</ref>\n\nAs jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]] began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French [[quadrille]]s, [[biguine]], ragtime and [[blues]] with collective [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[improvisation]]. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented [[Swing (music)|swing]] [[big band]]s, [[Kansas City jazz]], a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and [[Gypsy jazz]] (a style that emphasized [[Bal-musette|musette]] waltzes) were the prominent styles. [[Bebop]] emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. [[Cool jazz]] developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.\n\nThe 1950s saw the emergence of [[free jazz]], which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, and in the mid-1950s, [[hard bop]] emerged, which introduced influences from [[rhythm and blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. [[Modal jazz]] developed in the late 1950s, using the [[musical mode|mode]], or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. [[Jazz fusion|Jazz-rock fusion]] appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with [[rock music]]'s rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called [[smooth jazz]] became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as [[Latin jazz|Latin]] and [[Afro-Cuban jazz]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== <span id=\"Definition\"></span> Etymology and definition==\n{{Main|Jazz (word)}}\n[[File:EubieBlake.jpg|thumb|right|American jazz composer, lyricist, and pianist [[Eubie Blake]] made an early contribution to the genre's etymology]]\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1915, Composition pour Jazz, oil on cardboard, 73 x 73 cm, Solomon R.

The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence of earlier forms of music such as [[blues]], a form of folk music which arose in part from the [[work song]]s and [[field holler]]s of African-American slaves on plantations. These work songs were commonly structured around a repetitive [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] pattern, but early blues was also improvisational. [[Classical music]] performance is evaluated more by its fidelity to the [[sheet music|musical score]], with less attention given to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment. The classical performer's goal is to play the composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction and collaboration, placing less value on the contribution of the composer, if there is one, and more on the performer.<ref>Giddins 1998, 70.</ref> The jazz performer interprets a tune in individual ways, never playing the same composition twice. Depending on the performer's mood, experience, and interaction with band members or audience members, the performer may change melodies, harmonies, and time signatures.<ref>Giddins 1998, 89.</ref>\n\nIn early [[Dixieland]], a.k.a. New Orleans jazz, performers took turns playing melodies and improvising [[countermelodies]]. In the [[Swing music|swing]] era of the 1920s\u2013'40s, [[big bands]] relied more on [[arrangements]] which were written or learned by ear and memorized. Soloists improvised within these arrangements. In the [[bebop]] era of the 1940s, big bands gave way to small groups and minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated briefly at the beginning and most of the song was improvised. [[Modal jazz]] abandoned [[chord progressions]] to allow musicians to improvise even more. In many forms of jazz, a soloist is supported by a [[rhythm section]] of one or more chordal instruments (piano, guitar), double bass, and drums. The rhythm section plays chords and rhythms that outline the song structure and complement the soloist.<ref>[http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/jazz-drums/jazz-drumming/ Jazz Drum Lessons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027050049/http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/jazz-drums/jazz-drumming/ |date=October 27, 2010 }} \u2013 Drumbook.org</ref> In [[avant-garde jazz|avant-garde]] and [[free jazz]], the separation of soloist and band is reduced, and there is license, or even a requirement, for the abandoning of chords, scales, and meters.\n\n===Tradition and race===\nSince the emergence of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized. According to Bruce Johnson, there has always been a \"tension between jazz as a commercial music and an art form\".<ref name=\"Elsdon\">In [http://www.fzmw.de/2003/2003_12.htm Review of ''The Cambridge Companion to Jazz''] by Peter Elsdon, ''FZMw (Frankfurt Journal of Musicology)'' No. 6, 2003.</ref> Traditional jazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop, free jazz, and jazz fusion as forms of debasement and betrayal.

Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, it was always the same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect ... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major ... , and I carried this device into my melody as well.<ref name=\"Handy, Father 1941, p. 99\">Handy, Father (1941), p. 99.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe publication of his \"[[The Memphis Blues|Memphis Blues]]\" sheet music in 1912 introduced the 12-bar blues to the world (although Gunther Schuller argues that it is not really a blues, but \"more like a cakewalk\"<ref>Schuller (1968: 66, 145n.)</ref>).

Bix Beiderbecke formed The Wolverines in 1924.\n\nDespite its Southern black origins, there was a larger market for jazzy dance music played by white orchestras. In 1918, [[Paul Whiteman]] and his orchestra became a hit in San Francisco. He signed a contract with [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] and became the top bandleader of the 1920s, giving hot jazz a white component, hiring white musicians such as [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Frankie Trumbauer]], and [[Joe Venuti]]. In 1924, Whiteman commissioned George Gershwin's ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which was premiered by his orchestra. Jazz began to be recognized as a notable musical form. [[Olin Downes]], reviewing the concert in ''The New York Times'', wrote, \"This composition shows extraordinary talent, as it shows a young composer with aims that go far beyond those of his ilk, struggling with a form of which he is far from being master. ... In spite of all this, he has expressed himself in a significant and, on the whole, highly original form. ... His first theme ... is no mere dance-tune ... it is an idea, or several ideas, correlated and combined in varying and contrasting rhythms that immediately intrigue the listener.\"<ref name=\"Downes\">{{cite news |last1=Downes |first1=Olin |title=A Concert of Jazz |work=The New York Times |date=February 13, 1924 |page=16}}</ref>\n\nAfter Whiteman's band successfully toured Europe, huge hot jazz orchestras in theater pits caught on with other whites, including [[Fred Waring]], [[Jean Goldkette]], and [[Nathaniel Shilkret]]. According to Mario Dunkel, Whiteman's success was based on a \"rhetoric of domestication\" according to which he had elevated and rendered valuable (read \"white\") a previously inchoate (read \"black\") kind of music.<ref name=\"Dunkel\">{{cite journal |last1=Dunkel |first1=Mario |title=W.

The original New Orleans style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong was a master of his hometown style, but by the time he joined Henderson's band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong's solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong's bandmates (including a young [[Coleman Hawkins]]), sounded \"stiff, stodgy,\" with \"jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schuller|1968|p=91}}.</ref> The following example shows a short excerpt of the straight melody of \"Mandy, Make Up Your Mind\" by [[George W.

Key figures in developing the \"big\" jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers [[Count Basie]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Jimmy Dorsey|Jimmy]] and [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Earl Hines]], [[Harry James]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]], [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Artie Shaw]]. Although it was a collective sound, swing also offered individual musicians a chance to \"solo\" and improvise melodic, thematic solos which could at times be complex \"important\" music.\n\nOver time, social strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in America: white bandleaders began to recruit black musicians and black bandleaders white ones. In the mid-1930s, Benny Goodman hired pianist [[Teddy Wilson]], vibraphonist [[Lionel Hampton]] and guitarist [[Charlie Christian]] to join small groups. In the 1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist [[Lester Young]] marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or [[jump blues]] used small combos, uptempo music and blues chord progressions, drawing on [[boogie woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]] from the 1930s.\n\n===The influence of Duke Ellington===\n[[File:Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club 1943.jpg|thumb|upright|Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club (1943)]]\n\nWhile swing was reaching the height of its popularity, [[Duke Ellington]] spent the late 1920s and 1930s developing an innovative musical idiom for his orchestra. Abandoning the conventions of swing, he experimented with orchestral sounds, harmony, and [[musical form]] with complex compositions that still translated well for popular audiences; some of his tunes became [[hit single|hits]], and his own popularity spanned from the United States to Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van de Leur |first=Walter |chapter=12 \"Seldom seen, but always heard\": Billy Strayhorn and Duke Ellington |title=The Cambridge Companion to Duke Ellington |editor-last=Green |editor-first=Edward |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-316-19413-3 |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nEllington called his music ''American Music'', rather than ''jazz'', and liked to describe those who impressed him as \"beyond category.\"<ref name=\"Tucker-1\">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1995|p=6}} writes \"He tried to avoid the word 'jazz' preferring 'Negro' or 'American' music.

He often composed for the style and skills of these individuals, such as \"Jeep's Blues\" for [[Johnny Hodges]], \"Concerto for Cootie\" for [[Cootie Williams]] (which later became \"[[Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me]]\" with [[Bob Russell (songwriter)|Bob Russell]]'s lyrics), and \"The Mooche\" for [[Tricky Sam Nanton]] and [[Bubber Miley]]. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as [[Juan Tizol]]'s \"[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]\" and \"[[Perdido (song)|Perdido]]\", which brought the \"Spanish Tinge\" to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained with him for several decades. The band reached a creative peak in the early 1940s, when Ellington and a small hand-picked group of his composers and arrangers wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoryjazz.com/artists/ellington.html |title=Jazz Musicians \u2013 Duke Ellington |publisher=Theory Jazz |accessdate=July 14, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903233432/http://theoryjazz.com/artists/ellington.html |archivedate=September 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Beginnings of European jazz===\nAs only a limited number of American jazz records were released in Europe, European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, and [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], who visited Europe during and after World War I.

Vocalists of the famous big bands moved on to being marketed and performing as solo pop singers; these included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Dick Haymes]], and [[Doris Day]].<ref name=\"Trynka\"/> Older musicians who still performed their pre-war jazz, such as Armstrong and Ellington, were gradually viewed in the mainstream as pass\u00e9. Other younger performers, such as singer [[Big Joe Turner]] and saxophonist [[Louis Jordan]], who were discouraged by bebop's increasing complexity pursued more lucrative endeavors in rhythm and blues, [[jump blues]], and eventually [[rock and roll]].<ref name=\"Burchett\"/> Some, including Gillespie, composed intricate yet danceable songs for bebop musicians in an effort to make them more accessible, but bebop largely remained on the fringes of American audiences' purview. \"The new direction of postwar jazz drew a wealth of critical acclaim, but it steadily declined in popularity as it developed a reputation as an academic genre that was largely inaccessible to mainstream audiences\", Burchett said. \"The quest to make jazz more relevant to popular audiences, while retaining its artistic integrity, is a constant and prevalent theme in the history of postwar jazz.\"<ref name=\"Burchett\"/> During its swing period, jazz had been an uncomplicated musical scene; according to [[Paul Trynka]], this changed in the post-war years:\n\n{{quote|Suddenly jazz was no longer straightforward.

The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]], pianists [[Bud Powell]] and [[Thelonious Monk]], trumpeters [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Clifford Brown]], and drummer [[Max Roach]]. Divorcing itself from dance music, bebop established itself more as an art form, thus lessening its potential popular and commercial appeal.\n\nComposer [[Gunther Schuller]] wrote: \"In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it and all those other great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Dizzy Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was 'bop' and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings.\"<ref>Gunther Schuller November 14, 1972. Dance, p. 290.</ref>\n\nDizzy Gillespie wrote: \"People talk about the Hines band being 'the incubator of bop' and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The difference was in how you got from here to here to here...naturally each age has got its own shit.\"<ref>Dance p. 260.</ref>\n\nSince bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it could use faster tempos. Drumming shifted to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the [[ride cymbal]] was used to keep time while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity.<ref name=\"Floyd, Samuel A. 1995\">Floyd, Samuel A., Jr. (1995). ''The Power of Black Music: Interpreting its history from Africa to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nBebop musicians employed several harmonic devices which were not previously typical in jazz, engaging in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation. Bebop scales are traditional scales with an added chromatic passing note;<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=171}}.</ref> bebop also uses \"passing\" chords, [[substitute chord]]s, and [[altered chord]]s. New forms of [[chromaticism]] and [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] were introduced into jazz, and the dissonant [[tritone]] (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\"<ref>Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book'', 1981, p. 15.</ref> Chord progressions for bebop tunes were often taken directly from popular swing-era songs and reused with a new and more complex melody and/or reharmonized with more complex chord progressions to form new compositions, a practice which was already well-established in earlier jazz, but came to be central to the bebop style. Bebop made use of several relatively common chord progressions, such as blues (at base, I-IV-V, but often infused with ii-V motion) and 'rhythm changes' (I-VI-ii-V) \u2013 the chords to the 1930s pop standard \"[[I Got Rhythm]]\". Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show tunes.\n\nThe harmonic development in bebop is often traced back to a moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing \"Cherokee\" at [[Clark Monroe's Uptown House]], New York, in early 1942. \"I'd been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used...and I kept thinking there's bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes. I couldn't play it...I was working over 'Cherokee,' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive.\"<ref name=\"Kubik\">{{cite journal |last1=Kubik |first1=Gerhard |title=Bebop: A Case in Point. The African Matrix in Jazz Harmonic Practices |journal=Black Music Research Journal |date=22 March 2005}}</ref> [[Gerhard Kubik]] postulates that harmonic development in bebop sprang from blues and [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|African-related tonal sensibilities]] rather than 20th-century Western classical music. \"Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker's] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories. Bebop musicians eliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices.\"<ref name=\"Kubik\" />\n\nSamuel Floyd states that blues was both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about a new harmonic conception using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic variety, a developed and even more highly syncopated, linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity in which the blue note of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic-harmonic device; and reestablishment of the blues as the primary organizing and functional principle.<ref name=\"Floyd, Samuel A. 1995\"/> Kubik wrote:\n\n<blockquote>While for an outside observer, the harmonic innovations in bebop would appear to be inspired by experiences in Western \"serious\" music, from [[Claude Debussy]] to [[Arnold Schoenberg]], such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz, for example, on Bix Beiderbecke's piano playing. And it is also true that Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music. West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool jazz, but bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary, ideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western harmonic approach. The ultimate significance of all this is that the experiments in jazz during the 1940s brought back to [[African-American music]] several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions<ref>Kubik (2005).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThese divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time met a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and musicians, especially swing players who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\".<ref>Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book''. 1981, p. 16.</ref> But despite the friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary.\n\n===Afro-Cuban jazz (cu-bop)===\n{{Main|Afro-Cuban jazz}}\n[[File:Machito and his sister Graciella Grillo.jpg|thumb|upright|Machito (maracas) and his sister Graciella Grillo (claves)]]\n\n====Machito and Mario Bauza====\nThe general consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first original jazz piece to be overtly based in clave was \"Tanga\" (1943), composed by Cuban-born [[Mario Bauza]] and recorded by [[Machito]] and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. \"Tanga\" began as a spontaneous [[descarga]] (Cuban jam session), with jazz solos superimposed on top.<ref>In 1992 Bauza recorded \"Tanga\" in the expanded form of an Afro-Cuban suite, consisting of five movements. ''Mario Bauza and his Afro-Cuban Orchestra''. Messidor CD (1992).</ref>\n\nThis was the birth of [[Afro-Cuban jazz]]. The use of clave brought the African ''timeline'', or ''[[bell pattern|key pattern]]'', into jazz. Music organized around key patterns convey a two-celled (binary) structure, which is a complex level of African [[cross beat|cross-rhythm]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pe\u00f1alosa|2010|p=56}}.</ref> Within the context of jazz, however, harmony is the primary referent, not rhythm. The harmonic progression can begin on either side of clave, and the harmonic \"one\" is always understood to be \"one\". If the progression begins on the \"three-side\" of clave, it is said to be in ''3\u20132 clave'' (shown below). If the progression begins on the \"two-side\", it is in ''2\u20133 clave''.<ref>{{harvnb|Pe\u00f1alosa|2010|pp=131\u2013136}}.</ref>\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\" override_midi=\"3-2 son clave.mid\">\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 4/4\n   \\repeat volta 2 { c8. c16 r8[ c] r[ c] c4 }\n}\n</score>\n\n====Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo====\n[[File:Dizzy Gillespie playing horn 1955.jpg|thumb|upright|Dizzy Gillespie, 1955]]\n[[Mario Bauz\u00e1]] introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban conga drummer and composer [[Chano Pozo]]. Gillespie and Pozo's brief collaboration produced some of the most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards. \"[[Manteca (song)|Manteca]]\" (1947) is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal [[guajeo]]s (Afro-Cuban [[ostinato]]s) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: \"If I'd let it go like [Chano] wanted it, it would have been strictly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn't have been a bridge. I thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but ... I had to keep going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Dizzy Gillespie, with Al|title=To Be or Not to Bop: Memoirs of Dizzy Gillespie|year=1985|publisher=Da Capo Press| location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-80236-2|page=77|title-link=To Be or Not to Bop: Memoirs of Dizzy Gillespie}}</ref> The bridge gave \"Manteca\" a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauza's modal \"Tanga\" of a few years earlier.\n\nGillespie's collaboration with Pozo brought specific African-based rhythms into bebop. While pushing the boundaries of harmonic improvisation, ''cu-bop'' also drew from African rhythm. Jazz arrangements with a Latin A section and a swung B section, with all choruses swung during solos, became common practice with many Latin tunes of the jazz standard repertoire. This approach can be heard on pre-1980 recordings of \"Manteca\", \"[[A Night in Tunisia]]\", \"Tin Tin Deo\", and \"[[On Green Dolphin Street (song)|On Green Dolphin Street]]\".\n\n====African cross-rhythm====\n[[File:Mongo Santamaria 1969.JPG|thumb|upright|Mongo Santamaria (1969)]]\nCuban percussionist [[Mongo Santamaria]] first recorded his composition \"[[Afro Blue]]\" in 1959.<ref>\"Afro Blue\", ''Afro Roots'' (Mongo Santamaria) Prestige CD 24018-2 (1959).</ref>\n\"Afro Blue\" was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) [[cross-rhythm]], or [[hemiola]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pe\u00f1alosa|2010|p=26}}.</ref> The song begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of {{music|time|12|8}}, or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats\u20146:4 (two cells of 3:2).\n\nThe following example shows the original [[ostinato]] \"Afro Blue\" bass line.

Originally a B{{music|flat}} [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] blues, Coltrane expanded the harmonic structure of \"Afro Blue.\"\n\nPerhaps the most respected [[Afro-cuban jazz]] combo of the late 1950s was vibraphonist [[Cal Tjader]]'s band. Tjader had [[Mongo Santamaria]], [[Armando Peraza]], and [[Willie Bobo]] on his early recording dates.\n\n===Dixieland revival===\nIn the late 1940s, there was a revival of [[Dixieland]], harking back to the contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two types of musicians involved in the revival: the first group was made up of those who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style and were returning to it (or continuing what they had been playing all along), such as [[Bob Crosby]]'s Bobcats, [[Max Kaminsky (musician)|Max Kaminsky]], [[Eddie Condon]], and [[Wild Bill Davison]].<ref name=\"Collier, 1978\">Collier, 1978.</ref> Most of these players were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second group of revivalists consisted of younger musicians, such as those in the [[Lu Watters]] band, [[Conrad Janis]], and [[Ward Kimball]] and his [[Firehouse Five Plus Two]] Jazz Band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.<ref name=\"Collier, 1978\"/>\n\n{{listen\n|image = none\n|filename    = DukeEllington_TakeTheATrain.ogg\n|title       = \"Take The 'A' Train\"\n|description = This 1941 sample of Duke Ellington's signature tune is an example of the swing style.\n|format      = [[Ogg]]\n|image4 = none\n|filename4    = CharlieParker_YardbirdSuite.ogg\n|title4       = \"Yardbird Suite\"\n|description4 = Excerpt from a saxophone solo by Charlie Parker.

Hard bop was developed in the mid-1950s, coalescing in 1953 and 1954; it developed partly in response to the vogue for cool jazz in the early 1950s and paralleled the rise of rhythm and blues. Miles Davis' 1954 performance of \"Walkin'\" at the first [[Newport Jazz Festival]] announced the style to the jazz world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Natambu|first1=Kofi|title=Miles Davis: A New Revolution in Sound|journal=Black Renaissance/Renaissance Noire |date=2014|volume=2|page=39}}</ref> The quintet Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, led by [[Art Blakey|Blakey]] and featuring pianist [[Horace Silver]] and trumpeter [[Clifford Brown]], were leaders in the hard bop movement with Davis.\n\n===Modal jazz===\n{{Main|Modal jazz}}\nModal jazz is a development which began in the later 1950s which takes the [[musical mode|mode]], or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Previously, a solo was meant to fit into a given [[chord progression]], but with modal jazz, the soloist creates a melody using one (or a small number of) modes. The emphasis is thus shifted from harmony to melody:<ref>{{harvnb|Litweiler|1984|pp=110\u2013111}}.</ref> \"Historically, this caused a seismic shift among jazz musicians, away from thinking vertically (the chord), and towards a more horizontal approach (the scale),\"<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=30}}.</ref> explained pianist [[Mark Levine (musician)|Mark Levine]].\n\nThe modal theory stems from a work by [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]. Miles Davis introduced the concept to the greater jazz world with ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959), an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz which would become the best selling jazz album of all time. In contrast to Davis' earlier work with hard bop and its complex chord progression and improvisation, ''Kind of Blue'' was composed as a series of modal sketches in which the musicians were given scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yudkin|first1=Jeremy|title=The Naming of Names: \"Flamenco Sketches\" or \"All Blues\"? Identifying the Last Two Tracks on Miles Davis's Classic Album Kind of Blue|journal=Musical Quarterly|date=2012|volume=95|issue=1|pages=15\u201335|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gds006}}</ref>\n\n\"I didn't write out the music for ''Kind of Blue'', but brought in sketches for what everybody was supposed to play because I wanted a lot of spontaneity,\"<ref>Davis, Miles (1989: 234). ''The Autobiography''. New York: Touchstone.</ref> recalled Davis. The track \"So What\" has only two chords: [[dominant seventh chord|D-7]] and E{{music|b}}-7.<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=29}}.</ref>\n\nOther innovators in this style include [[Jackie McLean]],<ref>{{harvnb|Litweiler|1984|pp=120\u2013123}}.</ref> and two of the musicians who had also played on ''Kind of Blue'': John Coltrane and Bill Evans.\n\n===Free jazz===\n{{Main|Free jazz}}\n[[File:John Coltrane 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|John Coltrane, 1963]]\nFree jazz, and the related form of [[avant-garde jazz]], broke through into an open space of \"free tonality\" in which meter, beat, and formal symmetry all disappeared, and a range of [[world music]] from India, Africa, and Arabia were melded into an intense, even religiously ecstatic or orgiastic style of playing.<ref>Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book''. 1981. Page 21.</ref> While loosely inspired by bebop, free jazz tunes gave players much more latitude; the loose harmony and tempo was deemed controversial when this approach was first developed. The bassist [[Charles Mingus]] is also frequently associated with the avant-garde in jazz, although his compositions draw from myriad styles and genres.\n\nThe first major stirrings came in the 1950s with the early work of [[Ornette Coleman]] (whose 1960 album ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation]]'' coined the term) and [[Cecil Taylor]]. In the 1960s, exponents included [[Albert Ayler]], [[Gato Barbieri]], [[Carla Bley]], [[Don Cherry]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Bill Dixon]], [[Jimmy Giuffre]], [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Michael Mantler]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Roswell Rudd]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], and [[John Tchicai]]. In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist [[Gary Peacock]] and drummer [[Sunny Murray]], a rhythm section honed with [[Cecil Taylor]] as leader. In November 1961, Coltrane played a gig at the Village Vanguard, which resulted in the classic ''Chasin' the 'Trane'', which ''Down Beat'' magazine panned as \"anti-jazz\". On his 1961 tour of France, he was booed, but persevered, signing with the new [[Impulse! Records]] in 1960 and turning it into \"the house that Trane built\", while championing many younger free jazz musicians, notably [[Archie Shepp]], who often played with trumpeter [[Bill Dixon]], who organized the 4-day \"October Revolution in Jazz\" in Manhattan in 1964, the first free jazz festival.\n\nA series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming increasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like [[multiphonics]], utilization of overtones, and playing in the [[altissimo]] register, as well as a mutated return to Coltrane's [[sheets of sound]]. In the studio, he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone. In addition, the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom.  The group's evolution can be traced through the recordings ''[[The John Coltrane Quartet Plays]]'', ''[[Living Space (album)|Living Space]]'' and ''[[Transition (John Coltrane album)|Transition]]'' (both June 1965), ''[[New Thing at Newport]]'' (July 1965), ''[[Sun Ship]]'' (August 1965), and ''[[First Meditations]]'' (September 1965).\n\nIn June 1965, Coltrane and 10 other musicians recorded ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'', a 40-minute-long piece without breaks that included adventurous solos by young avante-garde musicians as well as Coltrane, and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. [[Dave Liebman]] later called it \"the torch that lit the free jazz thing.\".  After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Pharoah Sanders to join the band in September 1965.  While Coltrane used over-blowing frequently as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would opt to overblow his entire solo, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument.\n\n====Free jazz in Europe====\n[[File:Peter-broetzmann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Peter Br\u00f6tzmann]] is a key figure in European free jazz.]]\n\nFree jazz was played in Europe in part because musicians such as Ayler, Taylor, [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], and [[Eric Dolphy]] spent extended periods of time there, and European musicians such as [[Michael Mantler]] and [[John Tchicai]] traveled to the U.S. to experience American music firsthand. European contemporary jazz was shaped by [[Peter Br\u00f6tzmann]], [[John Surman]], [[Krzysztof Komeda]], [[Zbigniew Namys\u0142owski]], [[Tomasz Stanko]], [[Lars Gullin]], [[Joe Harriott]], [[Albert Mangelsdorff]], [[Kenny Wheeler]], [[Graham Collier]], [[Michael Garrick]] and [[Mike Westbrook]]. They were eager to develop approaches to music that reflected their heritage.\n\nSince the 1960s, creative centers of jazz in Europe have developed, such as the creative jazz scene in Amsterdam. Following the work of drummer [[Han Bennink]] and pianist [[Misha Mengelberg]], musicians started to explore by improvising collectively until a form (melody, rhythm, a famous song) is found  Jazz critic [[Kevin Whitehead]] documented the free jazz scene in Amsterdam and some of its main exponents such as the ICP (Instant Composers Pool) orchestra in his book ''New Dutch Swing''. Since the 1990s Keith Jarrett has defended free jazz from criticism. British writer Stuart Nicholson has argued European contemporary jazz has an identity different from American jazz and follows a different trajectory.<ref name=\"Nicholson\">{{cite book |last1=Nicholson |first1=Stuart |title=Is Jazz Dead? Or Has it Moved to a New Address? |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York}}</ref>\n\n===Latin jazz===\n{{Main|Latin jazz}}\nLatin jazz is jazz that employs Latin American rhythms and is generally understood to have a more specific meaning than simply jazz from Latin America. A more precise term might be ''Afro-Latin jazz'', as the jazz subgenre typically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa or exhibit an African rhythmic influence beyond what is ordinarily heard in other jazz. The two main categories of Latin jazz are [[Afro-Cuban jazz]] and Brazilian jazz.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, many jazz musicians had only a basic understanding of Cuban and Brazilian music, and jazz compositions which used Cuban or Brazilian elements were often referred to as \"Latin tunes\", with no distinction between a Cuban [[son montuno]] and a Brazilian [[bossa nova]]. Even as late as 2000, in Mark Gridley's ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', a bossa nova bass line is referred to as a \"Latin bass figure.\"<ref>Gridley, Mark C. (2000: 444). ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', 7th ed.</ref> It was not uncommon during the 1960s and 1970s to hear a conga playing a Cuban [[tumbao]] while the drumset and bass played a Brazilian bossa nova pattern. Many jazz standards such as \"Manteca\", \"On Green Dolphin Street\" and \"Song for My Father\" have a \"Latin\" A section and a swung B section. Typically, the band would only play an even-eighth \"Latin\" feel in the A section of the head and swing throughout all of the solos. Latin jazz specialists like [[Cal Tjader]] tended to be the exception. For example, on a 1959 live Tjader recording of \"A Night in Tunisia\", pianist [[Vince Guaraldi]] soloed through the entire form over an authentic [[mambo (music)|mambo]].<ref>Tjader, Cal (1959). ''Monterey Concerts''. Prestige CD. ASIN: B000000ZCY.</ref>\n\n====Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance====\nFor most of its history, Afro-Cuban jazz had been a matter of superimposing jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms. But by the end of the 1970s, a new generation of New York City musicians had emerged who were fluent in both [[salsa (music)|salsa]] dance music and jazz, leading to a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry (congas and trumpet) and Andy (bass).<ref>Andy Gonzalez interviewed by Larry Birnbaum. Ed. Boggs, Vernon W. (1992: 297\u2013298). ''Salsiology; Afro-Cuban Music and the Evolution of Salsa in New York City''. New York: Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|0-313-28468-7}}</ref> During 1974\u20131976, they were members of one of [[Eddie Palmieri]]'s most experimental salsa groups: salsa was the medium, but Palmieri was stretching the form in new ways. He incorporated parallel fourths, with McCoy Tyner-type vamps. The innovations of Palmieri, the Gonzalez brothers and others led to an Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance in New York City.\n\nThis occurred in parallel with developments in Cuba<ref>Acosta, Leonardo (2003). ''Cubano Be, Cubano Bop: One Hundred Years of Jazz in Cuba'', p. 59. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books. {{ISBN|1-58834-147-X}}</ref> The first Cuban band of this new wave was [[Irakere]]. Their \"Ch\u00e9kere-son\" (1976) introduced a style of \"Cubanized\" bebop-flavored horn lines that departed from the more angular guajeo-based lines which were typical of Cuban popular music and Latin jazz up until that time. It was based on Charlie Parker's composition \"Billie's Bounce\", jumbled together in a way that fused clave and bebop horn lines.<ref>Moore, Kevin (2007) \"History and Discography of Irakere\". [http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/history-and-discography-of-irakere ''Timba.com''.]</ref> In spite of the ambivalence of some band members towards Irakere's Afro-Cuban folkloric / jazz fusion, their experiments forever changed Cuban jazz: their innovations are still heard in the high level of harmonic and rhythmic complexity in Cuban jazz and in the jazzy and complex contemporary form of popular dance music known as [[timba]].\n\n====Afro-Brazilian jazz====\n[[File:Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos.jpg|thumb|upright|Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos playing the Afro-Brazilian [[Berimbau]]]]\n\nBrazilian jazz, such as [[bossa nova]], is derived from [[samba]], with influences from jazz and other 20th-century classical and popular music styles. Bossa is generally moderately paced, with melodies sung in Portuguese or English, whilst the related jazz-samba is an adaptation of street samba into jazz.\n\nThe bossa nova style was pioneered by Brazilians [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]] and [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] and was made popular by [[Elizete Cardoso]]'s recording of \"[[Chega de Saudade]]\" on the ''[[Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Amor Demais]]'' LP. Gilberto's initial releases, and the 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'', achieved significant popularity in [[Latin America]]; this spread to North America via visiting American jazz musicians. The resulting recordings by [[Charlie Byrd]] and Stan Getz cemented bossa nova's popularity and led to a worldwide boom, with 1963's ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'', numerous recordings by famous jazz performers such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], and the eventual entrenchment of the bossa nova style as a lasting influence in world music.\n\nBrazilian percussionists such as [[Airto Moreira]] and [[Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos]] also influenced jazz internationally by introducing Afro-Brazilian folkloric instruments and rhythms into a wide variety of jazz styles, thus attracting a greater audience to them.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yanow|first=Scott|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p36965/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Airto Moreira|website=AllMusic|date=August 5, 1941|accessdate=2011-10-22}}</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6300/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Biography]</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Robert|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E6DF123BF93BA15755C0A964948260|title=Jazz Festival \u2013 A Study Of Folk-Jazz Fusion \u2013 Review|newspaper=New York Times|date=1982-06-28|accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>\n\n===African-inspired===\n[[File:Randy Weston.jpg|thumb|upright|Randy Weston]]\n\n====Rhythm====\nThe first [[jazz standard]] composed by a non-Latino to use an overt African {{music|time|12|8}} cross-rhythm was [[Wayne Shorter]]'s \"[[Footprints (composition)|Footprints]]\" (1967).<ref>\"Footprints\" ''Miles Smiles'' (Miles Davis).

The use of pentatonic scales in Africa probably goes back thousands of years.<ref>An ancient west central Sudanic stratum of ''pentatonic'' song composition, often associated with simple work rhythms in a regular meter, but with notable off-beat accents ... reaches back perhaps thousands of years to early West African sorgum agriculturalists\u2014Kubik, Gerhard (1999: 95). ''Africa and the Blues''. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi.</ref>\n\n[[McCoy Tyner]] perfected the use of the pentatonic scale in his solos,<ref>Gridley, Mark C. (2000: 270). ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', 7th ed.</ref> and also used parallel fifths and fourths, which are common harmonies in West Africa.<ref>Map showing distribution of harmony in Africa. Jones, A.M. (1959). ''Studies in African Music.'' Oxford Press.</ref>\n\nThe minor pentatonic scale is often used in blues improvisation, and like a blues scale, a minor pentatonic scale can be played over all of the chords in a blues. The following pentatonic lick was played over blues changes by [[Joe Henderson]] on [[Horace Silver]]'s \"African Queen\" (1965).<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=235}}.</ref>\n\nJazz pianist, theorist, and educator [[Mark Levine (musician)|Mark Levine]] refers to the scale generated by beginning on the fifth step of a pentatonic scale as the ''V pentatonic scale''.<ref>Levine, Mark (1989: 127). ''The Jazz Piano Book''. Petaluma, CA: Sher Music. ASIN: B004532DEE</ref>\n\n[[File:I IV V pentatonic.tiff|thumb|center|upright=2.05|C pentatonic scale beginning on the I (C pentatonic), IV (F pentatonic), and V (G pentatonic) steps of the scale.{{clarify|date=August 2012}}<!--the text above says the fifth step of a pentatonic scale, but this shows the fifth step of the C major diatonic scale-->]]\n\nLevine points out that the V pentatonic scale works for all three chords of the standard II-V-I jazz progression.<ref>Levine (1989: 127).</ref> This is a very common progression, used in pieces such as Miles Davis' \"Tune Up.\" The following example shows the V pentatonic scale over a II-V-I progression.<ref>After Mark Levine (1989: 127). ''The Jazz Piano Book''.</ref>\n\n[[File:II V I.tiff|thumb|center|upright=2.05|V pentatonic scale over II-V-I chord progression.]]\n\nAccordingly, John Coltrane's \"[[Giant Steps]]\" (1960), with its 26 chords per 16 bars, can be played using only three pentatonic scales. Coltrane studied [[Nicolas Slonimsky]]'s ''Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns'', which contains material that is virtually identical to portions of \"Giant Steps\".<ref>Bair, Jeff (2003: 5).

PhD Thesis. University of North Texas.</ref> The harmonic complexity of \"Giant Steps\" is on the level of the most advanced 20th-century art music. Superimposing the pentatonic scale over \"Giant Steps\" is not merely a matter of harmonic simplification, but also a sort of \"Africanizing\" of the piece, which provides an alternate approach for soloing. Mark Levine observes that when mixed in with more conventional \"playing the changes\", pentatonic scales provide \"structure and a feeling of increased space.\"<ref>Levine, Mark (1995: 205).

Sher Music. {{ISBN|1-883217-04-0}}.</ref>\n\n===Sacred and liturgical jazz===\n{{Main|Sacred jazz}}\nAs noted above, jazz has incorporated from its inception aspects of African American sacred music including spirituals and hymns. Secular jazz musicians often performed renditions of spirituals and hymns as part of their repertoire or isolated compositions such as \"Come Sunday,\" part of  \"Black and Beige Suite\" by [[Duke Ellington]]. Later many other jazz artists borrowed from black [[gospel music]]. However, it was only after World War II that a few jazz musicians began to compose and perform extended works intended for religious settings and/or as religious expression. Since the 1950's, sacred and liturgical music has been performed and recorded by many prominent jazz composers and musicians. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowes |first1=Malcolm |title=Jazz in the chapel |journal=Music Journal |date=11/1/1966 |volume=24 |issue=9 |page=45 |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref> The \"Abyssinian Mass\" by [[Wynton Marsalis]] (Blueengine Records, 2016) is a recent example.\n\nUnfortunately, relatively little has been written about sacred and liturgical jazz. In a 2013 doctoral dissertation, Angelo Versace examined the development of sacred jazz in the 1950s using disciplines of musicology and history. He noted that the traditions of black gospel music and jazz were combined in the 1950s to produce a new genre, \"sacred jazz.\"<ref name=\"Versace\">{{cite web |last1=Versace |first1=Angelo |title=The Evolution of Sacred Jazz as Reflected in the Music of Mary Lou Williams, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane and Recognized Contemporary Sacred Jazz Artists |url=https://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/oa_dissertations/991 |website=Open Access Dissertations |publisher=University of Miami |accessdate=28 March 2020 |date=30 April 2013}}</ref> Versace maintained that that the religious intent separates sacred from secular jazz. Most prominent in initiating the sacred jazz movement were pianist and composer [[Mary Lou Williams]], known for her jazz masses in the 1950s and [[Duke Ellington]]. Prior to his death in 1974 in response to contacts from Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, [[Duke Ellington]] wrote three Sacred Concerts: 1965 - A Concert of Sacred Music; 1968 - Second Sacred Concert; 1973 - Third Sacred Concert.  \n\nThe most prominent form of sacred and liturgical jazz is the jazz mass. Although most often performed in a concert setting rather than church worship setting, this form has many examples. An eminent example of composers of the jazz mass was [[Mary Lou Williams]]. Williams converted to Catholicism in 1957, and proceeded to compose three masses in the jazz idiom.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Corbin |first1=Ian M. |title=A jazz mass?

It was performed once in 1975 in St Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. However the [[Catholic church]] has not embraced jazz as appropriate for worship. In 1966 Joe Masters recorded \"Jazz Mass\" for Columbia Records. A jazz ensemble was joined by soloists and choir using the English text of the Roman Catholic Mass. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Connor |first1=Norman |title=The Jazz Mass by Joe Masters |journal=Choral Journal |date=1 February 1970 |volume=10 |issue=5 |page=19 |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref> Other examples include  \"Jazz Mass in Concert\" by [[Lalo Schiffrin]](Aleph Records, 1998, UPC 0651702632725) and \"Jazz Mass\" by [[Vince Guaraldi]] (Fantasy Records, 1965). In England, classical composer [[Will Todd]] recorded his \"Jazz Missa Brevis\" with jazz ensemble, solists and the St Martin's Voices on a 2018 Signum Records release, \"Passion Music/Jazz Missa Brevis\" also released as \"Mass in Blue,\" and jazz organist James Taylor composed \"The Rochester Mass\"   (Cherry Red Records, 2015) <ref>{{cite news |last1=Peel |first1=Adrian |title='The Rochester Mass,' a new concept from organist James Taylor |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/music/the-rochester-mass-a-new-concept-from-organist-james-taylor/article/450967 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |agency=Digital Journal |publisher=Digital Journal |date=2 December 2015}}</ref>. In 2013, Versace put forth bassist [[Ike Sturm]] and New York composer Deanna Witkowski as contemporary exemplars of sacred and liturgical jazz. <ref name=\"Versace\" />\n\n===Jazz fusion===\n{{Main|Jazz fusion}}\n[[File:Miles Davis 24.jpg|thumb|right|Fusion trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] in 1989]]\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the hybrid form of jazz-rock [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] was developed by combining jazz improvisation with rock rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound of rock musicians such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters, odd time signatures, syncopation, complex chords, and harmonies.\n\nAccording to [[AllMusic]]:\n\n<blockquote>... until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate. [However, ...] as rock became more creative and its musicianship improved, and as some in the jazz world became bored with [[hard bop]] and did not want to play strictly [[free jazz|avant-garde music]], the two different idioms began to trade ideas and occasionally combine forces.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d299|pure_url=yes}}|title=Explore: Fusion|website=AllMusic|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Miles Davis' new directions====\nIn 1969, Davis fully embraced the electric instrument approach to jazz with ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', which can be considered his first fusion album. Composed of two side-long suites edited heavily by producer [[Teo Macero]], this quiet, static album would be equally influential to the development of [[ambient music]].\n\nAs Davis recalls:\n\n<blockquote>The music I was really listening to in 1968 was [[James Brown]], the great guitar player [[Jimi Hendrix]], and a new group who had just come out with a hit record, \"[[Dance to the Music (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Dance to the Music]]\", [[Sly and the Family Stone]] ... I wanted to make it more like rock. When we recorded ''In a Silent Way'' I just threw out all the chord sheets and told everyone to play off of that.<ref>Davis, Miles, with Quincy Troupe (1989: 298) ''The Autobiography''. New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo contributors to ''In a Silent Way'' also joined organist [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]] to create one of the early acclaimed fusion albums: [[Emergency! (album)|''Emergency!'']] by [[The Tony Williams Lifetime]].\n\n====Psychedelic-jazz====\n\n=====Weather Report=====\n[[Weather Report]]'s self-titled electronic and psychedelic ''[[Weather Report (1971 album)|Weather Report]]'' debut album caused a sensation in the jazz world on its arrival in 1971, thanks to the pedigree of the group's members (including percussionist [[Airto Moreira]]), and their unorthodox approach to music. The album featured a softer sound than would be the case in later years (predominantly using acoustic bass with Shorter exclusively playing [[soprano saxophone]], and with no [[synthesizer]]s involved), but is still considered a classic of early fusion. It built on the avant-garde experiments which [[Joe Zawinul]] and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favour of continuous rhythm and movement \u2013 but took the music further. To emphasise the group's rejection of standard methodology, the album opened with the inscrutable avant-garde atmospheric piece \"Milky Way\", which featured by Shorter's extremely muted saxophone inducing vibrations in Zawinul's piano strings while the latter pedalled the instrument. ''[[Down Beat]]'' described the album as \"music beyond category\", and awarded it Album of the Year in the magazine's polls that year.\n\n[[Weather Report]]'s subsequent releases were creative funk-jazz works.<ref>Dan, Morgenstern (1971). ''Down Beat'' May 13.</ref>\n\n====Jazz-rock====\nAlthough some jazz purists protested against the blend of jazz and rock, many jazz innovators crossed over from the contemporary hard bop scene into fusion. As well as the electric instruments of rock (such as electric guitar, electric bass, electric piano and synthesizer keyboards), fusion also used the powerful amplification, [[Distortion (music)|\"fuzz\" pedals]], [[wah-wah pedal]]s and other effects that were used by 1970s-era rock bands. Notable performers of jazz fusion included Miles Davis, [[Eddie Harris]], keyboardists [[Joe Zawinul]], [[Chick Corea]], and Herbie Hancock, vibraphonist [[Gary Burton]], drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)]], violinist [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], guitarists [[Larry Coryell]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Ryo Kawasaki]], and [[Frank Zappa]], saxophonist Wayne Shorter and bassists [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Stanley Clarke]]. Jazz fusion was also popular in Japan, where the band [[Casiopea]] released over thirty fusion albums.\n\nAccording to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, \"just as free jazz appeared on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the 1960s ... jazz-rock briefly suggested the promise of doing the same\" with albums such as Williams' ''[[Emergency! (album)|Emergency!]]'' (1970) and Davis' ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'' (1975), which Nicholson said \"suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before.\" This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre \"mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio\" at the end of the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|page=614|last1=Harrison|first1=Max|last2=Thacker|first2=Eric|last3=Nicholson|first3=Stuart|title=The Essential Jazz Records: Modernism to Postmodernism|year=2000|publisher=[[A&C Black]]|isbn=978-0-7201-1822-3}}</ref>\n\n===Jazz-funk===\n{{Main|Jazz-funk}}\nBy the mid-1970s, the sound known as jazz-funk had developed, characterized by a strong [[beat (music)|back beat]] ([[Groove (music)|groove]]), electrified sounds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/jazz/jazzfunk/more.html |title=Free Jazz-Funk Music: Album, Track and Artist Charts |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920131709/http://www.rhapsody.com/jazz/jazzfunk/more.html |archivedate=2008-09-20 }}, ''Rhapsody Online&nbsp;\u2014 Rhapsody.com'' (October 20, 2010).</ref> and, often, the presence of electronic [[analog synthesizers]]. Jazz-funk also draws influences from traditional African music, Afro-Cuban rhythms and Jamaican [[reggae]], notably Kingston bandleader [[Sonny Bradshaw]]. Another feature is the shift of emphasis from improvisation to composition: arrangements, melody and overall writing became important. The integration of [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is wide and ranges from strong [[Musical improvisation#Jazz improvisation|jazz improvisation]] to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz [[riff]]s and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/explore/style/d202 |title=Explore: Jazz-Funk |accessdate=October 19, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019041451/http://allmusic.com/explore/style/d202 |archivedate=October 19, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nEarly examples are Herbie Hancock's [[The Headhunters|Headhunters]] band and Miles Davis' ''[[On the Corner]]'' album, which, in 1972, began Davis' foray into jazz-funk and was, he claimed, an attempt at reconnecting with the young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for [[rock and roll|rock]] and funk. While there is a discernible rock and funk influence in the [[timbre]]s of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian tambora and tablas and Cuban congas and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. The album was a culmination of sorts of the ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'' approach that Davis and producer [[Teo Macero]] had begun to explore in the late 1960s.\n\n===Traditionalism in the 1980s===\n{{main|1980s in jazz}}\n[[File:Wynton Marsalis 2009 09 13.jpg|thumb|right|Wynton Marsalis]]\n\nThe 1980s saw something of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]] emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Duke Ellington]], as well as the hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly [[modal jazz]] and [[post-bop]]); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.\n\nFor example, several musicians who had been prominent in the [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] genre during the 1970s began to record acoustic jazz once more, including [[Chick Corea]] and [[Herbie Hancock]]. Other musicians who had experimented with electronic instruments in the previous decade had abandoned them by the 1980s; for example, [[Bill Evans]], [[Joe Henderson]], and [[Stan Getz]]. Even the 1980s music of [[Miles Davis]], although certainly still fusion, adopted a far more accessible and recognisably jazz-oriented approach than his abstract work of the mid-1970s, such as a return to a theme-and-solos approach.\n\nThe emergence of young jazz talent beginning to perform in older, established musicians' groups further impacted the resurgence of traditionalism in the jazz community. In the 1970s, the groups of [[Betty Carter]] and [[The Jazz Messengers|Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers]] retained their conservative jazz approaches in the midst of fusion and jazz-rock, and in addition to difficulty booking their acts, struggled to find younger generations of personnel to authentically play traditional styles such as [[hard bop]] and [[bebop]]. In the late 1970s, however, a resurgence of younger jazz players in Blakey's band began to occur. This movement included musicians such as [[Valery Ponomarev]] and [[Bobby Watson]], [[Dennis Irwin]] and [[James Williams (musician)|James Williams]].\nIn the 1980s, in addition to [[Wynton Marsalis|Wynton]] and [[Branford Marsalis]], the emergence of pianists in the Jazz Messengers such as [[Donald Brown (musician)|Donald Brown]], [[Mulgrew Miller]], and later, Benny Green, bassists such as [[Charles Fambrough]], [[Lonnie Plaxico]] (and later, [[Peter Washington]] and Essiet Essiet) horn players such as [[Bill Pierce (saxophonist)|Bill Pierce]], [[Donald Harrison]] and later [[Javon Jackson]] and [[Terence Blanchard]] emerged as talented jazz musicians, all of whom made significant contributions in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nThe young Jazz Messengers' contemporaries, including [[Roy Hargrove]], [[Marcus Roberts]], [[Wallace Roney]] and [[Mark Whitfield]] were also influenced by [[Wynton Marsalis]]'s emphasis toward jazz tradition. These younger rising stars rejected avant-garde approaches and instead championed the acoustic jazz sound of [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and early recordings of the first [[Miles Davis]] quintet. This group of \"Young Lions\" sought to reaffirm jazz as a high art tradition comparable to the discipline of classical music.<ref name=\"Guilliatt, Richard\">{{cite web |last1=Guilliatt |first1=Richard |title=Jazz: The Young Lions' Roar |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-13/entertainment/ca-1495_1_lincoln-center-jazz-orchestra|website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=14 January 2018 |date=13 September 1992}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Betty Carter]]'s rotation of young musicians in her group foreshadowed many of New York's preeminent traditional jazz players later in their careers. Among these musicians were Jazz Messenger alumni [[Benny Green (pianist)|Benny Green]], [[Branford Marsalis]] and [[Ralph Peterson Jr.]], as well as [[Kenny Washington (musician)|Kenny Washington]], [[Lewis Nash]], [[Curtis Lundy]], [[Cyrus Chestnut]], [[Mark Shim]], [[Craig Handy]], Greg Hutchinson and [[Marc Cary]], [[Taurus Mateen]] and [[Geri Allen]].\n\n[[Out of the Blue (American band)|O.T.B.]] ensemble included a rotation of young jazz musicians such as [[Kenny Garrett]], [[Steve Wilson (jazz musician)|Steve Wilson]], [[Kenny Davis (musician)|Kenny Davis]], [[Renee Rosnes]], [[Ralph Peterson Jr.]], [[Billy Drummond]], and [[Robert Hurst (musician)|Robert Hurst]].<ref name=\"Out\">{{cite web|last1=Yanow|first1=Scott |title=Out of the Blue |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/out-of-the-blue-mn0000419825/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=14 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nA similar reaction{{Vague|date=January 2018}} took place against free jazz. According to [[Ted Gioia]]:\n\n<blockquote>the very leaders of the avant garde started to signal a retreat from the core principles of free jazz. Anthony Braxton began recording standards over familiar chord changes. [[Cecil Taylor]] played duets in concert with [[Mary Lou Williams]], and let her set out structured harmonies and familiar jazz vocabulary under his blistering keyboard attack. And the next generation of progressive players would be even more accommodating, moving inside and outside the changes without thinking twice. Musicians such as David Murray or [[Don Pullen]] may have felt the call of free-form jazz, but they never forgot all the other ways one could play African-American music for fun and profit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz.com/jazz-blog/2008/2/27/where-did-our-revolution-go-part-three |title=Where Did Our Revolution Go?

Chick Corea similarly began exploring jazz standards in the 1980s, having neglected them for the 1970s.\n\nIn 1987, the United States House of Representatives and Senate passed a bill proposed by Democratic Representative [[John Conyers Jr.]] to define jazz as a unique form of American music, stating \"jazz is hereby designated as a rare and valuable national American treasure to which we should devote our attention, support and resources to make certain it is preserved, understood and promulgated.\" It passed in the House on September 23, 1987 and in the Senate on November 4, 1987.<ref name=HR57>HR-57 Center [http://www.hr57.org/hconres57.html HR-57 Center for the Preservation of Jazz and Blues, with the six-point mandate.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918100538/http://www.hr57.org/hconres57.html |date=2008-09-18 }}</ref>\n\n===Smooth jazz===\n{{Main|Smooth jazz}}\n[[File:David Sanborn 2008 2.jpg|thumb|upright|David Sanborn, 2008]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called \"pop fusion\" or \"smooth jazz\" became successful, garnering significant radio airplay in \"[[quiet storm]]\" time slots at radio stations in urban markets across the U.S. This helped to establish or bolster the careers of vocalists including [[Al Jarreau]], [[Anita Baker]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[Sade Adu|Sade]], as well as saxophonists including [[Grover Washington Jr.]], [[Kenny G]], [[Kirk Whalum]], [[Boney James]], and [[David Sanborn]]. In general, smooth jazz is downtempo (the most widely played tracks are of 90\u2013105 [[beats per minute]]), and has a lead melody-playing instrument (saxophone, especially soprano and tenor, and [[legato]] electric guitar are popular).\n\nIn his ''[[Newsweek]]'' article \"The Problem With Jazz Criticism\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Opinion: The Problem With Jazz Criticism|author=Stanley Crouch|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/58477|website=Newsweek|date=June 5, 2003|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> [[Stanley Crouch]] considers Miles Davis' playing of fusion to be a turning point that led to smooth jazz.

It can be very experimental in nature and can vary widely in sound and concept. It ranges from the combination of live instrumentation with the beats of jazz [[house music|house]] (as exemplified by [[Saint Germain (musician)|St Germain]], [[Jazzanova]], and [[Fila Brazillia]]) to more band-based improvised jazz with electronic elements (for example, [[The Cinematic Orchestra]], [[Kobol (band)|Kobol]] and the Norwegian \"future jazz\" style pioneered by [[Bugge Wesseltoft]], [[Jaga Jazzist]], and [[Nils Petter Molv\u00e6r]]).\n\n[[Jazz rap]] developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and incorporates jazz influences into [[hip hop]].

Gang Starr's debut LP ''[[No More Mr. Nice Guy (Gang Starr album)|No More Mr. Nice Guy]]'' (1989) and their 1990 track \"Jazz Thing\" sampled [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Ramsey Lewis]]. The groups which made up the [[Native Tongues Posse]] tended toward jazzy releases: these include the [[Jungle Brothers]]' debut ''[[Straight Out the Jungle]]'' (1988), and [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s ''[[People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Low End Theory]]'' (1991). Rap duo [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] incorporated jazz influences on their 1992 debut ''[[Mecca and the Soul Brother]]''. Rapper [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]]'s [[Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1|Jazzmatazz]] series began in 1993 using jazz musicians during the studio recordings.\n\nAlthough jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, Miles Davis' final album ''[[Doo-Bop]]'' (released posthumously in 1992) was based on hip hop beats and collaborations with producer [[Easy Mo Bee]]. Davis' ex-bandmate [[Herbie Hancock]] also absorbed hip-hop influences in the mid-1990s, releasing the album ''[[Dis Is Da Drum]]'' in 1994.\n\n===Punk jazz and jazzcore===\n[[File:John Zorn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Zorn]] performing in 2006]]\nThe relaxation of orthodoxy which was concurrent with [[post-punk]] in London and New York City led to a new appreciation of jazz.

Individual performers often play in a variety of styles, sometimes in the same performance. Pianist [[Brad Mehldau]] and [[The Bad Plus]] have explored contemporary rock music within the context of the traditional jazz acoustic piano trio, recording instrumental jazz versions of songs by rock musicians. The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music. A firm avant-garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players, such as saxophonists [[Greg Osby]] and [[Charles Gayle]], while others, such as [[James Carter (musician)|James Carter]], have incorporated free jazz elements into a more traditional framework.\n\n[[Harry Connick Jr.]] began his career playing stride piano and the dixieland jazz of his home, New Orleans, beginning with his first recording when he was ten years old.<ref name=\"Bush\">{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=John|title=Harry Connick, Jr|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/harry-connick-jr-mn0000949259/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=14 January 2018}}</ref> Some of his earliest lessons were at the home of pianist [[Ellis Marsalis Jr.|Ellis Marsalis]].<ref name=\"home\">{{Cite episode| title =Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick Jr.| series =Finding Your Roots| first =Henry| last =Louis Gates Jr. (host)| network =PBS| date =July 17, 2010| season =1| number =1|type=DVD}}</ref> Connick had success on the pop charts after recording the soundtrack to the movie ''[[When Harry Met Sally]]'', which sold over two million copies.<ref name=\"Bush\" /> Crossover success has also been achieved by [[Diana Krall]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Kurt Elling]], and [[Jamie Cullum]].\n\nA number of players who usually perform in largely [[straight-ahead jazz|straight-ahead]] settings have emerged since the 1990s, including pianists [[Jason Moran (musician)|Jason Moran]] and [[Vijay Iyer]], guitarist [[Kurt Rosenwinkel]], vibraphonist [[Stefon Harris]], trumpeters [[Roy Hargrove]] and [[Terence Blanchard]], saxophonists [[Chris Potter (jazz saxophonist)|Chris Potter]] and [[Joshua Redman]], clarinetist [[Ken Peplowski]] and bassist [[Christian McBride]].\n\nAlthough [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]] reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s, the use of electronic instruments and rock-derived musical elements in jazz continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Musicians using this approach include [[Pat Metheny]], [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]], [[John Scofield]] and the Swedish group [[Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson Trio|e.s.t.]] Since the beginning of the 90s, electronic music had significant technical improvements that popularized and created new possibilities for the genre. Jazz elements such as improvisation, rhythmic complexities and harmonic textures were introduced to the genre and consequently had a big impact in new listeners and in some ways kept the versatility of jazz relatable to a newer generation that did not necessarily relate to what the traditionalists call real jazz (bebop, cool and modal jazz).<ref>Nicholson, Stuart (January 3, 2003),  [https://jazztimes.com/features/jazztronica-a-brief-history-of-the-future-of-jazz/ \"Jazztronica: A Brief History of the Future of Jazz\"], ''JazzTimes''.</ref> Artists such as [[Squarepusher]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Flying Lotus]] and sub genres like [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]], Drum n' Bass, Jungle and [[Techno]] ended up incorporating a lot of these elements.<ref>Kalouti, Noor, et al.

It received some criticism, however, for its failure to reflect the many distinctive non-American traditions and styles in jazz that had developed, and its limited representation of US developments in the last quarter of the 20th century.\n\nThe mid-2010s have seen an increasing influence of R&B, hip-hop, and pop music on jazz. In 2015, [[Kendrick Lamar]] released his third studio album, ''[[To Pimp a Butterfly]]''. The album heavily featured prominent contemporary jazz artists such as [[Thundercat (musician)|Thundercat]]<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite AV media notes |title=To Pimp a Butterfly |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/to-pimp-a-butterfly-mw0002835159/credits |publisher=[[Interscope Records]]}}</ref> and redefined jazz rap with a larger focus on improvisation and live soloing rather than simply sampling. In that same year, saxophonist [[Kamasi Washington]] released his nearly three-hour long debut, ''[[The Epic (album)|The Epic]]''.

[[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]] began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French [[quadrille]]s, [[biguine]], ragtime and [[blues]] with collective [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[improvisation]]. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented [[Swing (music)|swing]] [[big band]]s, [[Kansas City jazz]], a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and [[Gypsy jazz]] (a style that emphasized [[Bal-musette|musette]] waltzes) were the prominent styles. [[Bebop]] emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. [[Cool jazz]] developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.\n\nThe 1950s saw the emergence of [[free jazz]], which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, and in the mid-1950s, [[hard bop]] emerged, which introduced influences from [[rhythm and blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. [[Modal jazz]] developed in the late 1950s, using the [[musical mode|mode]], or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. [[Jazz fusion|Jazz-rock fusion]] appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with [[rock music]]'s rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called [[smooth jazz]] became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as [[Latin jazz|Latin]] and [[Afro-Cuban jazz]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== <span id=\"Definition\"></span> Etymology and definition==\n{{Main|Jazz (word)}}\n[[File:EubieBlake.jpg|thumb|right|American jazz composer, lyricist, and pianist [[Eubie Blake]] made an early contribution to the genre's etymology]]\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1915, Composition pour Jazz, oil on cardboard, 73 x 73 cm, Solomon R.

The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence of earlier forms of music such as [[blues]], a form of folk music which arose in part from the [[work song]]s and [[field holler]]s of African-American slaves on plantations. These work songs were commonly structured around a repetitive [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] pattern, but early blues was also improvisational. [[Classical music]] performance is evaluated more by its fidelity to the [[sheet music|musical score]], with less attention given to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment. The classical performer's goal is to play the composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction and collaboration, placing less value on the contribution of the composer, if there is one, and more on the performer.<ref>Giddins 1998, 70.</ref> The jazz performer interprets a tune in individual ways, never playing the same composition twice. Depending on the performer's mood, experience, and interaction with band members or audience members, the performer may change melodies, harmonies, and time signatures.<ref>Giddins 1998, 89.</ref>\n\nIn early [[Dixieland]], a.k.a. New Orleans jazz, performers took turns playing melodies and improvising [[countermelodies]]. In the [[Swing music|swing]] era of the 1920s\u2013'40s, [[big bands]] relied more on [[arrangements]] which were written or learned by ear and memorized. Soloists improvised within these arrangements. In the [[bebop]] era of the 1940s, big bands gave way to small groups and minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated briefly at the beginning and most of the song was improvised. [[Modal jazz]] abandoned [[chord progressions]] to allow musicians to improvise even more. In many forms of jazz, a soloist is supported by a [[rhythm section]] of one or more chordal instruments (piano, guitar), double bass, and drums. The rhythm section plays chords and rhythms that outline the song structure and complement the soloist.<ref>[http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/jazz-drums/jazz-drumming/ Jazz Drum Lessons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027050049/http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/jazz-drums/jazz-drumming/ |date=October 27, 2010 }} \u2013 Drumbook.org</ref> In [[avant-garde jazz|avant-garde]] and [[free jazz]], the separation of soloist and band is reduced, and there is license, or even a requirement, for the abandoning of chords, scales, and meters.\n\n===Tradition and race===\nSince the emergence of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized.

C. Handy: early published blues====\n[[File:WC Handy age 19 handyphoto10.jpg|thumb|right|upright|W. C. Handy at 19, 1892]]\n[[W. C. Handy]] became interested in folk blues of the Deep South while traveling through the Mississippi Delta. In this folk blues form, the singer would improvise freely within a limited melodic range, sounding like a field holler, and the guitar accompaniment was slapped rather than strummed, like a small drum which responded in syncopated accents, functioning as another \"voice\".<ref>Palmer (1981: 46).</ref> Handy and his band members were formally trained African-American musicians who had not grown up with the blues, yet he was able to adapt the blues to a larger band instrument format and arrange them in a popular music form.\n\nHandy wrote about his adopting of the blues:\n\n<blockquote>The primitive southern Negro, as he sang, was sure to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, it was always the same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect ... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major ... , and I carried this device into my melody as well.<ref name=\"Handy, Father 1941, p. 99\">Handy, Father (1941), p. 99.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe publication of his \"[[The Memphis Blues|Memphis Blues]]\" sheet music in 1912 introduced the 12-bar blues to the world (although Gunther Schuller argues that it is not really a blues, but \"more like a cakewalk\"<ref>Schuller (1968: 66, 145n.)</ref>). This composition, as well as his later \"[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]\" and others, included the habanera rhythm,<ref name=autogenerated2>W. C.

The instruments used by marching bands and dance bands became the instruments of jazz: brass, drums, and reeds tuned in the European 12-tone scale. Small bands contained a combination of self-taught and formally educated musicians, many from the funeral procession tradition. These bands traveled in black communities in the deep south. Beginning in 1914, [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] and African-American musicians played in [[vaudeville]] shows which carried jazz to cities in the northern and western parts of the U.S.<ref name=creoleorch>{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/creole.html|title=Original Creole Orchestra|accessdate=October 23, 2007|publisher=The Red Hot Archive }}</ref>\n\nIn New Orleans, a white bandleader named [[Papa Jack Laine]] integrated blacks and whites in his marching band.

Bix Beiderbecke formed The Wolverines in 1924.\n\nDespite its Southern black origins, there was a larger market for jazzy dance music played by white orchestras. In 1918, [[Paul Whiteman]] and his orchestra became a hit in San Francisco. He signed a contract with [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] and became the top bandleader of the 1920s, giving hot jazz a white component, hiring white musicians such as [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Frankie Trumbauer]], and [[Joe Venuti]]. In 1924, Whiteman commissioned George Gershwin's ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which was premiered by his orchestra. Jazz began to be recognized as a notable musical form. [[Olin Downes]], reviewing the concert in ''The New York Times'', wrote, \"This composition shows extraordinary talent, as it shows a young composer with aims that go far beyond those of his ilk, struggling with a form of which he is far from being master. ... In spite of all this, he has expressed himself in a significant and, on the whole, highly original form. ...

According to Mario Dunkel, Whiteman's success was based on a \"rhetoric of domestication\" according to which he had elevated and rendered valuable (read \"white\") a previously inchoate (read \"black\") kind of music.<ref name=\"Dunkel\">{{cite journal |last1=Dunkel |first1=Mario |title=W.

The original New Orleans style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong was a master of his hometown style, but by the time he joined Henderson's band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong's solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong's bandmates (including a young [[Coleman Hawkins]]), sounded \"stiff, stodgy,\" with \"jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schuller|1968|p=91}}.</ref> The following example shows a short excerpt of the straight melody of \"Mandy, Make Up Your Mind\" by [[George W.

Key figures in developing the \"big\" jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers [[Count Basie]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Jimmy Dorsey|Jimmy]] and [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Earl Hines]], [[Harry James]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]], [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Artie Shaw]]. Although it was a collective sound, swing also offered individual musicians a chance to \"solo\" and improvise melodic, thematic solos which could at times be complex \"important\" music.\n\nOver time, social strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in America: white bandleaders began to recruit black musicians and black bandleaders white ones. In the mid-1930s, Benny Goodman hired pianist [[Teddy Wilson]], vibraphonist [[Lionel Hampton]] and guitarist [[Charlie Christian]] to join small groups. In the 1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist [[Lester Young]] marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or [[jump blues]] used small combos, uptempo music and blues chord progressions, drawing on [[boogie woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]] from the 1930s.\n\n===The influence of Duke Ellington===\n[[File:Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club 1943.jpg|thumb|upright|Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club (1943)]]\n\nWhile swing was reaching the height of its popularity, [[Duke Ellington]] spent the late 1920s and 1930s developing an innovative musical idiom for his orchestra. Abandoning the conventions of swing, he experimented with orchestral sounds, harmony, and [[musical form]] with complex compositions that still translated well for popular audiences; some of his tunes became [[hit single|hits]], and his own popularity spanned from the United States to Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van de Leur |first=Walter |chapter=12 \"Seldom seen, but always heard\": Billy Strayhorn and Duke Ellington |title=The Cambridge Companion to Duke Ellington |editor-last=Green |editor-first=Edward |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-316-19413-3 |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nEllington called his music ''American Music'', rather than ''jazz'', and liked to describe those who impressed him as \"beyond category.\"<ref name=\"Tucker-1\">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1995|p=6}} writes \"He tried to avoid the word 'jazz' preferring 'Negro' or 'American' music.

He often composed for the style and skills of these individuals, such as \"Jeep's Blues\" for [[Johnny Hodges]], \"Concerto for Cootie\" for [[Cootie Williams]] (which later became \"[[Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me]]\" with [[Bob Russell (songwriter)|Bob Russell]]'s lyrics), and \"The Mooche\" for [[Tricky Sam Nanton]] and [[Bubber Miley]]. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as [[Juan Tizol]]'s \"[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]\" and \"[[Perdido (song)|Perdido]]\", which brought the \"Spanish Tinge\" to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained with him for several decades. The band reached a creative peak in the early 1940s, when Ellington and a small hand-picked group of his composers and arrangers wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoryjazz.com/artists/ellington.html |title=Jazz Musicians \u2013 Duke Ellington |publisher=Theory Jazz |accessdate=July 14, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903233432/http://theoryjazz.com/artists/ellington.html |archivedate=September 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Beginnings of European jazz===\nAs only a limited number of American jazz records were released in Europe, European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, and [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], who visited Europe during and after World War I.

Vocalists of the famous big bands moved on to being marketed and performing as solo pop singers; these included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Dick Haymes]], and [[Doris Day]].<ref name=\"Trynka\"/> Older musicians who still performed their pre-war jazz, such as Armstrong and Ellington, were gradually viewed in the mainstream as pass\u00e9. Other younger performers, such as singer [[Big Joe Turner]] and saxophonist [[Louis Jordan]], who were discouraged by bebop's increasing complexity pursued more lucrative endeavors in rhythm and blues, [[jump blues]], and eventually [[rock and roll]].<ref name=\"Burchett\"/> Some, including Gillespie, composed intricate yet danceable songs for bebop musicians in an effort to make them more accessible, but bebop largely remained on the fringes of American audiences' purview. \"The new direction of postwar jazz drew a wealth of critical acclaim, but it steadily declined in popularity as it developed a reputation as an academic genre that was largely inaccessible to mainstream audiences\", Burchett said. \"The quest to make jazz more relevant to popular audiences, while retaining its artistic integrity, is a constant and prevalent theme in the history of postwar jazz.\"<ref name=\"Burchett\"/> During its swing period, jazz had been an uncomplicated musical scene; according to [[Paul Trynka]], this changed in the post-war years:\n\n{{quote|Suddenly jazz was no longer straightforward.

From now on it was no good saying that you liked jazz, you had to specify what kind of jazz. And that is the way it has been ever since, only more so. Today, the word 'jazz' is virtually meaningless without further definition.<ref name=\"Trynka\"/>}}\n\n===Bebop===\n{{Main|Bebop}}\nIn the early 1940s, bebop-style performers began to shift jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\". The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]], pianists [[Bud Powell]] and [[Thelonious Monk]], trumpeters [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Clifford Brown]], and drummer [[Max Roach]]. Divorcing itself from dance music, bebop established itself more as an art form, thus lessening its potential popular and commercial appeal.\n\nComposer [[Gunther Schuller]] wrote: \"In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it and all those other great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Dizzy Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was 'bop' and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings.\"<ref>Gunther Schuller November 14, 1972. Dance, p. 290.</ref>\n\nDizzy Gillespie wrote: \"People talk about the Hines band being 'the incubator of bop' and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The difference was in how you got from here to here to here...naturally each age has got its own shit.\"<ref>Dance p. 260.</ref>\n\nSince bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it could use faster tempos. Drumming shifted to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the [[ride cymbal]] was used to keep time while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity.<ref name=\"Floyd, Samuel A. 1995\">Floyd, Samuel A., Jr. (1995). ''The Power of Black Music: Interpreting its history from Africa to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nBebop musicians employed several harmonic devices which were not previously typical in jazz, engaging in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation. Bebop scales are traditional scales with an added chromatic passing note;<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=171}}.</ref> bebop also uses \"passing\" chords, [[substitute chord]]s, and [[altered chord]]s. New forms of [[chromaticism]] and [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] were introduced into jazz, and the dissonant [[tritone]] (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\"<ref>Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book'', 1981, p. 15.</ref> Chord progressions for bebop tunes were often taken directly from popular swing-era songs and reused with a new and more complex melody and/or reharmonized with more complex chord progressions to form new compositions, a practice which was already well-established in earlier jazz, but came to be central to the bebop style. Bebop made use of several relatively common chord progressions, such as blues (at base, I-IV-V, but often infused with ii-V motion) and 'rhythm changes' (I-VI-ii-V) \u2013 the chords to the 1930s pop standard \"[[I Got Rhythm]]\". Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show tunes.\n\nThe harmonic development in bebop is often traced back to a moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing \"Cherokee\" at [[Clark Monroe's Uptown House]], New York, in early 1942. \"I'd been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used...and I kept thinking there's bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes. I couldn't play it...I was working over 'Cherokee,' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive.\"<ref name=\"Kubik\">{{cite journal |last1=Kubik |first1=Gerhard |title=Bebop: A Case in Point. The African Matrix in Jazz Harmonic Practices |journal=Black Music Research Journal |date=22 March 2005}}</ref> [[Gerhard Kubik]] postulates that harmonic development in bebop sprang from blues and [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|African-related tonal sensibilities]] rather than 20th-century Western classical music. \"Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker's] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories. Bebop musicians eliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices.\"<ref name=\"Kubik\" />\n\nSamuel Floyd states that blues was both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about a new harmonic conception using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic variety, a developed and even more highly syncopated, linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity in which the blue note of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic-harmonic device; and reestablishment of the blues as the primary organizing and functional principle.<ref name=\"Floyd, Samuel A. 1995\"/> Kubik wrote:\n\n<blockquote>While for an outside observer, the harmonic innovations in bebop would appear to be inspired by experiences in Western \"serious\" music, from [[Claude Debussy]] to [[Arnold Schoenberg]], such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz, for example, on Bix Beiderbecke's piano playing. And it is also true that Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music. West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool jazz, but bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary, ideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western harmonic approach. The ultimate significance of all this is that the experiments in jazz during the 1940s brought back to [[African-American music]] several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions<ref>Kubik (2005).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThese divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time met a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and musicians, especially swing players who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\".<ref>Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book''. 1981, p. 16.</ref> But despite the friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary.\n\n===Afro-Cuban jazz (cu-bop)===\n{{Main|Afro-Cuban jazz}}\n[[File:Machito and his sister Graciella Grillo.jpg|thumb|upright|Machito (maracas) and his sister Graciella Grillo (claves)]]\n\n====Machito and Mario Bauza====\nThe general consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first original jazz piece to be overtly based in clave was \"Tanga\" (1943), composed by Cuban-born [[Mario Bauza]] and recorded by [[Machito]] and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. \"Tanga\" began as a spontaneous [[descarga]] (Cuban jam session), with jazz solos superimposed on top.<ref>In 1992 Bauza recorded \"Tanga\" in the expanded form of an Afro-Cuban suite, consisting of five movements. ''Mario Bauza and his Afro-Cuban Orchestra''. Messidor CD (1992).</ref>\n\nThis was the birth of [[Afro-Cuban jazz]]. The use of clave brought the African ''timeline'', or ''[[bell pattern|key pattern]]'', into jazz. Music organized around key patterns convey a two-celled (binary) structure, which is a complex level of African [[cross beat|cross-rhythm]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pe\u00f1alosa|2010|p=56}}.</ref> Within the context of jazz, however, harmony is the primary referent, not rhythm. The harmonic progression can begin on either side of clave, and the harmonic \"one\" is always understood to be \"one\". If the progression begins on the \"three-side\" of clave, it is said to be in ''3\u20132 clave'' (shown below). If the progression begins on the \"two-side\", it is in ''2\u20133 clave''.<ref>{{harvnb|Pe\u00f1alosa|2010|pp=131\u2013136}}.</ref>\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\" override_midi=\"3-2 son clave.mid\">\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n   \\clef percussion\n   \\time 4/4\n   \\repeat volta 2 { c8. c16 r8[ c] r[ c] c4 }\n}\n</score>\n\n====Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo====\n[[File:Dizzy Gillespie playing horn 1955.jpg|thumb|upright|Dizzy Gillespie, 1955]]\n[[Mario Bauz\u00e1]] introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban conga drummer and composer [[Chano Pozo]]. Gillespie and Pozo's brief collaboration produced some of the most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards. \"[[Manteca (song)|Manteca]]\" (1947) is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal [[guajeo]]s (Afro-Cuban [[ostinato]]s) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: \"If I'd let it go like [Chano] wanted it, it would have been strictly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn't have been a bridge. I thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but ... I had to keep going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Dizzy Gillespie, with Al|title=To Be or Not to Bop: Memoirs of Dizzy Gillespie|year=1985|publisher=Da Capo Press| location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-80236-2|page=77|title-link=To Be or Not to Bop: Memoirs of Dizzy Gillespie}}</ref> The bridge gave \"Manteca\" a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauza's modal \"Tanga\" of a few years earlier.\n\nGillespie's collaboration with Pozo brought specific African-based rhythms into bebop. While pushing the boundaries of harmonic improvisation, ''cu-bop'' also drew from African rhythm. Jazz arrangements with a Latin A section and a swung B section, with all choruses swung during solos, became common practice with many Latin tunes of the jazz standard repertoire. This approach can be heard on pre-1980 recordings of \"Manteca\", \"[[A Night in Tunisia]]\", \"Tin Tin Deo\", and \"[[On Green Dolphin Street (song)|On Green Dolphin Street]]\".\n\n====African cross-rhythm====\n[[File:Mongo Santamaria 1969.JPG|thumb|upright|Mongo Santamaria (1969)]]\nCuban percussionist [[Mongo Santamaria]] first recorded his composition \"[[Afro Blue]]\" in 1959.<ref>\"Afro Blue\", ''Afro Roots'' (Mongo Santamaria) Prestige CD 24018-2 (1959).</ref>\n\"Afro Blue\" was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) [[cross-rhythm]], or [[hemiola]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pe\u00f1alosa|2010|p=26}}.</ref> The song begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of {{music|time|12|8}}, or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats\u20146:4 (two cells of 3:2).\n\nThe following example shows the original [[ostinato]] \"Afro Blue\" bass line.

Originally a B{{music|flat}} [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] blues, Coltrane expanded the harmonic structure of \"Afro Blue.\"\n\nPerhaps the most respected [[Afro-cuban jazz]] combo of the late 1950s was vibraphonist [[Cal Tjader]]'s band. Tjader had [[Mongo Santamaria]], [[Armando Peraza]], and [[Willie Bobo]] on his early recording dates.\n\n===Dixieland revival===\nIn the late 1940s, there was a revival of [[Dixieland]], harking back to the contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two types of musicians involved in the revival: the first group was made up of those who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style and were returning to it (or continuing what they had been playing all along), such as [[Bob Crosby]]'s Bobcats, [[Max Kaminsky (musician)|Max Kaminsky]], [[Eddie Condon]], and [[Wild Bill Davison]].<ref name=\"Collier, 1978\">Collier, 1978.</ref> Most of these players were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second group of revivalists consisted of younger musicians, such as those in the [[Lu Watters]] band, [[Conrad Janis]], and [[Ward Kimball]] and his [[Firehouse Five Plus Two]] Jazz Band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.<ref name=\"Collier, 1978\"/>\n\n{{listen\n|image = none\n|filename    = DukeEllington_TakeTheATrain.ogg\n|title       = \"Take The 'A' Train\"\n|description = This 1941 sample of Duke Ellington's signature tune is an example of the swing style.\n|format      = [[Ogg]]\n|image4 = none\n|filename4    = CharlieParker_YardbirdSuite.ogg\n|title4       = \"Yardbird Suite\"\n|description4 = Excerpt from a saxophone solo by Charlie Parker.

Hard bop was developed in the mid-1950s, coalescing in 1953 and 1954; it developed partly in response to the vogue for cool jazz in the early 1950s and paralleled the rise of rhythm and blues. Miles Davis' 1954 performance of \"Walkin'\" at the first [[Newport Jazz Festival]] announced the style to the jazz world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Natambu|first1=Kofi|title=Miles Davis: A New Revolution in Sound|journal=Black Renaissance/Renaissance Noire |date=2014|volume=2|page=39}}</ref> The quintet Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, led by [[Art Blakey|Blakey]] and featuring pianist [[Horace Silver]] and trumpeter [[Clifford Brown]], were leaders in the hard bop movement with Davis.\n\n===Modal jazz===\n{{Main|Modal jazz}}\nModal jazz is a development which began in the later 1950s which takes the [[musical mode|mode]], or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Previously, a solo was meant to fit into a given [[chord progression]], but with modal jazz, the soloist creates a melody using one (or a small number of) modes. The emphasis is thus shifted from harmony to melody:<ref>{{harvnb|Litweiler|1984|pp=110\u2013111}}.</ref> \"Historically, this caused a seismic shift among jazz musicians, away from thinking vertically (the chord), and towards a more horizontal approach (the scale),\"<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=30}}.</ref> explained pianist [[Mark Levine (musician)|Mark Levine]].\n\nThe modal theory stems from a work by [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]. Miles Davis introduced the concept to the greater jazz world with ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959), an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz which would become the best selling jazz album of all time. In contrast to Davis' earlier work with hard bop and its complex chord progression and improvisation, ''Kind of Blue'' was composed as a series of modal sketches in which the musicians were given scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yudkin|first1=Jeremy|title=The Naming of Names: \"Flamenco Sketches\" or \"All Blues\"? Identifying the Last Two Tracks on Miles Davis's Classic Album Kind of Blue|journal=Musical Quarterly|date=2012|volume=95|issue=1|pages=15\u201335|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gds006}}</ref>\n\n\"I didn't write out the music for ''Kind of Blue'', but brought in sketches for what everybody was supposed to play because I wanted a lot of spontaneity,\"<ref>Davis, Miles (1989: 234). ''The Autobiography''. New York: Touchstone.</ref> recalled Davis. The track \"So What\" has only two chords: [[dominant seventh chord|D-7]] and E{{music|b}}-7.<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=29}}.</ref>\n\nOther innovators in this style include [[Jackie McLean]],<ref>{{harvnb|Litweiler|1984|pp=120\u2013123}}.</ref> and two of the musicians who had also played on ''Kind of Blue'': John Coltrane and Bill Evans.\n\n===Free jazz===\n{{Main|Free jazz}}\n[[File:John Coltrane 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|John Coltrane, 1963]]\nFree jazz, and the related form of [[avant-garde jazz]], broke through into an open space of \"free tonality\" in which meter, beat, and formal symmetry all disappeared, and a range of [[world music]] from India, Africa, and Arabia were melded into an intense, even religiously ecstatic or orgiastic style of playing.<ref>Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book''. 1981. Page 21.</ref> While loosely inspired by bebop, free jazz tunes gave players much more latitude; the loose harmony and tempo was deemed controversial when this approach was first developed. The bassist [[Charles Mingus]] is also frequently associated with the avant-garde in jazz, although his compositions draw from myriad styles and genres.\n\nThe first major stirrings came in the 1950s with the early work of [[Ornette Coleman]] (whose 1960 album ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation]]'' coined the term) and [[Cecil Taylor]]. In the 1960s, exponents included [[Albert Ayler]], [[Gato Barbieri]], [[Carla Bley]], [[Don Cherry]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Bill Dixon]], [[Jimmy Giuffre]], [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Michael Mantler]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Roswell Rudd]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], and [[John Tchicai]]. In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist [[Gary Peacock]] and drummer [[Sunny Murray]], a rhythm section honed with [[Cecil Taylor]] as leader. In November 1961, Coltrane played a gig at the Village Vanguard, which resulted in the classic ''Chasin' the 'Trane'', which ''Down Beat'' magazine panned as \"anti-jazz\". On his 1961 tour of France, he was booed, but persevered, signing with the new [[Impulse! Records]] in 1960 and turning it into \"the house that Trane built\", while championing many younger free jazz musicians, notably [[Archie Shepp]], who often played with trumpeter [[Bill Dixon]], who organized the 4-day \"October Revolution in Jazz\" in Manhattan in 1964, the first free jazz festival.\n\nA series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming increasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like [[multiphonics]], utilization of overtones, and playing in the [[altissimo]] register, as well as a mutated return to Coltrane's [[sheets of sound]]. In the studio, he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone. In addition, the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom.  The group's evolution can be traced through the recordings ''[[The John Coltrane Quartet Plays]]'', ''[[Living Space (album)|Living Space]]'' and ''[[Transition (John Coltrane album)|Transition]]'' (both June 1965), ''[[New Thing at Newport]]'' (July 1965), ''[[Sun Ship]]'' (August 1965), and ''[[First Meditations]]'' (September 1965).\n\nIn June 1965, Coltrane and 10 other musicians recorded ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'', a 40-minute-long piece without breaks that included adventurous solos by young avante-garde musicians as well as Coltrane, and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. [[Dave Liebman]] later called it \"the torch that lit the free jazz thing.\".  After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Pharoah Sanders to join the band in September 1965.  While Coltrane used over-blowing frequently as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would opt to overblow his entire solo, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument.\n\n====Free jazz in Europe====\n[[File:Peter-broetzmann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Peter Br\u00f6tzmann]] is a key figure in European free jazz.]]\n\nFree jazz was played in Europe in part because musicians such as Ayler, Taylor, [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], and [[Eric Dolphy]] spent extended periods of time there, and European musicians such as [[Michael Mantler]] and [[John Tchicai]] traveled to the U.S. to experience American music firsthand. European contemporary jazz was shaped by [[Peter Br\u00f6tzmann]], [[John Surman]], [[Krzysztof Komeda]], [[Zbigniew Namys\u0142owski]], [[Tomasz Stanko]], [[Lars Gullin]], [[Joe Harriott]], [[Albert Mangelsdorff]], [[Kenny Wheeler]], [[Graham Collier]], [[Michael Garrick]] and [[Mike Westbrook]]. They were eager to develop approaches to music that reflected their heritage.\n\nSince the 1960s, creative centers of jazz in Europe have developed, such as the creative jazz scene in Amsterdam. Following the work of drummer [[Han Bennink]] and pianist [[Misha Mengelberg]], musicians started to explore by improvising collectively until a form (melody, rhythm, a famous song) is found  Jazz critic [[Kevin Whitehead]] documented the free jazz scene in Amsterdam and some of its main exponents such as the ICP (Instant Composers Pool) orchestra in his book ''New Dutch Swing''. Since the 1990s Keith Jarrett has defended free jazz from criticism. British writer Stuart Nicholson has argued European contemporary jazz has an identity different from American jazz and follows a different trajectory.<ref name=\"Nicholson\">{{cite book |last1=Nicholson |first1=Stuart |title=Is Jazz Dead? Or Has it Moved to a New Address? |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York}}</ref>\n\n===Latin jazz===\n{{Main|Latin jazz}}\nLatin jazz is jazz that employs Latin American rhythms and is generally understood to have a more specific meaning than simply jazz from Latin America. A more precise term might be ''Afro-Latin jazz'', as the jazz subgenre typically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa or exhibit an African rhythmic influence beyond what is ordinarily heard in other jazz. The two main categories of Latin jazz are [[Afro-Cuban jazz]] and Brazilian jazz.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, many jazz musicians had only a basic understanding of Cuban and Brazilian music, and jazz compositions which used Cuban or Brazilian elements were often referred to as \"Latin tunes\", with no distinction between a Cuban [[son montuno]] and a Brazilian [[bossa nova]]. Even as late as 2000, in Mark Gridley's ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', a bossa nova bass line is referred to as a \"Latin bass figure.\"<ref>Gridley, Mark C. (2000: 444). ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', 7th ed.</ref> It was not uncommon during the 1960s and 1970s to hear a conga playing a Cuban [[tumbao]] while the drumset and bass played a Brazilian bossa nova pattern. Many jazz standards such as \"Manteca\", \"On Green Dolphin Street\" and \"Song for My Father\" have a \"Latin\" A section and a swung B section. Typically, the band would only play an even-eighth \"Latin\" feel in the A section of the head and swing throughout all of the solos. Latin jazz specialists like [[Cal Tjader]] tended to be the exception. For example, on a 1959 live Tjader recording of \"A Night in Tunisia\", pianist [[Vince Guaraldi]] soloed through the entire form over an authentic [[mambo (music)|mambo]].<ref>Tjader, Cal (1959). ''Monterey Concerts''. Prestige CD. ASIN: B000000ZCY.</ref>\n\n====Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance====\nFor most of its history, Afro-Cuban jazz had been a matter of superimposing jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms. But by the end of the 1970s, a new generation of New York City musicians had emerged who were fluent in both [[salsa (music)|salsa]] dance music and jazz, leading to a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry (congas and trumpet) and Andy (bass).<ref>Andy Gonzalez interviewed by Larry Birnbaum. Ed. Boggs, Vernon W. (1992: 297\u2013298). ''Salsiology; Afro-Cuban Music and the Evolution of Salsa in New York City''. New York: Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|0-313-28468-7}}</ref> During 1974\u20131976, they were members of one of [[Eddie Palmieri]]'s most experimental salsa groups: salsa was the medium, but Palmieri was stretching the form in new ways. He incorporated parallel fourths, with McCoy Tyner-type vamps. The innovations of Palmieri, the Gonzalez brothers and others led to an Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance in New York City.\n\nThis occurred in parallel with developments in Cuba<ref>Acosta, Leonardo (2003). ''Cubano Be, Cubano Bop: One Hundred Years of Jazz in Cuba'', p. 59. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books. {{ISBN|1-58834-147-X}}</ref> The first Cuban band of this new wave was [[Irakere]]. Their \"Ch\u00e9kere-son\" (1976) introduced a style of \"Cubanized\" bebop-flavored horn lines that departed from the more angular guajeo-based lines which were typical of Cuban popular music and Latin jazz up until that time. It was based on Charlie Parker's composition \"Billie's Bounce\", jumbled together in a way that fused clave and bebop horn lines.<ref>Moore, Kevin (2007) \"History and Discography of Irakere\". [http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/history-and-discography-of-irakere ''Timba.com''.]</ref> In spite of the ambivalence of some band members towards Irakere's Afro-Cuban folkloric / jazz fusion, their experiments forever changed Cuban jazz: their innovations are still heard in the high level of harmonic and rhythmic complexity in Cuban jazz and in the jazzy and complex contemporary form of popular dance music known as [[timba]].\n\n====Afro-Brazilian jazz====\n[[File:Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos.jpg|thumb|upright|Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos playing the Afro-Brazilian [[Berimbau]]]]\n\nBrazilian jazz, such as [[bossa nova]], is derived from [[samba]], with influences from jazz and other 20th-century classical and popular music styles. Bossa is generally moderately paced, with melodies sung in Portuguese or English, whilst the related jazz-samba is an adaptation of street samba into jazz.\n\nThe bossa nova style was pioneered by Brazilians [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]] and [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] and was made popular by [[Elizete Cardoso]]'s recording of \"[[Chega de Saudade]]\" on the ''[[Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Amor Demais]]'' LP. Gilberto's initial releases, and the 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'', achieved significant popularity in [[Latin America]]; this spread to North America via visiting American jazz musicians. The resulting recordings by [[Charlie Byrd]] and Stan Getz cemented bossa nova's popularity and led to a worldwide boom, with 1963's ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'', numerous recordings by famous jazz performers such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], and the eventual entrenchment of the bossa nova style as a lasting influence in world music.\n\nBrazilian percussionists such as [[Airto Moreira]] and [[Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos]] also influenced jazz internationally by introducing Afro-Brazilian folkloric instruments and rhythms into a wide variety of jazz styles, thus attracting a greater audience to them.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yanow|first=Scott|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p36965/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Airto Moreira|website=AllMusic|date=August 5, 1941|accessdate=2011-10-22}}</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6300/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Biography]</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Robert|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E6DF123BF93BA15755C0A964948260|title=Jazz Festival \u2013 A Study Of Folk-Jazz Fusion \u2013 Review|newspaper=New York Times|date=1982-06-28|accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>\n\n===African-inspired===\n[[File:Randy Weston.jpg|thumb|upright|Randy Weston]]\n\n====Rhythm====\nThe first [[jazz standard]] composed by a non-Latino to use an overt African {{music|time|12|8}} cross-rhythm was [[Wayne Shorter]]'s \"[[Footprints (composition)|Footprints]]\" (1967).<ref>\"Footprints\" ''Miles Smiles'' (Miles Davis).

The use of pentatonic scales in Africa probably goes back thousands of years.<ref>An ancient west central Sudanic stratum of ''pentatonic'' song composition, often associated with simple work rhythms in a regular meter, but with notable off-beat accents ... reaches back perhaps thousands of years to early West African sorgum agriculturalists\u2014Kubik, Gerhard (1999: 95). ''Africa and the Blues''. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi.</ref>\n\n[[McCoy Tyner]] perfected the use of the pentatonic scale in his solos,<ref>Gridley, Mark C. (2000: 270). ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', 7th ed.</ref> and also used parallel fifths and fourths, which are common harmonies in West Africa.<ref>Map showing distribution of harmony in Africa. Jones, A.M. (1959). ''Studies in African Music.'' Oxford Press.</ref>\n\nThe minor pentatonic scale is often used in blues improvisation, and like a blues scale, a minor pentatonic scale can be played over all of the chords in a blues. The following pentatonic lick was played over blues changes by [[Joe Henderson]] on [[Horace Silver]]'s \"African Queen\" (1965).<ref>{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=235}}.</ref>\n\nJazz pianist, theorist, and educator [[Mark Levine (musician)|Mark Levine]] refers to the scale generated by beginning on the fifth step of a pentatonic scale as the ''V pentatonic scale''.<ref>Levine, Mark (1989: 127). ''The Jazz Piano Book''. Petaluma, CA: Sher Music. ASIN: B004532DEE</ref>\n\n[[File:I IV V pentatonic.tiff|thumb|center|upright=2.05|C pentatonic scale beginning on the I (C pentatonic), IV (F pentatonic), and V (G pentatonic) steps of the scale.{{clarify|date=August 2012}}<!--the text above says the fifth step of a pentatonic scale, but this shows the fifth step of the C major diatonic scale-->]]\n\nLevine points out that the V pentatonic scale works for all three chords of the standard II-V-I jazz progression.<ref>Levine (1989: 127).</ref> This is a very common progression, used in pieces such as Miles Davis' \"Tune Up.\" The following example shows the V pentatonic scale over a II-V-I progression.<ref>After Mark Levine (1989: 127). ''The Jazz Piano Book''.</ref>\n\n[[File:II V I.tiff|thumb|center|upright=2.05|V pentatonic scale over II-V-I chord progression.]]\n\nAccordingly, John Coltrane's \"[[Giant Steps]]\" (1960), with its 26 chords per 16 bars, can be played using only three pentatonic scales. Coltrane studied [[Nicolas Slonimsky]]'s ''Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns'', which contains material that is virtually identical to portions of \"Giant Steps\".<ref>Bair, Jeff (2003: 5).

PhD Thesis. University of North Texas.</ref> The harmonic complexity of \"Giant Steps\" is on the level of the most advanced 20th-century art music. Superimposing the pentatonic scale over \"Giant Steps\" is not merely a matter of harmonic simplification, but also a sort of \"Africanizing\" of the piece, which provides an alternate approach for soloing. Mark Levine observes that when mixed in with more conventional \"playing the changes\", pentatonic scales provide \"structure and a feeling of increased space.\"<ref>Levine, Mark (1995: 205).

Sher Music. {{ISBN|1-883217-04-0}}.</ref>\n\n===Sacred and liturgical jazz===\n{{Main|Sacred jazz}}\nAs noted above, jazz has incorporated from its inception aspects of African American sacred music including spirituals and hymns. Secular jazz musicians often performed renditions of spirituals and hymns as part of their repertoire or isolated compositions such as \"Come Sunday,\" part of  \"Black and Beige Suite\" by [[Duke Ellington]]. Later many other jazz artists borrowed from black [[gospel music]]. However, it was only after World War II that a few jazz musicians began to compose and perform extended works intended for religious settings and/or as religious expression. Since the 1950's, sacred and liturgical music has been performed and recorded by many prominent jazz composers and musicians. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowes |first1=Malcolm |title=Jazz in the chapel |journal=Music Journal |date=11/1/1966 |volume=24 |issue=9 |page=45 |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref> The \"Abyssinian Mass\" by [[Wynton Marsalis]] (Blueengine Records, 2016) is a recent example.\n\nUnfortunately, relatively little has been written about sacred and liturgical jazz. In a 2013 doctoral dissertation, Angelo Versace examined the development of sacred jazz in the 1950s using disciplines of musicology and history. He noted that the traditions of black gospel music and jazz were combined in the 1950s to produce a new genre, \"sacred jazz.\"<ref name=\"Versace\">{{cite web |last1=Versace |first1=Angelo |title=The Evolution of Sacred Jazz as Reflected in the Music of Mary Lou Williams, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane and Recognized Contemporary Sacred Jazz Artists |url=https://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/oa_dissertations/991 |website=Open Access Dissertations |publisher=University of Miami |accessdate=28 March 2020 |date=30 April 2013}}</ref> Versace maintained that that the religious intent separates sacred from secular jazz. Most prominent in initiating the sacred jazz movement were pianist and composer [[Mary Lou Williams]], known for her jazz masses in the 1950s and [[Duke Ellington]]. Prior to his death in 1974 in response to contacts from Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, [[Duke Ellington]] wrote three Sacred Concerts: 1965 - A Concert of Sacred Music; 1968 - Second Sacred Concert; 1973 - Third Sacred Concert.  \n\nThe most prominent form of sacred and liturgical jazz is the jazz mass. Although most often performed in a concert setting rather than church worship setting, this form has many examples. An eminent example of composers of the jazz mass was [[Mary Lou Williams]]. Williams converted to Catholicism in 1957, and proceeded to compose three masses in the jazz idiom.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Corbin |first1=Ian M. |title=A jazz mass?

It was performed once in 1975 in St Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. However the [[Catholic church]] has not embraced jazz as appropriate for worship. In 1966 Joe Masters recorded \"Jazz Mass\" for Columbia Records. A jazz ensemble was joined by soloists and choir using the English text of the Roman Catholic Mass. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Connor |first1=Norman |title=The Jazz Mass by Joe Masters |journal=Choral Journal |date=1 February 1970 |volume=10 |issue=5 |page=19 |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref> Other examples include  \"Jazz Mass in Concert\" by [[Lalo Schiffrin]](Aleph Records, 1998, UPC 0651702632725) and \"Jazz Mass\" by [[Vince Guaraldi]] (Fantasy Records, 1965). In England, classical composer [[Will Todd]] recorded his \"Jazz Missa Brevis\" with jazz ensemble, solists and the St Martin's Voices on a 2018 Signum Records release, \"Passion Music/Jazz Missa Brevis\" also released as \"Mass in Blue,\" and jazz organist James Taylor composed \"The Rochester Mass\"   (Cherry Red Records, 2015) <ref>{{cite news |last1=Peel |first1=Adrian |title='The Rochester Mass,' a new concept from organist James Taylor |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/music/the-rochester-mass-a-new-concept-from-organist-james-taylor/article/450967 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |agency=Digital Journal |publisher=Digital Journal |date=2 December 2015}}</ref>. In 2013, Versace put forth bassist [[Ike Sturm]] and New York composer Deanna Witkowski as contemporary exemplars of sacred and liturgical jazz. <ref name=\"Versace\" />\n\n===Jazz fusion===\n{{Main|Jazz fusion}}\n[[File:Miles Davis 24.jpg|thumb|right|Fusion trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] in 1989]]\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the hybrid form of jazz-rock [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] was developed by combining jazz improvisation with rock rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound of rock musicians such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters, odd time signatures, syncopation, complex chords, and harmonies.\n\nAccording to [[AllMusic]]:\n\n<blockquote>... until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate. [However, ...] as rock became more creative and its musicianship improved, and as some in the jazz world became bored with [[hard bop]] and did not want to play strictly [[free jazz|avant-garde music]], the two different idioms began to trade ideas and occasionally combine forces.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d299|pure_url=yes}}|title=Explore: Fusion|website=AllMusic|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Miles Davis' new directions====\nIn 1969, Davis fully embraced the electric instrument approach to jazz with ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', which can be considered his first fusion album. Composed of two side-long suites edited heavily by producer [[Teo Macero]], this quiet, static album would be equally influential to the development of [[ambient music]].\n\nAs Davis recalls:\n\n<blockquote>The music I was really listening to in 1968 was [[James Brown]], the great guitar player [[Jimi Hendrix]], and a new group who had just come out with a hit record, \"[[Dance to the Music (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Dance to the Music]]\", [[Sly and the Family Stone]] ... I wanted to make it more like rock. When we recorded ''In a Silent Way'' I just threw out all the chord sheets and told everyone to play off of that.<ref>Davis, Miles, with Quincy Troupe (1989: 298) ''The Autobiography''. New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo contributors to ''In a Silent Way'' also joined organist [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]] to create one of the early acclaimed fusion albums: [[Emergency! (album)|''Emergency!'']] by [[The Tony Williams Lifetime]].\n\n====Psychedelic-jazz====\n\n=====Weather Report=====\n[[Weather Report]]'s self-titled electronic and psychedelic ''[[Weather Report (1971 album)|Weather Report]]'' debut album caused a sensation in the jazz world on its arrival in 1971, thanks to the pedigree of the group's members (including percussionist [[Airto Moreira]]), and their unorthodox approach to music. The album featured a softer sound than would be the case in later years (predominantly using acoustic bass with Shorter exclusively playing [[soprano saxophone]], and with no [[synthesizer]]s involved), but is still considered a classic of early fusion. It built on the avant-garde experiments which [[Joe Zawinul]] and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favour of continuous rhythm and movement \u2013 but took the music further. To emphasise the group's rejection of standard methodology, the album opened with the inscrutable avant-garde atmospheric piece \"Milky Way\", which featured by Shorter's extremely muted saxophone inducing vibrations in Zawinul's piano strings while the latter pedalled the instrument. ''[[Down Beat]]'' described the album as \"music beyond category\", and awarded it Album of the Year in the magazine's polls that year.\n\n[[Weather Report]]'s subsequent releases were creative funk-jazz works.<ref>Dan, Morgenstern (1971). ''Down Beat'' May 13.</ref>\n\n====Jazz-rock====\nAlthough some jazz purists protested against the blend of jazz and rock, many jazz innovators crossed over from the contemporary hard bop scene into fusion. As well as the electric instruments of rock (such as electric guitar, electric bass, electric piano and synthesizer keyboards), fusion also used the powerful amplification, [[Distortion (music)|\"fuzz\" pedals]], [[wah-wah pedal]]s and other effects that were used by 1970s-era rock bands. Notable performers of jazz fusion included Miles Davis, [[Eddie Harris]], keyboardists [[Joe Zawinul]], [[Chick Corea]], and Herbie Hancock, vibraphonist [[Gary Burton]], drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)]], violinist [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], guitarists [[Larry Coryell]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Ryo Kawasaki]], and [[Frank Zappa]], saxophonist Wayne Shorter and bassists [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Stanley Clarke]]. Jazz fusion was also popular in Japan, where the band [[Casiopea]] released over thirty fusion albums.\n\nAccording to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, \"just as free jazz appeared on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the 1960s ... jazz-rock briefly suggested the promise of doing the same\" with albums such as Williams' ''[[Emergency! (album)|Emergency!]]'' (1970) and Davis' ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'' (1975), which Nicholson said \"suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before.\" This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre \"mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio\" at the end of the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|page=614|last1=Harrison|first1=Max|last2=Thacker|first2=Eric|last3=Nicholson|first3=Stuart|title=The Essential Jazz Records: Modernism to Postmodernism|year=2000|publisher=[[A&C Black]]|isbn=978-0-7201-1822-3}}</ref>\n\n===Jazz-funk===\n{{Main|Jazz-funk}}\nBy the mid-1970s, the sound known as jazz-funk had developed, characterized by a strong [[beat (music)|back beat]] ([[Groove (music)|groove]]), electrified sounds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/jazz/jazzfunk/more.html |title=Free Jazz-Funk Music: Album, Track and Artist Charts |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920131709/http://www.rhapsody.com/jazz/jazzfunk/more.html |archivedate=2008-09-20 }}, ''Rhapsody Online&nbsp;\u2014 Rhapsody.com'' (October 20, 2010).</ref> and, often, the presence of electronic [[analog synthesizers]]. Jazz-funk also draws influences from traditional African music, Afro-Cuban rhythms and Jamaican [[reggae]], notably Kingston bandleader [[Sonny Bradshaw]]. Another feature is the shift of emphasis from improvisation to composition: arrangements, melody and overall writing became important. The integration of [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is wide and ranges from strong [[Musical improvisation#Jazz improvisation|jazz improvisation]] to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz [[riff]]s and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/explore/style/d202 |title=Explore: Jazz-Funk |accessdate=October 19, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019041451/http://allmusic.com/explore/style/d202 |archivedate=October 19, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nEarly examples are Herbie Hancock's [[The Headhunters|Headhunters]] band and Miles Davis' ''[[On the Corner]]'' album, which, in 1972, began Davis' foray into jazz-funk and was, he claimed, an attempt at reconnecting with the young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for [[rock and roll|rock]] and funk. While there is a discernible rock and funk influence in the [[timbre]]s of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian tambora and tablas and Cuban congas and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. The album was a culmination of sorts of the ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'' approach that Davis and producer [[Teo Macero]] had begun to explore in the late 1960s.\n\n===Traditionalism in the 1980s===\n{{main|1980s in jazz}}\n[[File:Wynton Marsalis 2009 09 13.jpg|thumb|right|Wynton Marsalis]]\n\nThe 1980s saw something of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]] emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Duke Ellington]], as well as the hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly [[modal jazz]] and [[post-bop]]); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.\n\nFor example, several musicians who had been prominent in the [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] genre during the 1970s began to record acoustic jazz once more, including [[Chick Corea]] and [[Herbie Hancock]]. Other musicians who had experimented with electronic instruments in the previous decade had abandoned them by the 1980s; for example, [[Bill Evans]], [[Joe Henderson]], and [[Stan Getz]]. Even the 1980s music of [[Miles Davis]], although certainly still fusion, adopted a far more accessible and recognisably jazz-oriented approach than his abstract work of the mid-1970s, such as a return to a theme-and-solos approach.\n\nThe emergence of young jazz talent beginning to perform in older, established musicians' groups further impacted the resurgence of traditionalism in the jazz community. In the 1970s, the groups of [[Betty Carter]] and [[The Jazz Messengers|Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers]] retained their conservative jazz approaches in the midst of fusion and jazz-rock, and in addition to difficulty booking their acts, struggled to find younger generations of personnel to authentically play traditional styles such as [[hard bop]] and [[bebop]]. In the late 1970s, however, a resurgence of younger jazz players in Blakey's band began to occur. This movement included musicians such as [[Valery Ponomarev]] and [[Bobby Watson]], [[Dennis Irwin]] and [[James Williams (musician)|James Williams]].\nIn the 1980s, in addition to [[Wynton Marsalis|Wynton]] and [[Branford Marsalis]], the emergence of pianists in the Jazz Messengers such as [[Donald Brown (musician)|Donald Brown]], [[Mulgrew Miller]], and later, Benny Green, bassists such as [[Charles Fambrough]], [[Lonnie Plaxico]] (and later, [[Peter Washington]] and Essiet Essiet) horn players such as [[Bill Pierce (saxophonist)|Bill Pierce]], [[Donald Harrison]] and later [[Javon Jackson]] and [[Terence Blanchard]] emerged as talented jazz musicians, all of whom made significant contributions in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nThe young Jazz Messengers' contemporaries, including [[Roy Hargrove]], [[Marcus Roberts]], [[Wallace Roney]] and [[Mark Whitfield]] were also influenced by [[Wynton Marsalis]]'s emphasis toward jazz tradition. These younger rising stars rejected avant-garde approaches and instead championed the acoustic jazz sound of [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and early recordings of the first [[Miles Davis]] quintet. This group of \"Young Lions\" sought to reaffirm jazz as a high art tradition comparable to the discipline of classical music.<ref name=\"Guilliatt, Richard\">{{cite web |last1=Guilliatt |first1=Richard |title=Jazz: The Young Lions' Roar |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-13/entertainment/ca-1495_1_lincoln-center-jazz-orchestra|website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=14 January 2018 |date=13 September 1992}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Betty Carter]]'s rotation of young musicians in her group foreshadowed many of New York's preeminent traditional jazz players later in their careers. Among these musicians were Jazz Messenger alumni [[Benny Green (pianist)|Benny Green]], [[Branford Marsalis]] and [[Ralph Peterson Jr.]], as well as [[Kenny Washington (musician)|Kenny Washington]], [[Lewis Nash]], [[Curtis Lundy]], [[Cyrus Chestnut]], [[Mark Shim]], [[Craig Handy]], Greg Hutchinson and [[Marc Cary]], [[Taurus Mateen]] and [[Geri Allen]].\n\n[[Out of the Blue (American band)|O.T.B.]] ensemble included a rotation of young jazz musicians such as [[Kenny Garrett]], [[Steve Wilson (jazz musician)|Steve Wilson]], [[Kenny Davis (musician)|Kenny Davis]], [[Renee Rosnes]], [[Ralph Peterson Jr.]], [[Billy Drummond]], and [[Robert Hurst (musician)|Robert Hurst]].<ref name=\"Out\">{{cite web|last1=Yanow|first1=Scott |title=Out of the Blue |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/out-of-the-blue-mn0000419825/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=14 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nA similar reaction{{Vague|date=January 2018}} took place against free jazz. According to [[Ted Gioia]]:\n\n<blockquote>the very leaders of the avant garde started to signal a retreat from the core principles of free jazz. Anthony Braxton began recording standards over familiar chord changes. [[Cecil Taylor]] played duets in concert with [[Mary Lou Williams]], and let her set out structured harmonies and familiar jazz vocabulary under his blistering keyboard attack. And the next generation of progressive players would be even more accommodating, moving inside and outside the changes without thinking twice. Musicians such as David Murray or [[Don Pullen]] may have felt the call of free-form jazz, but they never forgot all the other ways one could play African-American music for fun and profit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz.com/jazz-blog/2008/2/27/where-did-our-revolution-go-part-three |title=Where Did Our Revolution Go?

Chick Corea similarly began exploring jazz standards in the 1980s, having neglected them for the 1970s.\n\nIn 1987, the United States House of Representatives and Senate passed a bill proposed by Democratic Representative [[John Conyers Jr.]] to define jazz as a unique form of American music, stating \"jazz is hereby designated as a rare and valuable national American treasure to which we should devote our attention, support and resources to make certain it is preserved, understood and promulgated.\" It passed in the House on September 23, 1987 and in the Senate on November 4, 1987.<ref name=HR57>HR-57 Center [http://www.hr57.org/hconres57.html HR-57 Center for the Preservation of Jazz and Blues, with the six-point mandate.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918100538/http://www.hr57.org/hconres57.html |date=2008-09-18 }}</ref>\n\n===Smooth jazz===\n{{Main|Smooth jazz}}\n[[File:David Sanborn 2008 2.jpg|thumb|upright|David Sanborn, 2008]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called \"pop fusion\" or \"smooth jazz\" became successful, garnering significant radio airplay in \"[[quiet storm]]\" time slots at radio stations in urban markets across the U.S. This helped to establish or bolster the careers of vocalists including [[Al Jarreau]], [[Anita Baker]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[Sade Adu|Sade]], as well as saxophonists including [[Grover Washington Jr.]], [[Kenny G]], [[Kirk Whalum]], [[Boney James]], and [[David Sanborn]]. In general, smooth jazz is downtempo (the most widely played tracks are of 90\u2013105 [[beats per minute]]), and has a lead melody-playing instrument (saxophone, especially soprano and tenor, and [[legato]] electric guitar are popular).\n\nIn his ''[[Newsweek]]'' article \"The Problem With Jazz Criticism\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Opinion: The Problem With Jazz Criticism|author=Stanley Crouch|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/58477|website=Newsweek|date=June 5, 2003|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> [[Stanley Crouch]] considers Miles Davis' playing of fusion to be a turning point that led to smooth jazz.

It can be very experimental in nature and can vary widely in sound and concept. It ranges from the combination of live instrumentation with the beats of jazz [[house music|house]] (as exemplified by [[Saint Germain (musician)|St Germain]], [[Jazzanova]], and [[Fila Brazillia]]) to more band-based improvised jazz with electronic elements (for example, [[The Cinematic Orchestra]], [[Kobol (band)|Kobol]] and the Norwegian \"future jazz\" style pioneered by [[Bugge Wesseltoft]], [[Jaga Jazzist]], and [[Nils Petter Molv\u00e6r]]).\n\n[[Jazz rap]] developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and incorporates jazz influences into [[hip hop]].

Gang Starr's debut LP ''[[No More Mr. Nice Guy (Gang Starr album)|No More Mr. Nice Guy]]'' (1989) and their 1990 track \"Jazz Thing\" sampled [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Ramsey Lewis]]. The groups which made up the [[Native Tongues Posse]] tended toward jazzy releases: these include the [[Jungle Brothers]]' debut ''[[Straight Out the Jungle]]'' (1988), and [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s ''[[People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Low End Theory]]'' (1991). Rap duo [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] incorporated jazz influences on their 1992 debut ''[[Mecca and the Soul Brother]]''. Rapper [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]]'s [[Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1|Jazzmatazz]] series began in 1993 using jazz musicians during the studio recordings.\n\nAlthough jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, Miles Davis' final album ''[[Doo-Bop]]'' (released posthumously in 1992) was based on hip hop beats and collaborations with producer [[Easy Mo Bee]]. Davis' ex-bandmate [[Herbie Hancock]] also absorbed hip-hop influences in the mid-1990s, releasing the album ''[[Dis Is Da Drum]]'' in 1994.\n\n===Punk jazz and jazzcore===\n[[File:John Zorn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Zorn]] performing in 2006]]\nThe relaxation of orthodoxy which was concurrent with [[post-punk]] in London and New York City led to a new appreciation of jazz.

Individual performers often play in a variety of styles, sometimes in the same performance. Pianist [[Brad Mehldau]] and [[The Bad Plus]] have explored contemporary rock music within the context of the traditional jazz acoustic piano trio, recording instrumental jazz versions of songs by rock musicians. The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music. A firm avant-garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players, such as saxophonists [[Greg Osby]] and [[Charles Gayle]], while others, such as [[James Carter (musician)|James Carter]], have incorporated free jazz elements into a more traditional framework.\n\n[[Harry Connick Jr.]] began his career playing stride piano and the dixieland jazz of his home, New Orleans, beginning with his first recording when he was ten years old.<ref name=\"Bush\">{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=John|title=Harry Connick, Jr|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/harry-connick-jr-mn0000949259/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=14 January 2018}}</ref> Some of his earliest lessons were at the home of pianist [[Ellis Marsalis Jr.|Ellis Marsalis]].<ref name=\"home\">{{Cite episode| title =Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick Jr.| series =Finding Your Roots| first =Henry| last =Louis Gates Jr. (host)| network =PBS| date =July 17, 2010| season =1| number =1|type=DVD}}</ref> Connick had success on the pop charts after recording the soundtrack to the movie ''[[When Harry Met Sally]]'', which sold over two million copies.<ref name=\"Bush\" /> Crossover success has also been achieved by [[Diana Krall]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Kurt Elling]], and [[Jamie Cullum]].\n\nA number of players who usually perform in largely [[straight-ahead jazz|straight-ahead]] settings have emerged since the 1990s, including pianists [[Jason Moran (musician)|Jason Moran]] and [[Vijay Iyer]], guitarist [[Kurt Rosenwinkel]], vibraphonist [[Stefon Harris]], trumpeters [[Roy Hargrove]] and [[Terence Blanchard]], saxophonists [[Chris Potter (jazz saxophonist)|Chris Potter]] and [[Joshua Redman]], clarinetist [[Ken Peplowski]] and bassist [[Christian McBride]].\n\nAlthough [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]] reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s, the use of electronic instruments and rock-derived musical elements in jazz continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Musicians using this approach include [[Pat Metheny]], [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]], [[John Scofield]] and the Swedish group [[Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson Trio|e.s.t.]] Since the beginning of the 90s, electronic music had significant technical improvements that popularized and created new possibilities for the genre. Jazz elements such as improvisation, rhythmic complexities and harmonic textures were introduced to the genre and consequently had a big impact in new listeners and in some ways kept the versatility of jazz relatable to a newer generation that did not necessarily relate to what the traditionalists call real jazz (bebop, cool and modal jazz).<ref>Nicholson, Stuart (January 3, 2003),  [https://jazztimes.com/features/jazztronica-a-brief-history-of-the-future-of-jazz/ \"Jazztronica: A Brief History of the Future of Jazz\"], ''JazzTimes''.</ref> Artists such as [[Squarepusher]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Flying Lotus]] and sub genres like [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]], Drum n' Bass, Jungle and [[Techno]] ended up incorporating a lot of these elements.<ref>Kalouti, Noor, et al.

It received some criticism, however, for its failure to reflect the many distinctive non-American traditions and styles in jazz that had developed, and its limited representation of US developments in the last quarter of the 20th century.\n\nThe mid-2010s have seen an increasing influence of R&B, hip-hop, and pop music on jazz. In 2015, [[Kendrick Lamar]] released his third studio album, ''[[To Pimp a Butterfly]]''. The album heavily featured prominent contemporary jazz artists such as [[Thundercat (musician)|Thundercat]]<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite AV media notes |title=To Pimp a Butterfly |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/to-pimp-a-butterfly-mw0002835159/credits |publisher=[[Interscope Records]]}}</ref> and redefined jazz rap with a larger focus on improvisation and live soloing rather than simply sampling. In that same year, saxophonist [[Kamasi Washington]] released his nearly three-hour long debut, ''[[The Epic (album)|The Epic]]''. Its hip-hop inspired beats and R&B vocal interludes was not only acclaimed by critics for being innovative in keeping jazz relevant,<ref>{{cite web|author=Russell Warfield|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/18781/reviews/4148955|title=The Epic|website=drownedinsound.com|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref> but also sparked a small resurgence in jazz on the internet.\n\nAnother internet-aided trend of 2010's jazz is that of extreme [[reharmonization]], inspired by both virtuosic players known for their speed and rhythm such as [[Art Tatum]], as well as players known for their ambitious voicings and chords such as Bill Evans. Supergroup [[Snarky Puppy]] has adopted this trend and has allowed for players like [[Cory Henry]]<ref>{{cite web|author=David Hochman|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhochman/2018/05/15/grammy-winning-keyboardist-cory-henry-on-inspiration-and-funky-improvisation/#72e76b0738ce|title=Grammy-Winning Keyboardist Cory Henry On Inspiration And Funky Improvisation|date=May 15, 2018|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}</ref> to shape the grooves and harmonies of modern jazz soloing.
