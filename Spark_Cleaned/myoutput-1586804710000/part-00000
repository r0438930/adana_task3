Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the Government's inflation target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base [[interest rate]], which is decided by the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]], and through its communications strategy, such as publishing [[yield curve]]s.<ref>Bank of England \u2013 Yield Curves by [[Internet Archive]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20110421034658/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/]</ref>\n\n:Maintaining financial stability involves protecting against threats to the whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank's surveillance and [[market intelligence]] functions. The threats are then dealt with through financial and other operations, both at home and abroad. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may act as the [[lender of last resort]] by extending credit when no other institution will.\nThe Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability, including:\n* [[HM Treasury]], the Government department responsible for financial and economic policy; and\n* Other central banks and international organisations, with the aim of improving the international financial system.\nThe 1997 [[memorandum of understanding]] describes the terms under which the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA work toward the common aim of increased financial stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between the HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority |accessdate=10 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203101708/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2010, the incoming Chancellor announced his intention to merge the FSA back into the Bank.

It also manages the country's [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]]. The Bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.\n\nThe Bank has a monopoly on the issue of [[banknote]]s in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one for one with deposits at the Bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845. The Bank decided to sell its banknote printing operations to [[De La Rue]] in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2003/041.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Sale of Bank Note Printing|accessdate=10 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nSince 1998, the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) has had the responsibility for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred in 1998 to the new [[Debt Management Office]], which also took over government cash management in 2000. [[Computershare]] took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds ([[gilt-edged security|gilt-edged securities]] or ''gilts'') from the Bank at the end of 2004.\n\nThe Bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries. This responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in June 1998, but after the financial crises in 2008 new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the Bank.\n\nIn 2011, the interim [[Financial Policy Committee]] (FPC) was created as a mirror committee to the MPC to spearhead the Bank's new mandate on financial stability. The FPC is responsible for macro prudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.\n\nTo help maintain economic stability, the Bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, a semiannual Financial Stability Report,<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211185350/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ |date=11 February 2012 }}</ref> and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public.

Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).<ref name=\"APF\"/>\n\n==Banknote issues==\n{{Main|Bank of England note issues}}\nThe Bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were \"White Notes\", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White Notes were issued in \u00a31 and \u00a32 denominations. During the 20th century White Notes were issued in denominations between \u00a35 and \u00a31000.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, commercial banks were allowed to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u00a32 note issued by Evans, Jones, Davies & Co|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118104053/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] began the process of restricting note issue to the Bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] in 1921.<ref name=banknote-history>{{cite web|title=A brief history of banknotes|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/scottish_northernireland.htm|website=Bank of England website|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=fox-note>{{cite web|title=Fox, Fowler & Co. \u00a35 note|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%C2%A35_not.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002040119/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%c2%a35_not.aspx|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the limitations of the 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]], regulated by the Bank.<ref name=scot-ni/>\n\nAt the start of the [[First World War]], the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914]] was passed, which granted temporary powers to [[HM Treasury]] for issuing banknotes to the values of \u00a31 and 10/- (ten shillings). Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible into gold through the Bank; they replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of [[George V|King George V]] (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:\n\n{{quotation|''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND \u2013 Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount \u2013 Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo.

The original plan was to parachute the money into the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above \u00a35 to be removed from circulation.\n\nIn 2006, over \u00a353&nbsp;million in banknotes belonging to the Bank was [[Securitas depot robbery|stolen from a depot]] in [[Tonbridge, Kent]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm|title=Record \u00a353m stolen in depot raid|accessdate=14 September 2014|date=27 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nModern banknotes are printed by contract with [[De La Rue]] Currency in [[Loughton, Essex]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/pages/about/production.aspx|title=Banknote Production|last=|first=|date=|website=bankofengland.co.uk|publisher=Bank of England|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310004155/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/production.aspx|archive-date=10 March 2012|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Gold vault==\nThe bank is custodian to the official gold reserves of the United Kingdom and around 30 other countries.

Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the Government's inflation target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base [[interest rate]], which is decided by the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]], and through its communications strategy, such as publishing [[yield curve]]s.<ref>Bank of England \u2013 Yield Curves by [[Internet Archive]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20110421034658/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/]</ref>\n\n:Maintaining financial stability involves protecting against threats to the whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank's surveillance and [[market intelligence]] functions. The threats are then dealt with through financial and other operations, both at home and abroad. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may act as the [[lender of last resort]] by extending credit when no other institution will.\nThe Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability, including:\n* [[HM Treasury]], the Government department responsible for financial and economic policy; and\n* Other central banks and international organisations, with the aim of improving the international financial system.\nThe 1997 [[memorandum of understanding]] describes the terms under which the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA work toward the common aim of increased financial stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between the HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority |accessdate=10 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203101708/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2010, the incoming Chancellor announced his intention to merge the FSA back into the Bank.

It also manages the country's [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]]. The Bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.\n\nThe Bank has a monopoly on the issue of [[banknote]]s in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one for one with deposits at the Bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845. The Bank decided to sell its banknote printing operations to [[De La Rue]] in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2003/041.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Sale of Bank Note Printing|accessdate=10 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nSince 1998, the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) has had the responsibility for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred in 1998 to the new [[Debt Management Office]], which also took over government cash management in 2000. [[Computershare]] took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds ([[gilt-edged security|gilt-edged securities]] or ''gilts'') from the Bank at the end of 2004.\n\nThe Bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries. This responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in June 1998, but after the financial crises in 2008 new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the Bank.\n\nIn 2011, the interim [[Financial Policy Committee]] (FPC) was created as a mirror committee to the MPC to spearhead the Bank's new mandate on financial stability. The FPC is responsible for macro prudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.\n\nTo help maintain economic stability, the Bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, a semiannual Financial Stability Report,<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211185350/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ |date=11 February 2012 }}</ref> and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public.

Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).<ref name=\"APF\"/>\n\n==Banknote issues==\n{{Main|Bank of England note issues}}\nThe Bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were \"White Notes\", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White Notes were issued in \u00a31 and \u00a32 denominations. During the 20th century White Notes were issued in denominations between \u00a35 and \u00a31000.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, commercial banks were allowed to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u00a32 note issued by Evans, Jones, Davies & Co|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118104053/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] began the process of restricting note issue to the Bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] in 1921.<ref name=banknote-history>{{cite web|title=A brief history of banknotes|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/scottish_northernireland.htm|website=Bank of England website|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=fox-note>{{cite web|title=Fox, Fowler & Co. \u00a35 note|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%C2%A35_not.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002040119/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%c2%a35_not.aspx|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the limitations of the 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]], regulated by the Bank.<ref name=scot-ni/>\n\nAt the start of the [[First World War]], the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914]] was passed, which granted temporary powers to [[HM Treasury]] for issuing banknotes to the values of \u00a31 and 10/- (ten shillings). Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible into gold through the Bank; they replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of [[George V|King George V]] (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:\n\n{{quotation|''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND \u2013 Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount \u2013 Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo.

The original plan was to parachute the money into the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above \u00a35 to be removed from circulation.\n\nIn 2006, over \u00a353&nbsp;million in banknotes belonging to the Bank was [[Securitas depot robbery|stolen from a depot]] in [[Tonbridge, Kent]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm|title=Record \u00a353m stolen in depot raid|accessdate=14 September 2014|date=27 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nModern banknotes are printed by contract with [[De La Rue]] Currency in [[Loughton, Essex]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/pages/about/production.aspx|title=Banknote Production|last=|first=|date=|website=bankofengland.co.uk|publisher=Bank of England|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310004155/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/production.aspx|archive-date=10 March 2012|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Gold vault==\nThe bank is custodian to the official gold reserves of the United Kingdom and around 30 other countries.
