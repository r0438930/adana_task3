All 17 games were played at the [[North Avenue Ice Palace]], however, because most of their opponents also called the building home, JHU only played two homes games. The team played in the [[Baltimore Hockey League]] and played an unbalanced schedule against their four league opponents.\n\nJohns Hopkins athletic teams did not receive a moniker until 1920.\n\n==Roster<ref name=yearbook>{{cite web |url=https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/37611 |title=Hullabaloo 1898 |work=Johns Hopkins University |accessdate=April 25, 2020}}</ref>==\n{{College ice hockey team roster | noNHL =yes }}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=Ronald T. |last=Abercrombie |link= |class= |rs= |pos=C |ft= |in= |wt= |birthyear= |birthmonth= |birthday= |state= |hometown= |prevteam= |prevleague= | noNHL =yes |inj= |cap=}}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=Howard |last=Baetjer |link= |class= |rs= |pos= |ft= |in= |wt= |birthyear= |birthmonth= |birthday= |state= |hometown= |prevteam= |prevleague= | noNHL =yes |inj= |cap=}}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=Joel I. |last=Butler |link= |class= |rs= |pos=C |ft= |in= |wt= |birthyear= |birthmonth= |birthday= |state= |hometown= |prevteam= |prevleague= | noNHL =yes |inj= |cap=}}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=Thomas |last=Fitzgerald |link= |class=sr |rs= |pos=RW |ft= |in= |wt= |birthyear= |birthmonth= |birthday= |state= |hometown= |prevteam= |prevleague= | noNHL =yes |inj= |cap=}}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=William H. |last=Maddren |link= |class= |rs= |pos=D |ft= |in= |wt= |birthyear= |birthmonth= |birthday= |state= |hometown= |prevteam= |prevleague= | noNHL =yes |inj= |cap=}}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=C.

All 17 games were played at the [[North Avenue Ice Palace]], however, because most of their opponents also called the building home, JHU only played two homes games. The team played in the [[Baltimore Hockey League]] and played an unbalanced schedule against their four league opponents.\n\nJohns Hopkins athletic teams did not receive a moniker until 1920.\n\n==Roster<ref name=yearbook>{{cite web |url=https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/37611 |title=Hullabaloo 1898 |work=Johns Hopkins University |accessdate=April 25, 2020}}</ref>==\n{{College ice hockey team roster | noNHL =yes }}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=Ronald T. |last=Abercrombie |link= |class= |rs= |pos=C |ft= |in= |wt= |birthyear= |birthmonth= |birthday= |state= |hometown= |prevteam= |prevleague= | noNHL =yes |inj= |cap=}}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=Howard |last=Baetjer |link= |class= |rs= |pos= |ft= |in= |wt= |birthyear= |birthmonth= |birthday= |state= |hometown= |prevteam= |prevleague= | noNHL =yes |inj= |cap=}}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=Joel I. |last=Butler |link= |class= |rs= |pos=C |ft= |in= |wt= |birthyear= |birthmonth= |birthday= |state= |hometown= |prevteam= |prevleague= | noNHL =yes |inj= |cap=}}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=Thomas |last=Fitzgerald |link= |class=sr |rs= |pos=RW |ft= |in= |wt= |birthyear= |birthmonth= |birthday= |state= |hometown= |prevteam= |prevleague= | noNHL =yes |inj= |cap=}}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=William H. |last=Maddren |link= |class= |rs= |pos=D |ft= |in= |wt= |birthyear= |birthmonth= |birthday= |state= |hometown= |prevteam= |prevleague= | noNHL =yes |inj= |cap=}}\n\n{{CIHplayer |num= |first=C.
