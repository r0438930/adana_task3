She published more than a dozen collections of poetry during her lifetime and 13 novels. She was twice awarded the [[Hawthornden Prize|Hawthornden Prize for Imaginative Literature]]: in 1927 for her pastoral epic, ''The Land'', and in 1933 for her ''Collected Poems''. She was the inspiration for the androgynous protagonist of ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'', by her famous friend and lover, [[Virginia Woolf]].\n \nShe had a longstanding column in ''[[The Observer]]'' (1946\u20131961) and is remembered for the celebrated garden at [[Sissinghurst Castle Garden|Sissinghurst]] created with her husband, Sir [[Harold Nicolson]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Antecedents===\n[[File:Victoria Josepha Sackville-West.jpg|thumb|right|[[Victoria Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville|Victoria Josefa Dolores Catalina Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville]].

She didn't befriend local children and found it hard to make friends at school. Her biographers characterise her childhood as one filled by loneliness and isolation. She wrote prolifically at Knole, penning eight full-length (unpublished) novels between 1906\u20131910, ballads, and many plays, some in French. Her lack of formal education led to later shyness with her peers, such as those in the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. She felt herself to be sluggish of mind and she was never at the intellectual heart of her social group.<ref>Sackville-West (2015) pXiii</ref><ref>Sackville-West (2015) pp1-2</ref><ref>Rose, Norman,''Harold Nicolson'' Random House, 2014, pxxx</ref>\n[[File:Vita in childhood.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Vita in Childhood]]\n\nVita's apparently Roma lineage introduced a passion for 'gypsy' ways, a culture she perceived to be hot-blooded, heart-led, dark and romantic. It informed the stormy nature of many of Vita's later love affairs and was a strong theme in her writing. She visited Roma camps and felt herself to be at one with them.<ref name=\"Sackville-West 2015 p2\"/>\n\nVita's mother had a wide array of famous lovers, including financier [[J. P. Morgan]] and Sir John Murray Scott (from 1897 until his death in 1912). Scott, secretary to the couple who inherited and developed the [[Wallace Collection]], was a devoted companion and Lady Sackville and he were rarely apart during their years together. During her childhood, Vita spent a great deal of time in Scott's apartments in Paris, perfecting her already fluent French.<ref name=\"Sackville-West 2015 p2\"/>\n\n===First loves===\nVita [[Debutante#United Kingdom|debuted]] in 1910, shortly after the death of King [[Edward VII]].

After the wedding the couple lived in [[Cihangir]], a suburb of [[Constantinople]] (now Istanbul), the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Sackville-West loved Constantinople, but the duties of a diplomat's wife did not appeal to her. It was only during this time that she attempted to don, with good grace, the part of a \"correct and adoring wife of the brilliant young diplomat\", as she sarcastically wrote.<ref name=\"dennison\"/>{{rp|97}}<ref name=\"dennison\"/>{{rp|95}} When she became pregnant, in the summer of 1914, the couple returned to England to ensure that she could give birth in a British hospital.\n\nThe family lived at 182 [[Ebury Street]], [[Belgravia]]<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/nicolson-harold-1886-1968 182 Ebury St], Blue Plaque, English Heritage]</ref> and bought [[Long Barn]] in Kent as a country house (1915\u20131930).

Vita often dressed as a man, styled as Keppel's husband.  The two women made a bond to remain faithful to one another, pledging that neither would engage in sexual relations with their husband. {{efn|In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Keppel, Sackville-West wrote: I never ought to have married you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you for as long as you wanted me ... I ought never to have married til I was thirty. I really think that is the best solution for people like me ... Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young.

In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote that she felt very low, entertaining thoughts of suicide, believing that Nicolson would be better off without her.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> In 1920 the lovers ran off again to France together and their husbands chased after them in a small two-seater aeroplane.<ref name=\"Sackville-West 2015 p4\"/> Sackville-West heard allegations that Keppel and her husband Trefusis had been involved sexually, and she broke off the relationship as the lesbian oath of fidelity had been broken.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Despite the rift, the two women stayed devoted to one another.\n\n===Persia===\nFrom 1925 to 1927, Nicolson lived in [[Tehran]] where Sackville-West often visited him.

She told Woolf in one letter: \"I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed\".<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|202}} Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to write quickly, she was inclined to believe that the volumes were written too much in haste: \"Vita's prose is too fluent\".<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|202}} {{efn|Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, wrote to Woolf: \"I shall work so hard [on the next book], partly to please you and partly to please myself ...

Sackville-West's support gave Woolf greater confidence and helped her cast off her self-image of a sickly semi-recluse. She persuaded Woolf that her nervous ailments had been misdiagnosed, and that she should focus on her own varied intellectual projects; that she must learn to rest. {{efn|In 1925, Sackville-West wrote to Woolf: \"Why do you give so much of your energies to the manuscripts of other people?

''The Edwardians'', published next, sold 30,000 copies in its first six months. The boost helped Hogarth financially, though Woolf did not always value the books' romantic themes. The increased security of the Press's fortunes allowed Woolf to write more experimental novels such as ''[[The Waves]]''<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|201}} Though contemporary critics consider Woolf a better writer, critics in the 1920s viewed Sackville-West as more accomplished, with her books outselling Woolf's by a large margin.<ref name=\"smith-2006\"/>{{rp|66\u201367}} {{efn|The extent to which Hogarth depended upon Sackville-West to stay in business was reflected in a letter Woolf sent her on 7 September 1930 saying: \"What about your novel and your poems?

These trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel ''To the Lighthouse'', noteworthy for its theme of longing for someone absent, was partly inspired by Sackville-West's frequent absences. Sackville-West inspired Woolf to write one of her most famous novels, ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'', featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries.

Nicolson provided the architectural structure, with strong classical lines, which would frame his wife's innovative informal planting schemes. She created a new and experimental system of enclosures or rooms, such as the White Garden, Rose Garden, Orchard, Cottage Garden and Nuttery. She also innovated single colour-themed gardens and design principles orientating the visitors' experience to discovery and exploration. Her first garden at [[Long Barn]] (Kent, 1915\u20131930) was experimental, a place of learning by trial and error and she carried over her ideas and projects to Sissinghurst, utilising her hard won experience.<ref name=\"GBG\"/> Sissinghurst was first opened to the public in 1938.\n\n[[File:Sissinghurst_Gardens_1_(4907255329).jpg|thumb|Sissinghurst]]\nSackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break as she needed money to pay for Sissinghurst.

In it she sought to explain both why she had chosen to stay with Nicolson and why she had fallen in love with Violet Keppel. The work, titled ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', was not published until 1973.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> In the book she uses metaphors from nature to present her account as truthful and honest, describing her life as a \"bog\" and a \"swamp\", suggesting that her personal life was naturally unappealing and unpleasant.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Sackville-West stated that she wanted to explain her sexuality, which she presented as being at the core of her personality. She wrote that in the future \"it will be recognized that many more people of my type do exist than under the present-day system of hypocrisy is commonly admitted\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|128}}\n\nReflecting a certain ambivalence about her sexuality, Sackville-West presented her sexual desires for Keppel as both \"deviant\" and \"natural\", as if she herself was uncertain of whether her sexuality was normal or not, though the American scholar Georgia Johnston has argued that Sackville-West's confusion on this point was due to her wish to have this memoir published one day.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> In this regard, Sackville-West wrote of her deep desire and love for Keppel while at same time declaring her \"shame\" about this \"duality with which I was too weak and too self-indulgent to struggle\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> At various times, Sackville-West called herself a \"pariah\" with a \"perverted nature\" and \"unnatural\" feelings for Keppel, who was portrayed as a tempting, if degrading, object of her desire.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Sackville-West called for a \"spirit of candor\" in society that would allow for tolerance of gay and bisexual people.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Much influenced by the theories promoted by sexologists like [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], [[Havelock Ellis]] and [[Sigmund Freud]], Sackville-West sometimes wrote of her sexuality as abnormal and wrong and due to some psychological flaw she was born with, portraying heterosexuality as the norm that she wanted, but failed to live up to.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>\n\nSeveral times, Sackville-West stated that she wrote ''Portrait of a Marriage'' for scientific purposes so people would be able to understand bisexual people, which would thus allow her, despite her self-condemnation, to present her sexuality as in some way normal.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Several of the sexologists Sackville-West cited, most notably Carpenter and Ellis, had argued that homosexuality and bisexuality were in fact normal, and despite her condemning herself, her use of a \"scientific\" approach backed up with quotes from Ellis and Carpenter allowed her to present her bisexuality as implicitly normal.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|127\u2013128}} Writing in the third person, Sackville-West declared \"she regrets that the person Harold married wasn't entirely and wholly what he had thought of her, and that the person who loves and owns Violet isn't a second person, because each suits each other\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|128\u2013129}} Sackville-West presented her sexuality as part of the personality she had been born with, portraying herself as an accursed woman who should be the object of sympathy, not condemnation.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>\n\nIn 1973, when her son Nigel Nicolson published ''Portrait of a Marriage'', he was uncertain if he was going to be charged with obscenity, going to considerable lengths to stress the legitimacy of a love for a person of the same sex in his introduction.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|130\u2013131}} Despite portraying herself as in some way \"deviant\" because of her feelings for women, Sackville-West also wrote in ''Portrait of a Marriage'' of the discovery and acceptance of her bisexuality as a teenager as the joyous \"liberation of half my personality\", suggesting that she did not really see herself as a woman with \"deviant\" sexuality, as this statement contradicted what she had written at the beginning of the book about her \"perverted\" sexuality.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|131}} Johnson wrote that Sackville-West, in presenting the lesbian side of herself in terms that depicted Keppel as evil and Nicolson as good, was the only way possible at the time to express this side of her personality, writing \"even if annihilating herself seemed the only way she could present any type of acceptable self.\"<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|131}}\n\nThe memoir was [[Portrait of a Marriage (TV series)|dramatised by the BBC]] (and [[PBS]] in North America) in 1990, starring [[Janet McTeer]] as Vita, and [[Cathryn Harrison]] as Violet. The series won four [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTAs]].<ref>[https://variety.com/1992/tv/reviews/masterpiece-theatre-portrait-of-a-marriage-parts-i-iii-1200430292/ \"Masterpiece Theatre Portrait of a Marriage Parts I-III\"], ''Variety'', 17 July 1992</ref>\n\n===''Challenge''===\nSackville-West's novel ''Challenge'' (1923) also bears witness to her affair with Keppel: Sackville-West and Keppel had started writing this book as a collaborative endeavour. It was published in America but banned in the UK until 1974.<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\">[http://spartacus-educational.com/Jsackville.htm Spartacus Educational] Biography</ref>\n\nThe male character's name, Julian, had been Sackville-West's nickname when passing as a man. ''Challenge'' (first entitled ''Rebellion'', then ''Enchantment'', then ''Vanity'' and at some point ''Foam''), is a ''roman \u00e0 clef'' with the character of Julian being a male version of Sackville-West and Eve, the woman he desires so passionately is Keppel.<ref>Sackville (2015) p5</ref><ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|133}} Notably, Sackville-West in ''Challenge'' defends Keppel against several of the insults Nicolson had applied to her in his letters to her; for example Nicolson often called Keppel a \"swine\" and a \"pig\", and in the book Julian goes out of his way to say that Eve is neither a swine nor a pig.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} In the book, Julian says that \"Eve is not a 'little swine', she just has the weaknesses and faults of femininity carried to the 9th degree, but is also redeemed by a self-sacrifice, which is very feminine\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nReflecting her obsession with the Romany people, Eve is portrayed as a seductive Romany woman with an \"insinuating femininity\" that Julian cannot resist, calling him away from his political mission of winning independence on a fictional Greek island during the Greek war of independence.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|153\u2013154}}  Nicolson wrote in a letter to his wife: \"Don't ''please'' dedicate it to Violet, it would kill me if you did\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} When ''Challenge'' was published in 1924, the dedication was written in Romany reading: \"This book is yours, honoured witch. If you read it, you will find your tormented soul changed and free\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} Throughout their relationship, Keppel was given to threatening suicide if Sackville-West left her, a character trait shared by Eve, who finally attempts to drown herself in the sea while Julian tries to come to her rescue.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} As Eve changes her mind about taking her life and tries to swim ashore as Julian swims out to her, it is too late and she is swept away by the tide to drown.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} The book's ending reflected Sackville-West's guilt about breaking her relationship with Keppel.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nHer mother, Lady Sackville, found the portrayal obvious enough to refuse to allow publication of the novel in England; but Vita's son [[Nigel Nicolson]] praises his mother: \"She fought for the right to love, men and women, rejecting the conventions that marriage demands exclusive love, and that women should love only men, and men only women. For this she was prepared to give up everything ... How could she regret that the knowledge of it should now reach the ears of a new generation, one so infinitely more compassionate than her own?\"\n\nSackville-West was fascinated with and often wrote about the [[Romani people|Roma]] people. As the British scholar Kirstie Blair noted, for her: \"Gypsies represent liberation, excitement, danger and the free expression of sexuality\".<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|141}} In particular, the Roma women, especially Spanish Romany women, served as a symbol for lesbianism in her writings.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|141\u2013142}} As with many other women writers in this period, for Sackville-West, the Romany represented a social element both familiar and strange; a people perceived and admired as flamboyant romantics while at the same time viewed and hated as shifty, dishonest types; a rootless people who belonged nowhere yet could be found everywhere in Europe, serving as a symbol for a sort of unconventional femininity.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|142\u2013143}} The picture Sackville-West held of the Romany was much influenced by \"[[Orientalism]]\", as the Romany were believed to have originated from India. The idea of a people who belonged nowhere, existing outside of the values of \"civilization\", held genuine appeal to her as it offered up the possibility of gender roles different from those held in the West.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|144}}  Sackville-West was English, but she invented Romany ancestry for herself on the Spanish side of her family, explaining her bohemian behavior as due to her alleged \"Gypsy\" descent.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|142}}\n\n===''Orlando''===\nWoolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write her most famous novel, ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'' (1928), featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. {{efn|Woolf documented the moment of the conception of ''Orlando'': she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: \"And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other\" (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband [[Leonard Woolf]]).}} {{efn| Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write ''Orlando'', asking in a letter: \"But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and its all about you and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind ... Do you mind, say Yes or No?\"<ref name=\"smith-2006\"/>{{rp|59}} }} Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|157}}  Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|158}}  ''Orlando'', which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|206}} Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|206}} {{efn|After finishing ''Orlando'', Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: \"For Promiscuous you are and that is all to be said about it. Look in the Index of ''Orlando''-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity ''passim''\".<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|213}} In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: \"Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting ... I'm not so sure ... I'm a fair-minded woman. You only be careful with your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks\".<ref name=\"smith-2006\"/>{{rp|66}} }}\n\n===''Family History''===\nSackville-West's 1932 novel ''Family History'' tells the story of Evelyn Jarrold, a rich widow who married into a family which owes its recent wealth and social position to the ownership of coal mines, and her ill-fated love affair with Miles Vane-Merrick, a much younger man with progressive social ideas. Evelyn Jarrold's husband, Tommy, died in the Great War, and she has nothing to occupy her apart from her son Dan, the Jarrolds' heir, who is away at Eton, social events and visits to her dressmaker. Vane-Merrick is a farming landowner and Member of Parliament, and is writing a book on economics. He represents new, progressive values and the male world of work and economic activity, and Evelyn Jarrold represents traditional values and the female world of family ties and social engagements.\n\nThe characters of Viola and Leonard Anquetil in ''Family History'' are socialists, pacifists and feminists, thinly veiled versions of Virginia and Leonard Woolf.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}} In ''Orlando'', Woolf allowed Vita to finally \"own\" Knole, and in ''Family History'', Vita returns the gesture, as the Anquetils have children who turned out to be intelligent and decent people.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}} Woolf had never had children and was afraid that she would have been a bad mother. In casting her fictional alter-ego as an excellent mother she was offering a \"gift\" to Woolf.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n===Other work and achievements===\nMost of the novels were an immediate success (except ''Dark Island'', ''Grand Canyon'' and ''La Grande Mademoiselle''). ''All Passion Spent'' (1931) and ''Seducers in Ecuador'' (1924) sold especially well. Somewhat Ironically ''Seducers'' overtook [[Virginia Woolf|her mentor's]] novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' at the top of the sales charts.<ref>Sackville-West (2015) p13</ref>\n\n''[[The Edwardians]]'' (1930) and ''[[All Passion Spent]]'' are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long suppressed sense of freedom and whimsy after a lifetime of following convention. This novel was dramatised by the [[BBC]] in 1986 starring Dame [[Wendy Hiller]]. ''All Passion Spent'' appears to reflect Woolf's influence. The character of Lady Slane begins to truly live only after the death of her husband, a former prime minister. She befriends the servants of her estate, discovering the lives of people she had previously ignored.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|211}} At the end of the novel Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage in order to pursue her career as a musician.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|211}}\n\n''Grand Canyon'' (1942) is a science fiction \"cautionary tale\" (as she termed it) about a Nazi invasion of an unprepared United States. The book takes an unsuspected twist, however, that makes it something more than a typical [[invasion literature|invasion yarn]].<ref>[https://www.panmacmillan.com/blogs/science-fiction-and-fantasy/dystopia-and-the-afterlife Pan Macmillan], ''Grand Canyon''</ref>\n\nThe poetry remains the least known of Sackville-West's work. It encompassed epics and translations of volumes such as [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]]'s ''[[Duino Elegies]]''. Her epic poems ''The Land'' (1926) and ''The Garden'' (1946) reflect an enduring passion for the earth and family tradition.''The Land'' may have been written in response to the central work of Modernist poetry ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (also published by Hogarth Press). She dedicated her poem to her lover [[Dorothy Wellesley]]. A recording of Sackville-West reading it was released by [[Columbia Records]].<ref>''Catalogue of Columbia Records, Up to and including Supplement no. 252'' (Columbia Graphophone Company, London September 1933), p. 375.

D 40192/3).</ref>\n<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\"/><ref>Sackville-West (2015) pp13-14</ref> Her poem won the [[Hawthornden Prize]] in 1927. She won it again in 1933 with her ''Collected Poems'', becoming the only writer to do so twice.<ref name=\"National Trust\"/> ''The Garden'' won the [[Heinemann Award]] for literature.<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\"/>\n\nHer epic poem ''Solitude'', published by the [[Hogarth Press]] in October 1938 contains references to the Bible, [[Paracelsus]], [[Ixion]], [[Catullus]], [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], the ''[[Iliad]]'' and a [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|Sabine bride]], all of which were quite acceptable in the early 20th century, but were seen as anachronistic by 1938.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|409}} The narrator of ''Solitude'' has an ardent love of the English countryside. Though the sex of the narrator is left ambiguous, implied at various points to be a man or a woman, it is made clear the narrator loved intensely a woman who is no longer present and who is deeply missed.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|409}} At one point, the narrator's horror and disgust at Ixion, a brutal rapist, implies that she is a woman. At another point in the poem, her desire to free Andromeda from her chains and to make love suggests that she is a lesbian.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|412\u2013413}} The narrator compares the love of nature to the love of books, as both cultivate her mind. She thinks of herself as superior to the farmers who merely work the land without the time or the interest for poetry, all of which make it possible for her to have a deeper appreciation of nature.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|414}}\n\nShe is not well known as a biographer. The most famous of those works is her biography of [[Saint Joan of Arc]] in the work of the same name. Additionally, she composed a dual biography of [[Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila]] and [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux]] entitled ''The Eagle and the Dove,'' a biography of the author [[Aphra Behn]], and a biography of her maternal grandmother, the Spanish dancer known as ''Pepita''.\n\nDespite being a shy woman, Sackville-West often forced herself to participate in literary readings before book clubs and on the BBC in order to feel a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\">{{cite journal | last1=Nagel | first1=Rebecca | date=September 2008 | title=The Classical Tradition in Vita Sackville-West's ''Solitude | jstor=25691245 | journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=407\u2013427 | doi=10.1007/s12138-009-0048-z}}</ref>{{rp|408}} Her love of the classical traditions in literature put her out of favour with modernist critics and by the 1940s, she was often dismissed as a dated writer, much to her chagrin.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/> In 1947 Sackville-West was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] and [[Companion of Honour]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The London Gazette Issue 38161 published on the 30 December 1947.

She published more than a dozen collections of poetry during her lifetime and 13 novels. She was twice awarded the [[Hawthornden Prize|Hawthornden Prize for Imaginative Literature]]: in 1927 for her pastoral epic, ''The Land'', and in 1933 for her ''Collected Poems''. She was the inspiration for the androgynous protagonist of ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'', by her famous friend and lover, [[Virginia Woolf]].\n \nShe had a longstanding column in ''[[The Observer]]'' (1946\u20131961) and is remembered for the celebrated garden at [[Sissinghurst Castle Garden|Sissinghurst]] created with her husband, Sir [[Harold Nicolson]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Antecedents===\n[[File:Victoria Josepha Sackville-West.jpg|thumb|right|[[Victoria Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville|Victoria Josefa Dolores Catalina Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville]].

She didn't befriend local children and found it hard to make friends at school. Her biographers characterise her childhood as one filled by loneliness and isolation. She wrote prolifically at Knole, penning eight full-length (unpublished) novels between 1906\u20131910, ballads, and many plays, some in French. Her lack of formal education led to later shyness with her peers, such as those in the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. She felt herself to be sluggish of mind and she was never at the intellectual heart of her social group.<ref>Sackville-West (2015) pXiii</ref><ref>Sackville-West (2015) pp1-2</ref><ref>Rose, Norman,''Harold Nicolson'' Random House, 2014, pxxx</ref>\n[[File:Vita in childhood.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Vita in Childhood]]\n\nVita's apparently Roma lineage introduced a passion for 'gypsy' ways, a culture she perceived to be hot-blooded, heart-led, dark and romantic. It informed the stormy nature of many of Vita's later love affairs and was a strong theme in her writing. She visited Roma camps and felt herself to be at one with them.<ref name=\"Sackville-West 2015 p2\"/>\n\nVita's mother had a wide array of famous lovers, including financier [[J. P. Morgan]] and Sir John Murray Scott (from 1897 until his death in 1912). Scott, secretary to the couple who inherited and developed the [[Wallace Collection]], was a devoted companion and Lady Sackville and he were rarely apart during their years together. During her childhood, Vita spent a great deal of time in Scott's apartments in Paris, perfecting her already fluent French.<ref name=\"Sackville-West 2015 p2\"/>\n\n===First loves===\nVita [[Debutante#United Kingdom|debuted]] in 1910, shortly after the death of King [[Edward VII]].

After the wedding the couple lived in [[Cihangir]], a suburb of [[Constantinople]] (now Istanbul), the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Sackville-West loved Constantinople, but the duties of a diplomat's wife did not appeal to her.

Vita often dressed as a man, styled as Keppel's husband.  The two women made a bond to remain faithful to one another, pledging that neither would engage in sexual relations with their husband. {{efn|In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Keppel, Sackville-West wrote: I never ought to have married you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you for as long as you wanted me ...

These trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel ''To the Lighthouse'', noteworthy for its theme of longing for someone absent, was partly inspired by Sackville-West's frequent absences. Sackville-West inspired Woolf to write one of her most famous novels, ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'', featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries.

Nicolson provided the architectural structure, with strong classical lines, which would frame his wife's innovative informal planting schemes. She created a new and experimental system of enclosures or rooms, such as the White Garden, Rose Garden, Orchard, Cottage Garden and Nuttery. She also innovated single colour-themed gardens and design principles orientating the visitors' experience to discovery and exploration. Her first garden at [[Long Barn]] (Kent, 1915\u20131930) was experimental, a place of learning by trial and error and she carried over her ideas and projects to Sissinghurst, utilising her hard won experience.<ref name=\"GBG\"/> Sissinghurst was first opened to the public in 1938.\n\n[[File:Sissinghurst_Gardens_1_(4907255329).jpg|thumb|Sissinghurst]]\nSackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break as she needed money to pay for Sissinghurst.

In it she sought to explain both why she had chosen to stay with Nicolson and why she had fallen in love with Violet Keppel. The work, titled ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', was not published until 1973.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> In the book she uses metaphors from nature to present her account as truthful and honest, describing her life as a \"bog\" and a \"swamp\", suggesting that her personal life was naturally unappealing and unpleasant.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Sackville-West stated that she wanted to explain her sexuality, which she presented as being at the core of her personality. She wrote that in the future \"it will be recognized that many more people of my type do exist than under the present-day system of hypocrisy is commonly admitted\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|128}}\n\nReflecting a certain ambivalence about her sexuality, Sackville-West presented her sexual desires for Keppel as both \"deviant\" and \"natural\", as if she herself was uncertain of whether her sexuality was normal or not, though the American scholar Georgia Johnston has argued that Sackville-West's confusion on this point was due to her wish to have this memoir published one day.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> In this regard, Sackville-West wrote of her deep desire and love for Keppel while at same time declaring her \"shame\" about this \"duality with which I was too weak and too self-indulgent to struggle\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> At various times, Sackville-West called herself a \"pariah\" with a \"perverted nature\" and \"unnatural\" feelings for Keppel, who was portrayed as a tempting, if degrading, object of her desire.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Sackville-West called for a \"spirit of candor\" in society that would allow for tolerance of gay and bisexual people.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Much influenced by the theories promoted by sexologists like [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], [[Havelock Ellis]] and [[Sigmund Freud]], Sackville-West sometimes wrote of her sexuality as abnormal and wrong and due to some psychological flaw she was born with, portraying heterosexuality as the norm that she wanted, but failed to live up to.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>\n\nSeveral times, Sackville-West stated that she wrote ''Portrait of a Marriage'' for scientific purposes so people would be able to understand bisexual people, which would thus allow her, despite her self-condemnation, to present her sexuality as in some way normal.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Several of the sexologists Sackville-West cited, most notably Carpenter and Ellis, had argued that homosexuality and bisexuality were in fact normal, and despite her condemning herself, her use of a \"scientific\" approach backed up with quotes from Ellis and Carpenter allowed her to present her bisexuality as implicitly normal.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|127\u2013128}} Writing in the third person, Sackville-West declared \"she regrets that the person Harold married wasn't entirely and wholly what he had thought of her, and that the person who loves and owns Violet isn't a second person, because each suits each other\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|128\u2013129}} Sackville-West presented her sexuality as part of the personality she had been born with, portraying herself as an accursed woman who should be the object of sympathy, not condemnation.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>\n\nIn 1973, when her son Nigel Nicolson published ''Portrait of a Marriage'', he was uncertain if he was going to be charged with obscenity, going to considerable lengths to stress the legitimacy of a love for a person of the same sex in his introduction.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|130\u2013131}} Despite portraying herself as in some way \"deviant\" because of her feelings for women, Sackville-West also wrote in ''Portrait of a Marriage'' of the discovery and acceptance of her bisexuality as a teenager as the joyous \"liberation of half my personality\", suggesting that she did not really see herself as a woman with \"deviant\" sexuality, as this statement contradicted what she had written at the beginning of the book about her \"perverted\" sexuality.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|131}} Johnson wrote that Sackville-West, in presenting the lesbian side of herself in terms that depicted Keppel as evil and Nicolson as good, was the only way possible at the time to express this side of her personality, writing \"even if annihilating herself seemed the only way she could present any type of acceptable self.\"<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|131}}\n\nThe memoir was [[Portrait of a Marriage (TV series)|dramatised by the BBC]] (and [[PBS]] in North America) in 1990, starring [[Janet McTeer]] as Vita, and [[Cathryn Harrison]] as Violet.

It was published in America but banned in the UK until 1974.<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\">[http://spartacus-educational.com/Jsackville.htm Spartacus Educational] Biography</ref>\n\nThe male character's name, Julian, had been Sackville-West's nickname when passing as a man. ''Challenge'' (first entitled ''Rebellion'', then ''Enchantment'', then ''Vanity'' and at some point ''Foam''), is a ''roman \u00e0 clef'' with the character of Julian being a male version of Sackville-West and Eve, the woman he desires so passionately is Keppel.<ref>Sackville (2015) p5</ref><ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|133}} Notably, Sackville-West in ''Challenge'' defends Keppel against several of the insults Nicolson had applied to her in his letters to her; for example Nicolson often called Keppel a \"swine\" and a \"pig\", and in the book Julian goes out of his way to say that Eve is neither a swine nor a pig.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} In the book, Julian says that \"Eve is not a 'little swine', she just has the weaknesses and faults of femininity carried to the 9th degree, but is also redeemed by a self-sacrifice, which is very feminine\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nReflecting her obsession with the Romany people, Eve is portrayed as a seductive Romany woman with an \"insinuating femininity\" that Julian cannot resist, calling him away from his political mission of winning independence on a fictional Greek island during the Greek war of independence.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|153\u2013154}}  Nicolson wrote in a letter to his wife: \"Don't ''please'' dedicate it to Violet, it would kill me if you did\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} When ''Challenge'' was published in 1924, the dedication was written in Romany reading: \"This book is yours, honoured witch. If you read it, you will find your tormented soul changed and free\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} Throughout their relationship, Keppel was given to threatening suicide if Sackville-West left her, a character trait shared by Eve, who finally attempts to drown herself in the sea while Julian tries to come to her rescue.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} As Eve changes her mind about taking her life and tries to swim ashore as Julian swims out to her, it is too late and she is swept away by the tide to drown.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} The book's ending reflected Sackville-West's guilt about breaking her relationship with Keppel.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nHer mother, Lady Sackville, found the portrayal obvious enough to refuse to allow publication of the novel in England; but Vita's son [[Nigel Nicolson]] praises his mother: \"She fought for the right to love, men and women, rejecting the conventions that marriage demands exclusive love, and that women should love only men, and men only women. For this she was prepared to give up everything ... How could she regret that the knowledge of it should now reach the ears of a new generation, one so infinitely more compassionate than her own?\"\n\nSackville-West was fascinated with and often wrote about the [[Romani people|Roma]] people. As the British scholar Kirstie Blair noted, for her: \"Gypsies represent liberation, excitement, danger and the free expression of sexuality\".<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|141}} In particular, the Roma women, especially Spanish Romany women, served as a symbol for lesbianism in her writings.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|141\u2013142}} As with many other women writers in this period, for Sackville-West, the Romany represented a social element both familiar and strange; a people perceived and admired as flamboyant romantics while at the same time viewed and hated as shifty, dishonest types; a rootless people who belonged nowhere yet could be found everywhere in Europe, serving as a symbol for a sort of unconventional femininity.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|142\u2013143}} The picture Sackville-West held of the Romany was much influenced by \"[[Orientalism]]\", as the Romany were believed to have originated from India. The idea of a people who belonged nowhere, existing outside of the values of \"civilization\", held genuine appeal to her as it offered up the possibility of gender roles different from those held in the West.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|144}}  Sackville-West was English, but she invented Romany ancestry for herself on the Spanish side of her family, explaining her bohemian behavior as due to her alleged \"Gypsy\" descent.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|142}}\n\n===''Orlando''===\nWoolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write her most famous novel, ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'' (1928), featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. {{efn|Woolf documented the moment of the conception of ''Orlando'': she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: \"And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other\" (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband [[Leonard Woolf]]).}} {{efn| Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write ''Orlando'', asking in a letter: \"But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and its all about you and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind ... Do you mind, say Yes or No?\"<ref name=\"smith-2006\"/>{{rp|59}} }} Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|157}}  Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|158}}  ''Orlando'', which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|206}} Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|206}} {{efn|After finishing ''Orlando'', Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: \"For Promiscuous you are and that is all to be said about it. Look in the Index of ''Orlando''-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity ''passim''\".<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|213}} In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: \"Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting ... I'm not so sure ... I'm a fair-minded woman. You only be careful with your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks\".<ref name=\"smith-2006\"/>{{rp|66}} }}\n\n===''Family History''===\nSackville-West's 1932 novel ''Family History'' tells the story of Evelyn Jarrold, a rich widow who married into a family which owes its recent wealth and social position to the ownership of coal mines, and her ill-fated love affair with Miles Vane-Merrick, a much younger man with progressive social ideas. Evelyn Jarrold's husband, Tommy, died in the Great War, and she has nothing to occupy her apart from her son Dan, the Jarrolds' heir, who is away at Eton, social events and visits to her dressmaker. Vane-Merrick is a farming landowner and Member of Parliament, and is writing a book on economics. He represents new, progressive values and the male world of work and economic activity, and Evelyn Jarrold represents traditional values and the female world of family ties and social engagements.\n\nThe characters of Viola and Leonard Anquetil in ''Family History'' are socialists, pacifists and feminists, thinly veiled versions of Virginia and Leonard Woolf.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}} In ''Orlando'', Woolf allowed Vita to finally \"own\" Knole, and in ''Family History'', Vita returns the gesture, as the Anquetils have children who turned out to be intelligent and decent people.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}} Woolf had never had children and was afraid that she would have been a bad mother. In casting her fictional alter-ego as an excellent mother she was offering a \"gift\" to Woolf.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n===Other work and achievements===\nMost of the novels were an immediate success (except ''Dark Island'', ''Grand Canyon'' and ''La Grande Mademoiselle''). ''All Passion Spent'' (1931) and ''Seducers in Ecuador'' (1924) sold especially well. Somewhat Ironically ''Seducers'' overtook [[Virginia Woolf|her mentor's]] novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' at the top of the sales charts.<ref>Sackville-West (2015) p13</ref>\n\n''[[The Edwardians]]'' (1930) and ''[[All Passion Spent]]'' are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long suppressed sense of freedom and whimsy after a lifetime of following convention. This novel was dramatised by the [[BBC]] in 1986 starring Dame [[Wendy Hiller]]. ''All Passion Spent'' appears to reflect Woolf's influence. The character of Lady Slane begins to truly live only after the death of her husband, a former prime minister. She befriends the servants of her estate, discovering the lives of people she had previously ignored.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|211}} At the end of the novel Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage in order to pursue her career as a musician.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|211}}\n\n''Grand Canyon'' (1942) is a science fiction \"cautionary tale\" (as she termed it) about a Nazi invasion of an unprepared United States. The book takes an unsuspected twist, however, that makes it something more than a typical [[invasion literature|invasion yarn]].<ref>[https://www.panmacmillan.com/blogs/science-fiction-and-fantasy/dystopia-and-the-afterlife Pan Macmillan], ''Grand Canyon''</ref>\n\nThe poetry remains the least known of Sackville-West's work. It encompassed epics and translations of volumes such as [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]]'s ''[[Duino Elegies]]''. Her epic poems ''The Land'' (1926) and ''The Garden'' (1946) reflect an enduring passion for the earth and family tradition.''The Land'' may have been written in response to the central work of Modernist poetry ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (also published by Hogarth Press). She dedicated her poem to her lover [[Dorothy Wellesley]]. A recording of Sackville-West reading it was released by [[Columbia Records]].<ref>''Catalogue of Columbia Records, Up to and including Supplement no. 252'' (Columbia Graphophone Company, London September 1933), p. 375. This was on four 78rpm sides in the [[Columbia Records]] 'International Educational Society' Lecture series, Lecture 98 (Cat. no. D 40192/3).</ref>\n<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\"/><ref>Sackville-West (2015) pp13-14</ref> Her poem won the [[Hawthornden Prize]] in 1927. She won it again in 1933 with her ''Collected Poems'', becoming the only writer to do so twice.<ref name=\"National Trust\"/> ''The Garden'' won the [[Heinemann Award]] for literature.<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\"/>\n\nHer epic poem ''Solitude'', published by the [[Hogarth Press]] in October 1938 contains references to the Bible, [[Paracelsus]], [[Ixion]], [[Catullus]], [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], the ''[[Iliad]]'' and a [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|Sabine bride]], all of which were quite acceptable in the early 20th century, but were seen as anachronistic by 1938.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|409}} The narrator of ''Solitude'' has an ardent love of the English countryside. Though the sex of the narrator is left ambiguous, implied at various points to be a man or a woman, it is made clear the narrator loved intensely a woman who is no longer present and who is deeply missed.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|409}} At one point, the narrator's horror and disgust at Ixion, a brutal rapist, implies that she is a woman. At another point in the poem, her desire to free Andromeda from her chains and to make love suggests that she is a lesbian.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|412\u2013413}} The narrator compares the love of nature to the love of books, as both cultivate her mind. She thinks of herself as superior to the farmers who merely work the land without the time or the interest for poetry, all of which make it possible for her to have a deeper appreciation of nature.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|414}}\n\nShe is not well known as a biographer. The most famous of those works is her biography of [[Saint Joan of Arc]] in the work of the same name. Additionally, she composed a dual biography of [[Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila]] and [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux]] entitled ''The Eagle and the Dove,'' a biography of the author [[Aphra Behn]], and a biography of her maternal grandmother, the Spanish dancer known as ''Pepita''.\n\nDespite being a shy woman, Sackville-West often forced herself to participate in literary readings before book clubs and on the BBC in order to feel a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\">{{cite journal | last1=Nagel | first1=Rebecca | date=September 2008 | title=The Classical Tradition in Vita Sackville-West's ''Solitude | jstor=25691245 | journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=407\u2013427 | doi=10.1007/s12138-009-0048-z}}</ref>{{rp|408}} Her love of the classical traditions in literature put her out of favour with modernist critics and by the 1940s, she was often dismissed as a dated writer, much to her chagrin.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/> In 1947 Sackville-West was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] and [[Companion of Honour]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The London Gazette Issue 38161 published on the 30 December 1947.
