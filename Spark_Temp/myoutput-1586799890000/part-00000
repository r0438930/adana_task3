The skeletons of ''Mussaurus'' infants were small, only six inches long excluding the tail, but a total of {{convert|20|to|37|cm|in}} long. This is about the size of a small lizard. Juveniles differed from adults in proportion in addition to size and mass. As is common for dinosaurs, juvenile ''Mussaurus'' had tall skulls with short snouts and large eyes.<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursmussaurus\"/>\n\nThese proportions are common in many infant vertebrates and are often associated with species that provide parental care during the vulnerable early stages of life. Adults are expected to have longer snouts and necks, as typical in early [[sauropodomorph]]s.\n\n===Locomotion===\nA study published in May 2019 shows that while ''M. patagonicus'' probably walked on all four limbs (was [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]]) during the first year of its life, changes in the relative proportions of its body during growth ([[ontogeny]]) caused its [[centre of mass]] to move backwards towards its [[pelvis]], resulting in the animal adopting a two-legged ([[bipedalism|bipedal]]) stance later in life.<ref name=\"Otero Cuff Allen Sumner-Rooney 2019-5-20\"/><ref name=\"Geggel 2019\">{{cite web |last=Geggel |first=Laura |title=No, That Baby Dinosaur Didn't Crawl.

Furthermore, the recently discovered one subadult and three adult specimens assigned to ''Mussaurus'' are more complete than other material assigned to it. Therefore, a cladistic analysis of basal sauropodomorphs performed by Otero and Pol (2013) to test the phylogenetic relationships of ''Mussaurus'', included information only from adult specimens. The following [[cladogram]] is simplified after their analysis (relationships outside Plateosauria are not shown).<ref name=OP13/>\n\n{{clade| style=font-size:85%;line-height:85%\n|label1=&nbsp;[[Plateosauria]]&nbsp; \n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Ruehleia]]''\n   |label2=&nbsp;[[Plateosauridae]]&nbsp;\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=''[[Unaysaurus]]''\n      |2=''[[Plateosaurus engelhardti]]''\n      |3=''[[Plateosaurus gracilis]]''\n      |4=''[[Plateosaurus ingens]]''}}\n   |label3=&nbsp;[[Massopoda]]&nbsp;\n   |3={{clade\n      |label1=&nbsp;[[Riojasauridae]]&nbsp;\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Eucnemesaurus]]''\n         |2=''[[Riojasaurus]]'' }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=''[[Ignavusaurus]]''\n            |2=''[[Sarahsaurus]]'' }}\n         |2={{clade\n            |label1=&nbsp;[[Massospondylidae]]&nbsp;\n            |1={{clade\n               |1={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Coloradisaurus]]''\n                  |2=''[[Glacialisaurus]]''\n                  |3=''[[Lufengosaurus]]'' }}\n               |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Massospondylus]]''\n                  |2={{clade\n                     |1=''[[Adeopapposaurus]]''\n                     |2=''[[Leyesaurus]]'' }} }} }}\n            |label2=&nbsp;[[Sauropodiformes]]&nbsp;\n            |2={{clade\n               |1=''[[Jingshanosaurus]]''\n               |label2=&nbsp;[[Anchisauria]]&nbsp;\n               |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Anchisaurus]]''\n                  |2=''[[Seitaad]]''\n                  |3=''[[Yunnanosaurus]]''\n                  |4={{clade\n                     |1='''''Mussaurus'''''\n                     |2={{clade\n                        |1=''[[Aardonyx]]''\n                        |2={{clade\n                           |1=''[[Leonerasaurus]]''\n                           |2={{clade\n                              |label1=&nbsp;[[Melanorosauridae]]&nbsp;\n                              |1={{clade\n                                 |1=''[[Camelotia]]''\n                                 |2=''[[Melanorosaurus]]''}}\n                              |label2=&nbsp;[[Sauropoda]]&nbsp;\n                              |2=SAUROPODA\n                              }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} \n\n|targetA=SAUROPODA\n|subcladeA={{clade\n                                 |1=''[[Blikanasaurus]]''\n                                 |2={{clade\n                                    |1={{clade\n                                       |1=''[[Antetonitrus]]''\n                                       |2=''[[Lessemsaurus]]''}}\n                                    |2={{clade\n                                       |1=''[[Gongxianosaurus]]''\n                                       |2={{clade\n                                          |1=''[[Isanosaurus]]''\n                                          |label2=&nbsp;[[Gravisauria]]&nbsp;\n                                          |2={{clade\n                                             |label1=&nbsp;[[Vulcanodontidae]]&nbsp;\n                                             |1={{clade\n                                                |1=''[[Tazoudasaurus]]''\n                                                |2=''[[Vulcanodon]]''}}\n                                             |label2=&nbsp;[[Eusauropoda]]&nbsp;\n                                             |2={{clade\n                                                |1={{clade\n                                                   |1=''[[Barapasaurus]]''\n                                                   |2=''[[Patagosaurus]]''}}\n                                                |2={{clade\n                                                   |1=''[[Shunosaurus]]''\n                                                   |2={{clade\n                                                      |1={{clade\n                                                         |1=''[[Omeisaurus]]''\n                                                         |2=''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''}}\n                                                      |2={{clade\n                                                         |1=''[[Cetiosaurus]]''\n                                                         |2=[[Neosauropoda]]\n}} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} \n}}\n\n==Palaeobiology==\n[[File:Mussaurus patagonicus.jpg|thumb|Life restoration of an infant eating a ''[[Dicroidium]]'' fern]]\n===Reproduction===\nMussaurus specimens have been found in association with nests that are believed to contain multiple eggs apiece. The skeletons of ''Mussaurus'' infants were small, only six inches long excluding the tail, but a total of {{convert|20|to|37|cm|in}} long. This is about the size of a small lizard. Juveniles differed from adults in proportion in addition to size and mass. As is common for dinosaurs, juvenile ''Mussaurus'' had tall skulls with short snouts and large eyes.<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursmussaurus\"/>\n\nThese proportions are common in many infant vertebrates and are often associated with species that provide parental care during the vulnerable early stages of life. Adults are expected to have longer snouts and necks, as typical in early [[sauropodomorph]]s.\n\n===Locomotion===\nA study published in May 2019 shows that while ''M. patagonicus'' probably walked on all four limbs (was [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]]) during the first year of its life, changes in the relative proportions of its body during growth ([[ontogeny]]) caused its [[centre of mass]] to move backwards towards its [[pelvis]], resulting in the animal adopting a two-legged ([[bipedalism|bipedal]]) stance later in life.<ref name=\"Otero Cuff Allen Sumner-Rooney 2019-5-20\"/><ref name=\"Geggel 2019\">{{cite web |last=Geggel |first=Laura |title=No, That Baby Dinosaur Didn't Crawl.
