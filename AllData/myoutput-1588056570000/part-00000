In 2002, when [[President of India|President]] [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] unveiled a portrait of Savarkar in the presence of [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], the Congress Party opposed the unveiling of the portrait and boycotted the function. Thackeray criticised the opposition and said \"Who is [Congress president and Leader of the Opposition] [[Sonia Gandhi]] to object to the portrait? What relation does she have with the country? How much does she know about the history and culture of India?\". Years later, when Congress General Secretary [[Digvijaya Singh]] made a statement that Savarkar was the first to suggest the two-nation theory that led to the partition, Thackeray defended Savarkar and accused Singh of distorting history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/thackeray-defends-savarkar-over-digvijays-statement/articleshow/7396685.cms|title=Thackeray defends Savarkar over Digvijay's statement|date=31 January 2011|publisher=|via=The Economic Times|access-date=25 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925142133/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/thackeray-defends-savarkar-over-digvijays-statement/articleshow/7396685.cms|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/2003/mar/05bal.htm|title=Savarkar was a great leader: Thackeray|website=www.rediff.com|access-date=24 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021170309/http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/mar/05bal.htm|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Support for Kashmiri Pandits ===\nIn 1990, the Islamic militant organisation [[Hizbul Mujahideen]], through the columns of an Urdu daily ''Aftab'', warned [[Kashmiri Pandits]] to leave the valley within 36 hours.

In 2002, when [[President of India|President]] [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] unveiled a portrait of Savarkar in the presence of [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], the Congress Party opposed the unveiling of the portrait and boycotted the function. Thackeray criticised the opposition and said \"Who is [Congress president and Leader of the Opposition] [[Sonia Gandhi]] to object to the portrait? What relation does she have with the country? How much does she know about the history and culture of India?\". Years later, when Congress General Secretary [[Digvijaya Singh]] made a statement that Savarkar was the first to suggest the two-nation theory that led to the partition, Thackeray defended Savarkar and accused Singh of distorting history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/thackeray-defends-savarkar-over-digvijays-statement/articleshow/7396685.cms|title=Thackeray defends Savarkar over Digvijay's statement|date=31 January 2011|publisher=|via=The Economic Times|access-date=25 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925142133/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/thackeray-defends-savarkar-over-digvijays-statement/articleshow/7396685.cms|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/2003/mar/05bal.htm|title=Savarkar was a great leader: Thackeray|website=www.rediff.com|access-date=24 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021170309/http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/mar/05bal.htm|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Support for Kashmiri Pandits ===\nIn 1990, the Islamic militant organisation [[Hizbul Mujahideen]], through the columns of an Urdu daily ''Aftab'', warned [[Kashmiri Pandits]] to leave the valley within 36 hours.
