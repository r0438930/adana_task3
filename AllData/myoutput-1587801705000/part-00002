It is the first in a planned series of games [[Video game remake|remaking]] the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]].''\n\nSet in the [[dystopian]] [[cyberpunk]] metropolis of [[Midgar]], players control mercenary [[Cloud Strife]] as he and an [[eco-terrorist]] group known as [[AVALANCHE]] oppose a powerful [[megacorporation]] known as Shinra from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time]] [[Action game|action]] with [[Strategy video game|strategic]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements.\n\n''Remake'' was announced in 2015 following years of speculation. Several key staff members returned, including character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as director and main character designer, director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] as producer, writer [[Kazushige Nojima]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\nThe game was generally well received for its graphics, gameplay, narrative, and faithfulness to the original. It has become one of the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 games.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'']]\n''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' is the first in a planned series of games [[Video game remake|remaking]] the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.

The game features an altered \"[[Active Time Battle]]\" (ATB) system from the original, which gradually fills up slowly, or can fill faster with attacks. Once it is filled, the player can halt the action and use special abilities such as magic, items, and special moves.

Shinra uses mako, the Planet's spiritual energy, harvested by massive reactors, to power the metropolis city of [[Midgar]] and develop cutting-edge technology. Disillusioned with Shinra, and at the request of his childhood friend [[Tifa Lockhart]], Cloud takes a mercenary job for Avalanche, an ecoterrorist organization, led by [[Barret Wallace]], who believes excessive mako harvesting will cause environmental disaster, which they attempt to prevent by bombing a mako reactor. In the aftermath, Cloud is haunted by memories of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], an enigmatic former SOLDIER member, and meets the florist [[Aerith Gainsborough]]. Although Cloud intends to leave Avalanche after receiving his pay, mysterious ghost-like entities, who often reappear at pivotal moments in the game, cause him to be recruited for another reactor bombing, which goes awry, separating him from the group.\n\nCloud meets Aerith again and protects her from Shinra forces, who pursue her for unknown reasons. While attempting to reunite with his party with Aerith's help, they see Tifa entering Wall Market, a lawless walled-in city, and, reuniting with her, learn that she is trying to gain information from Wall Market's crime lord Don Corneo. Corneo reveals that Shinra plans to collapse a piece of the \"plate,\" home to Midgar's upper class, onto the slums of Sector 7 to retaliate for Avalanche's destruction of the mako reactors. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret fail to stop Shinra's plan, and the plate falls. Thanks to Aerith, most of the population is able to evacuate in time, but she is captured by Shinra.\n\nWhile clearing the rubble left by the plate's fall, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret discover an underground Shinra research lab. Horrified by the experiments they find inside, they infiltrate Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith before she suffers the same fate. She reveals that she is the last descendant of the Cetra, a near-extinct precursor race who resided in a \"Promised Land\", which Shinra covets due to its boundless mako reserves. The group also meets a talking wolf-like creature called Red XIII, who explains that the strange ghost-like entities the group has encountered are called Whispers. They exist to ensure that the course of destiny (implied to be the events of the original game) is not altered, by correcting any deviations from this course. Meanwhile, Sephiroth infiltrates Shinra and steals a mysterious entity known as \"Jenova\", somehow connected to the extinction of the Cetra.\n\nIn a confrontation at the top of Shinra headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra and also impales Barret, although the Whispers save him, while the party fights a hallucinatory apparition of Jenova. With the death of President Shinra, his son Rufus assumes control of the company and briefly fights Cloud, but is defeated. Cloud and his allies flee the scene via the Midgar Expressway, but find Sephiroth waiting for them at the end. Sephiroth cryptically challenges Cloud, opening a portal to another dimension. Aerith somehow alters the portal, stating that they will change destiny if they continue. The group enters the portal and battles the Whisper Harbinger, an entity formed by an amalgamate of Whispers. While this happens, in what appears to be an alternate timeline also engulfed by Whispers, SOLDIER [[Zack Fair]] fights an army of Shinra troops determined to kill him and Cloud.\n\nAfter the Whisper Harbinger is defeated, Sephiroth confronts the group, seemingly seizing the remnants of the Whisper's power. Together, the party overwhelms him, but as Cloud seems poised to finish him, Sephiroth transports the both of them to a metaphysical realm he calls the Edge of Creation. Sephiroth urges Cloud to join him, and defy fate together. Cloud refuses and fights Sephiroth, but is no match for him alone and is defeated, although Sephiroth spares him before departing, cryptically stating that he will have seven seconds to defy fate. \n\nMeanwhile, in the alternate timeline, Zack Fair triumphs over the Shinra forces. After Cloud returns to his group, they agree that Sephiroth is a greater threat to the Planet than Shinra, and commit to pursuing him. However, as the group departs Midgar, Aerith expresses concern over their now uncertain future.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> \n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'s}} action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system draws from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game is fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nRather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314083618/https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|archive-date=March 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with the lighting engine Enlighten.<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202132615/https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |archive-date=February 2, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" /> The theme song \"Hollow\" is meant to reflect Cloud's state of mind with Nomura placing high emphasis on the rock music and male vocals.

Shinra uses mako, the Planet's spiritual energy, harvested by massive reactors, to power the metropolis city of [[Midgar]] and develop cutting-edge technology. Disillusioned with Shinra, and at the request of his childhood friend [[Tifa Lockhart]], Cloud takes a mercenary job for Avalanche, an ecoterrorist organization, led by [[Barret Wallace]], who believes excessive mako harvesting will cause environmental disaster, which they attempt to prevent by bombing a mako reactor. In the aftermath, Cloud is haunted by memories of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], an enigmatic former SOLDIER member, and meets the florist [[Aerith Gainsborough]]. Although Cloud intends to leave Avalanche after receiving his pay, mysterious ghost-like entities, who often reappear at pivotal moments in the game, cause him to be recruited for another reactor bombing, which goes awry, separating him from the group.\n\nCloud meets Aerith again and protects her from Shinra forces, who pursue her for unknown reasons. While attempting to reunite with his party with Aerith's help, they see Tifa entering Wall Market, a lawless walled-in city, and, reuniting with her, learn that she is trying to gain information from Wall Market's crime lord Don Corneo. Corneo reveals that Shinra plans to collapse a piece of the \"plate,\" home to Midgar's upper class, onto the slums of Sector 7 to retaliate for Avalanche's destruction of the mako reactors. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret fail to stop Shinra's plan, and the plate falls. Thanks to Aerith, most of the population is able to evacuate in time, but she is captured by Shinra.\n\nWhile clearing the rubble left by the plate's fall, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret discover an underground Shinra research lab. Horrified by the experiments they find inside, they infiltrate Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith before she suffers the same fate. She reveals that she is the last descendant of the Cetra, a near-extinct precursor race who resided in a \"Promised Land\", which Shinra covets due to its boundless mako reserves. The group also meets a talking wolf-like creature called Red XIII, who explains that the strange ghost-like entities the group has encountered are called Whispers. They exist to ensure that the course of destiny (implied to be the events of the original game) is not altered, by correcting any deviations from this course. Meanwhile, Sephiroth infiltrates Shinra and steals a mysterious entity known as \"Jenova\", somehow connected to the extinction of the Cetra.\n\nIn a confrontation at the top of Shinra headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra and also impales Barret, although the Whispers save him, while the party fights a hallucinatory apparition of Jenova. With the death of President Shinra, his son Rufus assumes control of the company and briefly fights Cloud, but is defeated. Cloud and his allies flee the scene via the Midgar Expressway, but find Sephiroth waiting for them at the end. Sephiroth cryptically challenges Cloud, opening a portal to another dimension. Aerith somehow alters the portal, stating that they will change destiny if they continue. The group enters the portal and battles the Whisper Harbinger, an entity formed by an amalgamate of Whispers. While this happens, in what appears to be an alternate timeline also engulfed by Whispers, SOLDIER [[Zack Fair]] fights an army of Shinra troops determined to kill him and Cloud.\n\nAfter the Whisper Harbinger is defeated, Sephiroth confronts the group, seemingly seizing the remnants of the Whisper's power. Together, the party overwhelms him, but as Cloud seems poised to finish him, Sephiroth transports the both of them to a metaphysical realm he calls the Edge of Creation. Sephiroth urges Cloud to join him, and defy fate together. Cloud refuses and fights Sephiroth, but is no match for him alone and is defeated, although Sephiroth spares him before departing, cryptically stating that he will have seven seconds to defy fate. \n\nMeanwhile, in the alternate timeline, Zack Fair triumphs over the Shinra forces. After Cloud returns to his group, they agree that Sephiroth is a greater threat to the Planet than Shinra, and commit to pursuing him. However, as the group departs Midgar, Aerith expresses concern over their now uncertain future.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time.

On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> \n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'s}} action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system draws from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game is fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nRather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314083618/https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|archive-date=March 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with the lighting engine Enlighten.<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202132615/https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |archive-date=February 2, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" /> The theme song \"Hollow\" is meant to reflect Cloud's state of mind with Nomura placing high emphasis on the rock music and male vocals.
