The tuning of the optical nonlinearities have been demonstrated during its entire laser-induced reduction process through continuous increase of the laser irradiance and four stages of different nonlinear activities have been discovered, which may serve as promising solid state materials for novel nonlinear functional devices.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = In Situ Third-Order Non-linear Responses During Laser Reduction of Graphene Oxide Thin Films Towards On-Chip Non-linear Photonic Devices|date = May 7, 2014|journal = Xiaorui Zheng|doi=10.1002/adma.201304681|pmid = 24639376|volume=26|issue = 17|pages=2699\u20132703|last1 = Zheng|first1 = Xiaorui|last2 = Jia|first2 = Baohua|last3 = Chen|first3 = Xi|last4 = Gu|first4 = Min|hdl = 1959.3/375725|hdl-access = free}}</ref> It is also proved that metal nanoparticles can greatly enhance the optical nonlinearity<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fakhri|first1=P|title=Nonlocal nonlinear optical response of graphene oxide- Au nanoparticles dispersed in different solvents|journal=Journal of Optics|volume=18|issue=1|page=015502|doi=10.1088/2040-8978/18/1/015502|bibcode=2016JOpt...18a5502F|year=2016}}</ref> and [[fluorescence]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Omidvar|first1=A|title=Metal-enhanced fluorescence of graphene oxide by palladium nanoparticles in the blue-green part of the spectrum|journal=Chinese Physics B|volume=25|issue=11|pages=118102|doi=10.1088/1674-1056/25/11/118102|url=http://cpb.iphy.ac.cn/EN/abstract/abstract68594.shtml|bibcode=2016ChPhB..25k8102O|year=2016}}</ref> of graphene oxide.\n\n===Graphene manufacture===\nGraphite oxide has attracted much interest as a possible route for the large-scale production and manipulation of [[graphene]], a material with extraordinary electronic properties.

Bacteria were used to produce a material consisting of two [[nanocellulose]] layers. The lower layer contains pristine [[cellulose]], while the top layer contains cellulose and graphene oxide, which absorbs sunlight and produces heat. The system draws water from below into the material. The water diffuses into the higher layer, where it evaporates and leaves behind any contaminants. The evaporate condenses on  top, where it can be captured. The film is produced by repeatedly adding a fluid coating that hardens. Bacteria produce nanocellulose fibers with interspersed graphene oxide flakes.

With the advances in micro- and nanofabrication techniques, continued miniaturization of the conventional optical lenses has always been requested for various applications such as communications, sensors, data storage and a wide range of other technology-driven and consumer-driven industries. Specifically, ever smaller sizes, as well as thinner thicknesses of micro lenses, are highly needed for subwavelength optics or nano-optics with extremely small structures, particularly for visible and near-IR applications. Also, as the distance scale for optical communications shrinks, the required feature sizes of micro lenses are rapidly pushed down.\n\nRecently, the excellent properties of newly discovered graphene oxide provide novel solutions to overcome the challenges of current planar focusing devices. Specifically, [[giant refractive index modification]] (as large as 10^-1), which is one order of magnitude larger than the current materials, between graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been demonstrated by dynamically manipulating its oxygen content using [[direct laser writing]] (DLW) method. As a result, the overall lens thickness can be potentially reduced by more than ten times. Also, the linear optical absorption of GO is found to increase as the reduction of GO deepens, which results in transmission contrast between GO and rGO and therefore provides amplitude modulation mechanism. Moreover, both the refractive index and the optical absorption are found to be dispersionless over a broad wavelength range from visible to near infrared. Finally, GO film offers flexible patterning capability by using the maskless DLW method, which reduces the manufacturing complexity and requirement.\n\nAs a result, a novel ultrathin [[planar lens]] on a GO thin film has been realized recently using the DLW method.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150922/ncomms9433/full/ncomms9433.html|title = Highly efficient and ultra-broadband graphene oxide ultrathin lenses with three-dimensional subwavelength focusing|last = |first = |date = September 22, 2015|work = Xiaorui Zheng|accessdate = August 20, 2015}}</ref> The distinct advantage of the GO flat lens is that phase modulation and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously, which are attributed to the giant refractive index modulation and the variable linear optical absorption of GO during its reduction process, respectively. Due to the enhanced wavefront shaping capability, the lens thickness is pushed down to subwavelength scale (~200&nbsp;nm), which is thinner than all current [[dielectric lens]]es (~ \u00b5m scale). The focusing intensities and the focal length can be controlled effectively by varying the laser powers and the lens sizes, respectively. By using oil immersion high NA objective during DLW process, 300&nbsp;nm fabrication feature size on GO film has been realized, and therefore the minimum lens size has been shrink down to 4.6&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, which is the smallest planar micro lens and can only be realized with metasurface by FIB. Thereafter, the focal length can be reduced to as small as 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5m, which would potentially increase the numerical aperture (NA) and the focusing resolution.\n\nThe full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 320&nbsp;nm at the minimum focal spot using 650&nbsp;nm input beam has been demonstrated experimentally, which corresponding to the effective numerical aperture (NA) of 1.24 (n=1.5), the largest NA of current micro lenses. Furthermore, ultra-broadband focusing capability from 500&nbsp;nm to as far as 2&nbsp;\u00b5m have been realized with the same planar lens, which is still a major challenge of focusing in infrared range due to limited availability of suitable materials and fabrication technology. Most importantly, the synthesized high quality GO thin films can be flexibly integrated on various substrates and easily manufactured by using the one-step DLW method over a large area at a comparable low cost and power (~nJ/pulse), which eventually makes the GO flat lenses promising for various practical applications.\n\n=== Energy Conversion ===\nPhotocatalytic Water Splitting is an artificial photosynthesis process in which water is dissociated into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), using artificial or natural light. Methods such as photocatalytic water splitting are currently being investigated to produce hydrogen as a clean source of energy. The superior electron mobility and high surface area of graphene oxide sheets suggest it may be implemented as a catalyst that meets the requirements for this process. Specifically, graphene oxide\u2019s compositional functional groups of epoxide (-O-) and hydroxide (-OH) allow for more flexible control in the water splitting process. This flexibility can be used to tailor the band gap and band positions that are targeted in photocatalytic water splitting. Recent research experiments have demonstrated that photocatalytic activity of graphene oxide containing a band gap within the required limits has produced effective splitting results, particularly when used with 40-50% coverage at a 2:1 hydroxide:epoxide ratio. When used in composite materials with CdS (a typical catalyst used in photocatalytic water splitting), graphene oxide nanocomposites have been shown to exhibit increased hydrogen production and quantum efficiency.\n\n=== Hydrogen Storage ===\nGraphene oxide is also being explored for its applications in hydrogen storage. Hydrogen molecules can be stored among the oxygen-based functional groups found throughout the sheet. This hydrogen storage capability can be further manipulated by modulating the interlayer distance between sheets, as well as making changes to the pore sizes. Research in transition metal decoration on carbon sorbents to enhance hydrogen binding energy has led to experiments with titanium and magnesium anchored to hydroxyl groups, allowing for the binding of multiple hydrogen molecules.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oxocarbon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n{{Oxides of carbon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graphite Oxide}}\n[[Category:Oxocarbons]]\n[[Category:Graphene]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Graphite oxide.svg|thumb|Structure proposed in 1998<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = H. | last2 = Klinowski | first2 = J. | last3 = Forster | first3 = M. | last4 = Lerf | first4 = A. | title = A new structural model for graphite oxide | doi = 10.1016/S0009-2614(98)00144-4 | journal = Chemical Physics Letters | volume = 287 | issue = 1 | pages = 53 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1998CPL...287...53H }}</ref> with functional groups.

With the advances in micro- and nanofabrication techniques, continued miniaturization of the conventional optical lenses has always been requested for various applications such as communications, sensors, data storage and a wide range of other technology-driven and consumer-driven industries. Specifically, ever smaller sizes, as well as thinner thicknesses of micro lenses, are highly needed for subwavelength optics or nano-optics with extremely small structures, particularly for visible and near-IR applications. Also, as the distance scale for optical communications shrinks, the required feature sizes of micro lenses are rapidly pushed down.\n\nRecently, the excellent properties of newly discovered graphene oxide provide novel solutions to overcome the challenges of current planar focusing devices. Specifically, [[giant refractive index modification]] (as large as 10^-1), which is one order of magnitude larger than the current materials, between graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been demonstrated by dynamically manipulating its oxygen content using [[direct laser writing]] (DLW) method. As a result, the overall lens thickness can be potentially reduced by more than ten times. Also, the linear optical absorption of GO is found to increase as the reduction of GO deepens, which results in transmission contrast between GO and rGO and therefore provides amplitude modulation mechanism. Moreover, both the refractive index and the optical absorption are found to be dispersionless over a broad wavelength range from visible to near infrared. Finally, GO film offers flexible patterning capability by using the maskless DLW method, which reduces the manufacturing complexity and requirement.\n\nAs a result, a novel ultrathin [[planar lens]] on a GO thin film has been realized recently using the DLW method.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150922/ncomms9433/full/ncomms9433.html|title = Highly efficient and ultra-broadband graphene oxide ultrathin lenses with three-dimensional subwavelength focusing|last = |first = |date = September 22, 2015|work = Xiaorui Zheng|accessdate = August 20, 2015}}</ref> The distinct advantage of the GO flat lens is that phase modulation and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously, which are attributed to the giant refractive index modulation and the variable linear optical absorption of GO during its reduction process, respectively. Due to the enhanced wavefront shaping capability, the lens thickness is pushed down to subwavelength scale (~200&nbsp;nm), which is thinner than all current [[dielectric lens]]es (~ \u00b5m scale). The focusing intensities and the focal length can be controlled effectively by varying the laser powers and the lens sizes, respectively. By using oil immersion high NA objective during DLW process, 300&nbsp;nm fabrication feature size on GO film has been realized, and therefore the minimum lens size has been shrink down to 4.6&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, which is the smallest planar micro lens and can only be realized with metasurface by FIB. Thereafter, the focal length can be reduced to as small as 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5m, which would potentially increase the numerical aperture (NA) and the focusing resolution.\n\nThe full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 320&nbsp;nm at the minimum focal spot using 650&nbsp;nm input beam has been demonstrated experimentally, which corresponding to the effective numerical aperture (NA) of 1.24 (n=1.5), the largest NA of current micro lenses. Furthermore, ultra-broadband focusing capability from 500&nbsp;nm to as far as 2&nbsp;\u00b5m have been realized with the same planar lens, which is still a major challenge of focusing in infrared range due to limited availability of suitable materials and fabrication technology. Most importantly, the synthesized high quality GO thin films can be flexibly integrated on various substrates and easily manufactured by using the one-step DLW method over a large area at a comparable low cost and power (~nJ/pulse), which eventually makes the GO flat lenses promising for various practical applications.\n\n=== Energy Conversion ===\nPhotocatalytic Water Splitting is an artificial photosynthesis process in which water is dissociated into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), using artificial or natural light. Methods such as photocatalytic water splitting are currently being investigated to produce hydrogen as a clean source of energy. The superior electron mobility and high surface area of graphene oxide sheets suggest it may be implemented as a catalyst that meets the requirements for this process. Specifically, graphene oxide\u2019s compositional functional groups of epoxide (-O-) and hydroxide (-OH) allow for more flexible control in the water splitting process. This flexibility can be used to tailor the band gap and band positions that are targeted in photocatalytic water splitting. Recent research experiments have demonstrated that photocatalytic activity of graphene oxide containing a band gap within the required limits has produced effective splitting results, particularly when used with 40-50% coverage at a 2:1 hydroxide:epoxide ratio. When used in composite materials with CdS (a typical catalyst used in photocatalytic water splitting), graphene oxide nanocomposites have been shown to exhibit increased hydrogen production and quantum efficiency.\n\n=== Hydrogen Storage ===\nGraphene oxide is also being explored for its applications in hydrogen storage. Hydrogen molecules can be stored among the oxygen-based functional groups found throughout the sheet. This hydrogen storage capability can be further manipulated by modulating the interlayer distance between sheets, as well as making changes to the pore sizes. Research in transition metal decoration on carbon sorbents to enhance hydrogen binding energy has led to experiments with titanium and magnesium anchored to hydroxyl groups, allowing for the binding of multiple hydrogen molecules.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oxocarbon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n{{Oxides of carbon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graphite Oxide}}\n[[Category:Oxocarbons]]\n[[Category:Graphene]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix PMC warnings", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite_oxide"}
