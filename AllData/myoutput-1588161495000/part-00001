The film is a new interpretation of the ''Conan'' myth, and is not related to the films featuring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. It stars [[Jason Momoa]] in the title role, alongside [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Stephen Lang]], [[Ron Perlman]], and [[Bob Sapp]] with [[Marcus Nispel]] directing. [[Morgan Freeman]] narrates the film.\n\nThe film had spent several years in development at [[Warner Bros.]], before the rights were shifted to Nu Image/Millennium Films in 2007, with a clause wishing for immediate start on production. [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] and [[Sony Pictures]] entered negotiations for distribution, with the film seeing many directors, prominently [[Brett Ratner]], before settling on Nispel in 2009, and subsequently bringing together a cast and crew. Filming began on March 15, 2010, and concluded June 5, 2010. The film was first released on August 17, 2011, in four countries: [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Iceland]], and the [[Philippines]]<ref>[http://www.syfyuniversal.fr/content/conan-le-barbare-2011-bande-annonce ''Conan''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s French and Belgian releases as announced on ''Syfyuniversal.fr'', a French science fiction & fantasy online channel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728190621/http://www.syfyuniversal.fr/content/conan-le-barbare-2011-bande-annonce |date=July 28, 2011 }}</ref><ref>''Illimit\u00e9, le magazine des cin\u00e9mas UGC'', #202/July\u2013August 2011, page 17, ISSN 1165-4368</ref> prior to the North American release on August 19.

This one is currently 696 words. -->\nConan is the son of Corin, a barbarian chieftan. Conan is a skilled but violent warrior, whom his father believes is not ready to wield his own sword. Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym, a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria. The mask, crafted by a group of sorcerers and used to subjugate the world, was broken into many pieces, scattered among the barbarian tribes. After locating Corin's piece of the mask and murdering the entire village, Zym leaves. Conan, the only survivor, swears revenge.\n\nYears later, Conan is a pirate but still seeks revenge. He encounters a slave colony and frees it by killing the slave handlers. In the city of Messantia, he encounters Ela-Shan, a thief being chased by Lucius, one of Zym's soldiers from years before. He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan. Conan escapes imprisonment, kills several of the guards, and confronts Lucius, forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl, the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the girl will unleash the mask's power. Conan helps the prisoners escape and Ela-Shan tells Conan he will find him at the City of Thieves, Argalon. Lucius is killed by the prisoners.\n\nZym and his daughter, the sorceress Marique, attack a monastery to find the pure-blood descendant. Sensing something is wrong, Fassir, an elderly monk, tells one of his students, Tamara, to run away and return to her birthplace. When Fassir refuses to reveal his knowledge of the descendant, Zym kills him. Marique slays several priestesses. Tamara's carriage is chased by Zym's men, but Conan rescues her, kills three of her pursuers, and captures Remo. After forcing him to reveal Tamara's importance as the pure-blood, Conan catapults Remo into Zym's nearby camp, killing him.\n\nZym and Marique confront Conan, who pretends to be interested in exchanging Tamara for gold. Conan attacks Zym, but Marique invokes soldiers made of sand, and poisons Conan with a boomerang sword. Tamara rescues him and they return to Conan's ship, where his friend Artus helps Conan recover. The boat is attacked by Zym's men, who kill several of Conan's men, but are defeated. Conan orders Artus to return to Messantia with Tamara and departs to confront Zym in his kingdom. Artus tells Tamara that Conan left a map behind and she follows him, meeting with him in a cave, where they have sex. The next day, as she is returning to the boat, Zym's men and daughter capture her.\n\nConan learns of Tamara's capture and departs to Argalon, where he asks Ela-Shan to help him break into Zym's castle. Zym prepares to drain Tamara's blood, mending the mask. He plans to use the girl's body as a vessel for his wife's soul. After confronting an octopus-like monster that guards the dungeons and killing its handlers, Conan infiltrates Zym's followers, kills a guard, steals his robe, and watches as Zym puts on the empowered mask. Conan releases Tamara, and she escapes as he battles Zym, reclaiming the sword Marique had stolen from his father. Marique attacks Tamara, but Conan hears Tamara's scream and cuts off Marique's hand. Tamara kicks her into a pit, where she is impaled. Zym swears revenge upon Conan.\n\nConan and Tamara are trapped on a bridge as Zym attacks. He uses the mask's power to call forth the spirit of his deceased wife, Maliva, a powerful sorceress, and her spirit begins to possess Tamara's body. She begs Conan to let her fall, but he instead destroys the bridge before jumping to safety with Tamara. Zym falls into the lava crying out to his wife.\n\nConan and Tamara escape, and he returns her to her birthplace, telling her that they will meet again. He returns to Corin's village and tells the memory of his father that he has avenged his death and recovered the sword Marique stole from him, restoring his honor.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Momoa]] as [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]\n** [[Leo Howard]] as young Conan\n* [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]] as Tamara, a beautiful and studious novice of a monastery who is actually of a bloodline of [[Acheron Empire|Acheronian necromancers]].\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as Khalar Zym, a ruthless empire-building warlord.

It stars [[Jason Momoa]] in the title role, alongside [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Stephen Lang]], [[Ron Perlman]], and [[Bob Sapp]] with [[Marcus Nispel]] directing.

[[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] and [[Sony Pictures]] entered negotiations for distribution, with the film seeing many directors, prominently [[Brett Ratner]], before settling on Nispel in 2009, and subsequently bringing together a cast and crew.

This one is currently 696 words. -->\nConan is the son of Corin, a barbarian chieftan. Conan is a skilled but violent warrior, whom his father believes is not ready to wield his own sword. Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym, a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria. The mask, crafted by a group of sorcerers and used to subjugate the world, was broken into many pieces, scattered among the barbarian tribes. After locating Corin's piece of the mask and murdering the entire village, Zym leaves. Conan, the only survivor, swears revenge.\n\nYears later, Conan is a pirate but still seeks revenge. He encounters a slave colony and frees it by killing the slave handlers. In the city of Messantia, he encounters Ela-Shan, a thief being chased by Lucius, one of Zym's soldiers from years before. He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan. Conan escapes imprisonment, kills several of the guards, and confronts Lucius, forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl, the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the girl will unleash the mask's power. Conan helps the prisoners escape and Ela-Shan tells Conan he will find him at the City of Thieves, Argalon. Lucius is killed by the prisoners.\n\nZym and his daughter, the sorceress Marique, attack a monastery to find the pure-blood descendant. Sensing something is wrong, Fassir, an elderly monk, tells one of his students, Tamara, to run away and return to her birthplace. When Fassir refuses to reveal his knowledge of the descendant, Zym kills him. Marique slays several priestesses. Tamara's carriage is chased by Zym's men, but Conan rescues her, kills three of her pursuers, and captures Remo. After forcing him to reveal Tamara's importance as the pure-blood, Conan catapults Remo into Zym's nearby camp, killing him.\n\nZym and Marique confront Conan, who pretends to be interested in exchanging Tamara for gold. Conan attacks Zym, but Marique invokes soldiers made of sand, and poisons Conan with a boomerang sword. Tamara rescues him and they return to Conan's ship, where his friend Artus helps Conan recover. The boat is attacked by Zym's men, who kill several of Conan's men, but are defeated. Conan orders Artus to return to Messantia with Tamara and departs to confront Zym in his kingdom. Artus tells Tamara that Conan left a map behind and she follows him, meeting with him in a cave, where they have sex. The next day, as she is returning to the boat, Zym's men and daughter capture her.\n\nConan learns of Tamara's capture and departs to Argalon, where he asks Ela-Shan to help him break into Zym's castle. Zym prepares to drain Tamara's blood, mending the mask. He plans to use the girl's body as a vessel for his wife's soul. After confronting an octopus-like monster that guards the dungeons and killing its handlers, Conan infiltrates Zym's followers, kills a guard, steals his robe, and watches as Zym puts on the empowered mask. Conan releases Tamara, and she escapes as he battles Zym, reclaiming the sword Marique had stolen from his father. Marique attacks Tamara, but Conan hears Tamara's scream and cuts off Marique's hand. Tamara kicks her into a pit, where she is impaled. Zym swears revenge upon Conan.\n\nConan and Tamara are trapped on a bridge as Zym attacks. He uses the mask's power to call forth the spirit of his deceased wife, Maliva, a powerful sorceress, and her spirit begins to possess Tamara's body. She begs Conan to let her fall, but he instead destroys the bridge before jumping to safety with Tamara. Zym falls into the lava crying out to his wife.\n\nConan and Tamara escape, and he returns her to her birthplace, telling her that they will meet again. He returns to Corin's village and tells the memory of his father that he has avenged his death and recovered the sword Marique stole from him, restoring his honor.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Momoa]] as [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]\n** [[Leo Howard]] as young Conan\n* [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]] as Tamara, a beautiful and studious novice of a monastery who is actually of a bloodline of [[Acheron Empire|Acheronian necromancers]].\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as Khalar Zym, a ruthless empire-building warlord.
