Measuring {{cvt|7.6|ha|acre}} in area, it is the largest square in the French capital. It is located in the city's [[8th arrondissement of Paris|eighth arrondissement]], at the eastern end of the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]. It was the site of many notable public executions, including the execution of [[King Louis XVI]], during the [[French Revolution]].\n\n== History ==\n== USA does not exist ==\nI have know idea what people are talking about when they say ''the states'' because that is just a large pile of poo. The USA does not exist and you know that, just except the truth thst ''The United states of America'' does not exist\n===Design===\nThe place was designed by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] in 1755 as a moat-skirted [[octagon]] between the Champs-Elys\u00e9es to the west and the [[Tuileries Garden]] to the east. Decorated with statues and fountains, the area was named the ''Place Louis XV'' to honor the king at that time. The square showcased an equestrian statue of the king, which had been commissioned in 1748 by the city of Paris, sculpted mostly by [[Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon]], and completed by [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle]] after the death of Bouchardon.\n\nAt the north end, two magnificent identical stone buildings were constructed. Separated by the [[Rue Royale, Paris|rue Royale]], these structures remain among the best examples of [[Louis Quinze]] style architecture. Initially, the eastern building served as the [[French Naval Ministry]]. Shortly after its construction, the western building became the opulent home of the Duc d'Aumont. It was later purchased by the Comte de Crillon, whose family resided there until 1907. The famous luxury [[H\u00f4tel de Crillon]], which currently occupies the building, took its name from its previous owners.\n\n=== French Revolution ===\n\nDuring the  [[French Revolution]] in 1789 the statue of [[Louis XV of France]] was torn down and the area renamed the '''Place de la R\u00e9volution'''. The new revolutionary government erected a [[guillotine]] in the square, and it was here that [[Execution of Louis XVI|King Louis XVI was executed]] on 21 January 1793.\n\nOther important figures guillotined on the site, often in front of cheering crowds, were Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Princess \u00c9lisabeth of France]], [[Charlotte Corday]], [[Madame du Barry]], [[Georges Danton]], [[Camille Desmoulins]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]], [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[Louis de Saint-Just]], and [[Olympe de Gouges]].\n\n[[File:Place Louis XVI plaque.jpg|thumb|The old plaque, for \"Place Louis XVI\", and replacement plaque at the corner of [[H\u00f4tel de Crillon]]]]\n[[Image:Place de la Concorde fountain dsc00774.jpg|thumb| The Fountain of River Commerce and Navigation, one of the two [[Fontaines de la Concorde]] (1840) on the Place de la Concorde.

After the [[Bourbon Restoration]] of 1814, the name was changed back to ''Place Louis XV'', and in 1826 the square was renamed ''Place Louis XVI''.  After the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 the name was returned to ''Place de la Concorde'' and has remained that way since.\n\n== Features ==\n[[File:Paris - Place de la Concorde vue de la Terrasse des Tuileries.jpg|thumb|Place de la Concorde as seen from la Terrasse des Tuileries ''ca'' 1900]]\n* To the west of the Place is the famous [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]].\n* To the east of the Place are the [[Tuileries Gardens]].

It is one of two the Egyptian government gave to the French in the 19th century. The other one stayed in Egypt, too difficult and heavy to move to France with the technology at that time. In the 1990s, President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] gave the second obelisk back to the Egyptians.\n\nThe obelisk once marked the entrance to the [[Luxor Temple]]. The self-declared [[Khedive]] of [[Egypt]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], offered the 3,300-year-old [[Luxor]] Obelisk to France in 1829. It arrived in Paris on 21 December 1833. Three years later, on 25 October 1836, King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] had it placed in the center of Place de la Concorde.\n\nThe obelisk, a yellow [[granite]] column, rises {{convert|23|m|ft|0}} high, including the base, and weighs over {{convert|250|t|ST|lk=on}}. Given the technical limitations of the day, transporting it was no easy feat \u2014 on the pedestal are drawn diagrams explaining the machinery that was used for the transportation. The obelisk is flanked on both sides by fountains constructed at the time of its erection on the Place.\n\nMissing its original cap, believed stolen in the 6th century BC, the government of France added a gold-leafed pyramid cap to the top of the obelisk in 1998.\n\n== The fountains ==\n[[File:Fontaine de la place de la Concorde Paris 04 07 97 8x6.jpg|thumb|right|Fountain of River Commerce and Navigation (1840) with the [[Eiffel Tower]] in the background.]]\n{{Main|Fontaines de la Concorde}}\nThe two fountains in the Place de la Concorde have been the most famous of the fountains built during the time of [[Louis-Philippe]], and came to symbolize the [[fountains in Paris]].   They were designed by [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]], a student of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical designer]] [[Charles Percier]] at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]]. The German-born Hittorff had served as the official Architect of Festivals and Ceremonies for the deposed King, and had spent two years studying the architecture and fountains of Italy.\n\nHittorff's two fountains were on the theme of rivers and seas, in part because of their proximity to the Ministry of Navy, and to the [[Seine]]. Their arrangement, on a north-south axis aligned with the Obelisk of Luxor and the Rue Royale, and the form of the fountains themselves, were influenced by the fountains of Rome, particularly [[Piazza Navona]] and the Piazza San Pietro, both of which had obelisks aligned with fountains.\n\nBoth fountains had the same form: a stone basin; six figures of [[Triton (mythology)|tritons]] or [[naiad]]s holding fish spouting water; six seated allegorical figures, their feet on the prows of ships, supporting the pedestal, of the circular ''vasque''; four statues of different forms of genius in arts or crafts supporting the upper inverted upper vasque; whose water shot up and then cascaded down to the lower vasque and then the basin.\n\nThe north fountain was devoted to the Rivers, with allegorical figures representing the [[Rhone]] and the [[Rhine]], the arts of the harvesting of flowers and fruits, harvesting and grape growing; and the geniuses of river navigation, industry, and agriculture.\n\nThe south fountain, closer to the Seine, represented the seas, with figures representing the Atlantic and the Mediterranean; harvesting coral; harvesting fish; collecting shellfish; collecting pearls; and the geniuses of astronomy, navigation and commerce.<ref>Beatrice Lamoitier, ''L'essor des fontaines monumentales'', in ''Paris et ses fontaines'', pg. 173.</ref>\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nIn the 1961 experimental documentary ''[[Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9]]'', [[Marceline Loridan-Ivens]] walks through the Place de la Concorde while reflecting on memories of her father and her time in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]].\n\nIn the ''[[Star Trek]]'' novels, the Place de la Concorde is the location of the offices of the President and the Council of the [[United Federation of Planets]].\n\nIn ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', Andrea Sachs throws her phone into one of the [[Fontaines de la Concorde]].\n\n''Angel'', the seventh book in the ''[[Maximum Ride]]'' novel series, includes the Place de la Concorde as a rally area to a crime organization known as the Doomsday Group.\n\nIn the video game ''[[Tom Clancy's EndWar]]'', the Place de la Concorde is across the bridge from the spawn point and is a major firefight zone.

In the end a missile lands in the background and destroys the square.\n\nIn [[Matthew Reilly]]'s first novel in the [[Jack West Jr]] series, ''[[Seven Ancient Wonders]]'', the Place de la Concorde is the resting place of a piece of the capstone to the Great Pyramid at Giza.\n\nIn the novel ''[[Tender is the Night]]'' by [[F.
