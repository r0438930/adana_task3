{"title_page": "Biology of depression", "text_new": "Scientific studies have found that  different brain areas show altered activity in people with [[major depressive disorder]], and this has encouraged advocates of various theories that seek to identify a biochemical origin of the disease, as opposed to theories that emphasize psychological or situational causes. Factors spanning these causative groups include nutritional deficiencies in [[Magnesium deficiency|magnesium]], [[vitamin D]], and [[tryptophan]] with situational origin but biological impact. Several theories concerning the '''biologically based cause of depression''' have been suggested over the years, including theories revolving around [[monoamine neurotransmitters]], [[neuroplasticity]], [[neurogenesis]], [[inflammation]] and the [[circadian rhythm]].

The observation of this efficacy led to the ''monoamine hypothesis of depression'', which postulates that the deficit of certain neurotransmitters is responsible for depression, and even that certain neurotransmitters are linked to specific symptoms. Normal serotonin levels have been linked to mood and behaviour regulation, sleep, and digestion; norepinephrine to the [[fight-or-flight response]]; and dopamine to movement, pleasure, and motivation. Some have also proposed the relationship between monoamines and phenotypes such as serotonin in sleep and suicide, norepinephrine in dysphoria, fatigue, apathy, cognitive dysfunction, and dopamine in loss of motivation and psychomotor symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marchand|last2=Valentina|last3=Jensen|title=Neurobiology of Mood disorders|journal=Hospital Physician|pages=17\u201326}}</ref> The main limitation for the monoamine hypothesis of depression is the therapeutic lag between initiation of antidepressant treatment and perceived improvement of symptoms. One explanation for this therapeutic lag is that the initial increase in synaptic serotonin is only temporary, as firing of serotonergic neurons in the [[dorsal raphe]] adapt via the activity of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> [[autoreceptor]]s.  The therapeutic effect of antidepressants is thought to arise from autoreceptor desensitization over a period of time, eventually elevating firing of serotonergic neurons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hjorth|first1=S|last2=Bengtsson|first2=HJ|last3=Kullberg|first3=A|last4=Carlzon|first4=D|last5=Peilot|first5=H|last6=Auerbach|first6=SB|title=Serotonin autoreceptor function and antidepressant drug action|journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)|date=June 2000|volume=14|issue=2|pages=177\u201385|doi=10.1177/026988110001400208|pmid=10890313}}</ref>\n[[File:Monoamine receptor effects.png|thumb|Monoamine receptors affect [[phospholipase C]] and [[adenylyl cyclase]] inside of the cell.

Reduced striatal activity, elevated OFC activity, and elevated sgACC activity were all findings consistent with the proposed models.  However, amygdala activity was reported to be decreased, contrary to the limbic-cortical model.  Furthermore, only lateral prefrontal regions were modulated by treatment, indicating that prefrontal areas are state markers(i.e. dependent upon mood), while subcortical abnormalities are trait markers(i.e. reflect a susceptibility).<ref name=\"Graham2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Julia|last2=Salimi-Khorshidi|first2=Gholamreza|last3=Hagan|first3=Cindy|last4=Walsh|first4=Nicholas|last5=Goodyer|first5=Ian|last6=Lennox|first6=Belinda|last7=Suckling|first7=John|title=Meta-analytic evidence for neuroimaging models of depression: State or trait?|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=1 November 2013|volume=151|issue=2|pages=423\u2013431|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2013.07.002|pmid=23890584|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Reward===\nWhile depression severity as a whole is not correlated with a blunted neural response to reward, [[anhedonia]] is directly correlated to reduced activity in the [[reward system]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Anticevic|first1=A|last2=Schleifer|first2=C|last3=Youngsun|first3=TC|title=Emotional and cognitive dysregulation in schizophrenia and depression: understanding common and distinct behavioral and neural mechanisms|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=December 2015|volume=17|issue=4|pages=421\u201334|pmid=26869843|pmc=4734880}}</ref>  The study of reward in depression is limited by heterogeniety in the definition and conceptualizations of reward and anhedonia.

This region is extremely rich in [[serotonin transporter]]s and is considered as a governor for a vast network involving areas like [[hypothalamus]] and [[brain stem]], which influences changes in appetite and sleep; the [[amygdala]] and [[Insular cortex|insula]], which affect the mood and anxiety; the [[hippocampus]], which plays an important role in memory formation; and some parts of the [[frontal cortex]] responsible for self-esteem.

The observation of this efficacy led to the ''monoamine hypothesis of depression'', which postulates that the deficit of certain neurotransmitters is responsible for depression, and even that certain neurotransmitters are linked to specific symptoms. Normal serotonin levels have been linked to mood and behaviour regulation, sleep, and digestion; norepinephrine to the [[fight-or-flight response]]; and dopamine to movement, pleasure, and motivation. Some have also proposed the relationship between monoamines and phenotypes such as serotonin in sleep and suicide, norepinephrine in dysphoria, fatigue, apathy, cognitive dysfunction, and dopamine in loss of motivation and psychomotor symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marchand|last2=Valentina|last3=Jensen|title=Neurobiology of Mood disorders|journal=Hospital Physician|pages=17\u201326}}</ref> The main limitation for the monoamine hypothesis of depression is the therapeutic lag between initiation of antidepressant treatment and perceived improvement of symptoms. One explanation for this therapeutic lag is that the initial increase in synaptic serotonin is only temporary, as firing of serotonergic neurons in the [[dorsal raphe]] adapt via the activity of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> [[autoreceptor]]s.  The therapeutic effect of antidepressants is thought to arise from autoreceptor desensitization over a period of time, eventually elevating firing of serotonergic neurons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hjorth|first1=S|last2=Bengtsson|first2=HJ|last3=Kullberg|first3=A|last4=Carlzon|first4=D|last5=Peilot|first5=H|last6=Auerbach|first6=SB|title=Serotonin autoreceptor function and antidepressant drug action|journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)|date=June 2000|volume=14|issue=2|pages=177\u201385|doi=10.1177/026988110001400208|pmid=10890313}}</ref>\n[[File:Monoamine receptor effects.png|thumb|Monoamine receptors affect [[phospholipase C]] and [[adenylyl cyclase]] inside of the cell.

Optogenetic excitation of D1-MSNs alleviates depressive symptoms and is rewarding, while the same with D2-MSNs enhances depressive symptoms.  Excitation of glutaminergic inputs from the ventral hippocampus reduces social interactions, and enhancing these projections produces susceptibility to stress-induced depression.<ref name=\"Knowland\"/>  Manipulations of different regions of the mPFC can produce and attenuate depressive behaviors.  For example, inhibiting mPFC neurons specifically in the intralimbic cortex attenuates depressive behaviors.  The conflicting findings associated with mPFC stimulation, when compared to the relatively specific findings in the infralimbic cortex, suggest that the prelimbic cortex and infralimbic cortex may mediate opposing effects.<ref name=\"Lammel\"/>  mPFC projections to the raphe nuclei are largely GABAergic and inhibit the firing of serotonergic neurons.
