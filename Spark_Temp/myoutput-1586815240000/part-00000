It consists of eight [[feature film]]s and additional media.\n\nIn 2003, Wan and Whannell made a [[Saw (2003 film)|short film]] to help [[Sales presentation|pitch]] a potential [[feature film]] concept. Their pitch was ultimately successful, and in 2004, [[Saw (2004 film)|the first installment]] of what would become the feature film franchise debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was released theatrically that October, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The sequels were directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], [[David Hackl]], and [[Kevin Greutert]], and were written by Wan, Whannell, Bousman, [[Patrick Melton]], and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and were released subsequently every October, on the Friday before [[Halloween]], between 2004 and 2010. Both of the creators remained with the franchise as [[executive producer]]s.\n\nOn July 22, 2010, producer [[Mark Burg]] confirmed that the seventh film, ''[[Saw 3D]]'', is the final installment of the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=July 22, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3dlvkb|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise with a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].<ref name=\"Lionsgate Remaking Saw\">{{cite web|title=Lionsgate Remaking Saw?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/58024/lionsgate-remaking-saw|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> In November 2013, it was reported that they were actively developing a sequel.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\">{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Lionsgate Is Actively Developing Next 'Saw'|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3262916/exclusive-lionsgate-is-actively-developing-next-saw/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref> An eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', was eventually released in October 2017. In 2019, a ninth film was announced, ''[[Spiral (2020 film)|Spiral]]'', with comedian and actor [[Chris Rock]] attached to star, produce, and co-write.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3561412/saw-reimagined-chris-rock-darren-bousman-returning-direct/|title=\u2018SAW\u2019 Being Reimagined by Chris Rock with Darren Bousman Returning to Direct!|first=Brad|last=Miska|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=May 16, 2019|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe franchise primarily revolves around [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]], also called the \"Jigsaw Killer\" or simply \"Jigsaw\". He was introduced briefly in ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and developed in more detail in ''[[Saw II]]'' and the subsequent films. Rather than killing his [[List of Saw characters|victims]] outright, Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls \"tests\" or \"games\" to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture and believes that if they survive, they will be \"rehabilitated\". Despite the fact that John was murdered in ''[[Saw III]]'', the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].\n\nThe franchise grossed more than {{US$|1 billion|long=no|link=yes}} from [[box office]] and retail sales by 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lidz|first=Franz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/movies/25lidz.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&hpw|title=Limbs Pile Up, and Money, Too|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 21, 2009|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> and the films have collectively grossed over {{US$|976 million|long=no}} at the worldwide box office as of 2018. The film series as a whole has received mostly mixed to negative reviews by critics, but has been a financial success at the box office and is one of the highest-grossing horror film franchises of all time.

Jill lost her unborn baby, Gideon, due to the unwitting actions of a drug addict named [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil]], who fled the scene. ''[[Saw VI]]'' later showed that another drug addict, [[Amanda Young]], also had an unintentional role in the death of Gideon. John grieved over the loss of his child and distanced himself from his friends and his wife.\n\nJohn and Jill eventually drifted apart and divorced. After this turn of events, John found himself trapped by his own complacency until he was diagnosed with inoperable [[cancer]]. Extremely bitter over his squandered life and the loss of his unborn son, John began observing the lives of others and became even more depressed as he saw those around him squandering the gift of life that he had just been denied. John went to a man named William Easton to get money for a cancer treatment, but was denied. Flashbacks from ''[[Saw II]]'' show that, after surviving a [[suicide]] attempt where he drove his car off a cliff, John was \"reborn\", and nurtured the idea that the only way for someone to change is for them to change themselves. Then, in ''[[Saw IV]]'' flashbacks, he designed the first trap and test for Cecil and decided to use the rest of his existence to design more of these \"tests\" or \"games\" as a form of \"instant rehabilitation\" that would change the world, \"one person at a time\". John was soon given the name \"The Jigsaw Killer\" (or \"Jigsaw\"), because he removed a puzzle-piece-shaped chunk of flesh from those who did not escape his traps. John stated that this name was given to him by the media, and that the cut piece of flesh was meant to represent that these victims were each missing something\u2014what he called the \"survival instinct\".\n\nFew of Jigsaw's victims can survive his brutal mechanical traps, which are often [[irony|ironically]] [[symbol]]ic representations of the problems in the victim's life and require them to undergo severe physical and psychological [[torture]] to escape.\n\nIn ''[[Saw V]]'', police lieutenant [[Mark Hoffman]]'s ties with John are revealed in a series of flashbacks during the film. Hoffman's sister is murdered by her boyfriend, [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]. Seth is arrested; however, a technicality allowed him to be released, and Hoffman, feeling Seth had not served the full capacity of his sentence, kills him in an inescapable trap designed to look like one of Jigsaw's, laying the blame on him. Jigsaw then kidnaps Hoffman and blackmails him into becoming his apprentice in his \"rehabilitation\" methods, though eventually Hoffman would become a willing apprentice, helping set up John's tests from almost the beginning, starting with [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]'s trap.\n\nThe first surviving victim, [[Amanda Young]], views Jigsaw as a hero who ultimately changed her life for the better. Amanda, upon Jigsaw's request, agrees to become his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]]. After Amanda survives, John shows Jill her rehabilitation, and Jill then becomes knowledgeable of John's traps and becomes somewhat of an accomplice as well.\n\nIn ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', Jigsaw has chained the man who diagnosed his cancer, [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], in a dilapidated industrial washroom with [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]], a photographer who has been tailing the doctor due to belief he is cheating on his wife. Lawrence has instructions to kill Adam by six o'clock, or else his wife and daughter will be killed. Flashbacks show detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who suspect Lawrence of being Jigsaw, following a trail of clues from other Jigsaw traps. Sing's death from a shotgun trap after saving a victim named Jeff causes Tapp to obsess over catching Jigsaw. Later on, he chases [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]], who monitors Adam and Lawrence's tests, and gets shot in the chest. Eventually, Lawrence saws off his own foot in order to escape, leaving Adam in the bathroom while Lawrence goes to try to save his family and get help for Adam. It is later seen in ''Saw 3D'' that Lawrence found a steaming hot pipe and cauterized his wound, stopping the bleeding and ultimately surviving the trap. John catches up with Lawrence and makes him his next apprentice, a fact which he hides from his other accomplices. Flashbacks from ''Saw III'' show that Amanda kidnapped Adam and later returned to suffocate him as an act of \"mercy killing\".\n\n[[File:Saw-cast.jpg|thumb|left|Central actors of the series. From top-left to bottom-right: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Cary Elwes, Costas Mandylor, Danny Glover, and Betsy Russell.|250px]]\n''[[Saw II]]'' begins with the police tracking a severely weakened Jigsaw to his lair. However, another test is in place, as he and Amanda have kidnapped the son of Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] and trapped him and a group of seven convicts, previously framed by Eric, in a house that is slowly being filled with [[Sarin|sarin gas]], with Amanda Young among them. He will trade [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]' life for Eric's time, conversing with him until the game is concluded. Eric loses his patience and assaults Jigsaw, forcing him to take him to the house, only to discover that the video feed from inside the house had been pre-recorded, the events actually taking place much earlier; Eric's son was locked in a safe in Jigsaw's warehouse, being kept alive with an oxygen tank. Eric is knocked unconscious by a masked figure and wakes up imprisoned in the bathroom from ''Saw'', which is part of the foundation of the house. Amanda reveals herself to Eric as Jigsaw's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e before leaving him to die. In a flashback from ''Saw III'', Eric manages to escape the bathroom by breaking his foot. He confronts and beats Amanda, demanding to know where his son is. Amanda fights him off and leaves him for dead. A flashback from ''Saw IV'' shows Hoffman later dragging Eric to a prison cell, keeping him alive for a future game.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw III]]'' and ''[[Saw IV]]'' occur concurrently. ''Saw III'' begins with Jigsaw, weakened and near death, confined to a makeshift hospital bed. Amanda has taken over his work, designing traps of her own; however, these traps are inescapable, as Amanda is convinced that Jigsaw's traps have no effect and that people don't change. A [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|kidnapped doctor]] is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while another test is performed on [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a man obsessed with vengeance against the drunk driver who killed his son. Jigsaw, unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy, designs a test for Amanda as well; she ultimately fails, and it results in the deaths of both Jigsaw and Amanda. ''Saw IV'', meanwhile, revolves around tests meant for [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]], which are overseen by Hoffman. Rigg fails his test, resulting in the death of Eric Matthews. Rigg is left to bleed to death by Hoffman, who later discovers the bodies of Jigsaw and Amanda. When an [[autopsy]] is performed on Jigsaw, a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] coated in wax is found in his [[stomach]]; the tape informs Hoffman that he is wrong to think that it is all over just because Jigsaw is dead, and he should not expect to go untested.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw V]]'' show one of Hoffman's first solo tests, five people connected by different roles in a disastrous fire that killed several others are put into four interconnected tests of teamwork, killing off one person in each trap. The two remaining test subjects realize at the final trap that each previous trap was meant to be completed by each of the five people doing a small part, rather than killing one person per trap. With this knowledge, the two work together and barely manage to escape. They are found alive by Special Agent Erikson. Meanwhile, Hoffman has set up FBI Agent [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] to appear to be Jigsaw's accomplice, while Strahm pursues Hoffman and is eventually killed due to his inability to follow Hoffman's rules, leaving Hoffman free to continue Jigsaw's \"work\".\n\n''[[Saw VI]]'' begins with Hoffman setting up a game as per John's instructions left in a box for Jill during ''Saw V''. This game centers on insurance executive named [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] who oversees a team responsible for rejecting two-thirds of all insurance claims. As William progresses through four tests, he saves as many people as he can and learns the error of his choice to reject so many policies, which inherently \"kill\" the rejected. His last test is revealed to be a test of forgiveness by the family of [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]], a man to whom William rejected a policy in the past, whose son ultimately chooses to kill William using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Meanwhile, Agent Erickson and the-previously-thought-to-be-dead agent [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]] search for Agent Strahm with the assistance of Hoffman. Upon finding irregularities in previous murder scenes, Perez and Erickson discover Hoffman's identity, but are killed by him before they can go public with his involvement. Hoffman travels back to the site of William's tests in which Jill attacks him to obey John's final request. She leaves Hoffman in a new Reverse Beartrap left behind by John, though does not leave a key for him to free himself. He is able to manipulate the trap and escapes wounded.\n\n''[[Saw 3D]]'' picks up with Jill and Hoffman battling for control of Jigsaw's legacy. As Jill enters protective custody and makes Hoffman's true identity public, Hoffman sets up a new game involving [[skinhead]]s to find a way to Jill. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen, a fraud who has written a book about escaping a Jigsaw trap he never experienced, is captured and forced to confront people who knew that he lied about being in a trap. Three of Dagen's friends die and his test concludes with him being forced to reenact the trap that he claimed to have survived before. He fails, which results in the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Hoffman has posed as a corpse and killed several officers to infiltrate the police station. He finds and kills Jill using the Reverse Beartrap. Hoffman attempts to leave town but is captured by Lawrence Gordon and his accomplices, then placed in the bathroom from the first film. Jigsaw is revealed to have aided Lawrence after his game and, in return, Lawrence helped him with subsequent traps. Hoffman is then left shackled in the bathroom to die.\n\n''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'' begins with a new game presumably being conducted 10 years after the events of John Kramer's death in ''Saw III''. Five people are forced to undergo a series of tests in an abandoned barn, led by John. In the first test, one of the subjects is seemingly killed by buzzsaws after remaining unconscious during instruction. Most of the remaining subjects are killed throughout the game, until only two, Anna and the heavily wounded Ryan, are left. The two of them are drugged and wake up chained on opposite sides of a room. John is revealed to be in the room with them, and he provides them with a shotgun, explaining it is the \"key to their freedom\", before leaving them to escape. Anna attempts to kill Ryan with the shotgun, but the weapon was rigged to backfire, killing her and leaving Ryan to die. Meanwhile, police forces led by Detective Halloran and aided by medical forensic scientists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonneville attempt to discover the location and participants in the game, while also struggling to understand how the deceased John could be behind it all. Logan and Eleanor find the location of the game at an abandoned barn owned by Jill Tuck, with Halloran pursuing them, believing they are behind the most recent games. Eleanor is shown escaping, and Logan and Halloran are placed in a room with collars lined with laser cutters around their neck. They are told by John that they must confess their sins to survive. Logan is presumably killed after admitting his error delayed John's diagnosis. Halloran then confesses he let various guilty convicts walk free, deactivating his collar. However, Logan rises from the ground, revealing his collar was harmless. He explains that the game in the barn was the very first game that took place ten years earlier, and that the bodies found by the team were criminals that Halloran let walk free, who Logan placed into an identical game of his own. He reveals he was the participant in the first game who was presumably killed by the buzzsaws, but that John did not believe Logan should die simply because his \"crime\" was merely an accident, and rescued him as a result. John took Logan under his wing, and Logan aided John in all the various traps throughout the series, making him John's very first apprentice. Logan reactivates Halloran's collar, slicing his head open, before slamming the door shut.\n\n===Recurring elements===\n'''Billy'''\n{{Main|Billy the Puppet}}\nBilly is a puppet resembling a [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist.27s dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]], sometimes seen riding a [[tricycle]], that has appeared throughout the films and has become a type of [[mascot]] for the series. It is used by the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] to communicate with his victims by delivering televised messages or occasionally in person to describe details of the sadistic traps and the means by which the victims could survive. Viewers have sometimes incorrectly identified the puppet itself as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]], because of its presence and connection to the killer.\n\nAge and use of the puppet over the course of the films necessitated its reconstruction. According to [[James Wan|Wan]], the original puppet's face for ''Saw'' involved clay, [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], and black ping-pong balls with the irises painted in for the eyes, but in later films more sophisticated construction included [[Water jet cutter|waterjet-cut]] foam for the body and remote-controlled [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronics]].<ref name=\"GreggJoBlopt2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|title=Saw 2: Dairy #2|last=Hoffman|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Hoffman|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|page=2|date=May 13, 2005|access-date=August 24, 2011<!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AcAwHaK|archive-date=August 24, 2011-->}}</ref>\n\nThe endurance and popularity of the franchise has resulted in the production of ''Billy'' merchandise, as well as references in other media and its use in promotions for the films.\n\n'''\"Hello Zepp\"'''\n{{Main|Hello Zepp}}\n\n\"Hello Zepp\" is a piece of instrumental music that was originally composed by [[Charlie Clouser]] for the first film in the series. In ''Saw'', the implied villain, Zep Hindle, is revealed to actually be a victim of the Jigsaw Killer. (The character's name in the script is spelled \"Zep\", whereas the music titles are spelled \"Zepp\".)<ref>[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Saw.html ''Saw'' script] on IMSDb. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref><ref>[http://saw.ugo.com/?cur=saw-i-soundtrack ''Saw'' track listing] on [[UGO Networks|UGO]]. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref> As the series continued, the piece was reused in every film as a [[leitmotif]], often being renamed and remixed to accommodate the changing situations and characters. The music was used in every ''Saw'' ending, usually during the revealing of plot revelations and twists which ''Saw'' films often use and it serves as the main theme tune for the whole films.\n\n'''Traps'''<br />\nAn important component of each film is the variety of (usually mechanical in form) traps Jigsaw and his apprentices use on their captives to communicate his message.\n\nAccording to [[David Hackl]], all of the traps are real objects, and not [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. They were designed to look horrific but ultimately be safe for the actors in them. Writer [[Marcus Dunstan]] said: \"It's built to function there on the day\", and added: \"It works. So if there's a scalping chair\u2014there really was a chair with working gears to grind and pull your scalp back.\" The most potentially dangerous item was a \"water box\" used in ''[[Saw V]]'', in which one of the actors ([[Scott Patterson]], as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]]) had to keep his head submerged as long as possible. Another element of the traps is that [[David Hackl|Hackl]] desired a specific look of rust and menace, but he also wanted them to have a type of beauty about them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039913p1.html|title=The Anatomy of a Trap: Saw|date=October 29, 2009|access-date=July 22, 2010|last=Monfette|first=Christopher|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3t1zc2|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\n[[File:Saw Guinness award cropped.jpg|thumb|The ''Saw'' series was placed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the \"Most Successful Horror Franchise\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/23/film-saw-idUSN2215375420100723|title=\"Saw\" movie franchise to get Guinness world record|last=Kit|first=Zorianna|work=[[Reuters]]|date=July 22, 2010|access-date=September 21, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61rOhewtb|archive-date=September 21, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Pictured here is director [[Kevin Greutert]] receiving the award at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2010 Comic-Con]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/content/printVersion/61775/|title=Splattered: An Interview with James Wan Talking torture, politics and not-so-sweet revenge|last=Foundas|first=Scott|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=August 30, 2011|access-date=August 19, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/614BzHXY1|archive-date=August 19, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\n''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' grossed $18.2 million its opening weekend and had become [[Lionsgate]]'s second-best opening, after ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''{{'s}} {{nowrap|$23.9 million}} (2004).<ref name=\"BOMOpening\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1540&p=.htm|title='Ray,' 'Saw' See Robust Bows|last=Gray|first=Brandon|work=Box Office Mojo|publisher=Amazon.com|date=November 1, 2004|access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> ''Saw'' went on to gross {{nowrap|$103 million}} worldwide,<ref name=\"SawBOM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=saw.htm|title=Saw (2004)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=August 16, 2011}}</ref> and is the second-lowest-grossing film in the series after ''[[Saw VI]]''.<ref name=\"Saw.vs\">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/showdowns/chart/?id=sawvs.htm|title='Saw' Vs.

It consists of eight [[feature film]]s and additional media.\n\nIn 2003, Wan and Whannell made a [[Saw (2003 film)|short film]] to help [[Sales presentation|pitch]] a potential [[feature film]] concept. Their pitch was ultimately successful, and in 2004, [[Saw (2004 film)|the first installment]] of what would become the feature film franchise debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was released theatrically that October, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The sequels were directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], [[David Hackl]], and [[Kevin Greutert]], and were written by Wan, Whannell, Bousman, [[Patrick Melton]], and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and were released subsequently every October, on the Friday before [[Halloween]], between 2004 and 2010. Both of the creators remained with the franchise as [[executive producer]]s.\n\nOn July 22, 2010, producer [[Mark Burg]] confirmed that the seventh film, ''[[Saw 3D]]'', is the final installment of the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=July 22, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3dlvkb|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise with a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].<ref name=\"Lionsgate Remaking Saw\">{{cite web|title=Lionsgate Remaking Saw?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/58024/lionsgate-remaking-saw|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> In November 2013, it was reported that they were actively developing a sequel.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\">{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Lionsgate Is Actively Developing Next 'Saw'|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3262916/exclusive-lionsgate-is-actively-developing-next-saw/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref> An eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', was eventually released in October 2017. In 2019, a ninth film was announced, ''[[Spiral (2020 film)|Spiral]]'', with comedian and actor [[Chris Rock]] attached to star, produce, and co-write.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3561412/saw-reimagined-chris-rock-darren-bousman-returning-direct/|title=\u2018SAW\u2019 Being Reimagined by Chris Rock with Darren Bousman Returning to Direct!|first=Brad|last=Miska|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=May 16, 2019|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe franchise primarily revolves around [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]], also called the \"Jigsaw Killer\" or simply \"Jigsaw\". He was introduced briefly in ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and developed in more detail in ''[[Saw II]]'' and the subsequent films. Rather than killing his [[List of Saw characters|victims]] outright, Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls \"tests\" or \"games\" to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture and believes that if they survive, they will be \"rehabilitated\". Despite the fact that John was murdered in ''[[Saw III]]'', the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].\n\nThe franchise grossed more than {{US$|1 billion|long=no|link=yes}} from [[box office]] and retail sales by 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lidz|first=Franz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/movies/25lidz.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&hpw|title=Limbs Pile Up, and Money, Too|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 21, 2009|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> and the films have collectively grossed over {{US$|976 million|long=no}} at the worldwide box office as of 2018. The film series as a whole has received mostly mixed to negative reviews by critics, but has been a financial success at the box office and is one of the highest-grossing horror film franchises of all time.

Jill lost her unborn baby, Gideon, due to the unwitting actions of a drug addict named [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil]], who fled the scene. ''[[Saw VI]]'' later showed that another drug addict, [[Amanda Young]], also had an unintentional role in the death of Gideon. John grieved over the loss of his child and distanced himself from his friends and his wife.\n\nJohn and Jill eventually drifted apart and divorced. After this turn of events, John found himself trapped by his own complacency until he was diagnosed with inoperable [[cancer]]. Extremely bitter over his squandered life and the loss of his unborn son, John began observing the lives of others and became even more depressed as he saw those around him squandering the gift of life that he had just been denied. John went to a man named William Easton to get money for a cancer treatment, but was denied. Flashbacks from ''[[Saw II]]'' show that, after surviving a [[suicide]] attempt where he drove his car off a cliff, John was \"reborn\", and nurtured the idea that the only way for someone to change is for them to change themselves. Then, in ''[[Saw IV]]'' flashbacks, he designed the first trap and test for Cecil and decided to use the rest of his existence to design more of these \"tests\" or \"games\" as a form of \"instant rehabilitation\" that would change the world, \"one person at a time\". John was soon given the name \"The Jigsaw Killer\" (or \"Jigsaw\"), because he removed a puzzle-piece-shaped chunk of flesh from those who did not escape his traps. John stated that this name was given to him by the media, and that the cut piece of flesh was meant to represent that these victims were each missing something\u2014what he called the \"survival instinct\".\n\nFew of Jigsaw's victims can survive his brutal mechanical traps, which are often [[irony|ironically]] [[symbol]]ic representations of the problems in the victim's life and require them to undergo severe physical and psychological [[torture]] to escape.\n\nIn ''[[Saw V]]'', police lieutenant [[Mark Hoffman]]'s ties with John are revealed in a series of flashbacks during the film. Hoffman's sister is murdered by her boyfriend, [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]. Seth is arrested; however, a technicality allowed him to be released, and Hoffman, feeling Seth had not served the full capacity of his sentence, kills him in an inescapable trap designed to look like one of Jigsaw's, laying the blame on him. Jigsaw then kidnaps Hoffman and blackmails him into becoming his apprentice in his \"rehabilitation\" methods, though eventually Hoffman would become a willing apprentice, helping set up John's tests from almost the beginning, starting with [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]'s trap.\n\nThe first surviving victim, [[Amanda Young]], views Jigsaw as a hero who ultimately changed her life for the better. Amanda, upon Jigsaw's request, agrees to become his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]]. After Amanda survives, John shows Jill her rehabilitation, and Jill then becomes knowledgeable of John's traps and becomes somewhat of an accomplice as well.\n\nIn ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', Jigsaw has chained the man who diagnosed his cancer, [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], in a dilapidated industrial washroom with [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]], a photographer who has been tailing the doctor due to belief he is cheating on his wife. Lawrence has instructions to kill Adam by six o'clock, or else his wife and daughter will be killed. Flashbacks show detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who suspect Lawrence of being Jigsaw, following a trail of clues from other Jigsaw traps. Sing's death from a shotgun trap after saving a victim named Jeff causes Tapp to obsess over catching Jigsaw. Later on, he chases [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]], who monitors Adam and Lawrence's tests, and gets shot in the chest. Eventually, Lawrence saws off his own foot in order to escape, leaving Adam in the bathroom while Lawrence goes to try to save his family and get help for Adam. It is later seen in ''Saw 3D'' that Lawrence found a steaming hot pipe and cauterized his wound, stopping the bleeding and ultimately surviving the trap. John catches up with Lawrence and makes him his next apprentice, a fact which he hides from his other accomplices. Flashbacks from ''Saw III'' show that Amanda kidnapped Adam and later returned to suffocate him as an act of \"mercy killing\".\n\n[[File:Saw-cast.jpg|thumb|left|Central actors of the series. From top-left to bottom-right: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Cary Elwes, Costas Mandylor, Danny Glover, and Betsy Russell.|250px]]\n''[[Saw II]]'' begins with the police tracking a severely weakened Jigsaw to his lair. However, another test is in place, as he and Amanda have kidnapped the son of Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] and trapped him and a group of seven convicts, previously framed by Eric, in a house that is slowly being filled with [[Sarin|sarin gas]], with Amanda Young among them. He will trade [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]' life for Eric's time, conversing with him until the game is concluded. Eric loses his patience and assaults Jigsaw, forcing him to take him to the house, only to discover that the video feed from inside the house had been pre-recorded, the events actually taking place much earlier; Eric's son was locked in a safe in Jigsaw's warehouse, being kept alive with an oxygen tank. Eric is knocked unconscious by a masked figure and wakes up imprisoned in the bathroom from ''Saw'', which is part of the foundation of the house. Amanda reveals herself to Eric as Jigsaw's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e before leaving him to die. In a flashback from ''Saw III'', Eric manages to escape the bathroom by breaking his foot. He confronts and beats Amanda, demanding to know where his son is. Amanda fights him off and leaves him for dead. A flashback from ''Saw IV'' shows Hoffman later dragging Eric to a prison cell, keeping him alive for a future game.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw III]]'' and ''[[Saw IV]]'' occur concurrently. ''Saw III'' begins with Jigsaw, weakened and near death, confined to a makeshift hospital bed. Amanda has taken over his work, designing traps of her own; however, these traps are inescapable, as Amanda is convinced that Jigsaw's traps have no effect and that people don't change. A [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|kidnapped doctor]] is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while another test is performed on [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a man obsessed with vengeance against the drunk driver who killed his son. Jigsaw, unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy, designs a test for Amanda as well; she ultimately fails, and it results in the deaths of both Jigsaw and Amanda. ''Saw IV'', meanwhile, revolves around tests meant for [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]], which are overseen by Hoffman. Rigg fails his test, resulting in the death of Eric Matthews. Rigg is left to bleed to death by Hoffman, who later discovers the bodies of Jigsaw and Amanda. When an [[autopsy]] is performed on Jigsaw, a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] coated in wax is found in his [[stomach]]; the tape informs Hoffman that he is wrong to think that it is all over just because Jigsaw is dead, and he should not expect to go untested.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw V]]'' show one of Hoffman's first solo tests, five people connected by different roles in a disastrous fire that killed several others are put into four interconnected tests of teamwork, killing off one person in each trap. The two remaining test subjects realize at the final trap that each previous trap was meant to be completed by each of the five people doing a small part, rather than killing one person per trap. With this knowledge, the two work together and barely manage to escape. They are found alive by Special Agent Erikson. Meanwhile, Hoffman has set up FBI Agent [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] to appear to be Jigsaw's accomplice, while Strahm pursues Hoffman and is eventually killed due to his inability to follow Hoffman's rules, leaving Hoffman free to continue Jigsaw's \"work\".\n\n''[[Saw VI]]'' begins with Hoffman setting up a game as per John's instructions left in a box for Jill during ''Saw V''. This game centers on insurance executive named [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] who oversees a team responsible for rejecting two-thirds of all insurance claims. As William progresses through four tests, he saves as many people as he can and learns the error of his choice to reject so many policies, which inherently \"kill\" the rejected. His last test is revealed to be a test of forgiveness by the family of [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]], a man to whom William rejected a policy in the past, whose son ultimately chooses to kill William using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Meanwhile, Agent Erickson and the-previously-thought-to-be-dead agent [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]] search for Agent Strahm with the assistance of Hoffman. Upon finding irregularities in previous murder scenes, Perez and Erickson discover Hoffman's identity, but are killed by him before they can go public with his involvement. Hoffman travels back to the site of William's tests in which Jill attacks him to obey John's final request. She leaves Hoffman in a new Reverse Beartrap left behind by John, though does not leave a key for him to free himself. He is able to manipulate the trap and escapes wounded.\n\n''[[Saw 3D]]'' picks up with Jill and Hoffman battling for control of Jigsaw's legacy. As Jill enters protective custody and makes Hoffman's true identity public, Hoffman sets up a new game involving [[skinhead]]s to find a way to Jill. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen, a fraud who has written a book about escaping a Jigsaw trap he never experienced, is captured and forced to confront people who knew that he lied about being in a trap. Three of Dagen's friends die and his test concludes with him being forced to reenact the trap that he claimed to have survived before. He fails, which results in the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Hoffman has posed as a corpse and killed several officers to infiltrate the police station. He finds and kills Jill using the Reverse Beartrap. Hoffman attempts to leave town but is captured by Lawrence Gordon and his accomplices, then placed in the bathroom from the first film. Jigsaw is revealed to have aided Lawrence after his game and, in return, Lawrence helped him with subsequent traps. Hoffman is then left shackled in the bathroom to die.\n\n''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'' begins with a new game presumably being conducted 10 years after the events of John Kramer's death in ''Saw III''. Five people are forced to undergo a series of tests in an abandoned barn, led by John. In the first test, one of the subjects is seemingly killed by buzzsaws after remaining unconscious during instruction. Most of the remaining subjects are killed throughout the game, until only two, Anna and the heavily wounded Ryan, are left. The two of them are drugged and wake up chained on opposite sides of a room. John is revealed to be in the room with them, and he provides them with a shotgun, explaining it is the \"key to their freedom\", before leaving them to escape. Anna attempts to kill Ryan with the shotgun, but the weapon was rigged to backfire, killing her and leaving Ryan to die. Meanwhile, police forces led by Detective Halloran and aided by medical forensic scientists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonneville attempt to discover the location and participants in the game, while also struggling to understand how the deceased John could be behind it all. Logan and Eleanor find the location of the game at an abandoned barn owned by Jill Tuck, with Halloran pursuing them, believing they are behind the most recent games. Eleanor is shown escaping, and Logan and Halloran are placed in a room with collars lined with laser cutters around their neck. They are told by John that they must confess their sins to survive. Logan is presumably killed after admitting his error delayed John's diagnosis. Halloran then confesses he let various guilty convicts walk free, deactivating his collar. However, Logan rises from the ground, revealing his collar was harmless. He explains that the game in the barn was the very first game that took place ten years earlier, and that the bodies found by the team were criminals that Halloran let walk free, who Logan placed into an identical game of his own. He reveals he was the participant in the first game who was presumably killed by the buzzsaws, but that John did not believe Logan should die simply because his \"crime\" was merely an accident, and rescued him as a result. John took Logan under his wing, and Logan aided John in all the various traps throughout the series, making him John's very first apprentice. Logan reactivates Halloran's collar, slicing his head open, before slamming the door shut.\n\n===Recurring elements===\n'''Billy'''\n{{Main|Billy the Puppet}}\nBilly is a puppet resembling a [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist.27s dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]], sometimes seen riding a [[tricycle]], that has appeared throughout the films and has become a type of [[mascot]] for the series. It is used by the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] to communicate with his victims by delivering televised messages or occasionally in person to describe details of the sadistic traps and the means by which the victims could survive. Viewers have sometimes incorrectly identified the puppet itself as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]], because of its presence and connection to the killer.\n\nAge and use of the puppet over the course of the films necessitated its reconstruction. According to [[James Wan|Wan]], the original puppet's face for ''Saw'' involved clay, [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], and black ping-pong balls with the irises painted in for the eyes, but in later films more sophisticated construction included [[Water jet cutter|waterjet-cut]] foam for the body and remote-controlled [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronics]].<ref name=\"GreggJoBlopt2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|title=Saw 2: Dairy #2|last=Hoffman|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Hoffman|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|page=2|date=May 13, 2005|access-date=August 24, 2011<!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AcAwHaK|archive-date=August 24, 2011-->}}</ref>\n\nThe endurance and popularity of the franchise has resulted in the production of ''Billy'' merchandise, as well as references in other media and its use in promotions for the films.\n\n'''\"Hello Zepp\"'''\n{{Main|Hello Zepp}}\n\n\"Hello Zepp\" is a piece of instrumental music that was originally composed by [[Charlie Clouser]] for the first film in the series. In ''Saw'', the implied villain, Zep Hindle, is revealed to actually be a victim of the Jigsaw Killer. (The character's name in the script is spelled \"Zep\", whereas the music titles are spelled \"Zepp\".)<ref>[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Saw.html ''Saw'' script] on IMSDb. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref><ref>[http://saw.ugo.com/?cur=saw-i-soundtrack ''Saw'' track listing] on [[UGO Networks|UGO]]. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref> As the series continued, the piece was reused in every film as a [[leitmotif]], often being renamed and remixed to accommodate the changing situations and characters. The music was used in every ''Saw'' ending, usually during the revealing of plot revelations and twists which ''Saw'' films often use and it serves as the main theme tune for the whole films.\n\n'''Traps'''<br />\nAn important component of each film is the variety of (usually mechanical in form) traps Jigsaw and his apprentices use on their captives to communicate his message.\n\nAccording to [[David Hackl]], all of the traps are real objects, and not [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. They were designed to look horrific but ultimately be safe for the actors in them. Writer [[Marcus Dunstan]] said: \"It's built to function there on the day\", and added: \"It works. So if there's a scalping chair\u2014there really was a chair with working gears to grind and pull your scalp back.\" The most potentially dangerous item was a \"water box\" used in ''[[Saw V]]'', in which one of the actors ([[Scott Patterson]], as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]]) had to keep his head submerged as long as possible. Another element of the traps is that [[David Hackl|Hackl]] desired a specific look of rust and menace, but he also wanted them to have a type of beauty about them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039913p1.html|title=The Anatomy of a Trap: Saw|date=October 29, 2009|access-date=July 22, 2010|last=Monfette|first=Christopher|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3t1zc2|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\n[[File:Saw Guinness award cropped.jpg|thumb|The ''Saw'' series was placed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the \"Most Successful Horror Franchise\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/23/film-saw-idUSN2215375420100723|title=\"Saw\" movie franchise to get Guinness world record|last=Kit|first=Zorianna|work=[[Reuters]]|date=July 22, 2010|access-date=September 21, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61rOhewtb|archive-date=September 21, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Pictured here is director [[Kevin Greutert]] receiving the award at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2010 Comic-Con]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/content/printVersion/61775/|title=Splattered: An Interview with James Wan Talking torture, politics and not-so-sweet revenge|last=Foundas|first=Scott|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=August 30, 2011|access-date=August 19, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/614BzHXY1|archive-date=August 19, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\n''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' grossed $18.2 million its opening weekend and had become [[Lionsgate]]'s second-best opening, after ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''{{'s}} {{nowrap|$23.9 million}} (2004).<ref name=\"BOMOpening\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1540&p=.htm|title='Ray,' 'Saw' See Robust Bows|last=Gray|first=Brandon|work=Box Office Mojo|publisher=Amazon.com|date=November 1, 2004|access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> ''Saw'' went on to gross {{nowrap|$103 million}} worldwide,<ref name=\"SawBOM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=saw.htm|title=Saw (2004)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=August 16, 2011}}</ref> and is the second-lowest-grossing film in the series after ''[[Saw VI]]''.<ref name=\"Saw.vs\">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/showdowns/chart/?id=sawvs.htm|title='Saw' Vs.
