It brings together land use planning, water management, [[Conservation biology|bio-diversity conservation]], and the future sustainability of industries like [[agriculture]], [[mining]], [[tourism]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]].

In [[Australia]], water sharing, such as the [[Murray Darling Basin|Murray Darling Basin Plan]] and [[catchment management]] are also significant.\n\n==Ownership regimes==\n\nNatural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], natural resources:\n\n* State property:  Ownership and control over the use of resources is in hands of the state. Individuals or groups may be able to make use of the resources, but only at the permission of the state. National forest, National parks and military reservations are some US  examples.\n\n* Private property: Any property owned by a defined individual or corporate entity. Both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owner(s). Private land is the most common example.\n\n* Common property: It is a private property of a group. The group may vary in size, nature and internal structure e.g. indigenous neighbours of village. Some examples of common property are community forests.\n\n* Non-property (open access): There is no definite owner of these properties. Each potential user has equal ability to use it as they wish. These areas are the most exploited. It is said that \"Everybody's property is nobody's property\". An example is a lake fishery. [[Common land]] may exist without ownership, in which case in the UK it is vested in a local authority.\n\n* Hybrid: Many ownership regimes governing natural resources will contain parts of more than one of the regimes described above, so natural resource managers need to consider the impact of hybrid regimes. An example of such a hybrid is native vegetation management in NSW, Australia, where legislation recognises a public interest in the preservation of native vegetation, but where most native vegetation exists on private land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/vegetation/nvact.htm|title=Native Vegetation Act 2003|publisher=Environment.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Stakeholder analysis==\n\n[[Stakeholder analysis]] originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into [[natural resource]] management in ever growing popularity.

They involve the ecological cycles, hydrological cycles, climate, animals, plants and geography, etc. All these are dynamic and inter-related. A change in one of them may have far reaching and/or long term impacts which may even be irreversible. In addition to the natural systems, natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests, policies, politics, geographical boundaries, economic implications and the list goes on. It is a very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time. This results in conflicting situations.\n\nAfter the United Nations Conference for the Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land, water, and forests. Although program names vary from nation to nation, all express similar aims.\n\nThe various approaches applied to natural resource management include:\n\n* Top-down (command and control)\n* Community-based natural resource management\n* [[Adaptive]] management\n* Precautionary approach\n* Integrated natural resource management\n\n=== Community-based natural resource management ===\n\nThe   community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities. The three key assumptions being that: locals are better placed to conserve natural resources, people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation, and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life.<ref name=\"Thakadu2005\" /> When a local people's quality of life is enhanced, their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced.<ref>Ostrom, E,  Schroeder, L and Wynne, S 1993. Institutional incentives and sustainable development: infrastructure policies in perspective. Westview Press. Oxford, UK. 266 pp.</ref> Regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of [[subsidiarity]].\n\nThe United Nations advocates CBNRM in the Convention on Biodiversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. Unless clearly defined, decentralised NRM can result an ambiguous socio-legal environment with local communities racing to exploit natural resources while they can e.g. forest communities in central Kalimantan (Indonesia).<ref>Bartley, T Andersson, K, Jager P and Van Laerhoven 2008 The contribution of Institutional Theories for explaining [[Decentralization]] of Natural Resource Governance.

What is biodiversity? Biodiversity is a comprehensive concept, which is a description of the extent of natural diversity. Gaston and Spicer<ref>Gaston, KJ & Spicer, JI 2004, Biodiversity: An Introduction, Blackwell Publishing Company, Malden.</ref> (p.&nbsp;3) point out that biodiversity is \"the variety of life\" and relate to different kinds of \"biodiversity organization\". According to Gray<ref>{{cite book|author=Gray, JS|date=1997|title=Marine biodiversity: patterns, threats and conservation needs|url=http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172744/http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|archive-date=21 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (p.&nbsp;154), the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity, was put forward by the United Nations in 1992, involving different aspects of biological diversity.\n\n;Precautionary Biodiversity Management\n\nThe \"threats\" wreaking havoc on biodiversity include; [[habitat fragmentation]], putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources; forest deterioration and deforestation; the invasion of \"alien species\" and \"climate change\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Cooney, R|date=2004|title=The Precautionary Principle in Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource Management|publisher=IUCN Policy and Global Change Series|number=2|url=http://pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509063720/http://www.pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|archive-date=9 May 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>( p.&nbsp;2). Since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public, the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management. According to Cooney, there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management.\n\n;Concrete \"policy tools\"\n\nCooney claims that the policy making is dependent on \"evidences\", relating to \"high standard of proof\", the forbidding of special \"activities\" and \"information and monitoring requirements\". Before making the policy of precaution, categorical evidence is needed. When the potential menace of \"activities\" is regarded as a critical and \"irreversible\" endangerment, these \"activities\" should be forbidden. For example, since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment, the South Africa Marine Living Resources Act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to \"catch fish\" by using explosives and toxicants.\n\n;Administration and guidelines\n\nAccording to Cooney, there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management;\n\n# \"[[Ecosystem-based management]]\" including \"more risk-averse and precautionary management\", where \"given prevailing uncertainty regarding ecosystem structure, function, and inter-specific interactions, precaution demands an ecosystem rather than single-species approach to management\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lackey |first1=Robert |title=Seven pillars of ecosystem management |journal=Landscape and Urban Planning |date=1998 |volume=40 |issue=1-3 |page=21-30 |doi=doi.org/10.1016/S0169-2046(97)00095-9}}</ref>\n# \"[[Adaptive management]]\" is \"a management approach that expressly tackles the uncertainty and dynamism of complex systems\".\n# \"[[Environmental impact assessment]]\" and exposure ratings decrease the \"uncertainties\" of precaution, even though it has deficiencies, and\n# \"Protectionist approaches\", which \"most frequently links to\" biodiversity conservation in natural resources management.\n\n;Land management\n\nIn order to have a sustainable environment, understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important. In terms of understanding, Young<ref>Young, A 1998, Land resources: now and for the future, Cambridge University Press, UK</ref> emphasises some important points of land management:\n\n* Comprehending the processes of nature including ecosystem, water, soils\n* Using appropriate and adapting management systems in local situations\n* Cooperation between scientists who have knowledge and resources and local people who have knowledge and skills\n\nDale et al.

The ecological principles relate to time, place, species, disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many ways. It is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines:\n\n* Examine impacts of local decisions in a regional context, and the effects on natural resources.\n* Plan for long-term change and unexpected events.\n* Preserve rare landscape elements and associated species.\n* Avoid land uses that deplete natural resources.\n* Retain large contiguous or connected areas that contain critical habitats.\n* Minimize the introduction and spread of non-native species.\n* Avoid or compensate for the effects of development on ecological processes.\n* Implement land-use and land-management practices that are compatible with the natural potential of the area.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n\n* [[Agriculture]]\n* [[Agroecology]]\n* [[Biodiversity]]\n* [[Bioregion]]\n* [[Conservation biology]]\n* [[Conservation ethic]]\n* [[Conservation movement]]\n* [[Conservation reliant species]]\n* [[Deep ecology]]\n* [[Earth Science]]\n* [[Ecology]]\n* [[Ecology movement]]\n* [[Ecosystem]]\n* [[Environmental movement]]\n* [[Environmental organizations]]\n* [[Environmental protection]]\n* [[Environmental resources management]]\n* [[Forestry]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Green party]]\n* [[Green politics]]\n* [[Habitat conservation]]\n* [[Holistic management]]\n* [[List of environmental issues]]\n* [[List of environmental organizations]]\n* [[Natural capital]]\n* [[Natural environment]]\n* [[Natural resource]]\n* [[Nature]]\n* [[Progressivism]]\n* [[Recycling]]\n* [[Renewable energy]]\n* [[Renewable resource]]\n* [[Stewardship]]\n* [[Sustainable agriculture]]\n* [[Sustainable management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Environmental science}}\n{{Environmental social science}}\n{{Natural resources}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Natural Resource Management}}\n[[Category:Environmental social science]]\n[[Category:Sustainable development]]\n[[Category:Environmental planning]]\n[[Category:Natural resource management| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Refimprove|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:Tongass national forest juneau img 7501.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Tongass National Forest]] in [[Alaska]] is managed by the [[United States Forest Service]]]]\n\n'''Natural Resource Management''' refers to the management of [[natural resource]]s such as [[Land (economics)|land]], [[water]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, with a particular focus on how management affects the [[quality of life]] for both present and future generations ([[stewardship]]).\n\n'''Natural Resource Management''' deals with managing the way in which people and natural [[landscapes]] interact.

In [[Australia]], water sharing, such as the [[Murray Darling Basin|Murray Darling Basin Plan]] and [[catchment management]] are also significant.\n\n==Ownership regimes==\n\nNatural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], natural resources:\n\n* State property:  Ownership and control over the use of resources is in hands of the state. Individuals or groups may be able to make use of the resources, but only at the permission of the state. National forest, National parks and military reservations are some US  examples.\n\n* Private property: Any property owned by a defined individual or corporate entity. Both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owner(s). Private land is the most common example.\n\n* Common property: It is a private property of a group. The group may vary in size, nature and internal structure e.g. indigenous neighbours of village. Some examples of common property are community forests.\n\n* Non-property (open access): There is no definite owner of these properties. Each potential user has equal ability to use it as they wish. These areas are the most exploited. It is said that \"Everybody's property is nobody's property\". An example is a lake fishery. [[Common land]] may exist without ownership, in which case in the UK it is vested in a local authority.\n\n* Hybrid: Many ownership regimes governing natural resources will contain parts of more than one of the regimes described above, so natural resource managers need to consider the impact of hybrid regimes. An example of such a hybrid is native vegetation management in NSW, Australia, where legislation recognises a public interest in the preservation of native vegetation, but where most native vegetation exists on private land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/vegetation/nvact.htm|title=Native Vegetation Act 2003|publisher=Environment.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Stakeholder analysis==\n\n[[Stakeholder analysis]] originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into [[natural resource]] management in ever growing popularity.

They involve the ecological cycles, hydrological cycles, climate, animals, plants and geography, etc. All these are dynamic and inter-related. A change in one of them may have far reaching and/or long term impacts which may even be irreversible. In addition to the natural systems, natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests, policies, politics, geographical boundaries, economic implications and the list goes on. It is a very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time. This results in conflicting situations.\n\nAfter the United Nations Conference for the Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land, water, and forests. Although program names vary from nation to nation, all express similar aims.\n\nThe various approaches applied to natural resource management include:\n\n* Top-down (command and control)\n* Community-based natural resource management\n* [[Adaptive]] management\n* Precautionary approach\n* Integrated natural resource management\n\n=== Community-based natural resource management ===\n\nThe   community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities. The three key assumptions being that: locals are better placed to conserve natural resources, people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation, and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life.<ref name=\"Thakadu2005\" /> When a local people's quality of life is enhanced, their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced.<ref>Ostrom, E,  Schroeder, L and Wynne, S 1993.

What is biodiversity? Biodiversity is a comprehensive concept, which is a description of the extent of natural diversity. Gaston and Spicer<ref>Gaston, KJ & Spicer, JI 2004, Biodiversity: An Introduction, Blackwell Publishing Company, Malden.</ref> (p.&nbsp;3) point out that biodiversity is \"the variety of life\" and relate to different kinds of \"biodiversity organization\". According to Gray<ref>{{cite book|author=Gray, JS|date=1997|title=Marine biodiversity: patterns, threats and conservation needs|url=http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172744/http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|archive-date=21 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (p.&nbsp;154), the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity, was put forward by the United Nations in 1992, involving different aspects of biological diversity.\n\n;Precautionary Biodiversity Management\n\nThe \"threats\" wreaking havoc on biodiversity include; [[habitat fragmentation]], putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources; forest deterioration and deforestation; the invasion of \"alien species\" and \"climate change\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Cooney, R|date=2004|title=The Precautionary Principle in Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource Management|publisher=IUCN Policy and Global Change Series|number=2|url=http://pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509063720/http://www.pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|archive-date=9 May 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>( p.&nbsp;2). Since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public, the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management. According to Cooney, there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management.\n\n;Concrete \"policy tools\"\n\nCooney claims that the policy making is dependent on \"evidences\", relating to \"high standard of proof\", the forbidding of special \"activities\" and \"information and monitoring requirements\". Before making the policy of precaution, categorical evidence is needed. When the potential menace of \"activities\" is regarded as a critical and \"irreversible\" endangerment, these \"activities\" should be forbidden. For example, since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment, the South Africa Marine Living Resources Act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to \"catch fish\" by using explosives and toxicants.\n\n;Administration and guidelines\n\nAccording to Cooney, there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management;\n\n# \"[[Ecosystem-based management]]\" including \"more risk-averse and precautionary management\", where \"given prevailing uncertainty regarding ecosystem structure, function, and inter-specific interactions, precaution demands an ecosystem rather than single-species approach to management\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lackey |first1=Robert |title=Seven pillars of ecosystem management |journal=Landscape and Urban Planning |date=1998 |volume=40 |issue=1-3 |page=21-30 |doi=doi.org/10.1016/S0169-2046(97)00095-9}}</ref>\n# \"[[Adaptive management]]\" is \"a management approach that expressly tackles the uncertainty and dynamism of complex systems\".\n# \"[[Environmental impact assessment]]\" and exposure ratings decrease the \"uncertainties\" of precaution, even though it has deficiencies, and\n# \"Protectionist approaches\", which \"most frequently links to\" biodiversity conservation in natural resources management.\n\n;Land management\n\nIn order to have a sustainable environment, understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important. In terms of understanding, Young<ref>Young, A 1998, Land resources: now and for the future, Cambridge University Press, UK</ref> emphasises some important points of land management:\n\n* Comprehending the processes of nature including ecosystem, water, soils\n* Using appropriate and adapting management systems in local situations\n* Cooperation between scientists who have knowledge and resources and local people who have knowledge and skills\n\nDale et al.

The ecological principles relate to time, place, species, disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many ways. It is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines:\n\n* Examine impacts of local decisions in a regional context, and the effects on natural resources.\n* Plan for long-term change and unexpected events.\n* Preserve rare landscape elements and associated species.\n* Avoid land uses that deplete natural resources.\n* Retain large contiguous or connected areas that contain critical habitats.\n* Minimize the introduction and spread of non-native species.\n* Avoid or compensate for the effects of development on ecological processes.\n* Implement land-use and land-management practices that are compatible with the natural potential of the area.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n\n* [[Agriculture]]\n* [[Agroecology]]\n* [[Biodiversity]]\n* [[Bioregion]]\n* [[Conservation biology]]\n* [[Conservation ethic]]\n* [[Conservation movement]]\n* [[Conservation reliant species]]\n* [[Deep ecology]]\n* [[Earth Science]]\n* [[Ecology]]\n* [[Ecology movement]]\n* [[Ecosystem]]\n* [[Environmental movement]]\n* [[Environmental organizations]]\n* [[Environmental protection]]\n* [[Environmental resources management]]\n* [[Forestry]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Green party]]\n* [[Green politics]]\n* [[Habitat conservation]]\n* [[Holistic management]]\n* [[List of environmental issues]]\n* [[List of environmental organizations]]\n* [[Natural capital]]\n* [[Natural environment]]\n* [[Natural resource]]\n* [[Nature]]\n* [[Progressivism]]\n* [[Recycling]]\n* [[Renewable energy]]\n* [[Renewable resource]]\n* [[Stewardship]]\n* [[Sustainable agriculture]]\n* [[Sustainable management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Environmental science}}\n{{Environmental social science}}\n{{Natural resources}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Natural Resource Management}}\n[[Category:Environmental social science]]\n[[Category:Sustainable development]]\n[[Category:Environmental planning]]\n[[Category:Natural resource management| ]]\n", "name_user": "User-duck", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:Narrow columns.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource_management"}
