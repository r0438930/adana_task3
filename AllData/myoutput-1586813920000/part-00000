From 1983 to 1985, Christina Knight was a Sales Director at EF Language Schools in Stockholm, before starting her studies at [https://www.berghs.se/ Berghs School of Communication] where she graduated in 1986 as Copywrite Student of the Year. After reading ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' by [[John Steinbeck]] when she was sixteen years old she was inspired to become a copywriter.<ref name=\"marcommnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://marcommnews.com/marcomms-star-parade-meet-christina-knight/|title=MarComm\u2019s Star Parade: Meet Christina Knight \u2013 Marketing Communication News|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>\n\nHer first job as a Copywriter was at the then renowned Swedish agency, {{ill|Hall & Cederquist|sv|Hall_%26_Cederquist|vertical-align=sup}}, later acquired by [[Young & Rubicam]]. Christina worked at Hall & Cederquist as the agency's first female creative ever and stayed until 1991, when she founded her own agency, [[Knight & Day]] in Stockholm together with the Art Director, Helena Sundelin. The agency ran successfully for nine years before the owners decided to fold and Christina proceeded to freelance as a Copywriter.\n\nConsequently, she has worked at Discovery in London and at several agencies; Trampolin, DRAFT/FCB, Lowe Brindfors, [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]] and [[INGO]] - Ogilvy & Grey in Stockholm, Sweden; between the years 1985-2004 as a Copywriter and since 2004 as a Creative Director, one of the rare female CD:s in the industry. In 2005, while working at [[DraftFCB]] Stockholm, Knight won a Lion at the Cannes Lions Advertising Award Festival for her work on a campaign called \u201cHello Period\u201d which was a tampon ad campaign aimed at educating young girls about periods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/directmarketing/tampons-and-information-on-menstruation-hello-period-6061505/|title=coloribus.com Ad Archives \"HELLO, PERIOD!

The book features stories from and about prominent female leaders in the advertising industry such as [[Rochelle Lazarus|Shelly Lazarus]], [[Cilla Snowball]], [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], Susan Hoffman, Nunu Ntshingila, Stefanie Wurst, and several others. With 10 American ad women and 4 women from around the world, the book hosts a diverse cast of potential role models.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://madwomen.info/thebook|title=MadWoman Book Info|date=March 10, 2018}}</ref> As a consequence, Christina has lectured all over the world about the importance of balance and diversity for the communications industry. In 2015, she left her position as Creative Director at INGO to found her own company, UKNIGHT, to fully focus on supporting the industry's development into a more representative and diverse industry. She works as a Copywriter and Creative Director as well as a consultant in the industry, lectures and also teaches at Berghs School of Communication in Stockholm, among other media schools. She is also a member of the board of WaterAid Sweden, of Fredrika Bremer F\u00f6rbundet and the [[International Alliance of Women]].\n\nWith Christina Knight going on to lecture about women and marketing she has even spoke as a TEDxSSE speaker in April 2014. She spoke from experience, talking about how awkward it was for her to campaign women sanitary protection to men in a client meeting. She gives us a look into the marketing field that is prominently men, because in her own words only 3% of creative directors are women in the U.S.A. She spoke about the term 'the pink ghetto', a term that was coined in 1983 to described the portion of the labor market that is predominantly female professions. But in the advertising industry, the term is used more for when the women who are in the field are placed in areas where it is deemed as typically female, example is Christina Knights campaigning for women's sanitary protection, although she was able to get herself in other assignments such as telecom, cars and ventilation technology. Throughout her talk, she makes a point that there has been a lack of women. There were few women to look up to in that industry, and she has traveled to find women in the field to show the younger generations more role models. In her own words and findings she shows a list of percentages during her talk, Women account for 80% of all consumer purchases, 55% of all home electronic purchases, 89% of all financial purchases, 92% of all holiday trips decisions, and 90% of all care purchases (by influence). She shows this because she was making the point that in the advertising industry, if women are not being brought to the forefront in this field could be a lost in money. That marketing to women could be beneficial, but that doesn't mean just make it pink.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.adwomen.org/2009/05/interview-to-christina-knight/|title=Interview to Christina Knight \u2013 Clio 2009 jury member {{!}} AdWomen|website=www.adwomen.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-09}}</ref>\n\nHer arguments are not about having more women, or having women take control of the workforce, but rather to have more equality in men dominated field so that there would be more balance. She believed with more equality comes more perspectives. In her interview for AdWomen in 2009, when the prospect of there ever being a segregation between whats being marketed for women and what's being marketed for men, she completely disagreed with that line of thinking. She argues that you need more women, not a separation. Even when something is more for women or more for men, in her experience, both sides listen but the difference is that both sides have different experiences and with that, opinions as well of course. So when a product that is more towards one gender is being made, then it could be easier to target that gender more successfully. When asked about how to target women and key factors to reached them, she denied there being a definite answer because that would generalize them. She spoke about role models and there importance to younger generations. How that while she was still in school she didn't have any female teachers. So she's made it a point to write about an essay on the subject and has become a role model herself as she holds lectures in that school now that she has rose the ranks herself to inspire the women there now because she acknowledges that there are talented men and women.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<blockquote>''\"When I lecture I always get questions on what it is like to be a woman in advertising and how I have been able to stay on for so long.
