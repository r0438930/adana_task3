This usage could apply to women too. The British comic strip ''[[Jane (comic strip)|Jane]]'', first published in the 1930s, described the adventures of ''Jane Gay''. Far from implying homosexuality, it referred to her free-wheeling lifestyle with plenty of boyfriends (while also punning on [[Lady Jane Grey]]).\n\nA passage from [[Gertrude Stein]]'s ''Miss Furr & Miss Skeene'' (1922) is possibly the first traceable published use of the word to refer to a homosexual relationship. According to Linda Wagner-Martin (''Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and her Family'', 1995) the portrait \"featured the sly repetition of the word gay, used with sexual intent for one of the first times in linguistic history,\" and [[Edmund Wilson]] (1951, quoted by James Mellow in ''Charmed Circle'', 1974) agreed.<ref>Martha E.

In a scene in which [[Cary Grant]]'s character's clothes have been sent to the cleaners, he is forced to wear a woman's feather-trimmed robe. When another character asks about his robe, he responds, \"Because I just went ''gay'' all of a sudden!\" Since this was a mainstream film at a time, when the use of the word to refer to [[cross-dressing]] (and, by extension, homosexuality) would still be unfamiliar to most film-goers, the line can also be interpreted to mean, \"I just decided to do something frivolous.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/bringingupbaby.html|title=Bringing Up Baby|access-date=24 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630103200/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/bringingupbaby.html|archive-date=30 June 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, the earliest reference found to date for the word gay as a self-described name for homosexuals came from Alfred A.

Additionally, none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite society. Consequently, a number of [[euphemism]]s were used to hint at suspected homosexuality. Examples include \"sporty\" girls and \"artistic\" boys,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cocks |first1=H.

In the British comedy-drama film ''[[Light Up the Sky!

He begins, \"I'd like to propose...\" at which point a fellow diner, played by [[Sidney Tafler]], interjects \"Who to?\", suggesting a proposal of marriage. The Benny Hill character responds, \"Not to you for start, you ain't my type\". He then adds in mock doubt, \"Oh, I don't know, you're rather gay on the quiet.\"\n\nBy 1963, a new sense of the word ''gay'' was known well enough to be used by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] in his book ''The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Man-Hunting''.

So, organizations like the National Gay Task Force became the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]]. For many ardent feminist lesbians, it was also important that the ''L'' come first, lest an ''L'' following a ''G'' become another symbol of male dominance over women,<ref>''Lesbian Ethics'', pp. 13\u201321.</ref> although other women prefer the usage ''gay woman''. In the 1990s, this was followed by another equally concerted push to include the terminology specifically pointing out the inclusion of bisexual, [[transgender]], [[intersex]], and other people, reflecting the intra-community debate as to whether these other sexual minorities were part of the same human rights movement. Most news organizations have formally adopted variations of this use, following the example and preference of the organizations, as reflected in their press releases and public communications.\n\n=== Descriptor ===\n[[File:Seattle R Place.jpg|thumb|right| \"R Place\" [[Gay Bar]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, United States.]]\n\nThe term ''gay'' can also be used as an adjective to describe things related to homosexual men, or things which are part of [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|the said culture]]. For example, the term \"gay bar\" describes the bar which either caters primarily to a homosexual male clientele or is otherwise part of homosexual male culture.\n\nUsing it to describe an object, such as an item of clothing, suggests that it is particularly flamboyant, often on the verge of being gaudy and garish. This usage predates the association of the term with homosexuality but has acquired different connotations since the modern usage developed.\n\n{{anchor|noun|Noun}}\n\n=== Use as a noun ===\nThe label ''gay'' was originally used purely as an [[adjective]] (\"he is a gay man\" or \"he is gay\"). The term has also been in use as a [[noun]] with the meaning \"homosexual man\" since the 1970s, most commonly in the plural for an unspecified group, as in \"gays are opposed to that policy.\" This usage is somewhat common in the names of organizations such as [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays]] (PFLAG) and [[Children of lesbians and gays everywhere|Children of Lesbians And Gays Everywhere]] (COLAGE). It is sometimes used to refer to individuals, as in \"he is a gay\" or \"two gays were there too,\" although this may be perceived as derogatory.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Editors of the American Heritage Dictionaries|title=The American Heritage Book of English Usage|date=1996|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0547563213|page=197|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BEHFyMCdwssC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012014626/https://books.google.de/books?id=BEHFyMCdwssC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197|archive-date=12 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also used for comedic effect by the ''[[Little Britain]]'' character Dafydd Thomas.\n\n==Generalized pejorative use==\nWhen used with a derisive attitude (e.g., \"that was so gay\"), the word ''gay'' is [[pejorative]].

This usage could apply to women too. The British comic strip ''[[Jane (comic strip)|Jane]]'', first published in the 1930s, described the adventures of ''Jane Gay''. Far from implying homosexuality, it referred to her free-wheeling lifestyle with plenty of boyfriends (while also punning on [[Lady Jane Grey]]).\n\nA passage from [[Gertrude Stein]]'s ''Miss Furr & Miss Skeene'' (1922) is possibly the first traceable published use of the word to refer to a homosexual relationship. According to Linda Wagner-Martin (''Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and her Family'', 1995) the portrait \"featured the sly repetition of the word gay, used with sexual intent for one of the first times in linguistic history,\" and [[Edmund Wilson]] (1951, quoted by James Mellow in ''Charmed Circle'', 1974) agreed.<ref>Martha E.

When another character asks about his robe, he responds, \"Because I just went ''gay'' all of a sudden!\" Since this was a mainstream film at a time, when the use of the word to refer to [[cross-dressing]] (and, by extension, homosexuality) would still be unfamiliar to most film-goers, the line can also be interpreted to mean, \"I just decided to do something frivolous.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/bringingupbaby.html|title=Bringing Up Baby|access-date=24 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630103200/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/bringingupbaby.html|archive-date=30 June 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, the earliest reference found to date for the word gay as a self-described name for homosexuals came from Alfred A.

Additionally, none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite society. Consequently, a number of [[euphemism]]s were used to hint at suspected homosexuality. Examples include \"sporty\" girls and \"artistic\" boys,<ref>Cocks, H. A. \"'Sporty' Girls and 'Artistic' Boys: Friendship, Illicit Sex, and the British 'Companionship' Advertisement, 1913\u20131928\", ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' \u2013 Volume 11, Number 3, July 2002, pp. 457\u2013482.</ref> all with the stress deliberately on the otherwise completely innocent adjective.\n\nThe 1960s marked the transition in the predominant meaning of the word ''gay'' from that of \"carefree\" to the current \"homosexual\". In the British comedy-drama film ''[[Light Up the Sky! (film)|Light Up the Sky!]]'' (1960), directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]], about the antics of a British Army searchlight squad during World War II, there is a scene in the mess hut where the character played by [[Benny Hill]] proposes an after-dinner toast. He begins, \"I'd like to propose...\" at which point a fellow diner, played by [[Sidney Tafler]], interjects \"Who to?\", suggesting a proposal of marriage. The Benny Hill character responds, \"Not to you for start, you ain't my type\". He then adds in mock doubt, \"Oh, I don't know, you're rather gay on the quiet.\"\n\nBy 1963, a new sense of the word ''gay'' was known well enough to be used by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] in his book ''The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Man-Hunting''. Similarly, [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]] in his 1964 novel ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'', could write that a character \"took pride in being a homosexual by feeling intellectually and esthetically superior to those (especially women) who weren't gay....\"<ref>Selby, Jr., Hubert \"Last Exit To Brooklyn\" NY: Grove Press, 1988 p. 23 copyright 1964</ref> Later examples of the original meaning of the word being used in popular culture include the theme song to the 1960\u20131966 animated TV series ''[[The Flintstones]]'', whereby viewers are assured that they will \"have a gay old time.\" Similarly, the 1966 [[Herman's Hermits]] song \"[[No Milk Today]]\", which became a Top 10 hit in the UK and a [[Top 40]] hit in the U.S., included the lyric \"No milk today, it was not always so; ''The company was gay'', we'd turn night into day.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/paul/lyrics/hermanshermits/nomilk~1.html|title=The Lyrics Library \u2013 Herman's Hermits \u2013 No Milk Today|access-date=24 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205130619/http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/paul/lyrics/hermanshermits/nomilk~1.html|archive-date=5 December 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1967, the headline of the review of the Beatles' ''[[Sgt.

So, organizations like the National Gay Task Force became the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]]. For many ardent feminist lesbians, it was also important that the ''L'' come first, lest an ''L'' following a ''G'' become another symbol of male dominance over women,<ref>''Lesbian Ethics'', pp. 13\u201321.</ref> although other women prefer the usage ''gay woman''. In the 1990s, this was followed by another equally concerted push to include the terminology specifically pointing out the inclusion of bisexual, [[transgender]], [[intersex]], and other people, reflecting the intra-community debate as to whether these other sexual minorities were part of the same human rights movement. Most news organizations have formally adopted variations of this use, following the example and preference of the organizations, as reflected in their press releases and public communications.\n\n=== Descriptor ===\n[[File:Seattle R Place.jpg|thumb|right| \"R Place\" [[Gay Bar]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, United States.]]\n\nThe term ''gay'' can also be used as an adjective to describe things related to homosexual men, or things which are part of [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|the said culture]]. For example, the term \"gay bar\" describes the bar which either caters primarily to a homosexual male clientele or is otherwise part of homosexual male culture.\n\nUsing it to describe an object, such as an item of clothing, suggests that it is particularly flamboyant, often on the verge of being gaudy and garish. This usage predates the association of the term with homosexuality but has acquired different connotations since the modern usage developed.\n\n{{anchor|noun|Noun}}\n\n=== Use as a noun ===\nThe label ''gay'' was originally used purely as an [[adjective]] (\"he is a gay man\" or \"he is gay\"). The term has also been in use as a [[noun]] with the meaning \"homosexual man\" since the 1970s, most commonly in the plural for an unspecified group, as in \"gays are opposed to that policy.\" This usage is somewhat common in the names of organizations such as [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays]] (PFLAG) and [[Children of lesbians and gays everywhere|Children of Lesbians And Gays Everywhere]] (COLAGE). It is sometimes used to refer to individuals, as in \"he is a gay\" or \"two gays were there too,\" although this may be perceived as derogatory.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Editors of the American Heritage Dictionaries|title=The American Heritage Book of English Usage|date=1996|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0547563213|page=197|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BEHFyMCdwssC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012014626/https://books.google.de/books?id=BEHFyMCdwssC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197|archive-date=12 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also used for comedic effect by the ''[[Little Britain]]'' character Dafydd Thomas.\n\n==Generalized pejorative use==\nWhen used with a derisive attitude (e.g., \"that was so gay\"), the word ''gay'' is [[pejorative]].
