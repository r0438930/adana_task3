'''Impression formation''' in [[social psychology]] refers to the processes by which different pieces of knowledge about another are combined into a global or summary impression. Social Psychologist Solomon Asch was a pioneer in Gestalt Psychology. He is credited with the seminal research on impression formation and conducted research on how individuals integrate information about personality traits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impression Formation, Theories Of|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/estpsychtheory/impression_formation_theories_of|publisher=Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref> Two major theories have been proposed to explain how this process of integration takes place. The Gestalt approach views the formation of a general impression as the sum of several interrelated impressions. As an individual seeks to form a coherent and meaningful impression of another individual, previous impressions significantly influence the interpretation of subsequent information.<ref name=\"HamiltonSherman1996\">{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=David L.|author2=Sherman, Steven J.|title=Perceiving persons and groups|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1996|volume=103|issue=2|pages=336–355|issn=1939-1471|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.336|pmid=8637962}}</ref> In contrast to the Gestalt approach, the cognitive algebra approach asserts that individuals' experiences are combined with previous evaluations to form a constantly changing impression of a person.<ref name=\"Himmelfarb1972\">{{cite journal|last=Himmelfarb|first=Samuel|title=Integration and attribution theories in personality impression formation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1972|volume=23|issue=3|pages=309–313|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/h0033126|pmid=5070314}}</ref> A related area to impression formation is the study of [[person perception]], making [[dispositional attribution]]s, and then adjusting those inferences based on the information available.<ref name=\"GilbertPelham1988\">{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert|first1=Daniel T.|last2=Pelham|first2=Brett W.|last3=Krull|first3=Douglas S.|title=On cognitive busyness: When person perceivers meet persons perceived.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1988|volume=54|issue=5|pages=733–740|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.733}}</ref>

==Methods==
Impression formation has traditionally been studied using three methods pioneered by Asch: [[free response]], [[free association (psychology)|free association]], and a check-list form. In addition, a fourth method based on a [[Likert scale]] with anchors such as “very favorable” and “very unfavorable”, has also been used in recent research.<ref name=\"ReederVonk2004\">{{cite journal|title=Dispositional Attribution: Multiple Inferences About Motive-Related Traits|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2004|volume=86|issue=4|pages=530–544|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.4.530|pmid=15053704|last1=Reeder|first1=Glenn D.|last2=Vonk|first2=Roos|last3=Ronk|first3=Marla J.|last4=Ham|first4=Jaap|last5=Lawrence|first5=Melissa|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.2048}}</ref> A combination of some or all of these techniques is often employed to produce the most accurate assessment of impression formation.

===Free response===
[[Free response]] is an experimental method frequently used in impression formation research. The participant (or perceiver) is presented with a stimulus (usually a short vignette or a list of personality descriptors such as ''assured, talkative, cold,'' etc.) and then instructed to briefly sketch his or her impressions of the type of person described. This is a useful technique for gathering detailed and concrete evidence on the nature of the impression formed. However, the difficulty of accurately coding responses often necessitates the use of additional quantitative measures.<ref name=\"Asch1946\">{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S. E.|date=1 January 1946|title=Forming impressions of personality.|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=258–290|citeseerx=10.1.1.463.2813|doi=10.1037/h0055756|pmid=20995551|issn=0096-851X}}</ref>

===Free association===
Free Association is another commonly used experimental method in which the perceiver creates a list of personality adjectives that immediately come to mind when asked to think about the type of person described by a particular set of descriptor adjectives.

===Check-list===
A check-list consisting of assorted personality descriptors is often used to supplement free response or free association data and to compare group trends.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> After presenting character-qualities of an imagined individual, perceivers are instructed to select the character adjectives from a preset list that best describe the resulting impression. While this produces an easily quantifiable assessment of an impression, it forces participants' answers into a limited, and often extreme, response set.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> However, when used in conjunction with the above-mentioned techniques, check-list data provides useful information about the character of impressions.

===Likert-type rating scales===
With [[Likert scale]]s, perceivers are responding to a presentation of discrete personality characteristics. Common presentation methods include lists of adjectives, photos or videos depicting a scene, or written scenarios.<ref name=\"ReederVonk2004\" /><ref name=Anderson1>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=N.

==Specific results==
===Primacy-recency effect===
Asch stressed the important influence of an individual's initial impressions of a person's personality traits on the interpretation of all subsequent impressions. Asch argued that these early impressions often shaped or colored an individual's perception of other trait-related details.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> A considerable body of research exists supporting this hypothesis.<ref name=DeCoster>{{cite journal|last=DeCoster|first=Jamie|author2=Claypool, Heather M.|title=A Meta-Analysis of Priming Effects on Impression Formation Supporting a General Model of Informational Biases|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=1 February 2004|volume=8|issue=1|pages=2–27|doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0801_1|pmid=15121538}}</ref> For example, when individuals were asked to rate their impression of another person after being presented a list of words progressing from either low favorability to high favorability (L - H) or from high favorability to low favorability (H - L), strong [[primacy effect]]s were found.<ref name=Anderson1 /> In other words, impressions formed from initial descriptor adjectives persisted over time and influenced global impressions. In general, primacy can have three main effects: initial trait-information can be integrated into an individual's global impression of a person in a process of ''[[assimilation effects]],'' it can lead to a durable impression against which other information is compared in a process of ''[[anchoring]],'' and it can cause people to actively change their perception of others in a process of ''correction.''<ref name=DeCoster/>

===Valence===
The emotionality of certain personality traits, such as \"warm\" versus \"cold\" characteristics, can influence how subsequent traits are interpreted and ultimately the type of impression formed.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> Information inconsistent with a person's global impression of another individual is especially prominent in memory. The process of assimilation can lead to causal attributions of personality as this inconsistent information is integrated into the whole.<ref name=Heider>{{cite journal|last=Heider|first=F.|title=Social perception and phenomenal causality.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1944|volume=51|issue=6|pages=358–374|doi=10.1037/h0055425}}</ref> This effect is especially influential when the behavior is perceived as negative. Consistent with [[negativity bias]], negative behaviors are seen as more indicative of an individual's behavior in situations involving moral issues.<ref name=Skowronski /> Extreme negative behavior is also considered more predictive of personality traits than less extreme behavior.<ref name=Skowronski />

==History==
===Classic experiments===
In a classic experiment, [[Solomon Asch]]'s principal theoretical concern revolved around understanding the mechanisms influencing a person's overall impression of others, principally trait centrality and trait [[valence (psychology)|valence]] of various personality characteristics.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> His research illustrated the influential roles of the [[primacy effect]], valence, and [[causal attribution]] on the part of the individual.<ref name=Anderson2>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Norman H.|title=Primacy effects in personality impression formation using a generalized order effect paradigm.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1965|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1037/h0021966|pmid=14313838}}</ref><ref name=\"ReederVonk2004\" /><ref name=Roese /><ref name=Skowronski>{{cite journal|last=Skowronski|first=John J.|author2=Carlston, Donal E.|title=Negativity and extremity biases in impression formation: A review of explanations.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 1989|volume=105|issue=1|pages=131–142|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.1.131}}</ref> Based on the findings of ten experiments studying the effect of various personality adjectives on the resulting quality and character of impressions, several key principles of impression formation have been identified.

1. '''''Individuals have a natural inclination to make global dispositional inferences about the nature of another person's personality.'''''

2. '''''Individuals expect observed behaviors to reflect stable personality traits.'''''

3. '''''Individuals attempt to fit information about different traits and behaviors into a meaningful and coherent whole.'''''

4. '''''Individuals attempt to explain and rationalize inconsistencies when the available information does not fit with the global perception.'''''

Harry Gollob expanded these insights with his subject-verb-object approach to social cognition, and he showed that [[evaluation]]s of sentence subjects could be calculated with high precision from out-of-context evaluations of the subject, verb, and object, with part of the evaluative outcome coming from multiplicative [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] among the input evaluations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gollob|first1=Harry F.|year=1968|title=Impression formation and word combination in sentences |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=341–353 |ref=harv |doi=10.1037/h0026822}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=GOLLOB |first1=H.

Gollob's [[Regression analysis|regression]] equations for predicting impressions of sentence subjects consisted of weighted summations of out-of-context ratings of the subject, verb, and object, and of multiplicative interactions of the ratings. The [[equation]]s essentially supported the cognitive [[algebra]] approach of [[Norman H. Anderson]]'s [[Information integration theory]].<ref>Anderson, Norman H. ''Unified Social Cognition'' (Psychology Press, 2008)</ref> Anderson, however, initiated a heated technical exchange between himself and Gollob,<ref>Anderson, Norman H. (1977). \"Some Problems in Using Analysis of Variance in Balance Theory\" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', '''35''':140–158</ref><ref>Gollob, H. F. (1979). \"A Reply to Norman H. Anderson's Critique of the Subject-Verb-Object Approach to Social Cognition,\" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', '''37''':931–949</ref><ref>Anderson, N.H. (1979).\"Indeterminate Theory: Reply to Gollob,\" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', '''37''':950–952</ref> in which Anderson argued that Gollob's use of the [[general linear model]] led to indeterminate theory because it could not completely account for any particular case in the set of cases used to estimate the models. The recondite exchange typified a continuing debate between proponents of [[contextualism]] who argue that impressions result from situationally specific influences (e.g., from [[semantics]] and [[nonverbal communication]] as well as [[affective science|affective]] factors), and modelers who follow the [[pragmatic maxim]], seeking [[approximation]]s revealing core mental processes. Another issue in using [[least-squares]] estimations is the compounding of [[Observational error|measurement error]] problems with multiplicative variables.<ref>David R. Heise (1986). \"Estimating nonlinear models: Correcting for measurement error.\" ''Sociological Methods & Research'', '''14''': 447–472</ref>

In sociology [[David R. Heise]] relabeled Gollob's framework from subject-verb-object to actor-behavior-object in order to allow for impression formation from perceived events as well as from verbal stimuli, and showed<ref>Heise, David R. (1969). \"Affective dynamics in simple sentences.\" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' '''11''': 204–213</ref><ref>Heise, D. R. (1970). \"Potency dynamics in simple sentences,\" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' '''16''': 48–54</ref> that actions produce impressions of behaviors and objects as well as of actors on all three dimensions of [[Charles E. Osgood]]'s [[semantic differential]]—Evaluation, Potency, and Activity. Heise used equations describing impression-formation processes as the empirical basis for his [[cybernetic]] theory of action, [[Affect control theory]].<ref>Heise, D. R. (1977). \"Social action as the control of affect,\" ''Behavioral Science'' '''22''': 163–177</ref><ref>Heise, D. R. (1979). ''Understanding Events: Affect and the Construction of Social Action'' (Cambridge University Press, 1979); Heise, D. R. ''Expressive Order: Confirming Sentiments in Social Actions'' (Springer, 2007)</ref>

[[Erving Goffman]]'s book ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]''<ref>Goffman, Erving. ''The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life'' (Anchor, 1959)</ref> and his essay \"On Face-work\" in the book ''Interaction Ritual''<ref>Goffman, E. ''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967)</ref> focused on how individuals engage in [[impression management]]. Using the notion of ''face'' as ''[[identity (social science)|identity]]'' is used now, Goffman proposed that individuals maintain face expressively. \"By entering a situation in which he is given a face to maintain, a person takes on the responsibility of standing guard over the flow of events as they pass before him. He must ensure that a particular expressive order is sustained-an order that regulates the flow of events, large or small, so that anything that appears to be expressed by them will be consistent with his face.\"<ref>Goffman, E. ''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967), p. 9</ref> In other words, individuals control events so as to create desired impressions of themselves. Goffman emphasized that individuals in a group operate as a ''[[team]]'' with everyone committed to helping others maintain their identities.<ref>Goffman, E., 1959</ref>

==Impression-formation processes in the US==
Ratings of 515 action descriptions by American respondents yielded estimations of a [[statistical model]] consisting of nine impression-formation equations, predicting outcome Evaluation, Potency, and Activity of actor, behavior, and object from pre-event ratings of the evaluation, potency, and activity of actor, behavior, and object.<ref>[[Maximum likelihood|Maximum-likelihood estimations]] are reported in Smith-Lovin, Lynn. \"Impressions from events,\" pp. 35–70 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>

Stability was a factor in every equation, with some pre-action feeling toward an action element transferred to post-action feeling about the same element. Evaluation, Potency, and Activity of behaviors suffused to actors so impressions of actors were determined in part by the behaviors they performed. In general objects of action lost Potency.

Interactions among variables included consistency effects, such as receiving Evaluative credit for performing a bad behavior toward a bad object person, and congruency effects, such as receiving evaluative credit for nice behaviors toward weak objects or bad behaviors toward powerful objects. Third-order interactions included a balance effect in which actors received a boost in evaluation if two or none of the elements in the action were negative, otherwise a decrement. Across all nine prediction equations, more than half of the 64 possible predictors (first-order variables plus second- Dand third-order interactions) contributed to outcomes.<ref>Impression-formation effects are described in detail by Heise, D. R. ''Expressive Order'', Chapter 6. [[Ordinary least squares]] estimations of equations from the 515-event study, and from studies mentioned below, can be examined in [http://www.indiana.edu/~socpsy/ACT/interact/JavaInteract.html Interact On-Line (Java applet)]</ref>

Studies of event descriptions that explicitly specified [[behavior settings]] found that impression-formation processes are largely the same when settings are salient, but the setting becomes an additional contributor to impression formation regarding actor, behavior, and object; and the action changes the impression of the setting.<ref>Smith-Lovin, Lynn (1979). \"Behavior settings and impressions formed from social scenarios\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''42''': 31–43; Smith-Lovin, L. \"The affective control of events within settings,\" pp. 71–102 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>

Actor and object are the same person in self-directed actions such as \"the lawyer praised himself\" or various kinds of [[self-harm]]. Impression-formation research<ref>Britt, Lory, and D. R. Heise (1992). \"Impressions of self-directed action.\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''55''': 335–350</ref> indicates that self-directed actions reduce the positivity of actors on the Evaluation, Potency, and Activity dimensions. Self-directed actions therefore are not an optimal way to confirm the good, potent, lively identities that people normally want to maintain. Rather self-directed actions are a likely mode of expression for individuals who want to manifest their low [[self-esteem]] and [[self-efficacy]].

Early work on impression formation<ref>Gollob, 1968; Gollob and Rossman, 1973</ref> used action sentences like, \"The kind man praises communists,\" and \"Bill helped the corrupt senator,\" assuming that modifier-noun combinations amalgamate into a functional unit. A later study<ref>Averett, Christine P., and D. R. Heise. \"Modified social identities: Amalgamations, attributions, and emotions,\" pp. 103–132 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref> found that a modifier-noun combination does form an overall impression that works in action descriptions like a noun alone. The action sentences in that study combined identities with status characteristics, [[Trait theory|traits]], [[mood (psychology)|moods]], and [[emotion]]s. Another study<ref>Heise, D. R., and Lisa Thomas (1989). \"Predicting impressions created by combinations of emotion and social identity\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''52''': 141–148.</ref> focused specifically on emotion descriptors combined with identities (e.g., an angry child) and again found that emotion terms amalgamate with identities, and equations describing this kind of amalgamation are of the same form as equations describing trait-identity amalgamation.

==Cross-cultural studies==
Studies of various kinds of impression formation have been conducted in Canada,<ref>MacKinnon, Neil J. (1985/1988/1998). Final Reports to Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada on Projects 410-81-0089, 410-86-0794, and 410-94-0087; Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Guelph.</ref> Japan,<ref>Smith, Herman W., Takanori Matsuno, and Michio Umino (1994). \"How similar are impression-formation processes among Japanese and Americans?\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''57''': 124–139</ref><ref>Smith, H. W. (2002). \"The dynamics of Japanese and American interpersonal events: Behavioral settings versus personality traits\" ''Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' '''26''': 71–92</ref><ref>Smith, H. W. and Linda E. Francis (2005). \"Social versus self-directed events among Japanese and Americans: Self-actualization, emotions, moods, and trait disposition labeling\" ''Social Forces'' '''84''': 821–830.</ref> and Germany.<ref>Schröder, Tobias (2011). \"A Model of Language-Based Impression Formation and Attribution Among Germans\" ''Journal of Language and Social Psychology'' '''30''': 82–102</ref> Core processes are similar cross-culturally. For example, in every culture that has been studied, Evaluation of an actor was determined by-among other things-a stability effect, a suffusion from the behavior Evaluation, and an interaction that rewarded an actor for performing a behavior whose Evaluation was consistent with the Evaluation of the object person.

On the other hand, each culture weighted the core effects distinctively. For example, the impact of behavior-object Evaluation consistency was much smaller in Germany than in the United States, Canada, or Japan, suggesting that [[Morality|moral]] judgments of actors have a somewhat different basis in Germany than in the other cultures. Additionally, impression-formation processes involved some unique interactions in each culture. For example, attribute-identity amalgamations in Germany involved some Potency and Activity interactions that did not appear in other cultures.

A book, ''Surveying Cultures''<ref>Heise, D. R. ''Surveying Cultures: Discovering Shared Conceptions and Sentiments'' (Wiley Interscience, 2010)</ref> reviewed [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural research]] on impression-formation processes, and provided guidelines for conducting impression-formation studies in cultures where the processes are unexplored currently.

== Recent Studies ==
Impression formation is based on the characteristics of both the perceivers and targets. However, research has not been able to quantify the extent to which these two groups contribute to impression. Research was conducted to determine the extent of how impressions originate from ‘our mind’ and ‘target face’. Results demonstrated that perceiver characteristics contribute more than target appearance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=Sally Y.|last2=Flake|first2=Jessica K.|last3=Hehman|first3=Eric|date=August 2019|title=Perceiver and target characteristics contribute to impression formation differently across race and gender.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=117|issue=2|pages=364–385|doi=10.1037/pspi0000160|pmid=30550328|issn=1939-1315|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2ac7512497a2289f7fc543d39eb5eec7d48468a9}}</ref> Impressions can be made from facial appearance alone and assessments on attributes such as nice, strong, and smart based on variations of the targets’ face.

'''Impression formation''' in [[social psychology]] refers to the processes by which different pieces of knowledge about another are combined into a global or summary impression. Social Psychologist Solomon Asch was a pioneer in Gestalt Psychology. He is credited with the seminal research on impression formation and conducted research on how individuals integrate information about personality traits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impression Formation, Theories Of|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/estpsychtheory/impression_formation_theories_of|publisher=Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref> Two major theories have been proposed to explain how this process of integration takes place. The Gestalt approach views the formation of a general impression as the sum of several interrelated impressions. As an individual seeks to form a coherent and meaningful impression of another individual, previous impressions significantly influence the interpretation of subsequent information.<ref name=\"HamiltonSherman1996\">{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=David L.|author2=Sherman, Steven J.|title=Perceiving persons and groups|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1996|volume=103|issue=2|pages=336–355|issn=1939-1471|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.336|pmid=8637962}}</ref> In contrast to the Gestalt approach, the cognitive algebra approach asserts that individuals' experiences are combined with previous evaluations to form a constantly changing impression of a person.<ref name=\"Himmelfarb1972\">{{cite journal|last=Himmelfarb|first=Samuel|title=Integration and attribution theories in personality impression formation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1972|volume=23|issue=3|pages=309–313|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/h0033126|pmid=5070314}}</ref> A related area to impression formation is the study of [[person perception]], making [[dispositional attribution]]s, and then adjusting those inferences based on the information available.<ref name=\"GilbertPelham1988\">{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert|first1=Daniel T.|last2=Pelham|first2=Brett W.|last3=Krull|first3=Douglas S.|title=On cognitive busyness: When person perceivers meet persons perceived.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1988|volume=54|issue=5|pages=733–740|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.733}}</ref>

==Methods==
Impression formation has traditionally been studied using three methods pioneered by Asch: [[free response]], [[free association (psychology)|free association]], and a check-list form. In addition, a fourth method based on a [[Likert scale]] with anchors such as “very favorable” and “very unfavorable”, has also been used in recent research.<ref name=\"ReederVonk2004\">{{cite journal|title=Dispositional Attribution: Multiple Inferences About Motive-Related Traits|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2004|volume=86|issue=4|pages=530–544|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.4.530|pmid=15053704|last1=Reeder|first1=Glenn D.|last2=Vonk|first2=Roos|last3=Ronk|first3=Marla J.|last4=Ham|first4=Jaap|last5=Lawrence|first5=Melissa|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.2048}}</ref> A combination of some or all of these techniques is often employed to produce the most accurate assessment of impression formation.

===Free response===
[[Free response]] is an experimental method frequently used in impression formation research. The participant (or perceiver) is presented with a stimulus (usually a short vignette or a list of personality descriptors such as ''assured, talkative, cold,'' etc.) and then instructed to briefly sketch his or her impressions of the type of person described. This is a useful technique for gathering detailed and concrete evidence on the natur of the impression formed. However, the difficulty of accurately coding responses often necessitates the use of additional quantitative measures.<ref name=\"Asch1946\">{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S. E.|date=1 January 1946|title=Forming impressions of personality.|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=258–290|citeseerx=10.1.1.463.2813|doi=10.1037/h0055756|pmid=20995551|issn=0096-851X}}</ref>

===Free association===
Free Association is another commonly used experimental method in which the perceiver creates a list of personality adjectives that immediately come to mind when asked to think about the type of person described by a particular set of descriptor adjectives.

===Check-list===
A check-list consisting of assorted personality descriptors is often used to supplement free response or free association data and to compare group trends.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> After presenting character-qualities of an imagined individual, perceivers are instructed to select the character adjectives from a preset list that best describe the resulting impression. While this produces an easily quantifiable assessment of an impression, it forces participants' answers into a limited, and often extreme, response set.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> However, when used in conjunction with the above-mentioned techniques, check-list data provides useful information about the character of impressions.

===Likert-type rating scales===
With [[Likert scale]]s, perceivers are responding to a presentation of discrete personality characteristics. Common presentation methods include lists of adjectives, photos or videos depicting a scene, or written scenarios.<ref name=\"ReederVonk2004\" /><ref name=Anderson1>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=N.

==Specific results==
===Primacy-recency effect===
Asch stressed the important influence of an individual's initial impressions of a person's personality traits on the interpretation of all subsequent impressions. Asch argued that these early impressions often shaped or colored an individual's perception of other trait-related details.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> A considerable body of research exists supporting this hypothesis.<ref name=DeCoster>{{cite journal|last=DeCoster|first=Jamie|author2=Claypool, Heather M.|title=A Meta-Analysis of Priming Effects on Impression Formation Supporting a General Model of Informational Biases|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=1 February 2004|volume=8|issue=1|pages=2–27|doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0801_1|pmid=15121538}}</ref> For example, when individuals were asked to rate their impression of another person after being presented a list of words progressing from either low favorability to high favorability (L - H) or from high favorability to low favorability (H - L), strong [[primacy effect]]s were found.<ref name=Anderson1 /> In other words, impressions formed from initial descriptor adjectives persisted over time and influenced global impressions. In general, primacy can have three main effects: initial trait-information can be integrated into an individual's global impression of a person in a process of ''[[assimilation effects]],'' it can lead to a durable impression against which other information is compared in a process of ''[[anchoring]],'' and it can cause people to actively change their perception of others in a process of ''correction.''<ref name=DeCoster/>

===Valence===
The emotionality of certain personality traits, such as \"warm\" versus \"cold\" characteristics, can influence how subsequent traits are interpreted and ultimately the type of impression formed.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> Information inconsistent with a person's global impression of another individual is especially prominent in memory. The process of assimilation can lead to causal attributions of personality as this inconsistent information is integrated into the whole.<ref name=Heider>{{cite journal|last=Heider|first=F.|title=Social perception and phenomenal causality.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1944|volume=51|issue=6|pages=358–374|doi=10.1037/h0055425}}</ref> This effect is especially influential when the behavior is perceived as negative. Consistent with [[negativity bias]], negative behaviors are seen as more indicative of an individual's behavior in situations involving moral issues.<ref name=Skowronski /> Extreme negative behavior is also considered more predictive of personality traits than less extreme behavior.<ref name=Skowronski />

==History==
===Classic experiments===
In a classic experiment, [[Solomon Asch]]'s principal theoretical concern revolved around understanding the mechanisms influencing a person's overall impression of others, principally trait centrality and trait [[valence (psychology)|valence]] of various personality characteristics.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> His research illustrated the influential roles of the [[primacy effect]], valence, and [[causal attribution]] on the part of the individual.<ref name=Anderson2>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Norman H.|title=Primacy effects in personality impression formation using a generalized order effect paradigm.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1965|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1037/h0021966|pmid=14313838}}</ref><ref name=\"ReederVonk2004\" /><ref name=Roese /><ref name=Skowronski>{{cite journal|last=Skowronski|first=John J.|author2=Carlston, Donal E.|title=Negativity and extremity biases in impression formation: A review of explanations.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 1989|volume=105|issue=1|pages=131–142|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.1.131}}</ref> Based on the findings of ten experiments studying the effect of various personality adjectives on the resulting quality and character of impressions, several key principles of impression formation have been identified.

1. '''''Individuals have a natural inclination to make global dispositional inferences about the nature of another person's personality.'''''

2. '''''Individuals expect observed behaviors to reflect stable personality traits.'''''

3. '''''Individuals attempt to fit information about different traits and behaviors into a meaningful and coherent whole.'''''

4. '''''Individuals attempt to explain and rationalize inconsistencies when the available information does not fit with the global perception.'''''

Harry Gollob expanded these insights with his subject-verb-object approach to social cognition, and he showed that [[evaluation]]s of sentence subjects could be calculated with high precision from out-of-context evaluations of the subject, verb, and object, with part of the evaluative outcome coming from multiplicative [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] among the input evaluations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gollob|first1=Harry F.|year=1968|title=Impression formation and word combination in sentences |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=341–353 |ref=harv |doi=10.1037/h0026822}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=GOLLOB |first1=H.

Gollob's [[Regression analysis|regression]] equations for predicting impressions of sentence subjects consisted of weighted summations of out-of-context ratings of the subject, verb, and object, and of multiplicative interactions of the ratings. The [[equation]]s essentially supported the cognitive [[algebra]] approach of [[Norman H. Anderson]]'s [[Information integration theory]].<ref>Anderson, Norman H. ''Unified Social Cognition'' (Psychology Press, 2008)</ref> Anderson, however, initiated a heated technical exchange between himself and Gollob,<ref>Anderson, Norman H. (1977). \"Some Problems in Using Analysis of Variance in Balance Theory\" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', '''35''':140–158</ref><ref>Gollob, H. F. (1979). \"A Reply to Norman H.

(1979).\"Indeterminate Theory: Reply to Gollob,\" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', '''37''':950–952</ref> in which Anderson argued that Gollob's use of the [[general linear model]] led to indeterminate theory because it could not completely account for any particular case in the set of cases used to estimate the models. The recondite exchange typified a continuing debate between proponents of [[contextualism]] who argue that impressions result from situationally specific influences (e.g., from [[semantics]] and [[nonverbal communication]] as well as [[affective science|affective]] factors), and modelers who follow the [[pragmatic maxim]], seeking [[approximation]]s revealing core mental processes. Another issue in using [[least-squares]] estimations is the compounding of [[Observational error|measurement error]] problems with multiplicative variables.<ref>David R. Heise (1986). \"Estimating nonlinear models: Correcting for measurement error.\" ''Sociological Methods & Research'', '''14''': 447–472</ref>

In sociology [[David R. Heise]] relabeled Gollob's framework from subject-verb-object to actor-behavior-object in order to allow for impression formation from perceived events as well as from verbal stimuli, and showed<ref>Heise, David R.

(1970). \"Potency dynamics in simple sentences,\" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' '''16''': 48–54</ref> that actions produce impressions of behaviors and objects as well as of actors on all three dimensions of [[Charles E. Osgood]]'s [[semantic differential]]—Evaluation, Potency, and Activity. Heise used equations describing impression-formation processes as the empirical basis for his [[cybernetic]] theory of action, [[Affect control theory]].<ref>Heise, D. R.

''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967)</ref> focused on how individuals engage in [[impression management]]. Using the notion of ''face'' as ''[[identity (social science)|identity]]'' is used now, Goffman proposed that individuals maintain face expressively. \"By entering a situation in which he is given a face to maintain, a person takes on the responsibility of standing guard over the flow of events as they pass before him. He must ensure that a particular expressive order is sustained-an order that regulates the flow of events, large or small, so that anything that appears to be expressed by them will be consistent with his face.\"<ref>Goffman, E. ''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967), p. 9</ref> In other words, individuals control events so as to create desired impressions of themselves. Goffman emphasized that individuals in a group operate as a ''[[team]]'' with everyone committed to helping others maintain their identities.<ref>Goffman, E., 1959</ref>

==Impression-formation processes in the US==
Ratings of 515 action descriptions by American respondents yielded estimations of a [[statistical model]] consisting of nine impression-formation equations, predicting outcome Evaluation, Potency, and Activity of actor, behavior, and object from pre-event ratings of the evaluation, potency, and activity of actor, behavior, and object.<ref>[[Maximum likelihood|Maximum-likelihood estimations]] are reported in Smith-Lovin, Lynn. \"Impressions from events,\" pp. 35–70 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>

Stability was a factor in every equation, with some pre-action feeling toward an action element transferred to post-action feeling about the same element. Evaluation, Potency, and Activity of behaviors suffused to actors so impressions of actors were determined in part by the behaviors they performed. In general objects of action lost Potency.

Interactions among variables included consistency effects, such as receiving Evaluative credit for performing a bad behavior toward a bad object person, and congruency effects, such as receiving evaluative credit for nice behaviors toward weak objects or bad behaviors toward powerful objects. Third-order interactions included a balance effect in which actors received a boost in evaluation if two or none of the elements in the action were negative, otherwise a decrement. Across all nine prediction equations, more than half of the 64 possible predictors (first-order variables plus second- Dand third-order interactions) contributed to outcomes.<ref>Impression-formation effects are described in detail by Heise, D. R. ''Expressive Order'', Chapter 6. [[Ordinary least squares]] estimations of equations from the 515-event study, and from studies mentioned below, can be examined in [http://www.indiana.edu/~socpsy/ACT/interact/JavaInteract.html Interact On-Line (Java applet)]</ref>

Studies of event descriptions that explicitly specified [[behavior settings]] found that impression-formation processes are largely the same when settings are salient, but the setting becomes an additional contributor to impression formation regarding actor, behavior, and object; and the action changes the impression of the setting.<ref>Smith-Lovin, Lynn (1979). \"Behavior settings and impressions formed from social scenarios\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''42''': 31–43; Smith-Lovin, L. \"The affective control of events within settings,\" pp. 71–102 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>

Actor and object are the same person in self-directed actions such as \"the lawyer praised himself\" or various kinds of [[self-harm]]. Impression-formation research<ref>Britt, Lory, and D. R. Heise (1992). \"Impressions of self-directed action.\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''55''': 335–350</ref> indicates that self-directed actions reduce the positivity of actors on the Evaluation, Potency, and Activity dimensions. Self-directed actions therefore are not an optimal way to confirm the good, potent, lively identities that people normally want to maintain. Rather self-directed actions are a likely mode of expression for individuals who want to manifest their low [[self-esteem]] and [[self-efficacy]].

Early work on impression formation<ref>Gollob, 1968; Gollob and Rossman, 1973</ref> used action sentences like, \"The kind man praises communists,\" and \"Bill helped the corrupt senator,\" assuming that modifier-noun combinations amalgamate into a functional unit. A later study<ref>Averett, Christine P., and D. R. Heise. \"Modified social identities: Amalgamations, attributions, and emotions,\" pp. 103–132 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref> found that a modifier-noun combination does form an overall impression that works in action descriptions like a noun alone. The action sentences in that study combined identities with status characteristics, [[Trait theory|traits]], [[mood (psychology)|moods]], and [[emotion]]s. Another study<ref>Heise, D. R., and Lisa Thomas (1989). \"Predicting impressions created by combinations of emotion and social identity\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''52''': 141–148.</ref> focused specifically on emotion descriptors combined with identities (e.g., an angry child) and again found that emotion terms amalgamate with identities, and equations describing this kind of amalgamation are of the same form as equations describing trait-identity amalgamation.

==Cross-cultural studies==
Studies of various kinds of impression formation have been conducted in Canada,<ref>MacKinnon, Neil J. (1985/1988/1998). Final Reports to Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada on Projects 410-81-0089, 410-86-0794, and 410-94-0087; Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Guelph.</ref> Japan,<ref>Smith, Herman W., Takanori Matsuno, and Michio Umino (1994). \"How similar are impression-formation processes among Japanese and Americans?\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''57''': 124–139</ref><ref>Smith, H. W. (2002). \"The dynamics of Japanese and American interpersonal events: Behavioral settings versus personality traits\" ''Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' '''26''': 71–92</ref><ref>Smith, H. W. and Linda E. Francis (2005). \"Social versus self-directed events among Japanese and Americans: Self-actualization, emotions, moods, and trait disposition labeling\" ''Social Forces'' '''84''': 821–830.</ref> and Germany.<ref>Schröder, Tobias (2011). \"A Model of Language-Based Impression Formation and Attribution Among Germans\" ''Journal of Language and Social Psychology'' '''30''': 82–102</ref> Core processes are similar cross-culturally. For example, in every culture that has been studied, Evaluation of an actor was determined by-among other things-a stability effect, a suffusion from the behavior Evaluation, and an interaction that rewarded an actor for performing a behavior whose Evaluation was consistent with the Evaluation of the object person.

On the other hand, each culture weighted the core effects distinctively. For example, the impact of behavior-object Evaluation consistency was much smaller in Germany than in the United States, Canada, or Japan, suggesting that [[Morality|moral]] judgments of actors have a somewhat different basis in Germany than in the other cultures. Additionally, impression-formation processes involved some unique interactions in each culture. For example, attribute-identity amalgamations in Germany involved some Potency and Activity interactions that did not appear in other cultures.

A book, ''Surveying Cultures''<ref>Heise, D. R. ''Surveying Cultures: Discovering Shared Conceptions and Sentiments'' (Wiley Interscience, 2010)</ref> reviewed [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural research]] on impression-formation processes, and provided guidelines for conducting impression-formation studies in cultures where the processes are unexplored currently.

== Recent Studies ==
Impression formation is based on the characteristics of both the perceivers and targets. However, research has not been able to quantify the extent to which these two groups contribute to impression. Research was conducted to determine the extent of how impressions originate from ‘our mind’ and ‘target face’. Results demonstrated that perceiver characteristics contribute more than target appearance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=Sally Y.|last2=Flake|first2=Jessica K.|last3=Hehman|first3=Eric|date=August 2019|title=Perceiver and target characteristics contribute to impression formation differently across race and gender.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=117|issue=2|pages=364–385|doi=10.1037/pspi0000160|pmid=30550328|issn=1939-1315|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2ac7512497a2289f7fc543d39eb5eec7d48468a9}}</ref> Impressions can be made from facial appearance alone and assessments on attributes such as nice, strong, and smart based on variations of the targets’ face.

[[File:Cassaroli-1984-treaty.jpg|thumb|300px|Signing of the agreement in Rome: Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Dante Caputo]] (left); Agostino Casaroli (middle); Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaime del Valle (right)]]

The '''Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict''' followed the failure of [[Direct negotiations between Chile and Argentina in 1977–1978|negotiations between Chile and Argentina]], when, on 22 December 1978, the Argentinian [[Military dictatorship|Junta]] started [[Operation Soberanía]], to invade [[Cape Horn]] and islands awarded to Chile by the [[Beagle Channel Arbitration]]. Soon after the event, [[Pope John Paul II]] offered to [[mediation|mediate]] and sent his personal envoy, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Antonio Samoré]], to [[Buenos Aires]]. Argentina, in acceptance of the authority of the Pope over the overwhelmingly Catholic Argentine population, called off the military operation and accepted the mediation. On 9 January 1979, Chile and Argentina signed the [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1979AM.PDF Act of Montevideo] formally requesting mediation by the Vatican and renouncing the use of force.

== Interests of the parties ==
{{Main|Beagle conflict#Interests of the parties|l1=Interests of the parties}}
The mediator acted to defuse the situation by negotiating an agreement that stopped the immediate military crisis. Then the Vatican crafted a six-year process that allowed the parties to grapple with increasingly difficult issues, including navigation rights, sovereignty over other islands in the [[Fuegian Archipelago]], [[delimitation]] of the [[Straits of Magellan]], and maritime boundaries south to [[Cape Horn]] and beyond.
* Chile considered the Arbitral Award of 1977 \"…fully operative and obligatory in law…\" as expressed by the Court of Arbitration after the Argentine Refusal.<ref>See \"Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit\", Karin Oellers-Frahm, Page 353</ref>
* Argentina repudiated the International Arbitral Award that the government of [[Alejandro Lanusse]] had solicited in 1971.
* Argentina extended its claim to all territories southward of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and eastward of the Cape Horn-[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. That is, Argentina claimed the islands Horn, Wollastone, Deceit, Barnevelt, Evouts, Herschell, etc.

The 1978 military mobilization revealed other latent international relations issues between the two countries that had been previously overlooked or ignored.

== Mediator ==
By the beginning of November 1978, Chile and Argentina no longer had any mechanism for working toward a peaceful settlement and the situation began to destabilize rapidly. It was at this point, with direct talks dead and a judicial settlement refused by Argentina, that Chile suggested mediation. Argentina accepted the proposal and the two foreign ministers agreed to meet in Buenos Aires on 12 December for the purpose of selecting a mediator and the terms of mediation. Possible candidates were<ref>See Alejandro Luis Corbacho: Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts, Universidad del CEMA, Argentina, Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, page 8</ref>
* [[Jimmy Carter]], [[President of the United States of America]],
* the [[Organization of American States]],
* [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[King of Spain]],
* a European president,
* Pope John Paul II.
The ministers concurred on the issue that the Pope should mediate the dispute, but their agreement proved ephemeral. In the evening, as the Chilean delegation was studying the documents for signature, the Argentine minister called the Chilean minister Cubillos to tell him that President Videla, who had approved their choice of mediator, had been stripped of his authority by the junta.

On 22 December 1978, Argentina launched [[Operation Soberania]] to occupy the islands militarily. On the morning of 22 December, Pope John Paul II, on his own initiative, contacted both governments directly to communicate that he was sending a personal envoy to Buenos Aires and Santiago.

== The Act of Montevideo ==
In [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], on 8 January 1979, both countries signed the Act of Montevideo. In this treaty the parties agreed to:
* no restrictions whatsoever over the mediation (textual: ''«…they will raise no objection to the expression by the Holy See, during these proceedings, of such ideas as its thorough studies on a disputed aspects of the problem of the southern zone may suggest to it, with a view to contributing to a peaceful settlement acceptable to both Parties…»'')
* ''«…Antonio Cardinal Samoré … asks that that request ''[of mediation]'' should be accompanied by an undertaking that the two States will not resort to the use of force in their mutual relations, will bring about a gradual return to the military situation existing at the beginning of 1977 and will refrain from adopting measures that might impair harmony in any sector.…»''.

The treaty gave the mediator a broad framework in which to negotiate without any geographical data or temporal restrictions.

== The four phases of the mediation ==
Mark Laudy<ref>Mark Laudy, \"The Vatican Mediation of the Beagle Channel Dispute: Crisis Intervention and Forum Building\" {{cite web |url=http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/words/11.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-29 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529153631/http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/words/11.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-29 |df= }}</ref> sees four phases during the mediation:
* The first phase was the shortest and most critical period of the entire mediation and began with Samorè's arrival in Buenos Aires on 25 December 1978. This was purely a crisis intervention to prevent a war and secure an agreement to submit the matter to mediation. In a shuttle diplomacy, Samorè flew between [[Santiago de Chile]] and Buenos Aires until the objectives were achieved with the signing of the Act of Montevideo on 8 January 1979.
* The second period ran from May 1979, when the Chilean and Argentine delegations arrived in Rome, through December 1980, when the Pope presented the parties with his proposal for settling the dispute. This first proposal was rejected by Argentina.
* The third and longest phase, running from the beginning of 1981 until December 1983, after Argentina's return to democracy, was characterized by long periods of stalled negotiations. The most significant developments during this period were the Argentine repudiation of the 1972 General Treaty; the subsequent effort to fill the juridical vacuum resulting from that repudiation; and the [[Falklands war]], which set the stage for the return to democracy in Argentina.
* The final phase began when [[Raúl Alfonsín]] assumed the presidency in Buenos Aires at the end of 1983 and ended with the signing of the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.

== The papal proposal of 1980 ==
[[File:Pope1980prop.png|thumb|200px|right|The papal proposal of 1980.]]
On 12 December 1980, the Pope received both delegations and communicated to them his proposal for resolving the controversy, the terms of which had been developed entirely in secret and should be kept secret in order to avoid debilitating public debate that might diminish confidence in the proceedings and limit the freedom of action of both governments. But on 22 August 1981 the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Nación]]'' published the terms of the proposal. Chile would retain all of the islands and Argentina would be entitled to maintain certain limited facilities (common radar and weather stations) on some islands and would receive important navigation rights. Most important, however, was the creation of an ocean area known as the Sea of Peace. In this area, extending to the east and southeast from the disputed chain of islands, Chilean territorial waters would be limited to a narrow territorial sea, in which it would be obliged to share with Argentina equal participation in resource exploitation, scientific investigation, and environmental management. Beyond the Chilean territorial waters would be a much broader band of ocean subject to Argentine jurisdiction, but also subject to the same sharing provisions that applied in Chilean waters.

Chile accepted the papal proposal, despite some reservations. Argentina never formally replied to the proposal. However, on 17 March 1981, Argentina delivered a note to the Vatican expressing grave misgivings about the proposal, both because it failed to award any islands to Argentina and because it allowed Chile to maintain a presence so far into the Atlantic.

== Argentina renounced a 1972 Arbitration treaty ==
On 21 January 1982, Argentina announced the withdrawal from the 1972 bilateral treaty providing for recourse to the [[International Court of Justice]] in case of disputes. In Argentina, the judicial process had become an [[anathema]], particularly in view of the adverse 1977 arbitration award.<ref>See Michael Morris, \"The Strait of Magellan\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, page 85</ref> Chile reserved the right to go to the ICJ unilaterally before the treaty ended on 27 December 1982.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Argentina/denuncia/tratado/Chile/Beagle/elpepiint/19820123elpepiint_13/Tes Argentina denuncia el tratado con Chile sobre el Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' on 23 January 1982 (in Spanish).</ref>

== To the Falklands war ==
After the papal proposal, negotiations remained stalled and meanwhile, a sequence of incidents in Chile and Argentina strained relations between the two countries.

On 28 April 1981, General [[Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri]] (then Argentine army chief; later, during the Falklands war, President of Argentina) closed the border to Chile without any consultation with his own president.<ref>See article [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00801e.htm Historia de la santa mediación] in Argentine newspaper ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', Buenos Aires, on 20 December 1998: «Me calenté, se justificó Galtieri ante el fastidiado comandante de la Marina, almirante Lambruschini, quien le preguntó: Pero se da usted cuenta que el país se encuentra así envuelto en una peligrosa escalada?»'' (Translation; I lost my cool, justify himself Galtieri, as the annoyed Chief of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Lambruschini, asked him: Don't you notice that it bring the country in a dangerous escalation?)</ref>

In March 1982, five weeks before the beginning of the Falklands war, a ship of the Argentine navy, [[USS Luiseno (ATF-156)|''ARA Francisco de Gurruchaga'']], anchored at the [[Cape Horn|Deceit island]], ''[[de facto]]'' under Chilean sovereignty since 1881, and refused to abandon the bay, despite Chilean demands.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/CANAL_DE_BEAGLE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Pinochet/ordena/acuartelamiento/tropas/chilenas/conflicto/Argentina/canal/Beagle/elpepiint/19820306elpepiint_4/Tes Pinochet ordena el acuartelamiento de las tropas chilenas por el conflicto con Argentina sobre el canal de Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' on 6 March 1982 (in Spanish).</ref><ref>William Ben Hunt, ''Getting to war: predicting international conflict with mass media indicators'', page 22</ref>

On 2 April 1982, Argentina [[Falklands War|invaded the Falkland Islands]]. The Argentine plan included indeed the military occupation of the disputed islands at the Beagle channel after the invasion of the Falklands, as stated by Brigadier [[Basilio Lami Dozo]], chief of the Argentine Air Force during the Falklands war, in an interview with the Argentine magazine [[Perfil]]: L.F. Galtieri: \"[Chile] have to know that what we are doing now, because they will be the next in turn.\"<ref>Argentine magazine [http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&ed=0420 Perfil] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125142325/http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&ed=0420 |date=2009-11-25 }} on 22 November 2009:

That was the determination of the [Argentine] navy…\".<ref>Editorial Planeta, Buenos Aires, 1999, page 281''«Los planes militares eran, en la hipótesis de resolver el caso Malvinas, invadir las islas en disputa en el Beagle.

Argentine General Osiris Villegas, first chief of the Argentine delegation in Rom asked to stop negotiations with Chile and to seize the islands in April 1982, after the seize of the Falklands. In his book ''La propuesta pontificia y el espacio nacional comprometido'', page 2, he called to:
:''no persistir en una diplomacia bilateral que durante años la ha inhibido para efectuar actos de posesión efectiva en las islas en litigio que son los hechos reales que garantizan el establecimiento de una soberanía usurpada y la preservación de la integridad del territorio nacional''. (cited in ''A treinta años de la crisis del Beagle, Desarrollo de un modelo de negociación en la resolución del conflicto'' by Renato Valenzuela Ugarte and Fernando García Toso, in Chilean Magazine \"Política y Estrategia\", nr. 115)</ref> Pope John Paul II made an unscheduled visit to Buenos Aires on 14 June 1982, in an attempt to prevent further hostilities between Britain and Argentina.

Chile became the only major Latin American country to support Britain indirectly by providing a military and naval diversion, but \"in private many [Latin American] governments were pleased with the outcome of the war\".<ref>See K.J. Holsti, \"The state, war, and the state of war\", page 176</ref>

== The final phase ==
After the war, yet despite the renewal of the 1972 Treaty on 15 September 1982, the distension after ARA-Gurruchaga incident and the spy-exchanging, the mediation continued to move very slowly. Following the war Chile evinced a greater willingness to negotiate modifications to the papal proposal, but by then it had become clear that the Argentine junta, reeling from its defeat in the war, was too weak to achieve an agreement.

Cardinal Antonio Samorè died in Rome at age 77, in February 1983.

President [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s new government was firmly committed to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible. Based on this commitment and additional discussions, the parties were able to lay much of the groundwork for a settlement.

In April 1984, [[Vatican Secretary of State]] [[Agostino Casaroli]] asked separately the two delegations for their proposals for a final solution.

By October 1984, both countries reached a complete understanding, and the revised text of the treaty was finalized on 18 October.

Chile accepted, again, the papal proposal. In Argentina, Alfonsin held a consultative [[referendum]]. The official returns showed 10,391,019 voted in favor of the proposed treaty while 2,105,663 opposed it, a margin of 82 percent to 16 percent opposed, with 2 percent casting blank or null ballots.<ref>See article [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE7D61638F935A15752C1A962948260 Beagle Channel Treaty Approved in Argentina] in USA-newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 26 November 1984</ref>

The [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] went a long way before enacted:
* on 30 December 1984, the treaty passed the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]];
* on 15 March 1985, the treaty passed the [[Argentine Senate]];
* on 16 March 1985, the treaty was signed by representative of the [[President of Argentina]], who was abroad;
* on 11 April 1985, the treaty passed the Chilean [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|junta]];
* on 12 April 1985, the treaty was signed by [[Augusto Pinochet]];
* on 2 May 1985, both ministers exchanged instruments.

==Aftermath==
The [[Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass]] crossing border was renamed to honour the special representative of Pope John Paul II.

The '''Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict''' followed the failure of [[Direct negotiations between Chile and Argentina in 1977–1978|negotiations between Chile and Argentina]], when, on 22 December 1978, the Argentinian [[Military dictatorship|Junta]] started [[Operation Soberanía]], to invade [[Cape Horn]] and islands awarded to Chile by the [[Beagle Channel Arbitration]]. Soon after the event, [[Pope John Paul II]] offered to [[mediation|mediate]] and sent his personal envoy, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Antonio Samoré]], to [[Buenos Aires]]. Argentina, in acceptance of the authority of the Pope over the overwhelmingly Catholic Argentine population, called off the military operation and accepted the mediation. On 9 January 1979, Chile and Argentina signed the [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1979AM.PDF Act of Montevideo] formally requesting mediation by the Vatican and renouncing the use of force.

== Interests of the parties ==
{{Main|Beagle conflict#Interests of the parties|l1=Interests of the parties}}
The mediator acted to defuse the situation by negotiating an agreement that stopped the immediate military crisis. Then, the Vatican crafted a six-year process that allowed the parties to grapple with increasingly difficult issues, including navigation rights, sovereignty over other islands in the [[Fuegian Archipelago]], [[delimitation]] of the [[Straits of Magellan]], and maritime boundaries south to [[Cape Horn]] and beyond.
* Chile considered the Arbitral Award of 1977 \"…fully operative and obligatory in law…\" as expressed by the Court of Arbitration after the Argentine Refusal.<ref>See \"Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit\", Karin Oellers-Frahm, Page 353</ref>
* Argentina repudiated the International Arbitral Award that the government of [[Alejandro Lanusse]] had solicited in 1971.
* Argentina extended its claim to all territories southward of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and eastward of the Cape Horn-[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. That is, Argentina claimed the islands Horn, Wollastone, Deceit, Barnevelt, Evouts, Herschell, etc.

The 1978 military mobilization revealed other latent international relations issues between the two countries that had been previously overlooked or ignored.

== Mediator ==
By the beginning of November 1978, Chile and Argentina no longer had any mechanism for working toward a peaceful settlement and the situation began to destabilize rapidly. It was at this point, with direct talks dead and a judicial settlement refused by Argentina, that Chile suggested mediation. Argentina accepted the proposal and the two foreign ministers agreed to meet in Buenos Aires on 12 December for the purpose of selecting a mediator and the terms of mediation. Possible candidates were<ref>See Alejandro Luis Corbacho: Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts, Universidad del CEMA, Argentina, Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, page 8</ref>
* [[Jimmy Carter]], [[President of the United States of America]],
* the [[Organization of American States]],
* [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[King of Spain]],
* a European president,
* Pope John Paul II.
The ministers concurred on the issue that the Pope should mediate the dispute, but their agreement proved ephemeral. In the evening, as the Chilean delegation was studying the documents for signature, the Argentine minister called the Chilean minister Cubillos to tell him that President Videla, who had approved their choice of mediator, had been stripped of his authority by the junta.

On 22 December 1978, Argentina launched [[Operation Soberania]] to occupy the islands militarily. On the morning of 22 December, Pope John Paul II, on his own initiative, contacted both governments directly to communicate that he was sending a personal envoy to Buenos Aires and Santiago.

== The Act of Montevideo ==
In [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], on 8 January 1979, both countries signed the Act of Montevideo. In this treaty the parties agreed to:
* no restrictions whatsoever over the mediation (textual: ''«…they will raise no objection to the expression by the Holy See, during these proceedings, of such ideas as its thorough studies on a disputed aspects of the problem of the southern zone may suggest to it, with a view to contributing to a peaceful settlement acceptable to both Parties…»'')
* ''«…Antonio Cardinal Samoré … asks that that request ''[of mediation]'' should be accompanied by an undertaking that the two States will not resort to the use of force in their mutual relations, will bring about a gradual return to the military situation existing at the beginning of 1977 and will refrain from adopting measures that might impair harmony in any sector.…»''.

The treaty gave the mediator a broad framework in which to negotiate without any geographical data or temporal restrictions.

== The four phases of the mediation ==
Mark Laudy<ref>Mark Laudy, \"The Vatican Mediation of the Beagle Channel Dispute: Crisis Intervention and Forum Building\" {{cite web |url=http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/words/11.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-29 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529153631/http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/words/11.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-29 |df= }}</ref> sees four phases during the mediation:
* The first phase was the shortest and most critical period of the entire mediation and began with Samorè's arrival in Buenos Aires on 25 December 1978. This was purely a crisis intervention to prevent a war and secure an agreement to submit the matter to mediation. In a shuttle diplomacy, Samorè flew between [[Santiago de Chile]] and Buenos Aires until the objectives were achieved with the signing of the Act of Montevideo on 8 January 1979.
* The second period ran from May 1979, when the Chilean and Argentine delegations arrived in Rome, through December 1980, when the Pope presented the parties with his proposal for settling the dispute. This first proposal was rejected by Argentina.
* The third and longest phase, running from the beginning of 1981 until December 1983, after Argentina's return to democracy, was characterized by long periods of stalled negotiations. The most significant developments during this period were the Argentine repudiation of the 1972 General Treaty; the subsequent effort to fill the juridical vacuum resulting from that repudiation; and the [[Falklands war]], which set the stage for the return to democracy in Argentina.
* The final phase began when [[Raúl Alfonsín]] assumed the presidency in Buenos Aires at the end of 1983 and ended with the signing of the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.

== The papal proposal of 1980 ==
[[File:Pope1980prop.png|thumb|200px|right|The papal proposal of 1980.]]
On 12 December 1980, the Pope received both delegations and communicated to them his proposal for resolving the controversy, the terms of which had been developed entirely in secret and should be kept secret in order to avoid debilitating public debate that might diminish confidence in the proceedings and limit the freedom of action of both governments. But on 22 August 1981 the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Nación]]'' published the terms of the proposal. Chile would retain all of the islands and Argentina would be entitled to maintain certain limited facilities (common radar and weather stations) on some islands and would receive important navigation rights. Most important, however, was the creation of an ocean area known as the Sea of Peace. In this area, extending to the east and southeast from the disputed chain of islands, Chilean territorial waters would be limited to a narrow territorial sea, in which it would be obliged to share with Argentina equal participation in resource exploitation, scientific investigation, and environmental management. Beyond the Chilean territorial waters would be a much broader band of ocean subject to Argentine jurisdiction, but also subject to the same sharing provisions that applied in Chilean waters.

Chile accepted the papal proposal, despite some reservations. Argentina never formally replied to the proposal. However, on 17 March 1981, Argentina delivered a note to the Vatican expressing grave misgivings about the proposal, both because it failed to award any islands to Argentina and because it allowed Chile to maintain a presence so far into the Atlantic.

== Argentina renounced a 1972 Arbitration treaty ==
On 21 January 1982, Argentina announced the withdrawal from the 1972 bilateral treaty providing for recourse to the [[International Court of Justice]] in case of disputes. In Argentina, the judicial process had become an [[anathema]], particularly in view of the adverse 1977 arbitration award.<ref>See Michael Morris, \"The Strait of Magellan\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, page 85</ref> Chile reserved the right to go to the ICJ unilaterally before the treaty ended on 27 December 1982.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Argentina/denuncia/tratado/Chile/Beagle/elpepiint/19820123elpepiint_13/Tes Argentina denuncia el tratado con Chile sobre el Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' on 23 January 1982 (in Spanish).</ref>

== To the Falklands war ==
After the papal proposal, negotiations remained stalled and meanwhile, a sequence of incidents in Chile and Argentina strained relations between the two countries.

On 28 April 1981, General [[Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri]] (then Argentine army chief; later, during the Falklands war, President of Argentina) closed the border to Chile without any consultation with his own president.<ref>See article [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00801e.htm Historia de la santa mediación] in Argentine newspaper ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', Buenos Aires, on 20 December 1998: «Me calenté, se justificó Galtieri ante el fastidiado comandante de la Marina, almirante Lambruschini, quien le preguntó: Pero se da usted cuenta que el país se encuentra así envuelto en una peligrosa escalada?»'' (Translation; I lost my cool, justify himself Galtieri, as the annoyed Chief of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Lambruschini, asked him: Don't you notice that it bring the country in a dangerous escalation?)</ref>

In March 1982, five weeks before the beginning of the Falklands war, a ship of the Argentine navy, [[USS Luiseno (ATF-156)|''ARA Francisco de Gurruchaga'']], anchored at the [[Cape Horn|Deceit island]], ''[[de facto]]'' under Chilean sovereignty since 1881, and refused to abandon the bay, despite Chilean demands.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/CANAL_DE_BEAGLE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Pinochet/ordena/acuartelamiento/tropas/chilenas/conflicto/Argentina/canal/Beagle/elpepiint/19820306elpepiint_4/Tes Pinochet ordena el acuartelamiento de las tropas chilenas por el conflicto con Argentina sobre el canal de Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' on 6 March 1982 (in Spanish).</ref><ref>William Ben Hunt, ''Getting to war: predicting international conflict with mass media indicators'', page 22</ref>

On 2 April 1982, Argentina [[Falklands War|invaded the Falkland Islands]]. The Argentine plan included indeed the military occupation of the disputed islands at the Beagle channel after the invasion of the Falklands, as stated by Brigadier [[Basilio Lami Dozo]], chief of the Argentine Air Force during the Falklands war, in an interview with the Argentine magazine ''[[Perfil]]'': L.F. Galtieri: ''\"[Chile] have to know that what we are doing now, because they will be the next in turn.\"''<ref>Argentine magazine [http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&ed=0420 Perfil] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125142325/http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&ed=0420 |date=2009-11-25 }} on 22 November 2009:
:''Para colmo, Galtieri dijo en un discurso: \"Que saquen el ejemplo de lo que estamos haciendo ahora porque después les toca a ellos\".</ref> [[Óscar Camilión]], Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina from 29 March 1981 to 11 December 1981, in his  \"Memorias Políticas\", confirms the plan of the Argentine military: ''\"The military planning was, with the Falklands in Argentine hands, to invade the disputed islands in the Beagle Channel. That was the determination of the [Argentine] navy…\"''.<ref>Editorial Planeta, Buenos Aires, 1999, page 281''«Los planes militares eran, en la hipótesis de resolver el caso Malvinas, invadir las islas en disputa en el Beagle. Esa era la decisión de la Armada…»''

:''Displaying the mentality of the Argentine military regime in the 1970s, as another example, there was \"Plan Rosario\" according to which Argentina would attack the Malvinas and then turn to settle the Beagle Channel problem by force. The sequence, according to the plan, could also be reversed.''

Argentine General Osiris Villegas, first chief of the Argentine delegation in Rom asked to stop negotiations with Chile and to seize the islands in April 1982, after the seize of the Falklands. In his book ''La propuesta pontificia y el espacio nacional comprometido'', page 2, he called to:
:''no persistir en una diplomacia bilateral que durante años la ha inhibido para efectuar actos de posesión efectiva en las islas en litigio que son los hechos reales que garantizan el establecimiento de una soberanía usurpada y la preservación de la integridad del territorio nacional''. (cited in ''A treinta años de la crisis del Beagle, Desarrollo de un modelo de negociación en la resolución del conflicto'' by Renato Valenzuela Ugarte and Fernando García Toso, in Chilean Magazine \"Política y Estrategia\", nr. 115)</ref> Pope John Paul II made an unscheduled visit to Buenos Aires on 14 June 1982, in an attempt to prevent further hostilities between Britain and Argentina.

Chile became the only major Latin American country to support Britain indirectly by providing a military and naval diversion, but ''\"in private many [Latin American] governments were pleased with the outcome of the war\"''.<ref>See K.J. Holsti, \"The state, war, and the state of war\", page 176</ref>

== The final phase ==
After the war, yet despite the renewal of the 1972 Treaty on 15 September 1982, the distension after ARA-Gurruchaga incident and the spy-exchanging, the mediation continued to move very slowly. Following the war Chile evinced a greater willingness to negotiate modifications to the papal proposal, but by then it had become clear that the Argentine junta, reeling from its defeat in the war, was too weak to achieve an agreement.

Cardinal Antonio Samorè died in Rome at age 77, in February 1983.

President [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s new government was firmly committed to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible. Based on this commitment and additional discussions, the parties were able to lay much of the groundwork for a settlement.

In April 1984, [[Vatican Secretary of State]] [[Agostino Casaroli]] asked separately the two delegations for their proposals for a final solution.

By October 1984, both countries reached a complete understanding, and the revised text of the treaty was finalized on 18 October.

Chile accepted, again, the papal proposal. In Argentina, Alfonsin held a consultative [[referendum]]. The official returns showed 10,391,019 voted in favor of the proposed treaty while 2,105,663 opposed it, a margin of 82 percent to 16 percent opposed, with 2 percent casting blank or null ballots.<ref>See article [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE7D61638F935A15752C1A962948260 Beagle Channel Treaty Approved in Argentina] in USA-newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 26 November 1984</ref>

The [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] went a long way before enacted:
* on 30 December 1984, the treaty passed the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]];
* on 15 March 1985, the treaty passed the [[Argentine Senate]];

[[File:Cassaroli-1984-treaty.jpg|thumb|300px|Signing of the agreement in Rome: Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Dante Caputo]] (left); Agostino Casaroli (middle); Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaime del Valle (right)]]

The '''Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict''' followed the failure of [[Direct negotiations between Chile and Argentina in 1977–1978|negotiations between Chile and Argentina]], when, on 22 December 1978, the Argentinian [[Military dictatorship|Junta]] started [[Operation Soberanía]], to invade [[Cape Horn]] and islands awarded to Chile by the [[Beagle Channel Arbitration]]. Soon after the event, [[Pope John Paul II]] offered to [[mediation|mediate]] and sent his personal envoy, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Antonio Samoré]], to [[Buenos Aires]]. Argentina, in acceptance of the authority of the Pope over the overwhelmingly Catholic Argentine population, called off the military operation and accepted the mediation. On 9 January 1979, Chile and Argentina signed the [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1979AM.PDF Act of Montevideo] formally requesting mediation by the Vatican and renouncing the use of force.

== Interests of the parties ==
{{Main|Beagle conflict#Interests of the parties|l1=Interests of the parties}}
The mediator acted to defuse the situation by negotiating an agreement that stopped the immediate military crisis. Then the Vatican crafted a six-year process that allowed the parties to grapple with increasingly difficult issues, including navigation rights, sovereignty over other islands in the [[Fuegian Archipelago]], [[delimitation]] of the [[Straits of Magellan]], and maritime boundaries south to [[Cape Horn]] and beyond.
* Chile considered the Arbitral Award of 1977 \"…fully operative and obligatory in law…\" as expressed by the Court of Arbitration after the Argentine Refusal.<ref>See \"Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit\", Karin Oellers-Frahm, Page 353</ref>
* Argentina repudiated the International Arbitral Award that the government of [[Alejandro Lanusse]] had solicited in 1971.
* Argentina extended its claim to all territories southward of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and eastward of the Cape Horn-[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. That is, Argentina claimed the islands Horn, Wollastone, Deceit, Barnevelt, Evouts, Herschell, etc.

The 1978 military mobilization revealed other latent international relations issues between the two countries that had been previously overlooked or ignored.

== Mediator ==
By the beginning of November 1978, Chile and Argentina no longer had any mechanism for working toward a peaceful settlement and the situation began to destabilize rapidly. It was at this point, with direct talks dead and a judicial settlement refused by Argentina, that Chile suggested mediation. Argentina accepted the proposal and the two foreign ministers agreed to meet in Buenos Aires on 12 December for the purpose of selecting a mediator and the terms of mediation. Possible candidates were<ref>See Alejandro Luis Corbacho: Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts, Universidad del CEMA, Argentina, Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, page 8</ref>
* [[Jimmy Carter]], [[President of the United States of America]],
* the [[Organization of American States]],
* [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[King of Spain]],
* a European president,
* Pope John Paul II.
The ministers concurred on the issue that the Pope should mediate the dispute, but their agreement proved ephemeral. In the evening, as the Chilean delegation was studying the documents for signature, the Argentine minister called the Chilean minister Cubillos to tell him that President Videla, who had approved their choice of mediator, had been stripped of his authority by the junta.

On 22 December 1978, Argentina launched [[Operation Soberania]] to occupy the islands militarily. On the morning of 22 December, Pope John Paul II, on his own initiative, contacted both governments directly to communicate that he was sending a personal envoy to Buenos Aires and Santiago.

== The Act of Montevideo ==
In [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], on 8 January 1979, both countries signed the Act of Montevideo. In this treaty the parties agreed to:
* no restrictions whatsoever over the mediation (textual: \"…they will raise no objection to the expression by the Holy See, during these proceedings, of such ideas as its thorough studies on a disputed aspects of the problem of the southern zone may suggest to it, with a view to contributing to a peaceful settlement acceptable to both Parties…\")
* \"…Antonio Cardinal Samoré … asks that that request [of mediation] should be accompanied by an undertaking that the two States will not resort to the use of force in their mutual relations, will bring about a gradual return to the military situation existing at the beginning of 1977 and will refrain from adopting measures that might impair harmony in any sector.…\".

The treaty gave the mediator a broad framework in which to negotiate without any geographical data or temporal restrictions.

== The four phases of the mediation ==
Mark Laudy<ref>Mark Laudy, \"The Vatican Mediation of the Beagle Channel Dispute: Crisis Intervention and Forum Building\" {{cite web |url=http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/words/11.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-29 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529153631/http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/words/11.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-29 |df= }}</ref> sees four phases during the mediation:
* The first phase was the shortest and most critical period of the entire mediation and began with Samorè's arrival in Buenos Aires on 25 December 1978. This was purely a crisis intervention to prevent a war and secure an agreement to submit the matter to mediation. In a shuttle diplomacy, Samorè flew between [[Santiago de Chile]] and Buenos Aires until the objectives were achieved with the signing of the Act of Montevideo on 8 January 1979.
* The second period ran from May 1979, when the Chilean and Argentine delegations arrived in Rome, through December 1980, when the Pope presented the parties with his proposal for settling the dispute. This first proposal was rejected by Argentina.
* The third and longest phase, running from the beginning of 1981 until December 1983, after Argentina's return to democracy, was characterized by long periods of stalled negotiations. The most significant developments during this period were the Argentine repudiation of the 1972 General Treaty; the subsequent effort to fill the juridical vacuum resulting from that repudiation; and the [[Falklands war]], which set the stage for the return to democracy in Argentina.
* The final phase began when [[Raúl Alfonsín]] assumed the presidency in Buenos Aires at the end of 1983 and ended with the signing of the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.

== The papal proposal of 1980 ==
[[File:Pope1980prop.png|thumb|200px|right|The papal proposal of 1980.]]
On 12 December 1980, the Pope received both delegations and communicated to them his proposal for resolving the controversy, the terms of which had been developed entirely in secret and should be kept secret in order to avoid debilitating public debate that might diminish confidence in the proceedings and limit the freedom of action of both governments. But on 22 August 1981 the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Nación]]'' published the terms of the proposal. Chile would retain all of the islands and Argentina would be entitled to maintain certain limited facilities (common radar and weather stations) on some islands and would receive important navigation rights. Most important, however, was the creation of an ocean area known as the Sea of Peace. In this area, extending to the east and southeast from the disputed chain of islands, Chilean territorial waters would be limited to a narrow territorial sea, in which it would be obliged to share with Argentina equal participation in resource exploitation, scientific investigation, and environmental management. Beyond the Chilean territorial waters would be a much broader band of ocean subject to Argentine jurisdiction, but also subject to the same sharing provisions that applied in Chilean waters.

Chile accepted the papal proposal, despite some reservations. Argentina never formally replied to the proposal. However, on 17 March 1981, Argentina delivered a note to the Vatican expressing grave misgivings about the proposal, both because it failed to award any islands to Argentina and because it allowed Chile to maintain a presence so far into the Atlantic.

== Argentina renounced a 1972 Arbitration treaty ==
On 21 January 1982, Argentina announced the withdrawal from the 1972 bilateral treaty providing for recourse to the [[International Court of Justice]] in case of disputes. In Argentina, the judicial process had become an [[anathema]], particularly in view of the adverse 1977 arbitration award.<ref>See Michael Morris, \"The Strait of Magellan\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, page 85</ref> Chile reserved the right to go to the ICJ unilaterally before the treaty ended on 27 December 1982.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Argentina/denuncia/tratado/Chile/Beagle/elpepiint/19820123elpepiint_13/Tes Argentina denuncia el tratado con Chile sobre el Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' on 23 January 1982 (in Spanish).</ref>

== To the Falklands war ==
After the papal proposal, negotiations remained stalled and meanwhile, a sequence of incidents in Chile and Argentina strained relations between the two countries.

On 28 April 1981, General [[Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri]] (then Argentine army chief; later, during the Falklands war, President of Argentina) closed the border to Chile without any consultation with his own president.<ref>See article [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00801e.htm Historia de la santa mediación] in Argentine newspaper ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', Buenos Aires, on 20 December 1998: «Me calenté, se justificó Galtieri ante el fastidiado comandante de la Marina, almirante Lambruschini, quien le preguntó: Pero se da usted cuenta que el país se encuentra así envuelto en una peligrosa escalada?»'' (Translation; I lost my cool, justify himself Galtieri, as the annoyed Chief of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Lambruschini, asked him: Don't you notice that it bring the country in a dangerous escalation?)</ref>

In March 1982, five weeks before the beginning of the Falklands war, a ship of the Argentine navy, [[USS Luiseno (ATF-156)|''ARA Francisco de Gurruchaga'']], anchored at the [[Cape Horn|Deceit island]], ''[[de facto]]'' under Chilean sovereignty since 1881, and refused to abandon the bay, despite Chilean demands.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/CANAL_DE_BEAGLE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Pinochet/ordena/acuartelamiento/tropas/chilenas/conflicto/Argentina/canal/Beagle/elpepiint/19820306elpepiint_4/Tes Pinochet ordena el acuartelamiento de las tropas chilenas por el conflicto con Argentina sobre el canal de Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' on 6 March 1982 (in Spanish).</ref><ref>William Ben Hunt, ''Getting to war: predicting international conflict with mass media indicators'', page 22</ref>

On 2 April 1982, Argentina [[Falklands War|invaded the Falkland Islands]]. The Argentine plan included indeed the military occupation of the disputed islands at the Beagle channel after the invasion of the Falklands, as stated by Brigadier [[Basilio Lami Dozo]], chief of the Argentine Air Force during the Falklands war, in an interview with the Argentine magazine [[Perfil]]: L.F. Galtieri: \"[Chile] have to know that what we are doing now, because they will be the next in turn.\"<ref>Argentine magazine [http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&ed=0420 Perfil] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125142325/http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&ed=0420 |date=2009-11-25 }} on 22 November 2009:
:''Para colmo, Galtieri dijo en un discurso: \"Que saquen el ejemplo de lo que estamos haciendo ahora porque después les toca a ellos\".</ref> [[Óscar Camilión]], Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina from 29 March 1981 to 11 December 1981, in his  \"Memorias Políticas\", confirms the plan of the Argentine military: \"The military planning was, with the Falklands in Argentine hands, to invade the disputed islands in the Beagle Channel. That was the determination of the [Argentine] navy…\".<ref>Editorial Planeta, Buenos Aires, 1999, page 281''«Los planes militares eran, en la hipótesis de resolver el caso Malvinas, invadir las islas en disputa en el Beagle. Esa era la decisión de la Armada…»''

:''Displaying the mentality of the Argentine military regime in the 1970s, as another example, there was \"Plan Rosario\" according to which Argentina would attack the Malvinas and then turn to settle the Beagle Channel problem by force. The sequence, according to the plan, could also be reversed.''

Argentine General Osiris Villegas, first chief of the Argentine delegation in Rom asked to stop negotiations with Chile and to seize the islands in April 1982, after the seize of the Falklands. In his book ''La propuesta pontificia y el espacio nacional comprometido'', page 2, he called to:
:''no persistir en una diplomacia bilateral que durante años la ha inhibido para efectuar actos de posesión efectiva en las islas en litigio que son los hechos reales que garantizan el establecimiento de una soberanía usurpada y la preservación de la integridad del territorio nacional''.

Chile became the only major Latin American country to support Britain indirectly by providing a military and naval diversion, but \"in private many [Latin American] governments were pleased with the outcome of the war\".<ref>See K.J. Holsti, \"The state, war, and the state of war\", page 176</ref>

== The final phase ==
After the war, yet despite the renewal of the 1972 Treaty on 15 September 1982, the distension after ARA-Gurruchaga incident and the spy-exchanging, the mediation continued to move very slowly. Following the war Chile evinced a greater willingness to negotiate modifications to the papal proposal, but by then it had become clear that the Argentine junta, reeling from its defeat in the war, was too weak to achieve an agreement.

Cardinal Antonio Samorè died in Rome at age 77, in February 1983.

President [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s new government was firmly committed to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible. Based on this commitment and additional discussions, the parties were able to lay much of the groundwork for a settlement.

In April 1984, [[Vatican Secretary of State]] [[Agostino Casaroli]] asked separately the two delegations for their proposals for a final solution.

By October 1984, both countries reached a complete understanding, and the revised text of the treaty was finalized on 18 October.

Chile accepted, again, the papal proposal. In Argentina, Alfonsin held a consultative [[referendum]]. The official returns showed 10,391,019 voted in favor of the proposed treaty while 2,105,663 opposed it, a margin of 82 percent to 16 percent opposed, with 2 percent casting blank or null ballots.<ref>See article [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE7D61638F935A15752C1A962948260 Beagle Channel Treaty Approved in Argentina] in USA-newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 26 November 1984</ref>

The [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] went a long way before enacted:
* on 30 December 1984, the treaty passed the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]];
* on 15 March 1985, the treaty passed the [[Argentine Senate]];
* on 16 March 1985, the treaty was signed by representative of the [[President of Argentina]], who was abroad;
* on 11 April 1985, the treaty passed the Chilean [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|junta]];
* on 12 April 1985, the treaty was signed by [[Augusto Pinochet]];
* on 2 May 1985, both ministers exchanged instruments.

==Aftermath==
The [[Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass]] crossing border was renamed to honour the special representative of Pope John Paul II.

[[File:Cassaroli-1984-treaty.jpg|thumb|300px|Signing of the agreement in Rome: Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Dante Caputo]] (left); Agostino Casaroli (middle); Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaime del Valle (right)]]

The '''Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict''' followed the failure of [[Direct negotiations between Chile and Argentina in 1977–1978|negotiations between Chile and Argentina]], when, on 22 December 1978, the Argentinian [[Military dictatorship|Junta]] started [[Operation Soberanía]], to invade [[Cape Horn]] and islands awarded to Chile by the [[Beagle Channel Arbitration]]. Soon after the event, [[Pope John Paul II]] offered to [[mediation|mediate]] and sent his personal envoy, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Antonio Samoré]], to [[Buenos Aires]]. Argentina, in acceptance of the authority of the Pope over the overwhelmingly Catholic Argentine population, called off the military operation and accepted the mediation. On 9 January 1979, Chile and Argentina signed the [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1979AM.PDF Act of Montevideo] formally requesting mediation by the Vatican and renouncing the use of force.

== Interests of the parties ==
{{Main|Beagle conflict#Interests of the parties|l1=Interests of the parties}}
The mediator acted to defuse the situation by negotiating an agreement that stopped the immediate military crisis. Then the Vatican crafted a six-year process that allowed the parties to grapple with increasingly difficult issues, including navigation rights, sovereignty over other islands in the [[Fuegian Archipelago]], [[delimitation]] of the [[Straits of Magellan]], and maritime boundaries south to [[Cape Horn]] and beyond.
* Chile considered the Arbitral Award of 1977 \"…fully operative and obligatory in law…\" as expressed by the Court of Arbitration after the Argentine Refusal.<ref>See \"Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit\", Karin Oellers-Frahm, Page 353</ref>
* Argentina repudiated the International Arbitral Award that the government of [[Alejandro Lanusse]] had solicited in 1971.
* Argentina extended its claim to all territories southward of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and eastward of the Cape Horn-[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. That is, Argentina claimed the islands Horn, Wollastone, Deceit, Barnevelt, Evouts, Herschell, etc.

The 1978 military mobilization revealed other latent international relations issues between the two countries that had been previously overlooked or ignored.

== Mediator ==
By the beginning of November 1978, Chile and Argentina no longer had any mechanism for working toward a peaceful settlement and the situation began to destabilize rapidly. It was at this point, with direct talks dead and a judicial settlement refused by Argentina, that Chile suggested mediation. Argentina accepted the proposal and the two foreign ministers agreed to meet in Buenos Aires on 12 December for the purpose of selecting a mediator and the terms of mediation. Possible candidates were<ref>See Alejandro Luis Corbacho: Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts, Universidad del CEMA, Argentina, Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, page 8</ref>
* [[Jimmy Carter]], [[President of the United States of America]],
* the [[Organization of American States]],
* [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[King of Spain]],
* a European president,
* Pope John Paul II.
The ministers concurred on the issue that the Pope should mediate the dispute, but their agreement proved ephemeral. In the evening, as the Chilean delegation was studying the documents for signature, the Argentine minister called the Chilean minister Cubillos to tell him that President Videla, who had approved their choice of mediator, had been stripped of his authority by the junta.

On 22 December 1978, Argentina launched [[Operation Soberania]] to occupy the islands militarily. On the morning of 22 December, Pope John Paul II, on his own initiative, contacted both governments directly to communicate that he was sending a personal envoy to Buenos Aires and Santiago.

== The Act of Montevideo ==
In [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], on 8 January 1979, both countries signed the Act of Montevideo. In this treaty the parties agreed to:
* no restrictions whatsoever over the mediation (textual: ''«…they will raise no objection to the expression by the Holy See, during these proceedings, of such ideas as its thorough studies on a disputed aspects of the problem of the southern zone may suggest to it, with a view to contributing to a peaceful settlement acceptable to both Parties…»'')
* ''«…Antonio Cardinal Samoré … asks that that request ''[of mediation]'' should be accompanied by an undertaking that the two States will not resort to the use of force in their mutual relations, will bring about a gradual return to the military situation existing at the beginning of 1977 and will refrain from adopting measures that might impair harmony in any sector.…»''.

The treaty gave the mediator a broad framework in which to negotiate without any geographical data or temporal restrictions.

== The four phases of the mediation ==
Mark Laudy<ref>Mark Laudy, \"The Vatican Mediation of the Beagle Channel Dispute: Crisis Intervention and Forum Building\" {{cite web |url=http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/words/11.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-29 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529153631/http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/words/11.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-29 |df= }}</ref> sees four phases during the mediation:
* The first phase was the shortest and most critical period of the entire mediation and began with Samorè's arrival in Buenos Aires on 25 December 1978. This was purely a crisis intervention to prevent a war and secure an agreement to submit the matter to mediation. In a shuttle diplomacy, Samorè flew between [[Santiago de Chile]] and Buenos Aires until the objectives were achieved with the signing of the Act of Montevideo on 8 January 1979.
* The second period ran from May 1979, when the Chilean and Argentine delegations arrived in Rome, through December 1980, when the Pope presented the parties with his proposal for settling the dispute. This first proposal was rejected by Argentina.
* The third and longest phase, running from the beginning of 1981 until December 1983, after Argentina's return to democracy, was characterized by long periods of stalled negotiations. The most significant developments during this period were the Argentine repudiation of the 1972 General Treaty; the subsequent effort to fill the juridical vacuum resulting from that repudiation; and the [[Falklands war]], which set the stage for the return to democracy in Argentina.
* The final phase began when [[Raúl Alfonsín]] assumed the presidency in Buenos Aires at the end of 1983 and ended with the signing of the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.

== The papal proposal of 1980 ==
[[File:Pope1980prop.png|thumb|200px|right|The papal proposal of 1980.]]
On 12 December 1980, the Pope received both delegations and communicated to them his proposal for resolving the controversy, the terms of which had been developed entirely in secret and should be kept secret in order to avoid debilitating public debate that might diminish confidence in the proceedings and limit the freedom of action of both governments. But on 22 August 1981 the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Nación]]'' published the terms of the proposal. Chile would retain all of the islands and Argentina would be entitled to maintain certain limited facilities (common radar and weather stations) on some islands and would receive important navigation rights. Most important, however, was the creation of an ocean area known as the Sea of Peace. In this area, extending to the east and southeast from the disputed chain of islands, Chilean territorial waters would be limited to a narrow territorial sea, in which it would be obliged to share with Argentina equal participation in resource exploitation, scientific investigation, and environmental management. Beyond the Chilean territorial waters would be a much broader band of ocean subject to Argentine jurisdiction, but also subject to the same sharing provisions that applied in Chilean waters.

Chile accepted the papal proposal, despite some reservations. Argentina never formally replied to the proposal. However, on 17 March 1981, Argentina delivered a note to the Vatican expressing grave misgivings about the proposal, both because it failed to award any islands to Argentina and because it allowed Chile to maintain a presence so far into the Atlantic.

== Argentina renounced a 1972 Arbitration treaty ==
On 21 January 1982, Argentina announced the withdrawal from the 1972 bilateral treaty providing for recourse to the [[International Court of Justice]] in case of disputes. In Argentina, the judicial process had become an [[anathema]], particularly in view of the adverse 1977 arbitration award.<ref>See Michael Morris, \"The Strait of Magellan\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, page 85</ref> Chile reserved the right to go to the ICJ unilaterally before the treaty ended on 27 December 1982.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Argentina/denuncia/tratado/Chile/Beagle/elpepiint/19820123elpepiint_13/Tes Argentina denuncia el tratado con Chile sobre el Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' on 23 January 1982 (in Spanish).</ref>

== To the Falklands war ==
After the papal proposal, negotiations remained stalled and meanwhile, a sequence of incidents in Chile and Argentina strained relations between the two countries.

On 28 April 1981, General [[Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri]] (then Argentine army chief; later, during the Falklands war, President of Argentina) closed the border to Chile without any consultation with his own president.<ref>See article [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00801e.htm Historia de la santa mediación] in Argentine newspaper ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', Buenos Aires, on 20 December 1998: «Me calenté, se justificó Galtieri ante el fastidiado comandante de la Marina, almirante Lambruschini, quien le preguntó: Pero se da usted cuenta que el país se encuentra así envuelto en una peligrosa escalada?»'' (Translation; I lost my cool, justify himself Galtieri, as the annoyed Chief of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Lambruschini, asked him: Don't you notice that it bring the country in a dangerous escalation?)</ref>

In March 1982, five weeks before the beginning of the Falklands war, a ship of the Argentine navy, [[USS Luiseno (ATF-156)|''ARA Francisco de Gurruchaga'']], anchored at the [[Cape Horn|Deceit island]], ''[[de facto]]'' under Chilean sovereignty since 1881, and refused to abandon the bay, despite Chilean demands.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/CANAL_DE_BEAGLE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Pinochet/ordena/acuartelamiento/tropas/chilenas/conflicto/Argentina/canal/Beagle/elpepiint/19820306elpepiint_4/Tes Pinochet ordena el acuartelamiento de las tropas chilenas por el conflicto con Argentina sobre el canal de Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' on 6 March 1982 (in Spanish).</ref><ref>William Ben Hunt, ''Getting to war: predicting international conflict with mass media indicators'', page 22</ref>

On 2 April 1982, Argentina [[Falklands War|invaded the Falkland Islands]]. The Argentine plan included indeed the military occupation of the disputed islands at the Beagle channel after the invasion of the Falklands, as stated by Brigadier [[Basilio Lami Dozo]], chief of the Argentine Air Force during the Falklands war, in an interview with the Argentine magazine [[Perfil]]: L.F. Galtieri: \"[Chile] have to know that what we are doing now, because they will be the next in turn.\"<ref>Argentine magazine [http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&ed=0420 Perfil] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125142325/http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&ed=0420 |date=2009-11-25 }} on 22 November 2009:
:''Para colmo, Galtieri dijo en un discurso: \"Que saquen el ejemplo de lo que estamos haciendo ahora porque después les toca a ellos\".</ref> [[Óscar Camilión]], Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina from 29 March 1981 to 11 December 1981, in his  \"Memorias Políticas\", confirms the plan of the Argentine military: \"The military planning was, with the Falklands in Argentine hands, to invade the disputed islands in the Beagle Channel. That was the determination of the [Argentine] navy…\".<ref>Editorial Planeta, Buenos Aires, 1999, page 281''«Los planes militares eran, en la hipótesis de resolver el caso Malvinas, invadir las islas en disputa en el Beagle. Esa era la decisión de la Armada…»''

:''Displaying the mentality of the Argentine military regime in the 1970s, as another example, there was \"Plan Rosario\" according to which Argentina would attack the Malvinas and then turn to settle the Beagle Channel problem by force. The sequence, according to the plan, could also be reversed.''

Argentine General Osiris Villegas, first chief of the Argentine delegation in Rom asked to stop negotiations with Chile and to seize the islands in April 1982, after the seize of the Falklands. In his book ''La propuesta pontificia y el espacio nacional comprometido'', page 2, he called to:
:''no persistir en una diplomacia bilateral que durante años la ha inhibido para efectuar actos de posesión efectiva en las islas en litigio que son los hechos reales que garantizan el establecimiento de una soberanía usurpada y la preservación de la integridad del territorio nacional''.

== The final phase ==
After the war, yet despite the renewal of the 1972 Treaty on 15 September 1982, the distension after ARA-Gurruchaga incident and the spy-exchanging, the mediation continued to move very slowly. Following the war Chile evinced a greater willingness to negotiate modifications to the papal proposal, but by then it had become clear that the Argentine junta, reeling from its defeat in the war, was too weak to achieve an agreement.

Cardinal Antonio Samorè died in Rome at age 77, in February 1983.

President [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s new government was firmly committed to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible. Based on this commitment and additional discussions, the parties were able to lay much of the groundwork for a settlement.

In April 1984, [[Vatican Secretary of State]] [[Agostino Casaroli]] asked separately the two delegations for their proposals for a final solution.

By October 1984, both countries reached a complete understanding, and the revised text of the treaty was finalized on 18 October.

Chile accepted, again, the papal proposal. In Argentina, Alfonsin held a consultative [[referendum]]. The official returns showed 10,391,019 voted in favor of the proposed treaty while 2,105,663 opposed it, a margin of 82 percent to 16 percent opposed, with 2 percent casting blank or null ballots.<ref>See article [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE7D61638F935A15752C1A962948260 Beagle Channel Treaty Approved in Argentina] in USA-newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 26 November 1984</ref>

The [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] went a long way before enacted:
* on 30 December 1984, the treaty passed the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]];
* on 15 March 1985, the treaty passed the [[Argentine Senate]];
* on 16 March 1985, the treaty was signed by representative of the [[President of Argentina]], who was abroad;
* on 11 April 1985, the treaty passed the Chilean [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|junta]];
* on 12 April 1985, the treaty was signed by [[Augusto Pinochet]];
* on 2 May 1985, both ministers exchanged instruments.

==Aftermath==
The [[Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass]] crossing border was renamed to honour the special representative of Pope John Paul II.

'''The Sidemen''', also referred to simply as '''Sidemen''', is a group of British [[YouTuber]]s. The group comprises [[KSI (entertainer)|JJ Olatunji]], Simon Minter, JoshUA Bradley, Tobit Brown, Ethan Payne, Vikram Singh Barn, and Harry Lewis, also known by their [[Pseudonym|online aliases]] KSI, Miniminter, Zerkaa, Tobjizzle, Behzinga, Vikkstar123, and W2S, respectively. They produce online videos consisting of challenges, game-show formats and [[Let's Play|video game commentaries]], as well as selling exclusive merchandise.

Founded on 19 October 2013 as an informal gaming group, the group recorded gameplays and challenges together which the members would upload to their respective channels. As their channels grew, the group began producing a wider variety of videos and other projects and, since 2018, has published primarily on their combined channels, Sidemen and MoreSidemen. {{As of|2020|3}}, their eponymous YouTube channel has over 7.6 million subscribers.<ref name=\"SidemenStats\">{{Cite web |url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCDogdKl7t7NHzQ95aEwkdMw |title=Sidemen's YouTube Stats |website=[[Social Blade]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830020618/https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCDogdKl7t7NHzQ95aEwkdMw |archive-date=30 August 2019 |access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>

== History ==
Some of the members knew each other before the group was formed: Josh Bradley and Tobi Brown both attended [[Bexley Grammar School]] in London, and [[KSI (entertainer)|JJ Olatunji]] and Simon Minter both attended [[Berkhamsted School]] in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=\"SidemenBook\">{{Cite book |last=The Sidemen |title=Sidemen: The Book |date=18 October 2016 |publisher=[[Coronet Books]] |isbn=978-1473648166 |pages=52–57}}</ref>

The group was informally created on 19 October 2013, when Olatunji, Minter, Bradley, Brown, and Ethan Payne formed a [[Rockstar Games Social Club]] group called '''The Ultimate Sidemen''' in the then-recently released ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]''; Vik Barn joined the group soon afterwards. In January 2014, Bradley met Harry Lewis while at a ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' gaming event in [[New York City]] and invited him to join the group.<ref name=\"SidemenBook\" /> Speaking about the origins of the group's name, Sidemen, Minter explained, \"A sideman is basically someone's bitch who just follows them around [...] I was basically JJ's bitch that followed him around.\"<ref name=\"bi19\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment/article/3037479/ksi-how-youtube-millionaire-who-beat-logan-paul-celebrity |title=KSI: how the YouTube millionaire, who beat Logan Paul in a celebrity boxing rematch, made his name |date=13 November 2019 |work=[[Business Insider]] |agency=[[South China Morning Post]] |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref>

'''The Sidemen''', also referred to simply as '''Sidemen''', is a group of British [[YouTuber]]s. The group comprises [[KSI (entertainer)|JJ Olatunji]], Simon Minter, Josh Bradley, Tobi Brown, Ethan Payne, Vik Barn, and Harry Lewis, also known by their [[Pseudonym|online aliases]] KSI, Miniminter, Zerkaa, Tobjizzle, Behzinga, Vikkstar123, and W2S, respectively. They produce online videos consisting of challenges, game-show formats and [[Let's Play|video game commentaries]], as well as selling exclusive merchandise.

Founded on 19 October 2013 as an informal gaming group, the group recorded gameplays and challenges together which the members would upload to their respective channels. As their channels grew, the group began producing a wider variety of videos and other projects and, since 2018, has published primarily on their combined channels, Sidemen and MoreSidemen. {{As of|2020|3}}, their eponymous YouTube channel has over 7.6 million subscribers.<ref name=\"SidemenStats\">{{Cite web |url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCDogdKl7t7NHzQ95aEwkdMw |title=Sidemen's YouTube Stats |website=[[Social Blade]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830020618/https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCDogdKl7t7NHzQ95aEwkdMw |archive-date=30 August 2019 |access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>

== History ==
Some of the members knew each other before the group was formed: Josh Bradley and Tobi Brown both attended [[Bexley Grammar School]] in London, and [[KSI (entertainer)|JJ Olatunji]] and Simon Minter both attended [[Berkhamsted School]] in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=\"SidemenBook\">{{Cite book |last=The Sidemen |title=Sidemen: The Book |date=18 October 2016 |publisher=[[Coronet Books]] |isbn=978-1473648166 |pages=52–57}}</ref>

The group was informally created on 19 October 2013, when Olatunji, Minter, Bradley, Brown, and Ethan Payne formed a [[Rockstar Games Social Club]] group called '''The Ultimate Sidemen''' in the then-recently released ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]''; Vik Barn joined the group soon afterwards. In January 2014, Bradley met Harry Lewis while at a ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' gaming event in [[New York City]] and invited him to join the group.<ref name=\"SidemenBook\" /> Speaking about the origins of the group's name, Sidemen, Minter explained, \"A sideman is basically someone's bitch who just follows them around [...] I was basically JJ's bitch that followed him around.\"<ref name=\"bi19\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment/article/3037479/ksi-how-youtube-millionaire-who-beat-logan-paul-celebrity |title=KSI: how the YouTube millionaire, who beat Logan Paul in a celebrity boxing rematch, made his name |date=13 November 2019 |work=[[Business Insider]] |agency=[[South China Morning Post]] |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref>

'''Elliot McKay See Jr.''' (July 23, 1927 – February 28, 1966) was an American [[engineer]], [[United States naval aviator|naval aviator]], [[test pilot]], and [[NASA]] [[astronaut]].

See received an appointment to the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]] in 1945. He graduated in 1949 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[marine engineering]] and a  [[United States Navy Reserve]] commission, and joined the Aircraft Gas Turbine Division of [[General Electric]] as an engineer. He was called to active duty  as a [[naval aviator]] during the [[Korean War]], and flew [[Grumman F9F Panther]] fighters with [[VA-52 (U.S. Navy)|Fighter Squadron 144]] (VF-144) from the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Randolph|CV-15|6}} in the Mediterranean, and {{USS|Boxer|CV-21|6}}  in the Western Pacific.  He married Marilyn Denahy in 1954, and they had three children.

See rejoined General Electric (GE) in 1956 as a flight test engineer after his tour of duty, and became a group leader and experimental test pilot at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], where he flew the latest jet aircraft with GE engines. He also obtained a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[aeronautical engineering]] from [[UCLA]].

Selected in NASA's [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|second group of astronauts]] in 1962, See was the prime command pilot for what would have been his first space flight, [[Gemini 9]]. He was killed along with [[Charles Bassett]], his Gemini 9 crewmate, in a [[1966 NASA T-38 crash|NASA jet crash]] at the [[St. Louis]] [[McDonnell Aircraft]] plant, where they were to undergo two weeks of [[space rendezvous]] simulator training.

==Early life and education==
Elliot McKay See Jr. was born on July 23, 1927, to Elliot See Sr. and Mamie ({{nee}} Drummond) in Dallas, Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/28957076/the_philadelphia_inquirer/|title=New Astronauts, 9 Hottest Jet Pilots in the U.S., Have Been Training a Year|newspaper=The Philadelphia Enquirer|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date=September 18, 1962|page=3|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> He was the first of two children; his sister Sally rounded out the family.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=36}} His father was an [[electrical engineer]] who worked for [[General Electric]], and his mother worked in jobs ranging from advertising to real estate.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=36}} See was active in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] for five years, and earned the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/FILESTORE/pdf/02-558.pdf|title=Astronauts and the BSA|access-date=June 25, 2016|website=[[Boy Scouts of America]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622104220/http://www.scouting.org/FILESTORE/pdf/02-558.pdf|archive-date=June 22, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> He attended [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]] and was on the varsity team in several sports, including boxing. He was also on the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) Rifle Team. He graduated from high school in 1945.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=36}}

The United States entered World War II in December 1941. See had to choose between going to war or going to college, as he would otherwise be drafted at age 18. He decided to apply for aviation cadet training. He failed a physical, and, according to See, \"going to college became the most important thing\". He enrolled at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], and after a few months pledged to [[Phi Kappa Psi]]. While at the University of Texas, he signed up for flying lessons and received his [[private pilot's license]].{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=37–38}}

See applied for military officer training and received an appointment to the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]] (USMMA) in 1945. As the end of the war drew near, the USMMA changed its curriculum to a four-year college-level program, which was the minimum requirement to be a merchant marine in peacetime. He spent his [[United States Merchant Marine Academy#Curriculum|plebe]] year at [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]], where the USMMA had a [[satellite campus]], and then transferred to the main [[campus]] at [[Kings Point, New York]]. He commanded the Third Company as a cadet officer. He was a member of the Propeller Club and head [[cheerleader]]. He was on the [[mile relay]] running team, played intramural [[softball]], and was a varsity boxer. As co-captain of the rifle team, he won the Captain Tomb Trophy for individual rifle and pistol marksmanship in December 1948.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=37–38}} In 1949,  [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized the USMMA to award [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees to its graduates,<ref>{{cite web |title=USMMA History  |website= U.S. Merchant Marine Academy |url=https://www.usmma.edu/about/usmma-history |access-date= June 7, 2019|date= January 18, 2013 }}</ref> so on graduation that year Elliott received his degree, his marine engineer's licenses, and a commission as an officer in the [[United States Navy Reserve]].{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=37–38}}

==Navy service and General Electric==
[[File:LT(jg) Elliot See.jpg|thumb|upright|left| See as a [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] during his tour of duty on {{USS|Boxer|CV-21|6}} ]]
After graduation, See took a summer job with [[Lykes Brothers Steamship Company]]. On September 1, 1949, he joined the Aircraft Gas Turbine Division of General Electric, the firm his father had worked for, in [[Boston]]. He moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], when the division was relocated.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=40–41}} There he met Marilyn Jane Denahy from [[Georgetown, Ohio]], who worked at General Electric as a secretary.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |title=Head Over Heels for What's Out There |pp=30–39, 81–90 |date=September 27, 1963 |volume=55 |issue=19 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=NFIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA86 |access-date=May 10, 2019 }}</ref> He and his friend Tay Haney pooled their funds to buy a [[Luscombe Silvaire Sprayer]] aircraft, which they flew on cross-country trips. In November 1952, while taking Marilyn on a joyride, the Luscombe's engine began to fail. See attempted to land the aircraft on a short, unimproved field, but the tail wheel snagged a power line and forced the aircraft into the ground. See suffered deep cuts to his face which required [[plastic surgery]]. Marilyn escaped the crash with only minor injuries.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=40–41}} 

By 1953, See was working as a flight test engineer at General Electric's plant in [[Evendale, Ohio]]. Like many naval reservists, he was called to [[active duty]] due to the [[Korean War]].

Every astronaut was assigned a core competency, a special area in which they had to develop expertise, by the NASA Astronaut Office. The knowledge they gathered could then be shared with the others, and the astronaut-expert was expected to provide astronaut input to the spacecraft designers and engineers. See's special area of expertise was the spacecraft electrical and sequential systems, and the coordination of mission planning.{{sfn|Burgess|2013|p=166}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/remembering-nasa-astronauts-elliot-see-and-charles-bassett|title=Remembering NASA Astronauts Elliot See and Charles Bassett|date=February 26, 2016|website=NASA|access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref> See was tasked with determining if the crewed lunar landing should occur in direct sunlight or using light reflected from the Earth.

See was announced as the backup pilot for [[Gemini 5]] on February 8, 1965, with Armstrong serving as the backup command pilot.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=45}} They were the first civilians selected for a spaceflight.<ref>{{cite news|title=7-Day Space Flight Astronauts Selected|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=February 9, 1965|access-date=February 1, 2018|page=2|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17081486/}}</ref> Gemini 5 was launched on August 21, 1965. Early in the flight a problem was discovered with the [[fuel cell]]s, and the [[flight controller]]s considered ending the mission early. See had worked with General Electric in developing the fuel cells and was confident that they could find a solution to the problem. Flight Director [[Chris Kraft]] gave them 24 hours to fix the problem or he would terminate the flight early. After working through the night, they diagnosed the problem and developed procedures that allowed the astronauts to fix the fuel cells, which allowed the mission to continue.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=46}}

See was a [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) at MSC in Houston during the [[Gemini 7]]/[[Gemini 6A]] [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] mission in December 1965. Under the crew rotation system devised by chief astronaut [[Deke Slayton]], as the backup for Gemini 5, Armstrong and See were in line for prime crew of [[Gemini 8]].<ref name=\"NASA Bio\"/>{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=138, 168}}{{sfn|Reichl|2016|p=110}} From the spring to the fall of 1965, Armstrong and See trained for the Gemini 5 mission. They spent a significant amount of time training in the spacecraft simulators. They flew back and forth to [[Kennedy Space Center]], from which their spacecraft would be launched; to North Carolina to develop experiments to be conducted during the flight; and to [[McDonnell Aircraft]] in [[St. Louis]], where the [[Gemini spacecraft]] was made.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=45}}

On February 28, 1966, See and Bassett were flying with their backup crew, [[Gene Cernan]] and [[Thomas P. Stafford|Thomas Stafford]], from [[Ellington Air Force Base]] to [[Lambert Field]] in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, for two weeks of space rendezvous simulator training.<ref name=\"losingtm\" /> The prime crew flew in one jet and the backup crew in another. See was the pilot of their [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] trainer jet. The weather at Lambert Field was poor and required an [[instrument approach]]. Both jets overshot the initial landing attempt; See continued with a [[visual circling approach]] and Stafford elected to follow the standard procedure for a [[missed approach]]. On his second attempt, See undershot the runway, hit the afterburners and turned to the right.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=33–34}}

The jet crashed into McDonnell Aircraft Building 101, where the Gemini spacecraft was built. See was found in a parking lot still strapped to his ejection seat. Both astronauts died instantly from trauma sustained in the accident. They died within {{convert|500|ft}} of their spacecraft. See and Bassett were buried near each other in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], and the graves are about 100 yards from [[Theodore Freeman]], another astronaut who died in a T-38 crash three years prior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33458404/the_daily_sentinel/|title=Astronauts See, Bassett Paid Arlington Tributes|newspaper=The Daily Sentinel|location=Grand Junction, Colorado|date=March 4, 1966|page=14|agency=Associated Press|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=\"losingtm\">{{cite magazine |first=W.

After [[Ted Freeman]]'s wife found out he died from a reporter, NASA enacted new policies to avoid a similar embarrassing situation in the future. In compliance with these policies, astronaut [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] asked Marilyn Lovell and Jane Conrad to go to Marilyn See's house and ensure she did not find out about her husband's death from a non-NASA source. They rushed over and made excuses for their early surprise visit. After Young arrived to break the news, the three hugged her for comfort. Marilyn Lovell then went to the school to pick up Marilyn See's children, to make sure they did not find out from the press.{{sfn|Koppel|2013|pp=120–122}}

A NASA investigative panel later concluded that [[pilot error]], caused by bad weather, was the principal cause of the accident. The panel concluded that See was flying too low on his second approach, probably due to poor visibility.<ref name=\"acdnrept\">{{cite news |newspaper=Space News Roundup |publisher=NASA |title=Accident Board Reports Findings in See–Bassett Crash |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/roundups/issues/66-06-10.pdf |page=3 |date=June 10, 1966 |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013017/https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/roundups/issues/66-06-10.pdf|archive-date=March 5, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the time, See was known as one of the better pilots in the astronaut corps.{{sfn|Shayler|2000|p=82}} Slayton later expressed doubts about See's flying abilities, claiming that he flew too slowly, and \"wasn't aggressive enough... he flew too slow–a fatal problem in a plane like the T-38, which will stall easily if you get below 270 knots  [{{convert|270|kn|kph|disp=out}}].\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=167}}

[[Jim Lovell]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] were promoted to the backup crew as a result of the accident.

'''Elliot McKay See Jr.''' (July 23, 1927 – February 28, 1966) was an American [[engineer]], [[United States naval aviator|naval aviator]], [[test pilot]], and [[NASA]] [[astronaut]].

See received an appointment to the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]] in 1945. He graduated in 1949 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[marine engineering]] and a  [[United States Navy Reserve]] commission, and joined the Aircraft Gas Turbine Division of [[General Electric]] as an engineer. He was called to active duty  as a [[naval aviator]] during the [[Korean War]], and flew [[Grumman F9F Panther]] fighters with [[VA-52 (U.S. Navy)|Fighter Squadron 144]] (VF-144) from the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Randolph|CV-15|6}} in the Mediterranean, and {{USS|Boxer|CV-21|6}}  in the Western Pacific.  He married Marilyn Denahy in 1954, and they had three children.

See rejoined General Electric (GE) in 1956 as a flight test engineer after his tour of duty, and became a group leader and experimental test pilot at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], where he flew the latest jet aircraft with GE engines. He also obtained a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[aeronautical engineering]] from [[UCLA]].

Selected in NASA's [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|second group of astronauts]] in 1962, See was the prime command pilot for what would have been his first space flight, [[Gemini 9]]. He was killed along with [[Charles Bassett]], his Gemini 9 crewmate, in a [[1966 NASA T-38 crash|NASA jet crash]] at the [[St. Louis]] [[McDonnell Aircraft]] plant, where they were to undergo two weeks of [[space rendezvous]] simulator training.

==Early life and education==
Elliot McKay See Jr. was born on July 23, 1927, to Elliot See Sr. and Mamie ({{nee}} Drummond) in Dallas, Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/28957076/the_philadelphia_inquirer/|title=New Astronauts, 9 Hottest Jet Pilots in the U.S., Have Been Training a Year|newspaper=The Philadelphia Enquirer|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date=September 18, 1962|page=3|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> He was the first of two children; his sister Sally rounded out the family.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=36}} His father was an [[electrical engineer]] who worked for [[General Electric]], and his mother worked in jobs ranging from advertising to real estate.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=36}} See was active in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] for five years, and earned the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/FILESTORE/pdf/02-558.pdf|title=Astronauts and the BSA|access-date=June 25, 2016|website=[[Boy Scouts of America]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622104220/http://www.scouting.org/FILESTORE/pdf/02-558.pdf|archive-date=June 22, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> He attended [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]] and was on the varsity team in several sports, including boxing. He was also on the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) Rifle Team. He graduated from high school in 1945.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=36}}

The United States entered World War II in December 1941. See had to choose between going to war or going to college, as he would otherwise be drafted at age 18. He decided to apply for aviation cadet training. He failed a physical, and, according to See, \"going to college became the most important thing\". He enrolled at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], and after a few months pledged to [[Phi Kappa Psi]]. While at the University of Texas, he signed up for flying lessons and received his [[private pilot's license]].{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=37–38}}

See applied for military officer training and received an appointment to the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]] (USMMA) in 1945. As the end of the war drew near, the USMMA changed its curriculum to a four-year college-level program, which was the minimum requirement to be a merchant marine in peacetime. He spent his [[United States Merchant Marine Academy#Curriculum|plebe]] year at [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]], where the USMMA had a [[satellite campus]], and then transferred to the main [[campus]] at [[Kings Point, New York]]. He commanded the Third Company as a cadet officer. He was a member of the Propeller Club and head [[cheerleader]]. He was on the [[mile relay]] running team, played intramural [[softball]], and was a varsity boxer. As co-captain of the rifle team, he won the Captain Tomb Trophy for individual rifle and pistol marksmanship in December 1948.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=37–38}} In 1949,  [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized the USMMA to award [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees to its graduates,<ref>{{cite web |title=USMMA History  |website= U.S. Merchant Marine Academy |url=https://www.usmma.edu/about/usmma-history |access-date= June 7, 2019|date= January 18, 2013 }}</ref> so on graduation that year Elliott received his degree, his marine engineer's licenses, and a commission as an officer in the [[United States Navy Reserve]].{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=37–38}}

After graduation, See took a summer job with [[Lykes Brothers Steamship Company]]. On September 1, 1949, he joined the Aircraft Gas Turbine Division of General Electric, the firm his father had worked for, in [[Boston]].

Every astronaut was assigned a core competency, a special area in which they had to develop expertise, by the NASA Astronaut Office. The knowledge they gathered could then be shared with the others, and the astronaut-expert was expected to provide astronaut input to the spacecraft designers and engineers.

Early in the flight a problem was discovered with the [[fuel cell]]s, and the [[flight controller]]s considered ending the mission early. See had worked with General Electric in developing the fuel cells and was confident that they could find a solution to the problem. Flight Director [[Chris Kraft]] gave them 24 hours to fix the problem or he would terminate the flight early. After working through the night, they diagnosed the problem and developed procedures that allowed the astronauts to fix the fuel cells, which allowed the mission to continue.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=46}}

See was a [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) at MSC in Houston during the [[Gemini 7]]/[[Gemini 6A]] [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] mission in December 1965. Under the crew rotation system devised by chief astronaut [[Deke Slayton]], as the backup for Gemini 5, Armstrong and See were in line for prime crew of [[Gemini 8]].<ref name=\"NASA Bio\"/>{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=138, 168}}{{sfn|Reichl|2016|p=110}} From the spring to the fall of 1965, Armstrong and See trained for the Gemini 5 mission. They spent a significant amount of time training in the spacecraft simulators. They flew back and forth to [[Kennedy Space Center]], from which their spacecraft would be launched; to North Carolina to develop experiments to be conducted during the flight; and to [[McDonnell Aircraft]] in [[St. Louis]], where the [[Gemini spacecraft]] was made.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|p=45}}

{{main|1966 NASA T-38 crash}}

On February 28, 1966, See and Bassett were flying with their backup crew, [[Gene Cernan]] and [[Thomas P. Stafford|Thomas Stafford]], from [[Ellington Air Force Base]] to [[Lambert Field]] in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, for two weeks of space rendezvous simulator training.<ref name=\"losingtm\" /> The prime crew flew in one jet and the backup crew in another. See was the pilot of their [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] trainer jet. The weather at Lambert Field was poor and required an [[instrument approach]]. Both jets overshot the initial landing attempt; See continued with a [[visual circling approach]] and Stafford elected to follow the standard procedure for a [[missed approach]]. On his second attempt, See undershot the runway, hit the afterburners and turned to the right.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=33–34}}

The jet crashed into McDonnell Aircraft Building 101, where the Gemini spacecraft was built. See was found in a parking lot still strapped to his ejection seat. Both astronauts died instantly from trauma sustained in the accident. They died within {{convert|500|ft}} of their spacecraft. See and Bassett were buried near each other in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], and the graves are about 100 yards from [[Theodore Freeman]], another astronaut who died in a T-38 crash three years prior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33458404/the_daily_sentinel/|title=Astronauts See, Bassett Paid Arlington Tributes|newspaper=The Daily Sentinel|location=Grand Junction, Colorado|date=March 4, 1966|page=14|agency=Associated Press|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=\"losingtm\">{{cite magazine |first=W.

After [[Ted Freeman]]'s wife found out he died from a reporter, NASA enacted new policies to avoid a similar embarrassing situation in the future. In compliance with these policies, astronaut [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] asked Marilyn Lovell and Jane Conrad to go to Marilyn See's house and ensure she did not find out about her husband's death from a non-NASA source. They rushed over and made excuses for their early surprise visit. After Young arrived to break the news, the three hugged her for comfort. Marilyn Lovell then went to the school to pick up Marilyn See's children, to make sure they did not find out from the press.{{sfn|Koppel|2013|pp=120–122}}

A NASA investigative panel later concluded that [[pilot error]], caused by bad weather, was the principal cause of the accident. The panel concluded that See was flying too low on his second approach, probably due to poor visibility.<ref name=\"acdnrept\">{{cite news |newspaper=Space News Roundup |publisher=NASA |title=Accident Board Reports Findings in See–Bassett Crash |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/roundups/issues/66-06-10.pdf |page=3 |date=June 10, 1966 |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013017/https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/roundups/issues/66-06-10.pdf|archive-date=March 5, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the time, See was known as one of the better pilots in the astronaut corps.{{sfn|Shayler|2000|p=82}} Slayton later expressed doubts about See's flying abilities, claiming that he flew too slowly, and \"wasn't aggressive enough... he flew too slow–a fatal problem in a plane like the T-38, which will stall easily if you get below 270 knots  [{{convert|270|kn|kph|disp=out}}].\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=167}}

[[Jim Lovell]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] were promoted to the backup crew as a result of the accident. Stafford and Cernan–the original backup crew–were launched three months later, on June 3, as [[Gemini 9A]].{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|p=332}} The shuffling of the Gemini crews caused by the deaths of See and Bassett affected crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and [[Project Apollo]] missions.

'''Rosenheim''' is a town in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is an [[independent city]] located in the centre of the [[Rosenheim (district)|district of Rosenheim]] ([[Upper Bavaria]]), and is also the seat of its administration. It is located on the west bank of the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] at the confluence of the rivers Inn and [[Mangfall]], in the [[Bavarian Alpine Foreland]]. It is the third largest city in Upper Bavaria with over 61,000 inhabitants. Rosenheim is the economic centre and the busiest place in the region.

==Geography==
The population of the town proper is approximately 60,000 inhabitants with up to 125,000 in the surrounding area. Rosenheim is situated in the Upper-Bavarian Alpine Foothills, {{convert|450|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and covers an area of {{convert|37.52|km²|2|abbr=out}}. The capital of Bavaria, [[Munich]], is {{convert|52|km|0|abbr=off}} away in North-West direction from Rosenheim. [[Rosenheim station]] is at the junction of the [[Munich–Rosenheim railway|Munich–Rosenheim]], the [[Rosenheim–Salzburg railway|Rosenheim–Salzburg]] and the [[Rosenheim–Kufstein railway|Munich–Innsbruck]] lines.

The landscape around Rosenheim was formed during the last ice age from the advancement of the [[Inn Valley Glacier]] and later from the Rosenheim lake. The lake existed about 10,000 years ago, covering the whole [[Inn valley]] as far as [[Wasserburg am Inn]], about {{cvt|25|km}} north of Rosenheim.

Even today in many places around the town the former shoreline can be recognised where the former flat lake bed changes suddenly into relatively steep embankment.

==History==
[[File:Rosenheim heilig geist.jpg|thumb|right|Rosenheim, churches St. Nikolaus and Heilig Geist]]
Rosenheim's development can be traced from its location on intersecting major trade routes. Even in early times, the town's intersecting traffic stimulated its development as a market town. It subsequently evolved from a market to a salt trade and then [[railway town]] to today's wood and college town.

=== Pons Aeni ===
Crucial to the establishment of Rosenheim were the Inn and the corresponding [[Inntal]]. The Romans arrived in the year 15 BC under the leadership of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]]. They founded to the East right of the Inn the province [[Noricum]] and to the west of the Inn [[Raetia|Rhaetia]]. The [[Colonization|colonizers]] built a road through the [[Brenner Pass|Brenner]] to [[Castra Regina]], and one running east–west road from [[Iuvavum]] to [[Augusta Vindelicorum|Augusta Vindelicum]]. The intersection of these two enormously important trade routes were protected by a military station whose name was \"Pons Aeni\". Less frequently used terms were \"Ponte Aoni\", \"Ad enum\" or \"stations Enensis\". The Romano Celtic settlement existed for some 500 years with that name. Pons was between Aeni Isinisca ([[Aying]]) and {{ill|Bedaium|de}} (today part of [[Seeon-Seebruck]]), as shown on the Roman road map [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] from the 4th century. The name \"Pons Aeni\" can still be recognised in local place names, \"Pfunzen\" in the name of the district \"Langenpfunzen\" and \"Leonhardspfunzen\".<ref>Stefan Trux, Franz Hilger: ''Rosenheim – Tor zum Inntal.'' S. 12.</ref>

[[File:Schloss Rosenheim.jpg|thumb|Schloss Rosenheim in 1900, watercolour by Michael Kotz]]

=== Origin of the town's name ===
The origin of the town's name is not completely clear. First mentioned in 1234, Rosenheim castle is on the eastern bank of the Inn, on today's castle hill, overlooking a new bridge over the Inn. Perhaps the name comes from the Rosenheim Rose emblem of the [[Wasserburg am Inn|Wasserburger]] Earl Hall, who built the castle. Another theory is that originally the name Ross was derived from the ''Rössern'' steeds that were used in medieval times to pull the river transport vessels, and for which there were large stables in Rosenheim. Still in use today the street names ''Am Esbaum'' (the tree on which the horses were grazing) or ''Am Roßacker'' are possible indications.

Another theory suggests that there could be a kindred word ''Roas'', ''Roze'' oder ''Ried'', that used to mean swamp and peat bogs, which are still to be found around Rosenheim - evident also by the name of the neighboring town of Rosenheim [[Kolbermoor]]. An example of the old names, the nearby village of [[Riedering]]. Maybe the name is also derived from Rosenheim personal names ''Roso''/''Hrodo''.
The most beautiful word for word theory is that formerly 'Rose' used to mean a beautiful girl. It was well known among the Inn boatmen that there were many beauties to admire in this town. The sailors of the town liked to control what was called \"home of the Rose\" - in other words Rosenheim.

=== Development of Rosenheim ===
At about the time the first mention of Rosenheim castle in 1234, a settlement of boatmen developed on the western shore. The area around the Inn Bridge was not developed for a long time due to marshy soil at the proximity of the mouth of the river [[Mangfall]], so the settlement was located several hundred meters away. The centre of Rosenheim is therefore not directly on the riverside.

[[File:Rosenheim - Neue Innbrücke.jpg|thumb|right|Rosenheim and new Inn bridge on the postcard]]

=== Market Rosenheim ===
The town quickly grew in importance as a hub for all types of goods that were transported to the Inn (livestock, grain, silk, arms, salt), and received the 1328 [[Market town|Markets]] status. The Rosenheim ship masters made Rosenheim very wealthy during this era through the transport of goods, due to the location between [[Hall in Tirol]] the Inn and onwards to the Danube down to [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]]. Until about 1600 the settlement had grown into one of the largest and most important markets in Bavaria, even though [[town privileges]] were only attained in 1864 from the Bavarian King Ludwig II.

Rosenheim experienced economic decline during the 17th century in the wake of the decline of Inn Shipping Company and the consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. There were also a plague epidemic (1634) and a market fire (1641).

[[File:Rosenheim 19th century.jpg|thumb|left|Rosenheim in the 19th century]]

In the 19th century Rosenheim developed as an economic centre in the Southeast of Bavaria due to [[brine]]. In 1810 an early type of wooden pipeline brought brine from the salt mines in the area [[Bad Reichenhall|Reichenhall]] and [[Traunstein]] to Rosenheim. Boiling the salt made Rosenheim the centre of Bavarian salt production until 1958.

Expansion of the railways brought early connection to the railway. In 1858 Rosenheim station was inaugurated, which however would soon be too small and prove a hindrance for further urban development, in 1876 the station moved to its present site. The old railway line was the straight through road (now the Town Hall and Prince Regent Street, main Rosenheimer transport axis, from the northwest to the southeast of the town), the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the first station now serves as an exhibition center, the old station is directly opposite the 1878 City Hall - and is used in the [[ZDF]] evening series \"[[Die Rosenheim-Cops]]\" as the backdrop of the police headquarters.

[[File:Rosenheim 1860 A.jpg|thumb|left|Rosenheim about 1860]]

The economic boom of the late 19th and early 20th century made the [[Gründerzeit]] - and [[Art Nouveau]] (and its regional characteristics, the [[Swiss chalet style]]) the most important architectural style, which now determines the townscape. It was built in the emerging civic centre to the present Town Hall and the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in Rosenheim for rare Gothic Revival-style brick for the widening Evangelical Lutheran Church.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Rosenheim had nine breweries which are still preserved in the names of some restaurants (Duschl-, Hof-, Mail-, Pernloher-, Stern-, Weißbräu). The only survivors being \"{{ill|Auerbräu|de}}\" and \"{{ill|Flötzinger Bräu|bar||de}}\" and supply, among others, the \"[[Märzen]]\" for the \"{{ill|Rosenheimer Herbstfest|de}}\", as well as the Bierbichler Weißbräu.

=== Rosenheim in the Nazi era ===
[[File:Fuente de Juan Nepomuceno, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 63.jpg|thumb|Nepomuk statue]]
[[File:Iglesia de San Salvador, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 59.jpg|thumb|150px|Redeemer church]]
The number of Jews living in Rosenheim was high compared to other Bavarian cities.  However, at the start of the 20th century, the Jewish community consisted of about 50 people. The request to the city council for establishment of a separate Jewish religious association, with reference to the Bavarian-Jewish legislation, was refused, so the Rosenheim Jews remained attached to the state capital, where their dead also had to be buried.  Even the funeral of the First World War fallen son of a Jewish merchant based in Rosenheim at the city cemetery was refused and was \"the biggest disappointment and the bitterest pain\" for the father.
[[File:Mittertor, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 65.jpg|thumb|left|Mittertor, old town entrance]]

With the creation of the first local Nazi group outside of Munich in 1920, the Rosenheim Jews saw increasing hostility.  Centre of hate campaigns was the Rosenheim School.  A scandal occurred in June 1920, after a reader accused the writer of a letter titled \"Rosenheimer Jews\" in the local press, who wanted to repeal the provisions of the Versailles Treaty and held military exercises  at the Rosenheim School.  Seven members of the high school and a member of the \"Chiemgau\" then raided a villa inhabited by Jews in the ''Herbststrasse''.  The college of the town of Rosenheim, on July 29, 1920 came to the conclusion that {{\"|… es sei bedauerlich, dass die Bewegung zur Bekämpfung eines volksausbeuterischen Judentums […], die in ihrem Wesen gewiß berechtigt sei, durch solche Auswüchse in Mißkredit komme.}} \"... it was regrettable that the people's movement to fight exploitative Jews[...], which certainly was justified in its nature, has been discredited.\" Protests of the Bavarian Jewish Central Association were unsuccessful, only an unmistakable message of the Bavarian Interior Ministry September 1920 was able to maintain peace.
[[File:Lokschuppen in Rosenheim02 klein.jpg|thumb|right|Lokschuppen exhibition center]]

On April 1, 1933, shortly after the Nazi seizure of power, guards were set up in front of Jewish shops, warning against buying in these stores, but to desist assault and criminal damage.  A large proportion of the population ignored these calls.  The shops were therefore still frequented, much to the annoyance of Nazi activists who acted with the backing of then-Mayor Gmelch.  Despite the support of the population, six of the eleven Jewish business owners gave up their businesses by 1937.

The assassination of German diplomat vom Rath by the Jew Herschel Grynszpan on 7 November 1938 in Paris was taken as a final opportunity to strike against the Jews. The [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] came with 8 to 10 men on November 10 at 3–4 o'clock in the morning to the last two Jewish shops and destroyed their inventory and merchandise.

The fate of many Rosenheim Jews is documented. Those who could, emigrated, mostly to the United States. However, many failed entry and exit applications, and many died in concentration camps.<ref name=\"RiDR\">Rosenheim im Dritten Reich; Beiträge zur Stadtgeschichte, editor Kulturamt der Stadt Rosenheim 1989</ref>

===Bombing during the Second World War ===
[[File:Westerndorf.jpg|thumb|St. John the Baptist church and [[Bavarian Alps]]]]

From the beginning of bombing raids on German cities in the spring of 1942, Rosenheim was not spared.  In November 1943 there were shelters for only 650 people for a population of approximately 22,000. However, by February 1944 shelters had been built for about 6400 people and in conjunction with other shelters a total of 10,525 people could be protected.

During 14 bomb attacks, 201 people were killed and 179 injured. The focus of the air attacks was the railway station and the railway tracks, as Rosenheim was an important transportation hub between Munich, Salzburg and Innsbruck. The neighbouring communities of Ziegelberg, Stephanskirchen, Westerndorf St. Peter and Oberpfaffenhofen were also hit. The first air attack was on 20 October 1944 at lunch time from 12:47 to 13:17 o'clock with over a hundred aircraft dropping 1,000 bombs, leaving 27 dead and 59 wounded. The heaviest air raid took place on 18 April 1945. From 14:40 to 14:55 around 200 to 1300 aircraft dropped bombs in the area around the station, resulting in 53 dead and 36 injured, in addition, this attack also made 800 people homeless. The station building was almost completely destroyed and railway tracks were destroyed over a length of 20 kilometers. The last air attacks were made on 19 and 21 April 1945. During the war the majority of at least 173 unexploded bombs were recovered. In 1964, the ''[[Oberbayerisches Volksblatt]]'' reported that the approximate location of 38 undiscovered unexploded ordnance was known.<ref name=\"RiDR\"/>

===Coat of arms===
[[File:RO Riedergarten 2013-04.jpg|thumb|Riedergarten]]

The emblem of Rosenheim shows a white rose on a red background.  This may indicate the former arms of [[Wasserburg am Inn]] have returned, because Wasserburg ruled Rosenheim until 1247. The oldest known seal of Rosenheim was built in 1374 and already shows the rose, which has not changed since.  The only exception is a picture by [[Philipp Apian]], which was painted around the year 1568 and shows a border around the rose.<ref>Wappenverzeichnis: [http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/r/rosenhei.htm http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/r/rosenhei.htm]</ref>

There exists also a logo for Rosenheim, containing the same rose which is present on the coat of arms.

=== Theater ===
The ''Kultur- und Kongresszentrum Rosenheim (KU'KO)'' (Culture and Congress Centre) was built on the site of the [[brine]] works, demolished in 1967. Inaugurated on October 2, 1982 as the town hall, now the Culture and Congress Centre Rosenheim has evolved over the years into a national event centre.  Today in the 3000-square-foot multipurpose building approximately 400 events are held annually.

Since 1885, the {{ill|Mittertor|de}} has housed the Municipal Museum with a large collection (about 5000 exhibits) of the cultural history of the town and [[Rosenheim (district)|district of Rosenheim]], from the prehistory and early history and Roman times to the recent town history in the 20th century. It is one of the most important regional history collections in South East Upper Bavaria.

The Inn Museum houses the hydraulic engineering and marine technology collection of the Rosenheim Water Management Office and is located in the historic river master's ''Bruckbaustadel'' at the Inn Bridge.  With many original objects, the museum displays the Inn Shipping Company, the source of Rosenheim's prosperity in the Middle Ages, in the past centuries.  In addition, the museum provides facts about the river landscape and river engineering, geology, settlement history, marine engineering, bridge design and the development of waterways.

The ''Wood technology Museum'' was established in 1990 in the listed Ellmaierhaus. It is housed on the first floor, which is accessed via the so-called Jacob's ladder.  At more than 400 square meters of exhibition space displays this unique museum, which is closely related to the ''timber town of Rosenheim'' and its training centres for wood occupations, wood as a raw material, its importance and processing past and present.  The exhibition shows not only the end products, but also their production and the necessary tools.  Regular special exhibitions complete the offer of the ''Wood technology Museum''.

The Municipal Gallery of 1935-1937 was built by [[German Bestelmeyer]]. Every year, six art exhibitions are held here. In addition to contemporary art, also exhibitions of works from the 19th and 20th century are held.  A thematic focus is the art from the region and the [[Munich School]].

The ''{{ill|Lokschuppen Rosenheim|lt=Lokschuppen|de}}'' is an internationally renowned exhibition centre with annually changing exhibitions in the former railways round house.

The brine pump house is one of the few monuments in the town which recall time from 1810 to 1958 of Rosenheim's brine industry.<ref>Ludwig Gassner: ''Rosenheim und dessen Umgebung. Für Fremde und Einheimische unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Heilbades Rosenheim''. Rosenheim 1865 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=A8lAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP5 online]).</ref> As part of the National Exposition ''salt makes history'', the town renovated the historic, listed building and set up an exhibition room about Rosenheim's [[brine]] history. Admission is only possible with town guides or by agreement with the Metropolitan Museum.

The ''{{ill|Klepper Faltbootwerft|lt=Klepper|de||nl|Klepper (kano)}}'' museum houses various exhibits, on the one hand the history of the Klepper [[folding boat]], coats and tents.  On the other hand, it is also dedicated to the development of the company Klepper, who was once the biggest employer in Rosenheim.

The Mittertor (the sole survivor of five market gates) was the eastern gate of the market before 1350, which was then protected with a double ditch. Since the 15th century, it separated the interior from the exterior of the market served as a customs office. Until the 19th century it also contained several municipal facilities such as the [[Clerk (municipal official)|town clerk's]] office. After the great fire in 1641 the Rosenheim onion dome was built and later extended into a long building.  At its core is the Mittertor the oldest building in town.  On the façade to the side of the square is the emblem of Louis Rosenheim, with the white rose against a red background. The [[coat of arms of Bavaria|Bavarian crest]] can also be seen here.

The street ''Münchener Strasse'' follows the ''Gillitzerblock'', that is also called \"small pedestrian zone.\"  Immediately apparent are the magnificently restored [[Gründerzeit]] fronts.  The name ''Gillitzerblock'' come from its builder Thomas Gillitzer.  At the end of the 19th century he obtained a relatively large area of land, for its day, and built 15 houses, including the Hotel ''Deutscher Kaiser''. Since the 1960s, the once solely Gründerzeit ensemble has been altered with new construction and renovations.  Only the façades in ''Münchener Strasse'' have been preserved and restored to the original.

The ''Quest-{{ill|Kunstmühle|de}}'' was built from 1855 to 1916 in several phases as industrial complexes. ''Kunstmühle'' was at these times the name for technically advanced mills - German ''Kunst'' means art. The mill was renovated in the 1990s and now serves as a restaurant and office space. The ''Quest-Kunstmühle'' Power station is located on the Mangfallkanal. The former mill houses the exhibition halls of the Rosenheim arts club. The approximately {{convert|200|m²|0|abbr=out}} upper floor holds exhibitions of contemporary artists, exchange exhibitions with other art associations and activities accompanying the exhibition.

The Rosenheim ballroom was built in the former Rosenheim Hofbräus buildings. The hall with ballroom and vaulted cellar was built in 1878. It was renovated in 1994 and since 2001 has been used as an event space, with its many possible uses of the centre of the eastern town of Rosenheim.

The town's landmark is the gothic spire ({{convert|65|m|0|abbr=on}}) of the parish church St. Nikolaus ({{convert|1450|m|0|abbr=on}}) with its baroque [[onion dome]] ({{convert|1641|m|0|abbr=on}}).

=== Parks ===
The ''Kunstwiese'' shows three-dimensional contemporary art works by artists from Rosenheim all year round.

The ''Riedergarten'' was created in 1729 as a private herb garden by Rosenheim pharmacist Johann Rieder. It was sold to the town in 1925 by physician Dr. Herman Rieder for use as a summer garden. In 2002 the garden was redesigned by the opening up of a previously culverted stream, adding a modern character.

Since 1987 the ''Salingarten'', in front of the Culture and Congress Centre Ku'Ko, has been used as a sculpture garden. Large sculptures by important sculptors from Rosenheim and environment can be seen here.

}}
'''Rosenheim''' is a town in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is an [[independent city]] located in the centre of the [[Rosenheim (district)|district of Rosenheim]] ([[Upper Bavaria]]), and is also the seat of its administration. It is located on the west bank of the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] at the confluence of the rivers Inn and [[Mangfall]], in the [[Bavarian Alpine Foreland]]. It is the third largest city in Upper Bavaria with over 61,000 inhabitants. Rosenheim is the economic centre and the busiest place in the region.

==Geography==
The population of the town proper is approximately 60,000 inhabitants with up to 125,000 in the surrounding area. Rosenheim is situated in the Upper-Bavarian Alpine Foothills, {{convert|450|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and covers an area of {{convert|37.52|km²|2|abbr=out}}. The capital of Bavaria, [[Munich]], is {{convert|52|km|0|abbr=off}} away in North-West direction from Rosenheim. [[Rosenheim station]] is at the junction of the [[Munich–Rosenheim railway|Munich–Rosenheim]], the [[Rosenheim–Salzburg railway|Rosenheim–Salzburg]] and the [[Rosenheim–Kufstein railway|Munich–Innsbruck]] lines.

The landscape around Rosenheim was formed during the last ice age from the advancement of the [[Inn Valley Glacier]] and later from the Rosenheim lake. The lake existed about 10,000 years ago, covering the whole [[Inn valley]] as far as [[Wasserburg am Inn]], about {{cvt|25|km}} north of Rosenheim.

Even today in many places around the town the former shoreline can be recognised where the former flat lake bed changes suddenly into relatively steep embankment.

==History==
[[File:Rosenheim heilig geist.jpg|thumb|right|Rosenheim, churches St. Nikolaus and Heilig Geist]]
Rosenheim's development can be traced from its location on intersecting major trade routes. Even in early times, the town's intersecting traffic stimulated its development as a market town. It subsequently evolved from a market to a salt trade and then [[railway town]] to today's wood and college town.

=== Pons Aeni ===
Crucial to the establishment of Rosenheim were the Inn and the corresponding [[Inntal]]. The Romans arrived in the year 15 BC under the leadership of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]]. They founded to the East right of the Inn the province [[Noricum]] and to the west of the Inn [[Raetia|Rhaetia]]. The [[Colonization|colonizers]] built a road through the [[Brenner Pass|Brenner]] to [[Castra Regina]], and one running east–west road from [[Iuvavum]] to [[Augusta Vindelicorum|Augusta Vindelicum]]. The intersection of these two enormously important trade routes were protected by a military station whose name was \"Pons Aeni\". Less frequently used terms were \"Ponte Aoni\", \"Ad enum\" or \"stations Enensis\". The Romano Celtic settlement existed for some 500 years with that name. Pons was between Aeni Isinisca ([[Aying]]) and {{ill|Bedaium|de}} (today part of [[Seeon-Seebruck]]), as shown on the Roman road map [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] from the 4th century. The name \"Pons Aeni\" can still be recognised in local place names, \"Pfunzen\" in the name of the district \"Langenpfunzen\" and \"Leonhardspfunzen\".<ref>Stefan Trux, Franz Hilger: ''Rosenheim – Tor zum Inntal.'' S. 12.</ref>

[[File:Schloss Rosenheim.jpg|thumb|Schloss Rosenheim in 1900, watercolour by Michael Kotz]]

=== Origin of the town's name ===
The origin of the town's name is not completely clear. First mentioned in 1234, Rosenheim castle is on the eastern bank of the Inn, on today's castle hill, overlooking a new bridge over the Inn. Perhaps the name comes from the Rosenheim Rose emblem of the [[Wasserburg am Inn|Wasserburger]] Earl Hall, who built the castle. Another theory is that originally the name Ross was derived from the ''Rössern'' steeds that were used in medieval times to pull the river transport vessels, and for which there were large stables in Rosenheim. Still in use today the street names ''Am Esbaum'' (the tree on which the horses were grazing) or ''Am Roßacker'' are possible indications.

Another theory suggests that there could be a kindred word ''Roas'', ''Roze'' oder ''Ried'', that used to mean swamp and peat bogs, which are still to be found around Rosenheim - evident also by the name of the neighboring town of Rosenheim [[Kolbermoor]]. An example of the old names, the nearby village of [[Riedering]]. Maybe the name is also derived from Rosenheim personal names ''Roso''/''Hrodo''.
The most beautiful word for word theory is that formerly 'Rose' used to mean a beautiful girl. It was well known among the Inn boatmen that there were many beauties to admire in this town. The sailors of the town liked to control what was called \"home of the Rose\" - in other words Rosenheim.

=== Development of Rosenheim ===
At about the time the first mention of Rosenheim castle in 1234, a settlement of boatmen developed on the western shore. The area around the Inn Bridge was not developed for a long time due to marshy soil at the proximity of the mouth of the river [[Mangfall]], so the settlement was located several hundred meters away. The centre of Rosenheim is therefore not directly on the riverside.

[[File:Rosenheim - Neue Innbrücke.jpg|thumb|right|Rosenheim and new Inn bridge on the postcard]]

=== Market Rosenheim ===
The town quickly grew in importance as a hub for all types of goods that were transported to the Inn (livestock, grain, silk, arms, salt), and received the 1328 [[Market town|Markets]] status. The Rosenheim ship masters made Rosenheim very wealthy during this era through the transport of goods, due to the location between [[Hall in Tirol]] the Inn and onwards to the Danube down to [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]]. Until about 1600 the settlement had grown into one of the largest and most important markets in Bavaria, even though [[town privileges]] were only attained in 1864 from the Bavarian King Ludwig II.

Rosenheim experienced economic decline during the 17th century in the wake of the decline of Inn Shipping Company and the consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. There were also a plague epidemic (1634) and a market fire (1641).

[[File:Rosenheim 19th century.jpg|thumb|left|Rosenheim in the 19th century]]

In the 19th century Rosenheim developed as an economic centre in the Southeast of Bavaria due to [[brine]]. In 1810 an early type of wooden pipeline brought brine from the salt mines in the area [[Bad Reichenhall|Reichenhall]] and [[Traunstein]] to Rosenheim. Boiling the salt made Rosenheim the centre of Bavarian salt production until 1958.

Expansion of the railways brought early connection to the railway. In 1858 Rosenheim station was inaugurated, which however would soon be too small and prove a hindrance for further urban development, in 1876 the station moved to its present site. The old railway line was the straight through road (now the Town Hall and Prince Regent Street, main Rosenheimer transport axis, from the northwest to the southeast of the town), the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the first station now serves as an exhibition center, the old station is directly opposite the 1878 City Hall - and is used in the [[ZDF]] evening series \"[[Die Rosenheim-Cops]]\" as the backdrop of the police headquarters.

[[File:Rosenheim 1860 A.jpg|thumb|left|Rosenheim about 1860]]

The economic boom of the late 19th and early 20th century made the [[Gründerzeit]] - and [[Art Nouveau]] (and its regional characteristics, the [[Swiss chalet style]]) the most important architectural style, which now determines the townscape. It was built in the emerging civic centre to the present Town Hall and the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in Rosenheim for rare Gothic Revival-style brick for the widening Evangelical Lutheran Church.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Rosenheim had nine breweries which are still preserved in the names of some restaurants (Duschl-, Hof-, Mail-, Pernloher-, Stern-, Weißbräu). The only survivors being \"{{ill|Auerbräu|de}}\" and \"{{ill|Flötzinger Bräu|bar||de}}\" and supply, among others, the \"[[Märzen]]\" for the \"{{ill|Rosenheimer Herbstfest|de}}\", as well as the Bierbichler Weißbräu.

=== Rosenheim in the Nazi era ===
[[File:Fuente de Juan Nepomuceno, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 63.jpg|thumb|Nepomuk statue]]
[[File:Iglesia de San Salvador, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 59.jpg|thumb|150px|Redeemer church]]
The number of Jews living in Rosenheim was high compared to other Bavarian cities.  However, at the start of the 20th century, the Jewish community consisted of about 50 people. The request to the city council for establishment of a separate Jewish religious association, with reference to the Bavarian-Jewish legislation, was refused, so the Rosenheim Jews remained attached to the state capital, where their dead also had to be buried.  Even the funeral of the First World War fallen son of a Jewish merchant based in Rosenheim at the city cemetery was refused and was \"the biggest disappointment and the bitterest pain\" for the father.
[[File:Mittertor, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 65.jpg|thumb|left|Mittertor, old town entrance]]

With the creation of the first local Nazi group outside of Munich in 1920, the Rosenheim Jews saw increasing hostility.  Centre of hate campaigns was the Rosenheim School.  A scandal occurred in June 1920, after a reader accused the writer of a letter titled \"Rosenheimer Jews\" in the local press, who wanted to repeal the provisions of the Versailles Treaty and held military exercises  at the Rosenheim School.  Seven members of the high school and a member of the \"Chiemgau\" then raided a villa inhabited by Jews in the ''Herbststrasse''.  The college of the town of Rosenheim, on July 29, 1920 came to the conclusion that {{\"|… es sei bedauerlich, dass die Bewegung zur Bekämpfung eines volksausbeuterischen Judentums […], die in ihrem Wesen gewiß berechtigt sei, durch solche Auswüchse in Mißkredit komme.}} \"... it was regrettable that the people's movement to fight exploitative Jews[...], which certainly was justified in its nature, has been discredited.\" Protests of the Bavarian Jewish Central Association were unsuccessful, only an unmistakable message of the Bavarian Interior Ministry September 1920 was able to maintain peace.
[[File:Lokschuppen in Rosenheim02 klein.jpg|thumb|right|Lokschuppen exhibition center]]

On April 1, 1933, shortly after the Nazi seizure of power, guards were set up in front of Jewish shops, warning against buying in these stores, but to desist assault and criminal damage.  A large proportion of the population ignored these calls.  The shops were therefore still frequented, much to the annoyance of Nazi activists who acted with the backing of then-Mayor Gmelch.  Despite the support of the population, six of the eleven Jewish business owners gave up their businesses by 1937.

The assassination of German diplomat vom Rath by the Jew Herschel Grynszpan on 7 November 1938 in Paris was taken as a final opportunity to strike against the Jews. The [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] came with 8 to 10 men on November 10 at 3–4 o'clock in the morning to the last two Jewish shops and destroyed their inventory and merchandise.

The fate of many Rosenheim Jews is documented. Those who could, emigrated, mostly to the United States. However, many failed entry and exit applications, and many died in concentration camps.<ref name=\"RiDR\">Rosenheim im Dritten Reich; Beiträge zur Stadtgeschichte, editor Kulturamt der Stadt Rosenheim 1989</ref>

===Bombing during the Second World War ===
[[File:Westerndorf.jpg|thumb|St. John the Baptist church and [[Bavarian Alps]]]]

From the beginning of bombing raids on German cities in the spring of 1942, Rosenheim was not spared.  In November 1943 there were shelters for only 650 people for a population of approximately 22,000. However, by February 1944 shelters had been built for about 6400 people and in conjunction with other shelters a total of 10,525 people could be protected.

During 14 bomb attacks, 201 people were killed and 179 injured. The focus of the air attacks was the railway station and the railway tracks, as Rosenheim was an important transportation hub between Munich, Salzburg and Innsbruck. The neighbouring communities of Ziegelberg, Stephanskirchen, Westerndorf St. Peter and Oberpfaffenhofen were also hit. The first air attack was on 20 October 1944 at lunch time from 12:47 to 13:17 o'clock with over a hundred aircraft dropping 1,000 bombs, leaving 27 dead and 59 wounded. The heaviest air raid took place on 18 April 1945. From 14:40 to 14:55 around 200 to 1300 aircraft dropped bombs in the area around the station, resulting in 53 dead and 36 injured, in addition, this attack also made 800 people homeless. The station building was almost completely destroyed and railway tracks were destroyed over a length of 20 kilometers. The last air attacks were made on 19 and 21 April 1945. During the war the majority of at least 173 unexploded bombs were recovered. In 1964, the ''[[Oberbayerisches Volksblatt]]'' reported that the approximate location of 38 undiscovered unexploded ordnance was known.<ref name=\"RiDR\"/>

===Coat of arms===
[[File:RO Riedergarten 2013-04.jpg|thumb|Riedergarten]]

The emblem of Rosenheim shows a white rose on a red background.  This may indicate the former arms of [[Wasserburg am Inn]] have returned, because Wasserburg ruled Rosenheim until 1247. The oldest known seal of Rosenheim was built in 1374 and already shows the rose, which has not changed since.  The only exception is a picture by [[Philipp Apian]], which was painted around the year 1568 and shows a border around the rose.<ref>Wappenverzeichnis: [http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/r/rosenhei.htm http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/r/rosenhei.htm]</ref>

There exists also a logo for Rosenheim, containing the same rose which is present on the coat of arms.

[[File:Mangfalleinmündung in den Inn.jpg|thumb|Confluence of the river [[Mangfall]] in the river [[Inn (river)|Inn]]]]
Since 1885, the {{ill|Mittertor|de}} has housed the Municipal Museum with a large collection (about 5000 exhibits) of the cultural history of the town and [[Rosenheim (district)|district of Rosenheim]], from the prehistory and early history and Roman times to the recent town history in the 20th century. It is one of the most important regional history collections in South East Upper Bavaria.

The Inn Museum houses the hydraulic engineering and marine technology collection of the Rosenheim Water Management Office and is located in the historic river master's ''Bruckbaustadel'' at the Inn Bridge.  With many original objects, the museum displays the Inn Shipping Company, the source of Rosenheim's prosperity in the Middle Ages, in the past centuries.  In addition, the museum provides facts about the river landscape and river engineering, geology, settlement history, marine engineering, bridge design and the development of waterways.

The ''Wood technology Museum'' was established in 1990 in the listed Ellmaierhaus. It is housed on the first floor, which is accessed via the so-called Jacob's ladder.  At more than 400 square meters of exhibition space displays this unique museum, which is closely related to the ''timber town of Rosenheim'' and its training centres for wood occupations, wood as a raw material, its importance and processing past and present.  The exhibition shows not only the end products, but also their production and the necessary tools.  Regular special exhibitions complete the offer of the ''Wood technology Museum''.

The Municipal Gallery of 1935-1937 was built by [[German Bestelmeyer]]. Every year, six art exhibitions are held here. In addition to contemporary art, also exhibitions of works from the 19th and 20th century are held.  A thematic focus is the art from the region and the [[Munich School]].

The ''{{ill|Lokschuppen Rosenheim|lt=Lokschuppen|de}}'' is an internationally renowned exhibition centre with annually changing exhibitions in the former railways round house.

The brine pump house is one of the few monuments in the town which recall time from 1810 to 1958 of Rosenheim's brine industry.<ref>Ludwig Gassner: ''Rosenheim und dessen Umgebung. Für Fremde und Einheimische unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Heilbades Rosenheim''. Rosenheim 1865 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=A8lAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP5 online]).</ref> As part of the National Exposition ''salt makes history'', the town renovated the historic, listed building and set up an exhibition room about Rosenheim's [[brine]] history. Admission is only possible with town guides or by agreement with the Metropolitan Museum.

The ''{{ill|Klepper Faltbootwerft|lt=Klepper|de||nl|Klepper (kano)}}'' museum houses various exhibits, on the one hand the history of the Klepper [[folding boat]], coats and tents.  On the other hand, it is also dedicated to the development of the company Klepper, who was once the biggest employer in Rosenheim.

===Architecture ===
[[File:Lokschuppen in Rosenheim05 klein Trux.jpg|thumb|Town Hall Rosenheim]]
The Mittertor (the sole survivor of five market gates) was the eastern gate of the market before 1350, which was then protected with a double ditch. Since the 15th century, it separated the interior from the exterior of the market served as a customs office. Until the 19th century it also contained several municipal facilities such as the [[Clerk (municipal official)|town clerk's]] office. After the great fire in 1641 the Rosenheim onion dome was built and later extended into a long building.  At its core is the Mittertor the oldest building in town.  On the façade to the side of the square is the emblem of Louis Rosenheim, with the white rose against a red background. The [[coat of arms of Bavaria|Bavarian crest]] can also be seen here.

The street ''Münchener Strasse'' follows the ''Gillitzerblock'', that is also called \"small pedestrian zone.\"  Immediately apparent are the magnificently restored [[Gründerzeit]] fronts.  The name ''Gillitzerblock'' come from its builder Thomas Gillitzer.  At the end of the 19th century he obtained a relatively large area of land, for its day, and built 15 houses, including the Hotel ''Deutscher Kaiser''. Since the 1960s, the once solely Gründerzeit ensemble has been altered with new construction and renovations.  Only the façades in ''Münchener Strasse'' have been preserved and restored to the original.

The ''Quest-{{ill|Kunstmühle|de}}'' was built from 1855 to 1916 in several phases as industrial complexes. ''Kunstmühle'' was at these times the name for technically advanced mills - German ''Kunst'' means art. The mill was renovated in the 1990s and now serves as a restaurant and office space. The ''Quest-Kunstmühle'' Power station is located on the Mangfallkanal. The former mill houses the exhibition halls of the Rosenheim arts club. The approximately {{convert|200|m²|0|abbr=out}} upper floor holds exhibitions of contemporary artists, exchange exhibitions with other art associations and activities accompanying the exhibition.

The Rosenheim ballroom was built in the former Rosenheim Hofbräus buildings. The hall with ballroom and vaulted cellar was built in 1878. It was renovated in 1994 and since 2001 has been used as an event space, with its many possible uses of the centre of the eastern town of Rosenheim.

The town's landmark is the gothic spire ({{convert|65|m|0|abbr=on}}) of the parish church St. Nikolaus ({{convert|1450|m|0|abbr=on}}) with its baroque [[onion dome]] ({{convert|1641|m|0|abbr=on}}).

=== Parks ===
The ''Kunstwiese'' shows three-dimensional contemporary art works by artists from Rosenheim all year round.

The ''Riedergarten'' was created in 1729 as a private herb garden by Rosenheim pharmacist Johann Rieder. It was sold to the town in 1925 by physician Dr. Herman Rieder for use as a summer garden. In 2002 the garden was redesigned by the opening up of a previously culverted stream, adding a modern character.

Since 1987 the ''Salingarten'', in front of the Culture and Congress Centre Ku'Ko, has been used as a sculpture garden. Large sculptures by important sculptors from Rosenheim and environment can be seen here.

\"'''The Tell-Tale Heart'''\" is a [[short story]] by American writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]], first published in 1843. It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator’s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.

The story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.

The specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator, and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, \"[the old man] never wronged\", the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. 

Critics argue that the old man could be a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents a veiled secret or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.

==Plot summary==
[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]
\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". 

The old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.

On the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. The narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.

The narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.

== Publication history ==
[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]
\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.

Poe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}, p. 201.</ref> Its original publication included an epigraph which quoted [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s poem \"[[A Psalm of Life]]\".<ref name=Moss151>Moss, Sidney P.

Southern Illinois University Press, 1969. p. 151</ref> The story was slightly revised when republished in the August 23, 1845, edition of the ''[[Broadway Journal]]''.

== Analysis ==
\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" uses an [[unreliable narrator]]. The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>

The narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed. Cambridge University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-521-42243-7}}, p. 30.</ref> In any case, the narrator tells the story in great detail.<ref name=\"Cleman-p70\">Cleman, John. \"Irresistible Impulses: Edgar Allan Poe and the Insanity Defense\", in ''Bloom's BioCritiques: Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Harold Bloom.

Cooper Square Press, 1992. p. 101. {{ISBN|0-8154-1038-7}}</ref> Every word contributes to the purpose of moving the story forward, exemplifying Poe's theories about the writing of short stories.<ref>Quinn, Arthur Hobson.

The story is driven not by the narrator's insistence upon their \"innocence\", but by their insistence on their sanity. This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E. Arthur. \"Poe's 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\" in ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Poe's Tales'', edited by William L. Howarth. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc., 1971, p. 94.</ref> Their denial of insanity is based on their systematic actions and their precision, as they provide a rational explanation for irrational behavior.<ref name=\"Cleman-p70\"/> This rationality, however, is undermined by their lack of motive (\"Object there was none. Passion there was none.\"). Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/> It is difficult to fully understand the narrator's true emotions about the blue eyed man because of this contradiction. It is said that \"At the same time he disclosed a deep psychological confusion\", referring to the narrator and his comment that \"Object there was none. Passion there was none\" and that the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=E. Arthur |title=Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" |journal=University of California Press |volume=19 |issue=4 |page=369 |pages=369-378 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2932876?seq=1 |accessdate=4/13/20}}</ref>




The story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\"; which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. The guilt in the narrator can be seen when the narrator confessed to the police that the body of the old man was under the floor boards. Even though the old man was dead, the body and heart of the dead man still seemed to haunt the narrator and convict him of his ungodly deeds. \"Since such processes of reasoning tend to convict the speaker of madness, it does not seem out of keeping that he is driven to confession...\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=E. Arthur |title=Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" |journal=University of California Press |volume=19 |issue=4 |page=369 |pages=369-378 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2932876?seq=1 |accessdate=4/13/20}}</ref> \"Poe and the Gothic Tradition\", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J. Hayes. Cambridge University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-521-79727-6}}, p. 87.</ref> Poe's contemporaries may well have been reminded of the controversy over the [[insanity defense]] in the 1840s.<ref name=\"Cleman-p66\">Cleman, ''Bloom's BioCritiques'', p. 66.</ref>

The narrator claims to have a disease that causes [[Sensitivity (human)|hypersensitivity]]. A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing deathwatch beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''. Second quarter, 1969.</ref> [[Henry David Thoreau]] observed in an 1838 article that deathwatch beetles make sounds similar to a heartbeat.<ref>Robison, E. Arthur. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1971105.htm Thoreau and the Deathwatch in Poe's 'The Tell-Tale Heart']\", in ''Poe Studies'', vol. IV, no. 1. June 1971. pp. 14-16</ref> The beating could even be the sound of the narrator's own heart. Alternatively, if the beating is really a product of the narrator's imagination, it is that uncontrolled imagination that leads to their own destruction.<ref name=\"Eddings-p213\">Eddings, Dennis W. \"Theme and Parody in 'The Raven'\", in ''Poe and His Times: The Artist and His Milieu'', edited by Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV. Baltimore: The Edgar Allan Poe Society, 1990. {{ISBN|0-9616449-2-3}}, p. 213.</ref>

It is also possible that the narrator has [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. Paranoid schizophrenics very often experience auditory hallucinations. These auditory hallucinations are more often voices, but can also be sounds.<ref name=\"Zimmerman-p39-48\">ZIMMERMAN, BRETT. “‘Moral Insanity’ or Paranoid Schizophrenia: Poe's ‘The Tell-Tale Heart.’” Mosaic: A Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature, vol. 25, no. 2, 1992, pp. 39–48. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24780617.</ref> This is of course a very modern view of the work; in Poe's era there was no such diagnosis, and Poe would not have been familiar with a set of symptoms as pertaining to any definite mental disease. 

The relationship between the old man and the narrator is ambiguous. Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong. The murder of the eye, then, is a removal of conscience.<ref name=\"Hoffman-p223\">Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1972. {{ISBN|0-8071-2321-8}}, p. 223.</ref> The eye may also represent secrecy: only when the eye is found open on the final night, penetrating the veil of secrecy, is the murder carried out.<ref name=\"Benfey-p33\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 33.</ref>

[[Richard Wilbur]] suggested that the tale is an allegorical representation of Poe's poem \"[[To Science]]\", which depicts a struggle between imagination and science. In \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", the old man may thus represent the scientific and rational mind, while the narrator may stand for the imaginative.<ref name=\"Benfey-pp31-32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', pp. 31-32.</ref>

\"'''The Tell-Tale Heart'''\" is a [[short story]] by American writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]], first published in 1843. It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator’s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.

The story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.

The specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator, and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, \"[the old man] never wronged\", the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. 

Critics argue that the old man could be a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents a veiled secret or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.

==Plot summary==
[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]
\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". 

The old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.

On the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. The narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.

The narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.

== Publication history ==
[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]
\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.

Poe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}, p. 201.</ref> Its original publication included an epigraph which quoted [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s poem \"[[A Psalm of Life]]\".<ref name=Moss151>Moss, Sidney P. ''Poe's Literary Battles: The Critic in the Context of His Literary Milieu''. Southern Illinois University Press, 1969. p. 151</ref> The story was slightly revised when republished in the August 23, 1845, edition of the ''[[Broadway Journal]]''. This edition omitted Longfellow's poem because Poe believed it was plagiarized.<ref name=Moss151/> \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was reprinted several additional times during Poe's lifetime.<ref name=\"eapoe\">{{cite web | date = September 30, 2007 | url = http://www.eapoe.org/works/tales/index.htm | title = \"The Tales of Edgar Allan Poe\" (index) | work = eapoe.org | publisher = The Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore | accessdate = 2007-11-05}}</ref>

== Analysis ==
\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" uses an [[unreliable narrator]]. The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>

The narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed. Cambridge University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-521-42243-7}}, p. 30.</ref> In any case, the narrator tells the story in great detail.<ref name=\"Cleman-p70\">Cleman, John. \"Irresistible Impulses: Edgar Allan Poe and the Insanity Defense\", in ''Bloom's BioCritiques: Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Harold Bloom. Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7910-6173-6}}, p. 70.</ref> What follows is a study of terror but, more specifically, the memory of terror as the narrator is relating events from the past.<ref>Quinn, Arthur Hobson. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8018-5730-9}}. p. 394</ref> The first word of the story, \"True!\", is an admission of their guilt, as well as an assurance of reliability.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\"/> This introduction also serves to gain the reader's attention.<ref>Meyers, Jeffrey.

Cooper Square Press, 1992. p. 101. {{ISBN|0-8154-1038-7}}</ref> Every word contributes to the purpose of moving the story forward, exemplifying Poe's theories about the writing of short stories.<ref>Quinn, Arthur Hobson.

The story is driven not by the narrator's insistence upon their \"innocence\", but by their insistence on their sanity. This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E. Arthur. \"Poe's 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\" in ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Poe's Tales'', edited by William L. Howarth. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc., 1971, p. 94.</ref> Their denial of insanity is based on their systematic actions and their precision, as they provide a rational explanation for irrational behavior.<ref name=\"Cleman-p70\"/> This rationality, however, is undermined by their lack of motive (\"Object there was none. Passion there was none.\"). Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/> It is difficult to fully understand the narrator's true emotions about the blue eyed man because of this contradiction. It is said that \"At the same time he disclosed a deep psychological confusion\", referring to the narrator and his comment that \"Object there was none. Passion there was none\" and that the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=E. Arthur |title=Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" |journal=University of California Press |volume=19 |issue=4 |page=369 |pages=369-378 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2932876?seq=1 |accessdate=4/13/20}}</ref>




The story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\"; which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. \"Poe and the Gothic Tradition\", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J. Hayes. Cambridge University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-521-79727-6}}, p. 87.</ref> Poe's contemporaries may well have been reminded of the controversy over the [[insanity defense]] in the 1840s.<ref name=\"Cleman-p66\">Cleman, ''Bloom's BioCritiques'', p. 66.</ref>

The narrator claims to have a disease that causes [[Sensitivity (human)|hypersensitivity]]. A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing deathwatch beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''. Second quarter, 1969.</ref> [[Henry David Thoreau]] observed in an 1838 article that deathwatch beetles make sounds similar to a heartbeat.<ref>Robison, E. Arthur. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1971105.htm Thoreau and the Deathwatch in Poe's 'The Tell-Tale Heart']\", in ''Poe Studies'', vol. IV, no. 1. June 1971. pp. 14-16</ref> The beating could even be the sound of the narrator's own heart. Alternatively, if the beating is really a product of the narrator's imagination, it is that uncontrolled imagination that leads to their own destruction.<ref name=\"Eddings-p213\">Eddings, Dennis W. \"Theme and Parody in 'The Raven'\", in ''Poe and His Times: The Artist and His Milieu'', edited by Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV. Baltimore: The Edgar Allan Poe Society, 1990. {{ISBN|0-9616449-2-3}}, p. 213.</ref>

It is also possible that the narrator has [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. Paranoid schizophrenics very often experience auditory hallucinations. These auditory hallucinations are more often voices, but can also be sounds.<ref name=\"Zimmerman-p39-48\">ZIMMERMAN, BRETT. “‘Moral Insanity’ or Paranoid Schizophrenia: Poe's ‘The Tell-Tale Heart.’” Mosaic: A Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature, vol. 25, no. 2, 1992, pp. 39–48. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24780617.</ref> This is of course a very modern view of the work; in Poe's era there was no such diagnosis, and Poe would not have been familiar with a set of symptoms as pertaining to any definite mental disease. 

The relationship between the old man and the narrator is ambiguous. Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong. The murder of the eye, then, is a removal of conscience.<ref name=\"Hoffman-p223\">Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1972. {{ISBN|0-8071-2321-8}}, p. 223.</ref> The eye may also represent secrecy: only when the eye is found open on the final night, penetrating the veil of secrecy, is the murder carried out.<ref name=\"Benfey-p33\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 33.</ref>

[[Richard Wilbur]] suggested that the tale is an allegorical representation of Poe's poem \"[[To Science]]\", which depicts a struggle between imagination and science. In \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", the old man may thus represent the scientific and rational mind, while the narrator may stand for the imaginative.<ref name=\"Benfey-pp31-32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', pp. 31-32.</ref>

[[File:Celtic wooden cross - Redruth - New Cut Car Park.jpg|thumb|right|Celtic wooden cross in New Cut Car Park]]

==Toponymy==
The name Redruth derives from its older Cornish name, ''Rhyd-ruth''.  It means Red Ford (literally fordred). The first syllable 'red' means ford. The second 'ruth' means red.

''Rhyd'' is the older form of 'Res', which is a Cornish equivalent to a ford (across a river), a common Celtic word; Old Cornish ''rid''; Welsh ''rhyd'' (Old Welsh ''rit''); Old Breton ''rit'' or ''ret'', Gaulish ''ritu-'', all from Indo-European ''*prtus'' derived word in ''-tu'' from the root *per \" to cross, to go through \"; Proto-Germanic ''*furdúz'' (English ford, German ''Furt''); Latin ''portus'', all related to the Celtic word.<ref>[[Xavier Delamarre]], ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'', éditions errance 2003, p. 258.</ref> 

It is the ''-ruth'' (and not the ''Red-'' part of the name) which means the colour red.<ref>Redruth & its people – Michael Tangye – {{ISBN|0-9501872-1-6}}</ref>

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Native Copper from Huelvor near Redruth, Cornwall.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Native Copper]] mineral specimen from Huelvor near Redruth. Hand-colored copper-plate engraving by [[James Sowerby]], 1807.]]
[[File:St Uny's Church - geograph.org.uk - 352440.jpg|thumb|St Uny's Church]]
Traditionally in the [[Penwith (hundred)|Penwith Hundred]], the town has developed away from the original settlement, which was near where the present Churchtown (around [[St. Euny]]'s Church) district of Redruth stands today. This location is a steeply wooded valley, with [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] on one side and the now-called [[Bullers Hill]] on the other. The presence of shallow [[lode]]s of [[tin]] and [[copper]] lying east to west made it an advantageous site for extracting metals, including, tin, [[lead]] and copper. The first settlers stayed by a crossing in the river and started extracting metal ores, and this process turned the colour of the river red.

Historically, Redruth was a small [[market town]] overshadowed by its neighbours until a boom in the demand for copper [[ore]] during the 18th century. Copper ore had mostly been discarded by the Cornish [[tin]]-mining industry but was now needed to make [[brass]], an essential metal in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Surrounded by copper ore deposits, Redruth quickly became one of the largest and richest mining areas in Britain and the town's population grew markedly, although most miners' families remained poor.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In the 1880s and 1890s the town end of Clinton Road gained a number of institutions, notably a [[School of Metalliferous Mining|School of Mines and Art School]] in 1882–83, St. Andrew's Church (replacing the chapel in Chapel Street) in 1883 and, opposite, the Free Library, built in 1895. The [[Mining Exchange]] was built in 1880 as a place for the trading of mineral stock. By the turn of the 20th century, Victoria Park had been laid out to commemorate the [[Golden Jubilee]] and this part of town had taken on its present appearance – a far cry from the jumble of mining activity that had taken place there in the early 19th century. Redruth was making its transition from a market town dominated by mines and industry to a residential centre.

By the end of the 19th century, the Cornish mining industry was in decline and Britain was importing most of its copper ore. To find employment, many miners [[Emigration|emigrated]] to the newer mining industries in the Americas, Pachuca, Mexico, [[Australasia]] and South Africa. Cornwall's last fully operational mine, [[South Crofty]] at [[Pool, Cornwall|Pool]] between Redruth and [[Camborne]], closed in March 1998.

==Governance==

===Parliamentary representation===
The [[Camborne and Redruth (UK Parliament constituency)|Camborne and Redruth]] [[county constituency|constituency]] was created for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], following a review of parliamentary representation in [[Cornwall]] by the [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission for England]], which increased the number of seats in the county from five to six.<ref name=\"BCECornwall\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Cornwall_the_Isles_of_Scilly.doc |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091102212641/http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Cornwall_the_Isles_of_Scilly.doc |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 November 2009 |title=Final recommendations for Parliamentary constituencies in the county of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly |publisher=[[Boundary Commission for England]] |date=9 January 2005 |accessdate=1 January 2010 }}</ref>
It is primarily a successor to the former [[Falmouth and Camborne (UK Parliament constituency)|Falmouth and Camborne]] seat.

===Local government===
Redruth until the late 1800s comprised the Redruth Urban District and [[Redruth Rural District]]. The urban district was merged with that of [[Camborne]] and parts of Redruth Rural District and [[Helston Rural District]] (both of which were being abolished) in 1934 to form the [[Camborne-Redruth Urban District]]. The urban district persisted until it was merged into the [[Kerrier]] district of Cornwall under the [[Local Government Act 1972]].<ref name=VoB>{{cite web|title=Camborne Redruth UD through time|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10002163#tab02|publisher=[[A Vision of Britain through Time]]|accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref>

==Education==
[[File:Library (28608161513).jpg|thumb|The Passmore Edwards Free Library]]
[[Redruth School]], a [[Technology College]], is a secondary school, for ages 11–16. It used to have a [[sixth form]], for ages 16-18, however it closed applications for new students in 2016 and officially closed in 2020 due to funding cuts.
The town used to have a coeducational independent school, Highfields Private School, but this closed in 2012. 

Primary schools within the town include Pennoweth School, Treleigh School, Treloweth Community Primary School, Trewirgie Infant School and Trewirgie Junior School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alltheschools.com/cornwall/redruth.htm|title=Schools in Redruth, Cornwall|work=Schools Directory|publisher=School Creations|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref>

The Curnow Community Special School caters for students with special needs.

The Passmore Edwards Free Library was built in 1894. Its architect was James Hicks who used a castellated baronial style; there is a prominent octagonal tower. The reading room was once the school of Thomas Collins where Collins who had been headmaster of Trewirgie school taught local children and children left behind by parents who had emigrated overseas.<ref>Beacham, Peter & Pevsner, Nikolaus (2014). ''Cornwall''. New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-12668-6}}; p. 471  </ref>

==Notable buildings==
The Parish Church of St Uny, which is some distance from the town centre, is of [[Norman architecture|Norman]] foundation but was rebuilt in 1756. The patron saint is also honoured at Lelant. The tower is two centuries earlier and the whole church is built of granite. A [[chapel of ease]] was built in the town in 1828 but it is no longer in use.<ref name=\"Pevsner, N. 1970 p. 150\">Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books; p. 150</ref> Other places of worship include the Wesleyan Church of 1826, the Free Methodist Church of 1864 (in grand Italianate style) and the Quaker Meeting House of 1833 (no longer in use).<ref name=\"Pevsner, N. 1970 p. 150\"/>

The former post office in Alma Place is now known as the [[Cornish Studies Centre]]: also housed there is the collection of Tregellas Tapestries which depict the history of Cornwall in embroidery. The Mining Exchange building is now used as a housing advice centre (it was built in 1880 as accommodation for share brokers).

[[File:William Murdoch placque.jpg|thumb|Plaque on Murdoch House]]

===Murdoch House===
[[File:Murdoch House & St. Rumon's Gardens.jpg|thumb|Murdoch House and St Rumon's Gardens]]
The house now called Murdoch (or, sometimes Murdock) House in the middle of Cross Street was erected in the 1660s as a chapel and it afterwards became a prison. [[William Murdoch]] lived in it from 1782 to 1798. During this time, he worked on local tin and copper mines, erecting engines on behalf of [[Boulton and Watt]].
He fitted the house out with [[gas lighting]] from [[coal gas]] – this was the first house in the world with this type of lighting.

In the 19th century, the house was used as a tea room, run by a Mrs Knuckey. In 1931 Mr A. Pearce Jenkin, a leading citizen of Redruth purchased the house and gave it as a gift to the [[Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]).<ref>Janet Thomson; ''The Scot Who Lit The World, The Story of William Murdoch Inventor of Gas Lighting''; 2003; {{ISBN|0-9530013-2-6}}</ref>

Murdoch House has since been fully restored and is now regularly used by the Redruth [[Old Cornwall Society]], as well as the Cornish-American Connection and the Redruth Story Group. Next door are [[Media in Cornwall#Cinema|St. Rumon's Gardens]].

===Tin Miner Statue===
[[File:The Tin Miner - Fore St. Redruth.jpg|thumb|Tin Miner statue]]
A [[bronze sculpture]] of a Cornish miner by artist [[David Annand]] standing at 6 feet 7 inches was erected in April 2008.<ref>[http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=144125&command=displayContent&sourceNode=232450&contentPK=20243264&folderPk=108202&pNodeId=251466 thisiscornwall.co.uk news report on the statue]</ref>
The sculpture was commissioned by the Redruth Public Realm Working Party's Mining Art Group in response to comments received during the consultation process, that the town did not have anything to represent the history of the men who worked down the tin and copper mines in the area.
David Annand was selected from over 70 artists who responded to an advert placed by Cornwall Arts Centre Trust, the project managers, for expressions of interest in August 2006.

Redruth is also home to [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]], which has most historical interest. The Carn however is not the highest point in Redruth, beaten slightly by [[Carnmenellis]], south west of the town centre.

'''''Sport''''' [[Redruth RFC|Redruth Rugby Football Club]] currently play in [[National League 2 South]] (tier 4 of rugby union in England). Players such as [[Phil Vickery (rugby player)|Phil Vickery]] and [[Rob Thirlby]] have both passed through its ranks though the club's most famous \"son\" must be [[Richard Sharp]] OBE. A resident of Clinton Road with his mother and brother Nigel, he represented Redruth, Cornwall, and England, leading his country to the [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations]] title in [[1963 Five Nations Championship|1963]]. Redruth [[association football|soccer club]] has not enjoyed as much success but still thrives in its regular fixtures. On the high street there is a [[Tang Soo Do]] (Korean Karate) and [[Kickboxing]] Academy named ISK Martial Arts. [[Duchy Hockey Club]] are based at Pool Academy on the outskirts of Redruth and compete in the West of England regional leagues.

'''''Performing arts''''' Actress [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], electronic musician [[Luke Vibert]], [[baritone]] [[Benjamin Luxon]], opera singer [[Alan Opie]], record producer and broadcaster Tris Penna, and the co founder of and drummer with [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Mick Fleetwood]], were all born here. The writer and comedian [[Rory McGrath]] was born here and educated at the town's secondary school, Cornish artist [[Jonathan Polkest]] studied art at The Redruth School of Art in Clinton Road, The musician [[Aphex Twin]] (and friend of Vibert) grew up near Redruth. Luke Vibert has released an album called ''Chicago, Detroit, Redruth'' and has also recorded under the alias ''Kerrier District''; a reference to name of the district in which Redruth is located. [[Hedluv + Passman]] both grew up in Redruth, and wrote the song \"'druth\" in tribute to the town. The traditional Cornish dance and music group, [[Hevva]] is based in Redruth.

'''''Scholars and philanthropists''''' The historians [[Kenneth Hamilton Jenkin]] and [[Charles Thomas (historian)|Charles Thomas]] were also born in Redruth, and the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] philanthropist [[John Passmore Edwards]] was born in the neighbouring village of Blackwater.

'''''Town centre shopping''''' Key shops and other outlets within the [[town centre]] include a multi-screen [[Cinema (place)|cinema]], a covered [[market (place)|market]] way, the [[Cornish Studies Centre]], an old butter market, various [[antique shop]]s, a second hand [[book shop]] and two supermarkets, plus Greens Newsagents, The Emporium (formerly John Oliver's) which still carries on the tradition of selling music and books (mainly of local historical interest) and antiques, as well as providing other products (gifts, stationery, greeting cards, etc.) and the local cash and carry Jims. Off the main street ([[Fore Street]]), there are two separate specialist shopping areas, Bond Street (to the south of the [[Redruth railway station|railway station]]) and Green Lane to the north.

The new '''''street landscaping''''' includes wooden seating, with granite furniture, new [[signpost]]s, [[street lights]] and [[litter bin]]s, and two sets of [[bronze]] 'dogs', which were cast from the boots of former tin miners by sculptor David Kemp. The town has a burgundy colour theme, which is in the new [[Public Realm]] regeneration work to highlight the town's name. A project to light various [[public buildings]] around the town with [[LED]] coloured lights has already commenced. Some of the buildings opposite the railway station and the St. Rumon's Gardens have now (April 2008) been completed.

'''''Environment awards''''' On 7 November 2007, Redruth jointly won (with [[Luton]]) the annual UK town centre environment awards, which are run by the BCSC (a retail property consortium).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcsc.org.uk/news_art.asp?news_id=319 |publisher=BCSC |title= Environment award details}}</ref> The judges praised the cast bronze 'dogs'<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7083063.stm |publisher=BBC Cornwall |title= Redruth Town Prize | date=7 November 2007 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> and also liked the large amount of work that had been done to the town in terms of landscaping the central area (mainly Fore St & the opeways).

'''''Heartlands visitor park''''' Just outside the town is a European funded visitor attraction, themed on the Robinson Shaft Mine, it offers parking, an adventure play ground for older children and a pleasant restaurant. At times the last working [[Cornish engine|Cornish pumping engine]] can be seen working.<ref>[https://plus.google.com/109520294795188720633/about?hl=en&gl=de Google review]</ref> The museum is an Anchor point on the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erih.net/nc/anchor-points/detail.html?user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bpointer%5D=0&user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bmode%5D=1&user_erihobjects_pi2%5BshowUid%5D=18485&user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bregionalroute%5D=0&user_erihobjects_pi2%5BanchorOnly%5D=1&user_erihobjects_pi2%5BmembersOnly%5D=0|title=ERIH Entry: Heartlands|year=2014|ref=harv|publisher=European Route of Industrial Heritage|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Redruth - Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Redruth railway station]]
Redruth is an important transport hub. The [[Redruth railway station|railway station]] is a [[railhead]] for both [[Helston]] and the [[Lizard, Cornwall|Lizard]], and there are frequent buses connecting the three places. The railway station is served by trains from [[Paddington]], as well as the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and the [[Northern England|North]]. Redruth is next to the main [[A30 road]] and thus has access to the main route out of the county as well as routes to the [[Penwith|far West]], [[North Cornwall]], [[South East Cornwall]] and [[Plymouth]]. Another road, the A393, bisects the town in a north-south direction, and links the A30 with the port of [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. A third road, the A3047, links Redruth with [[Camborne]], some four miles ({{convert|4|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) to the west.

The Barncoose by-pass connects between the Redruth Community Hospital and the Barncoose [[Industrial Estate]]. It is intended to reduce [[Heavy Goods Vehicle|HGV]] traffic using the main Camborne road and provide a direct access to the Industrial Estate. It did, however, provoke some controversy, as some residents in Barncoose lost their parking spaces to make way for the new road.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6523417.stm BBC News – Residents anger]</ref> It was extended further towards Camborne in 2016.

==Toponymy==
The name Redruth derives from its older Cornish name, ''Rhyd-ruth''.  It means Red Ford (literally fordred). The first syllable 'red' means ford. The second 'ruth' means red.

''Rhyd'' is the older form of 'Res', which is a Cornish equivalent to a ford (across a river), a common Celtic word; Old Cornish ''rid''; Welsh ''rhyd'' (Old Welsh ''rit''); Old Breton ''rit'' or ''ret'', Gaulish ''ritu-'', all from Indo-European ''*prtus'' derived word in ''-tu'' from the root *per \" to cross, to go through \"; Proto-Germanic ''*furdúz'' (English ford, German ''Furt''); Latin ''portus'', all related to the Celtic word.<ref>[[Xavier Delamarre]], ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'', éditions errance 2003, p. 258.</ref> 

It is the ''-ruth'' (and not the ''Red-'' part of the name) which means the colour red.<ref>Redruth & its people – Michael Tangye – {{ISBN|0-9501872-1-6}}</ref>

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Native Copper from Huelvor near Redruth, Cornwall.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Native Copper]] mineral specimen from Huelvor near Redruth. Hand-colored copper-plate engraving by [[James Sowerby]], 1807.]]
[[File:St Uny's Church - geograph.org.uk - 352440.jpg|thumb|St Uny's Church]]
Traditionally in the [[Penwith (hundred)|Penwith Hundred]], the town has developed away from the original settlement, which was near where the present Churchtown (around [[St. Euny]]'s Church) district of Redruth stands today. This location is a steeply wooded valley, with [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] on one side and the now-called [[Bullers Hill]] on the other. The presence of shallow [[lode]]s of [[tin]] and [[copper]] lying east to west made it an advantageous site for extracting metals, including, tin, [[lead]] and copper. The first settlers stayed by a crossing in the river and started extracting metal ores, and this process turned the colour of the river red.

Historically, Redruth was a small [[market town]] overshadowed by its neighbours until a boom in the demand for copper [[ore]] during the 18th century. Copper ore had mostly been discarded by the Cornish [[tin]]-mining industry but was now needed to make [[brass]], an essential metal in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Surrounded by copper ore deposits, Redruth quickly became one of the largest and richest mining areas in Britain and the town's population grew markedly, although most miners' families remained poor.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In the 1880s and 1890s the town end of Clinton Road gained a number of institutions, notably a [[School of Metalliferous Mining|School of Mines and Art School]] in 1882–83, St. Andrew's Church (replacing the chapel in Chapel Street) in 1883 and, opposite, the Free Library, built in 1895. The [[Mining Exchange]] was built in 1880 as a place for the trading of mineral stock. By the turn of the 20th century, Victoria Park had been laid out to commemorate the [[Golden Jubilee]] and this part of town had taken on its present appearance – a far cry from the jumble of mining activity that had taken place there in the early 19th century. Redruth was making its transition from a market town dominated by mines and industry to a residential centre.

By the end of the 19th century, the Cornish mining industry was in decline and Britain was importing most of its copper ore. To find employment, many miners [[Emigration|emigrated]] to the newer mining industries in the Americas, Pachuca, Mexico, [[Australasia]] and South Africa. Cornwall's last fully operational mine, [[South Crofty]] at [[Pool, Cornwall|Pool]] between Redruth and [[Camborne]], closed in March 1998.

==Governance==

===Parliamentary representation===
The [[Camborne and Redruth (UK Parliament constituency)|Camborne and Redruth]] [[county constituency|constituency]] was created for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], following a review of parliamentary representation in [[Cornwall]] by the [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission for England]], which increased the number of seats in the county from five to six.<ref name=\"BCECornwall\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Cornwall_the_Isles_of_Scilly.doc |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091102212641/http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Cornwall_the_Isles_of_Scilly.doc |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 November 2009 |title=Final recommendations for Parliamentary constituencies in the county of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly |publisher=[[Boundary Commission for England]] |date=9 January 2005 |accessdate=1 January 2010 }}</ref>
It is primarily a successor to the former [[Falmouth and Camborne (UK Parliament constituency)|Falmouth and Camborne]] seat.

===Local government===
Redruth until the late 1800s comprised the Redruth Urban District and [[Redruth Rural District]]. The urban district was merged with that of [[Camborne]] and parts of Redruth Rural District and [[Helston Rural District]] (both of which were being abolished) in 1934 to form the [[Camborne-Redruth Urban District]]. The urban district persisted until it was merged into the [[Kerrier]] district of Cornwall under the [[Local Government Act 1972]].<ref name=VoB>{{cite web|title=Camborne Redruth UD through time|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10002163#tab02|publisher=[[A Vision of Britain through Time]]|accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref>

==Education==
[[File:Library (28608161513).jpg|thumb|The Passmore Edwards Free Library]]
[[Redruth School]], a [[Technology College]], is a secondary school and [[sixth form college]], for ages 11–18.
The town used to have a coeducational independent school, Highfields Private School, but this closed in 2012. 

Primary schools within the town include Pennoweth School, Treleigh School, Treloweth Community Primary School, Trewirgie Infant School and Trewirgie Junior School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alltheschools.com/cornwall/redruth.htm|title=Schools in Redruth, Cornwall|work=Schools Directory|publisher=School Creations|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref>

The Curnow Community Special School caters for students with special needs.

The Passmore Edwards Free Library was built in 1894. Its architect was James Hicks who used a castellated baronial style; there is a prominent octagonal tower. The reading room was once the school of Thomas Collins where Collins who had been headmaster of Trewirgie school taught local children and children left behind by parents who had emigrated overseas.<ref>Beacham, Peter & Pevsner, Nikolaus (2014). ''Cornwall''. New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-12668-6}}; p. 471  </ref>

==Notable buildings==
The Parish Church of St Uny, which is some distance from the town centre, is of [[Norman architecture|Norman]] foundation but was rebuilt in 1756. The patron saint is also honoured at Lelant. The tower is two centuries earlier and the whole church is built of granite. A [[chapel of ease]] was built in the town in 1828 but it is no longer in use.<ref name=\"Pevsner, N. 1970 p. 150\">Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books; p. 150</ref> Other places of worship include the Wesleyan Church of 1826, the Free Methodist Church of 1864 (in grand Italianate style) and the Quaker Meeting House of 1833 (no longer in use).<ref name=\"Pevsner, N. 1970 p. 150\"/>

The former post office in Alma Place is now known as the [[Cornish Studies Centre]]: also housed there is the collection of Tregellas Tapestries which depict the history of Cornwall in embroidery. The Mining Exchange building is now used as a housing advice centre (it was built in 1880 as accommodation for share brokers).

[[File:William Murdoch placque.jpg|thumb|Plaque on Murdoch House]]

===Murdoch House===
[[File:Murdoch House & St. Rumon's Gardens.jpg|thumb|Murdoch House and St Rumon's Gardens]]
The house now called Murdoch (or, sometimes Murdock) House in the middle of Cross Street was erected in the 1660s as a chapel and it afterwards became a prison. [[William Murdoch]] lived in it from 1782 to 1798. During this time, he worked on local tin and copper mines, erecting engines on behalf of [[Boulton and Watt]].
He fitted the house out with [[gas lighting]] from [[coal gas]] – this was the first house in the world with this type of lighting.

In the 19th century, the house was used as a tea room, run by a Mrs Knuckey. In 1931 Mr A. Pearce Jenkin, a leading citizen of Redruth purchased the house and gave it as a gift to the [[Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]).<ref>Janet Thomson; ''The Scot Who Lit The World, The Story of William Murdoch Inventor of Gas Lighting''; 2003; {{ISBN|0-9530013-2-6}}</ref>

Murdoch House has since been fully restored and is now regularly used by the Redruth [[Old Cornwall Society]], as well as the Cornish-American Connection and the Redruth Story Group. Next door are [[Media in Cornwall#Cinema|St. Rumon's Gardens]].

===Tin Miner Statue===
[[File:The Tin Miner - Fore St. Redruth.jpg|thumb|Tin Miner statue]]
A [[bronze sculpture]] of a Cornish miner by artist [[David Annand]] standing at 6 feet 7 inches was erected in April 2008.<ref>[http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=144125&command=displayContent&sourceNode=232450&contentPK=20243264&folderPk=108202&pNodeId=251466 thisiscornwall.co.uk news report on the statue]</ref>
The sculpture was commissioned by the Redruth Public Realm Working Party's Mining Art Group in response to comments received during the consultation process, that the town did not have anything to represent the history of the men who worked down the tin and copper mines in the area.
David Annand was selected from over 70 artists who responded to an advert placed by Cornwall Arts Centre Trust, the project managers, for expressions of interest in August 2006.

'''''Sport''''' [[Redruth RFC|Redruth Rugby Football Club]] currently play in [[National League 2 South]] (tier 4 of rugby union in England). Players such as [[Phil Vickery (rugby player)|Phil Vickery]] and [[Rob Thirlby]] have both passed through its ranks though the club's most famous \"son\" must be [[Richard Sharp]] OBE. A resident of Clinton Road with his mother and brother Nigel, he represented Redruth, Cornwall, and England, leading his country to the [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations]] title in [[1963 Five Nations Championship|1963]]. Redruth [[association football|soccer club]] has not enjoyed as much success but still thrives in its regular fixtures. On the high street there is a [[Tang Soo Do]] (Korean Karate) and [[Kickboxing]] Academy named ISK Martial Arts. [[Duchy Hockey Club]] are based at Pool Academy on the outskirts of Redruth and compete in the West of England regional leagues.

The writer and comedian [[Rory McGrath]] was born here and educated at the town's secondary school, Cornish artist [[Jonathan Polkest]] studied art at The Redruth School of Art in Clinton Road, The musician [[Aphex Twin]] (and friend of Vibert) grew up near Redruth. Luke Vibert has released an album called ''Chicago, Detroit, Redruth'' and has also recorded under the alias ''Kerrier District''; a reference to name of the district in which Redruth is located. [[Hedluv + Passman]] both grew up in Redruth, and wrote the song \"'druth\" in tribute to the town. The traditional Cornish dance and music group, [[Hevva]] is based in Redruth.

'''''Scholars and philanthropists''''' The historians [[Kenneth Hamilton Jenkin]] and [[Charles Thomas (historian)|Charles Thomas]] were also born in Redruth, and the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] philanthropist [[John Passmore Edwards]] was born in the neighbouring village of Blackwater.

'''''Town centre shopping''''' Key shops and other outlets within the [[town centre]] include a multi-screen [[Cinema (place)|cinema]], a covered [[market (place)|market]] way, the [[Cornish Studies Centre]], an old butter market, various [[antique shop]]s, a second hand [[book shop]] and two supermarkets, plus Greens Newsagents, The Emporium (formerly John Oliver's) which still carries on the tradition of selling music and books (mainly of local historical interest) and antiques, as well as providing other products (gifts, stationery, greeting cards, etc.) and the local cash and carry Jims. Off the main street ([[Fore Street]]), there are two separate specialist shopping areas, Bond Street (to the south of the [[Redruth railway station|railway station]]) and Green Lane to the north.

The new '''''street landscaping''''' includes wooden seating, with granite furniture, new [[signpost]]s, [[street lights]] and [[litter bin]]s, and two sets of [[bronze]] 'dogs', which were cast from the boots of former tin miners by sculptor David Kemp. The town has a burgundy colour theme, which is in the new [[Public Realm]] regeneration work to highlight the town's name. A project to light various [[public buildings]] around the town with [[LED]] coloured lights has already commenced. Some of the buildings opposite the railway station and the St. Rumon's Gardens have now (April 2008) been completed.

'''''Environment awards''''' On 7 November 2007, Redruth jointly won (with [[Luton]]) the annual UK town centre environment awards, which are run by the BCSC (a retail property consortium).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcsc.org.uk/news_art.asp?news_id=319 |publisher=BCSC |title= Environment award details}}</ref> The judges praised the cast bronze 'dogs'<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7083063.stm |publisher=BBC Cornwall |title= Redruth Town Prize | date=7 November 2007 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> and also liked the large amount of work that had been done to the town in terms of landscaping the central area (mainly Fore St & the opeways).

'''''Heartlands visitor park''''' Just outside the town is a European funded visitor attraction, themed on the Robinson Shaft Mine, it offers parking, an adventure play ground for older children and a pleasant restaurant. At times the last working [[Cornish engine|Cornish pumping engine]] can be seen working.<ref>[https://plus.google.com/109520294795188720633/about?hl=en&gl=de Google review]</ref> The museum is an Anchor point on the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erih.net/nc/anchor-points/detail.html?user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bpointer%5D=0&user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bmode%5D=1&user_erihobjects_pi2%5BshowUid%5D=18485&user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bregionalroute%5D=0&user_erihobjects_pi2%5BanchorOnly%5D=1&user_erihobjects_pi2%5BmembersOnly%5D=0|title=ERIH Entry: Heartlands|year=2014|ref=harv|publisher=European Route of Industrial Heritage|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

'''''Miscellany''''' It is home to Cornwall's first ILR Radio Station, [[Pirate FM]]. On 20 June 2008, the town held its first regular [[Farmers' Market]] in Market Place: the Market will now be held every Friday throughout the year.

==Transportation==
[[File:Redruth - Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Redruth railway station]]
Redruth is an important transport hub. The [[Redruth railway station|railway station]] is a [[railhead]] for both [[Helston]] and the [[Lizard, Cornwall|Lizard]], and there are frequent buses connecting the three places. The railway station is served by trains from [[Paddington]], as well as the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and the [[Northern England|North]]. Redruth is next to the main [[A30 road]] and thus has access to the main route out of the county as well as routes to the [[Penwith|far West]], [[North Cornwall]], [[South East Cornwall]] and [[Plymouth]]. Another road, the A393, bisects the town in a north-south direction, and links the A30 with the port of [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. A third road, the A3047, links Redruth with [[Camborne]], some four miles ({{convert|4|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) to the west.

The Barncoose by-pass connects between the Redruth Community Hospital and the Barncoose [[Industrial Estate]]. It is intended to reduce [[Heavy Goods Vehicle|HGV]] traffic using the main Camborne road and provide a direct access to the Industrial Estate. It did, however, provoke some controversy, as some residents in Barncoose lost their parking spaces to make way for the new road.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6523417.stm BBC News – Residents anger]</ref> It was extended further towards Camborne in 2016.

==History==
Jackson County was formed in 1816. It was named after General Andrew Jackson.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n166 167]}}</ref>

Jackson County was the site of the first recorded [[train robbery]] of a moving train in the United States. On October 6, 1866 the [[Reno Gang]] robbed an [[Ohio and Mississippi Railway]] train, making off with over $10,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=VideoArticle&id=51742 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419044438/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=VideoArticle&id=51742 |archivedate=2009-04-19 }}</ref>

Jackson County has the second longest [[3-span covered bridge]] in the world; [[Medora Covered Bridge|The Medora Covered Bridge]]. After a recent project to completely refurbish the Medora Covered Bridge, the nearby town of Medora now holds an annual event at the bridge. The bridge is open for pedestrian traffic and site-seers. Another long neglected covered bridge, the [[Bells Ford Bridge]], believed to have been the last remaining [[Post Truss]] bridge in the world, succumbed to neglect, collapsing into the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] on January 2, 2006.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of {{convert|513.91|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|509.31|sqmi}} (or 99.10%) is land and {{convert|4.60|sqmi}} (or 0.90%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the fiscal body of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. The 7 representatives are elected from 4 county districts and 3 at-large positions. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of six years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]] Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Jackson County is part of [[Indiana's 9th congressional district]] and is represented in [[United States Congress|Congress]] by [[USRepublican|Republican]] [[Todd Young]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://toddyoung.house.gov/ |title=Conressman Todd Young |publisher=House.Gov |accessdate=2011-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512151302/http://toddyoung.house.gov/ |archivedate=2011-05-12 }}</ref>  It is also part of [[Indiana Senate]] districts 44 and 45<ref>{{cite web

==History==
Jackson County was formed in 1816. It was named after General Andrew Jackson.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

Jackson County was the site of the first recorded [[train robbery]] of a moving train in the United States. On October 6, 1866 the [[Reno Gang]] robbed an [[Ohio and Mississippi Railway]] train, making off with over $10,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=VideoArticle&id=51742 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419044438/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=VideoArticle&id=51742 |archivedate=2009-04-19 }}</ref>

Jackson County has the second longest [[3-span covered bridge]] in the world; [[Medora Covered Bridge|The Medora Covered Bridge]]. After a recent project to completely refurbish the Medora Covered Bridge, the nearby town of Medora now holds an annual event at the bridge. The bridge is open for pedestrian traffic and site-seers. Another long neglected covered bridge, the [[Bells Ford Bridge]], believed to have been the last remaining [[Post Truss]] bridge in the world, succumbed to neglect, collapsing into the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] on January 2, 2006.

'''County Council:''' The county council is the fiscal body of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. The 7 representatives are elected from 4 county districts and 3 at-large positions. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of six years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]] Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

The anonymous text that is usually called the '''Prayer of Saint Francis''' (or '''Peace Prayer''', or '''Simple Prayer for Peace''', or '''Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace''') is a widely known [[Christian prayer]] for peace. Often associated with the Italian [[Saint]] [[Francis of Assisi]] ({{c.|1182}} – 1226), but entirely absent from his writings, the prayer in its present form has not been traced back further than 1912.<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/> Its first known occurrence was in French, in a small spiritual magazine called ''[[La Clochette]]'' (The Little Bell), published by a [[Catholic Church]] organization in Paris named ''La Ligue de la Sainte-Messe'' (The League of the Holy Mass). The author's name was not given, although it may have been the founder of ''La Ligue,'' Father Esther Bouquerel. The prayer was heavily publicized during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201710/what-do-we-know-about-st-francis-americas-most-popular-saint-31161|title=What do we know about St. Francis, America's most popular saint?|last=Manning|first=Kathleen|year=2017|work=[[U.S. Catholic (magazine)|U.S. Catholic]]|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> It has been frequently set to music by notable songwriters and quoted by prominent leaders, and its broadly inclusive language has found appeal with diverse faiths encouraging service to others.<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.franciscan-archive.org/franciscana/peace.html |title=The Origin of the Peace Prayer of St. Francis |accessdate=25 May 2011 |last=Renoux |first=Christian |publisher=[[The Franciscan Archive]]}}</ref>{{sfn|Renoux|2001|pp=21, 27–28}}<ref name=Picucci>{{cite news |first=Egidio |last=Piccuci |date=19–20 January 2009 |newspaper=L'Osservatore Romano |page=6 |title=Le origini del testo attribuito a san Francesco d'Assisi: ''L'Osservatore Romano'' e la vera storia della Preghiera semplice |language=Italian}}</ref>

O Master, let me not seek as much
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love,
for it is in giving that one receives,
it is in self-forgetting that one finds,
it is in pardoning that one is pardoned,
it is in dying that one is raised to eternal life.</poem>

===Franciscan viewpoints===
The [[Franciscan Order]] does not include the prayer in its official \"Prayers of St. Francis\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ofm.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Prayers.pdf |title=Prayers of St. Francis |author=Francis of Assisi |publisher=Ordo Fratrum Minorum: Franciscan Friars |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref> and a church historian has noted that the phrasing of the first half of the text (\"let me...\") is atypically self-oriented for Francis: {{Quote|text=The most painful moment usually comes when [students] discover that Saint Francis did not write the \"Peace Prayer of Saint Francis\"... Noble as its sentiments are, Francis would not have written such a piece, focused as it is on the self, with its constant repetition of the pronouns \"I\" and \"me\", the words \"God\" and \"Jesus\" never appearing once.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GgMWtn8E94C&pg=PR9 |title=Francis of Assisi: A New Biography |first=Augustine |last=Thompson |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-8014-5070-9 |page=ix |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>}} However, the prayer has been recommended by members of the order, while not attributing it to St. Francis.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ofm.org/blog/children-praying-for-peace-letter-from-the-minister-general-and-custos-of-the-holy-land/ |title=Children praying for peace: Letter from the Minister General and from the Custos of the Holy Land |first1=Michael A. |last1=Perry |first2=Francesco |last2=Patton |publisher=Ordo Fratrum Minorum: Franciscan Friars |date=27 November 2016 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>

It has been noted that the second half of the prayer has similarities to this saying of [[Giles of Assisi]] (c. 1190 – 1262), one of the saint's close companions:

Blessed is he who loves and does not therefore desire to be loved;
Blessed is he who fears and does not therefore desire to be feared;

Blessed is he who behaves well toward others and does not desire that others behave well toward him;

The most-prominent hymn version of the prayer is \"Make Me a Channel of Your Peace\", or simply \"Prayer of St. Francis\", adapted and set to a chant-like melody in 1967 by South African songwriter Sebastian Temple (Johann Sebastian von Tempelhoff, 1928–1997), who had become a [[third order Franciscan]]. The hymn is an anthem of the [[Royal British Legion]] and is usually sung at its annual [[Festival of Remembrance]]. In 1997 it was part of the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]], and was performed by the Irish singer [[Sinéad O'Connor]] on the [[Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute|Princess Diana tribute album]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ocp.org/en-us/artists/587#bio |title=Sebastian Temple: Songs, Bio |publisher=Oregon Catholic Press |accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfneBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA277&lpg=PA279 |title=The Daily Telegraph Book of Hymns |first=Ian |last=Bradley |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |year=2005 |accessdate=5 June 2017 |isbn=978-0-8264-8678-3 |pages=277–279}}</ref> The hymn was also sung for the [[Wedding of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and Charlene Wittstock#Religious|religious wedding ceremony of Prince Albert II of Monaco to South African Charlene Wittstock]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palais.mc/monaco/palais-princier/english/royal-wedding/live-broadcast.2270.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705071808/http://www.palais.mc/monaco/palais-princier/english/royal-wedding/live-broadcast.2270.html |title=Royal Wedding: Live broadcast |publisher=Prince's Palace of Monaco |url-status=dead |date=2 July 2011 |accessdate=2 July 2011 |archivedate=5 July 2011}}</ref>

==History==
[[Christian Renoux]], a history professor at the [[University of Orléans]], published in French in 2001 a book-length study of the prayer and its origins, clearing up much of the confusion that had accumulated previously.{{sfn|Renoux|2001}} The Franciscan journal ''Frate Francesco'' and the Vatican newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' published articles in Italian summarizing the book's findings,<ref name=Picucci/><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.assisiofm.it/preghiera-semplice-2616-1.html |title=Recensioni: Christian Renoux, ''La prière pour la paix attribuée à saint François: une énigme à résoudre'' |first=Pietro |last=Messa |journal=Frate Francesco |volume=68 |number=2 |pages=413–416 |date=November 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2017 |language=Italian}}</ref> and Renoux published an online abstract in English at [[The Franciscan Archive]].<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/>

===''La Clochette'' (1912)===
The earliest known record of the prayer{{sfn|Renoux|2001|p=21}} is its appearance, as a \"beautiful prayer to say during Mass\", in the December 1912 issue of the small devotional French Catholic publication ''[[La Clochette]]'', \"the bulletin of the League of the Holy Mass\".<ref name=original/> Although the prayer was published anonymously, Renoux concluded that, with few exceptions, the texts in ''La Clochette'' were generally written by its founding editor, Father Esther Bouquerel (1855–1923).{{sfn|Renoux|2001|pp=27–28}}

===Mistaken attribution (1916) to 11th-century William the Conqueror===
[[File:Gerard David - Saint Francis gg0321 a71.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|St. Francis on a painted altarpiece by [[Gerard David]] (early 1500s)]]
In 1915, Marquis Stanislas de La Rochethulon (1862–1945), founding president of the Anglo-French association ''Souvenir Normand'' (Norman Remembrance), which called itself \"a work of peace and justice inspired by the testament of [[William the Conqueror]], who is considered to be the ancestor of all the royal families of Europe\", sent this prayer to [[Pope Benedict XV]] in the midst of [[World War I]].<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/> The Pope had an Italian translation published on the front page of ''L'Osservatore Romano'' on 20 January 1916. It appeared under the heading, \"The prayers of 'Souvenir Normand' for peace\", with a jumbled explanation: \"'Souvenir Normand' has sent the Holy Father the text of some prayers for peace. We have pleasure in presenting in particular the prayer addressed to the [[Sacred Heart]], inspired by the testament of William the Conqueror.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=20 January 1916 |newspaper=L'Osservatore Romano |page=1 |title=Le preghiere del 'Souvenir Normand' per la pace |language=Italian}}</ref> On 28 January 1916, the newspaper ''[[La Croix]]'' reprinted, in French, the article from ''L'Osservatore Romano'', with exactly the same heading and explanation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2593157/f6.image |title=Les prières du 'Souvenir Normand' pour la paix |newspaper=La Croix |page=6 |date=28 January 1916 |accessdate=6 March 2017 |language=French}}</ref> La Rochethulon wrote to ''La Croix'' to clarify that it was not a prayer of ''Souvenir Normand''; but he failed to mention ''La Clochette'', the first publication in which it had appeared.<ref name=Picucci/> Because of its appearance in ''L'Osservatore Romano'' and ''La Croix'' as a simple prayer for peace during World War I, the prayer became widely known.<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/>

===Mistaken attribution (c.1927) to 13th-century Saint Francis===
Around 1918, Franciscan Father Étienne Benoît reprinted the \"Prayer for Peace\" in French, without attribution, on the back of a mass-produced [[holy card]] depicting his Order's founder, the inspirational peacemaker from the [[Crusades]] era, [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/> The prayer was circulating in the United States by January 1927, when its first known English version (slightly abridged from the 1912 French original) appeared in the [[Quaker]] magazine ''[[Friends Journal|Friends' Intelligencer]]'', under the misattributed and misspelled title \"A prayer of St. Francis of Assissi\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=22 January 1927 |journal=Friends' Intelligencer |page=66 |volume=84 |number=4 |publisher=[[Religious Society of Friends]] |location=Philadelphia |title=A prayer of St. Francis of Assissi |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3gf0AAAAMAAJ&q=assissi |accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/12/22/prayer-assisi/ |title=Prayer Credited to St. Francis of Assisi |first=Garson |last=O'Toole |website=Quote Investigator |date=22 December 2011 |accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref> The saint's namesake American [[archbishop]] and [[military vicar]] [[Francis Spellman]] distributed millions of copies of the \"Prayer of St. Francis\" during [[World War II]], and the next year it was read into the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' by Senator [[Albert W.

As a friar later summarized the relationship between the prayer and St. Francis: \"One can safely say that although he is not the author, it resembles him and would not have displeased him.\"<ref name=Gallican>{{cite journal |url=https://gallican.org/plapaix.htm |title=La Prière pour la Paix |first=Christophe-André |last=Marty |journal=Le Gallican |date=January 2014 |accessdate=6 March 2017 |language=French |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708223531/http://gallican.org/plapaix.htm |archivedate=8 July 2016  }}</ref>

The anonymous text that is usually called the '''Prayer of Saint Francis''' (or '''Peace Prayer''', or '''Simple Prayer for Peace''', or '''Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace''') is a widely known [[Christian prayer]] for peace. Often associated with the Italian [[Saint]] [[Francis of Assisi]] ({{c.|1182}} – 1226), but entirely absent from his writings, the prayer in its present form has not been traced back further than 1912.<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/> Its first known occurrence was in French, in a small spiritual magazine called ''[[La Clochette]]'' (The Little Bell), published by a [[Catholic Church]] organization in Paris named ''La Ligue de la Sainte-Messe'' (The League of the Holy Mass). The author's name was not given, although it may have been the founder of ''La Ligue,'' Father Esther Bouquerel. The prayer was heavily publicized during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201710/what-do-we-know-about-st-francis-americas-most-popular-saint-31161|title=What do we know about St. Francis, America's most popular saint?|last=Manning|first=Kathleen|year=2017|work=[[U.S. Catholic (magazine)|U.S. Catholic]]|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> It has been frequently set to music by notable songwriters and quoted by prominent leaders, and its broadly inclusive language has found appeal with diverse faiths encouraging service to others.<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.franciscan-archive.org/franciscana/peace.html |title=The Origin of the Peace Prayer of St. Francis |accessdate=25 May 2011 |last=Renoux |first=Christian |publisher=[[The Franciscan Archive]]}}</ref>{{sfn|Renoux|2001|pp=21, 27–28}}<ref name=Picucci>{{cite news |first=Egidio |last=Piccuci |date=19–20 January 2009 |newspaper=L'Osservatore Romano |page=6 |title=Le origini del testo attribuito a san Francesco d'Assisi: ''L'Osservatore Romano'' e la vera storia della Preghiera semplice |language=Italian}}</ref>

Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
Where there is hatred, let me bring love.
Where there is offense, let me bring pardon.
Where there is discord, let me bring union.
Where there is error, let me bring truth.
Where there is doubt, let me bring faith.
Where there is despair, let me bring hope.
Where there is darkness, let me bring your light.
Where there is sadness, let me bring joy.
O Master, let me not seek as much
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love,
for it is in giving that one receives,
it is in self-forgetting that one finds,
it is in pardoning that one is pardoned,
it is in dying that one is raised to eternal life.</poem>

===Franciscan viewpoints===
The [[Franciscan Order]] does not include the prayer in its official \"Prayers of St. Francis\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ofm.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Prayers.pdf |title=Prayers of St. Francis |author=Francis of Assisi |publisher=Ordo Fratrum Minorum: Franciscan Friars |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref> and a church historian has noted that the phrasing of the first half of the text (\"let me...\") is atypically self-oriented for Francis: {{Quote|text=The most painful moment usually comes when [students] discover that Saint Francis did not write the \"Peace Prayer of Saint Francis\"... Noble as its sentiments are, Francis would not have written such a piece, focused as it is on the self, with its constant repetition of the pronouns \"I\" and \"me\", the words \"God\" and \"Jesus\" never appearing once.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GgMWtn8E94C&pg=PR9 |title=Francis of Assisi: A New Biography |first=Augustine |last=Thompson |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-8014-5070-9 |page=ix |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>}} However, the prayer has been recommended by members of the order, while not attributing it to St. Francis.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ofm.org/blog/children-praying-for-peace-letter-from-the-minister-general-and-custos-of-the-holy-land/ |title=Children praying for peace: Letter from the Minister General and from the Custos of the Holy Land |first1=Michael A. |last1=Perry |first2=Francesco |last2=Patton |publisher=Ordo Fratrum Minorum: Franciscan Friars |date=27 November 2016 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>

It has been noted that the second half of the prayer has similarities to this saying of [[Giles of Assisi]] (c. 1190 – 1262), one of the saint's close companions:

Golden Sayings of Blessed Giles of Assisi

Blessed is he who loves and does not therefore desire to be loved;
Blessed is he who fears and does not therefore desire to be feared;
Blessed is he who serves and does not therefore desire to be served;
Blessed is he who behaves well toward others and does not desire that others behave well toward him;
And because these are great things, the foolish do not rise to them.<ref>{{cite book |author=Giles of Assisi |title=The Golden Sayings of Blessed Brother Giles |translator-first=Paschal |translator-last=Robinson |publisher=Dolphin Press |year=1907 |orig-year=orig. 13th century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqVZAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA5 |page=5 |accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref>

The most-prominent hymn version of the prayer is \"Make Me a Channel of Your Peace\", or simply \"Prayer of St. Francis\", adapted and set to a chant-like melody in 1967 by South African songwriter Sebastian Temple (Johann Sebastian von Tempelhoff, 1928–1997), who had become a [[third order Franciscan]]. The hymn is an anthem of the [[Royal British Legion]] and is usually sung at its annual [[Festival of Remembrance]]. In 1997 it was part of the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]], and was performed by the Irish singer [[Sinéad O'Connor]] on the [[Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute|Princess Diana tribute album]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ocp.org/en-us/artists/587#bio |title=Sebastian Temple: Songs, Bio |publisher=Oregon Catholic Press |accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfneBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA277&lpg=PA279 |title=The Daily Telegraph Book of Hymns |first=Ian |last=Bradley |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |year=2005 |accessdate=5 June 2017 |isbn=978-0-8264-8678-3 |pages=277–279}}</ref> The hymn was also sung for the [[Wedding of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and Charlene Wittstock#Religious|religious wedding ceremony of Prince Albert II of Monaco to South African Charlene Wittstock]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palais.mc/monaco/palais-princier/english/royal-wedding/live-broadcast.2270.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705071808/http://www.palais.mc/monaco/palais-princier/english/royal-wedding/live-broadcast.2270.html |title=Royal Wedding: Live broadcast |publisher=Prince's Palace of Monaco |url-status=dead |date=2 July 2011 |accessdate=2 July 2011 |archivedate=5 July 2011}}</ref>

==History==
[[Christian Renoux]], a history professor at the [[University of Orléans]], published in French in 2001 a book-length study of the prayer and its origins, clearing up much of the confusion that had accumulated previously.{{sfn|Renoux|2001}} The Franciscan journal ''Frate Francesco'' and the Vatican newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' published articles in Italian summarizing the book's findings,<ref name=Picucci/><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.assisiofm.it/preghiera-semplice-2616-1.html |title=Recensioni: Christian Renoux, ''La prière pour la paix attribuée à saint François: une énigme à résoudre'' |first=Pietro |last=Messa |journal=Frate Francesco |volume=68 |number=2 |pages=413–416 |date=November 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2017 |language=Italian}}</ref> and Renoux published an online abstract in English at [[The Franciscan Archive]].<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/>

===''La Clochette'' (1912)===
The earliest known record of the prayer{{sfn|Renoux|2001|p=21}} is its appearance, as a \"beautiful prayer to say during Mass\", in the December 1912 issue of the small devotional French Catholic publication ''[[La Clochette]]'', \"the bulletin of the League of the Holy Mass\".<ref name=original/> Although the prayer was published anonymously, Renoux concluded that, with few exceptions, the texts in ''La Clochette'' were generally written by its founding editor, Father Esther Bouquerel (1855–1923).{{sfn|Renoux|2001|pp=27–28}}

In 1915, Marquis Stanislas de La Rochethulon (1862–1945), founding president of the Anglo-French association ''Souvenir Normand'' (Norman Remembrance), which called itself \"a work of peace and justice inspired by the testament of [[William the Conqueror]], who is considered to be the ancestor of all the royal families of Europe\", sent this prayer to [[Pope Benedict XV]] in the midst of [[World War I]].<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/> The Pope had an Italian translation published on the front page of ''L'Osservatore Romano'' on 20 January 1916. It appeared under the heading, \"The prayers of 'Souvenir Normand' for peace\", with a jumbled explanation: \"'Souvenir Normand' has sent the Holy Father the text of some prayers for peace. We have pleasure in presenting in particular the prayer addressed to the [[Sacred Heart]], inspired by the testament of William the Conqueror.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=20 January 1916 |newspaper=L'Osservatore Romano |page=1 |title=Le preghiere del 'Souvenir Normand' per la pace |language=Italian}}</ref> On 28 January 1916, the newspaper ''[[La Croix]]'' reprinted, in French, the article from ''L'Osservatore Romano'', with exactly the same heading and explanation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2593157/f6.image |title=Les prières du 'Souvenir Normand' pour la paix |newspaper=La Croix |page=6 |date=28 January 1916 |accessdate=6 March 2017 |language=French}}</ref> La Rochethulon wrote to ''La Croix'' to clarify that it was not a prayer of ''Souvenir Normand''; but he failed to mention ''La Clochette'', the first publication in which it had appeared.<ref name=Picucci/> Because of its appearance in ''L'Osservatore Romano'' and ''La Croix'' as a simple prayer for peace during World War I, the prayer became widely known.<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/>

===Mistaken attribution (c.1927) to 13th-century Saint Francis===
Around 1918, Franciscan Father Étienne Benoît reprinted the \"Prayer for Peace\" in French, without attribution, on the back of a mass-produced [[holy card]] depicting his Order's founder, the inspirational peacemaker from the [[Crusades]] era, [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/> The prayer was circulating in the United States by January 1927, when its first known English version (slightly abridged from the 1912 French original) appeared in the [[Quaker]] magazine ''[[Friends Journal|Friends' Intelligencer]]'', under the misattributed and misspelled title \"A prayer of St. Francis of Assissi\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=22 January 1927 |journal=Friends' Intelligencer |page=66 |volume=84 |number=4 |publisher=[[Religious Society of Friends]] |location=Philadelphia |title=A prayer of St. Francis of Assissi |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3gf0AAAAMAAJ&q=assissi |accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/12/22/prayer-assisi/ |title=Prayer Credited to St. Francis of Assisi |first=Garson |last=O'Toole |website=Quote Investigator |date=22 December 2011 |accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref> The saint's namesake American [[archbishop]] and [[military vicar]] [[Francis Spellman]] distributed millions of copies of the \"Prayer of St. Francis\" during [[World War II]], and the next year it was read into the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' by Senator [[Albert W.

As a friar later summarized the relationship between the prayer and St. Francis: \"One can safely say that although he is not the author, it resembles him and would not have displeased him.\"<ref name=Gallican>{{cite journal |url=https://gallican.org/plapaix.htm |title=La Prière pour la Paix |first=Christophe-André |last=Marty |journal=Le Gallican |date=January 2014 |accessdate=6 March 2017 |language=French |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708223531/http://gallican.org/plapaix.htm |archivedate=8 July 2016  }}</ref>

'''C-squares''' (acronym for the '''''concise spatial query and representation system''''') is a system of spatially unique, location-based identifiers ([[geocodes]]) for areas on the surface of the [[earth]], represented as cells from a [[Discrete Global Grid]] at a hierarchical set of resolution steps. The identifiers incorporate literal values of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in an interleaved notation (producing grid resolutions of 10, 1, 0.1 degrees, etc.), together with additional digits that support intermediate grid resolutions of 5, 0.5, 0.05 degrees, etc. The system was initially designed to represent data \"footprints\" or spatial extents in a more flexible manner than a standard [[minimum bounding rectangle]], and to support \"lightweight\", text-based spatial querying; it can also provide a set of identifiers for grid cells used for assembly, storage and analysis of spatially organised data. Dataset extents expressed in c-squares notation can be visualised using a web-based utility, the c-squares mapper, an online instance of which is currently provided by [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia. C-squares codes and associated published software are free to use and the software is released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL), a licence of the Free Software Foundation.

==History==
The c-squares method was developed by Tony Rees at [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia (then \"CSIRO Marine Research\") in 2001-2, initially as a method for spatial indexing, rapid query, and compact storage and visualization of dataset spatial \"footprints\" in an agency-specific [[Geospatial metadata|metadata directory]] (data catalogue).<ref name=\"about_c-squares\">CSIRO Marine Research, 2002: [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/about-csquares.htm About C-Squares.]</ref><ref name = \"Rees_2002\">Rees, Tony (2002): \"C-squares–a new metadata element for improved spatial querying and representation of spatial dataset coverage in metadata records\".

==Rationale==
===Indexing spatial data===
{{Main|Grid (spatial index)}}
Spatial data are inherently (at least) 2-dimensional; without additional indexing, a numeric range query in 2 dimensions (e.g. ''x'' and ''y'', or latitude and longitude) is required to retrieve data items within a particular area. Such queries are computationally expensive so it can be beneficial to pre-process (index) the data in some manner that reduces the inherent dimensionality from two to one dimension, for example as labelled cells of a grid; the grid labels can then be [[database index|indexed]] by standard, one dimensional methods for rapid search and retrieval,<ref>Rigaux, P., Scholl, M., and Voisard, A. 2002. Spatial Databases - with application to GIS. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 410pp.</ref> and/or searched by simple alphanumeric text searches. C-squares is an example of such a grid where the cell identifiers are designed to be human- as well as machine-readable, and to be concordant with recognizable and commonly intervals of latitude and longitude.

===Dataset footprints===
[[Geographic data and information|Spatial data]], that is, data associated with particular geographic locations on the earth, have spatial \"footprints\" that ideally are recorded in metadata systems or data catalogues, to support spatial searching of the resources in question.<ref name = \"Hill_2006\">Hill, Linda (2006). ''Georeferencing: The Geographic Associations of Information''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 260 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-262-08354-6}}</ref> A \"basic\" generalization of any data footprint is the minimum bounding rectangle or MBR, that is, the smallest set of boundaries of latitude and longitude that completely contain the data. Such stored rectangles are relatively simple to query as a mathematical operation (look for overlap with an input \"search\" rectangle) but, with real world data, may not be a good surrogate for the true data \"footprint\" if the latter contains disjoint or sparsely populated data items, items on a diagonal line, or items with significant \"holes\", such as a vessel track around a continent.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /> Representation as a set of smaller \"tiles\", such those denoted by c-square codes at an appropriate resolution, can more accurately reflect the shape of such non-rectangular and/or non-contiguous datasets.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /><ref name = \"Hill_2006\" />

===Data binning===
{{Main|Data binning}}
\"Binning\" describes the process of converting continuously variable data (in the present case, spatial locations in degrees of latitude and longitude) into a set of discrete \"bins\" in order to apply the indexing and subsequent search/retrieval processes, other processing and reporting, etc. The optimal size of the spatial data \"bins\" can depend on the user's requirements (e.g. geographic coverage), desire for handling large vs. small datasets (which can affect the time required for processing or production of on-demand maps) and density of available data (with sparse input data, many \"bins\" may end up being empty). Large \"bins\" will have smaller data handling requirements and smooth out data deficiencies, but will result in a loss of resolution of fine scale data; small \"bins\" can result in large quantities of data to be handled (for example, a global coverage at 0.1 degree resolution requires over 6 million grid cells) which may be too much for easy handling. To date, 0.5 degree cells (50×50 km nominal size) have been found to be a reasonable compromise between resolution and data storage requirements for global coverages (259,200 cells), e.g. as used for Aquamaps,<ref name = \"Ready_et_al_2010\" /> while for more local applications, either 0.5 or 0.1 degree cells may be useful.

===Data reduction===
{{Main|data reduction}}
One advantage of binning spatial data as described above is that it offers the potential for [[data reduction]] in some use cases: for example rather than storing (say) hundreds of raw data points within the same bin, the data can be represented as an average value and/or number of data points held, or just as presence/absence (for example as a range map). By this means, the quantity of information required to be stored in the spatial index and associated information can be substantially reduced in many cases, with a concomitant improvement in performance (speed of spatial queries and result mapping as desired).

===Hierarchical representation===
{{Main|Discrete global grid#Hierarchical grids}}
As a property of a discrete global grid, hierarchical notation ensures that the geocodes for finer resolutions of the mesh incorporate those of all their parents, permitting rapid search and/or data aggregation at any desired equal or higher level of the hierarchy. In the c-squares case, the code is extended by additional alphanumeric characters as the spatial resolution increases, with the corollary that resolution can be decreased if desired, merely by truncating the code by the relevant amount.

[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|An equal angle spherical (global) grid, represented in a \"real world\" (orthographic) perspective.]]
===Equal angle grids===
Equal angle grids (the class that includes c-squares) have the advantage that transformation of spatial data (for example as simple coordinates of latitude and longitude) in and out of the grid notation can be simple, since the latitude–longitude grid is itself equal angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/85ec/ec57454e66e3326b4aaf834ab9c5fe4e073c.pdf |last1=Kimerling |first1=A. Jon |last2=Sahr |first2=Kevin |last3=White |first3=Denis |last4=Song |first4=Lian |year=1999 |title=Comparing geometrical properties of global grids |journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271–288 |doi=}}</ref> On the actual surface of the globe, the cells are approximately \"square\" only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four. By contrast, equal area grids attempt to preserve a constant area for all cells at the same hierarchical level (resolution), at the expense of losing concordance with familiar lines of latitude and/or longitude.

===Regional (local/national) vs. global grids===
Local and/or national grids have been developed for use within a number of countries, for example the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|UK National Grid]] has been in use since 1946,<ref name = \"Nature_1946\">{{Cite journal |url=https://tos.org/oceanography/article/c-squares-a-new-spatial-indexing-system-and-its-applicability-to-the-descri |last=Anonymous |first=|year=1946 |title=The National Grid of the Ordnance Survey |journal=Nature |volume=158 |issue= |pages=510 |doi=10.1038/158510a0}}</ref> while a separate system is in use for [[Irish grid reference system|Ireland]]. Discontinuities occur where such grids meet or overlap, and some areas (for example the more offshore portions of surrounding seas and the [[Channel Islands]]) are not covered at all. Global grids offer a solution to this problem (providing standard treatment for all areas of the globe) and also offer a potential format for collation of cross-national data into a single repository for analysis and reporting, for example see Vanhee ''et al''., 2018.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" />

==The c-squares global grid notation==
[[File:WMO-squares-global.gif|thumb|Global coverage of 10x10 degree World Meteorological Organization (WMO) squares (= c-squares 10-degree grid)]]

===Initial 10 degree squares===
10-degree c-squares are specified as being identical to equivalent World Meteteorological Organization (WMO) square codes, refer illustration at right. These squares are aligned with 10-degree subdivisions of the global latitude–longitude grid, which for c-squares use is specified as employing the [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS84 datum]]. WMO (10 degree) squares are encoded with four digits, in the series 1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx and 7xxx.<ref name=\"NODC_1998\" /> The leading digit indicates the \"global quadrant\" with 1 for north-east (latitude and longitude are both positive), 3 for south-east (latitude is negative and longitude positive), 5 for south-west (latitude and longitude are both negative) and 7 for north-west (latitude is positive and longitude negative). The next digit, 0 through 8, corresponds to the tens of latitude degrees either north or south; while the remaining 2 digits, 00 through 17, correspond to the tens of longitude degrees either east or west (by specification, 0 is treated as positive). Thus the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 0,0 (latitude,longitude) is encoded 1000, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 0 and 10 degrees north (actually, 0 and 9.999...) and 0 and 9.999... degrees east; the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 80 N, 170 E is encoded 1817, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 80 and 90 degrees north and 170 and 179.999... degrees east.

===Subsequent recursive subdivision===
C-squares extends the initial WMO 10×10 square notation via a recursive series of \"cycles\", each 3 digits long (the final one may be 1 digit), separated by the colon character, the number of characters (and cycles) indicating the resolution encoded, as per these examples:
*1000 ... 10×10 degree square (up to 1000×1000 km nominal)
*1000:1 ... 5×5 degree square (up to 500×500 km nominal)
*1000:100 ... 1×1 degree square (up to 100×100 km nominal)
*1000:100:1 ... 0.5×0.5 degree square (up to 50×50km nominal)
*1000:100:100 ... 0.1×0.1 degree square (up to 10×10 km nominal)
*1000:100:100:1 ... 0.05×0.05 degree square (up to 5×5km nominal)
(etc.)

The nominal sizes given reflect the fact that at the equator, 1 degree of both latitude and longitude correspond to around 110 km, with the actual value for longitude declining between there and the poles, where it becomes zero (latitude actual: 110.567 km at the equator, 111.699 km at the poles; longitude actual: 111.320 km at the equator, 78.847 km at latitude ±45 degrees, 0 km at the poles); at a sample northern hemisphere latitude e.g. that of [[London]] (51.5 degrees north), a 1×1 degree square measures approximately 111×69 km.<ref>U.S. National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center: [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml Latitude/Longitude Distance Calculator]</ref>

[[File:C-squares geocode principle - SE intermediate quadrant example.gif|thumb|C-squares recursive subdivision principle - intermediate quadrant example (south-east global quadrant)]]
To produce the 1 or 3 digits in any cycle following the initial 4-digit, 10-degree square identifier, first an \"intermediate quadrant\", 1 through 4 is designated (refer diagram at right), where 1 indicates low absolute values of both latitude and longitude (regardless of sign), 2 indicates low longitude and high latitude, 3 indicates high latitude and low longitude, and 4 indicates high values for both; \"low\" and high\" being taken from the relevant portion of the data to be gridded (for example within the 10 degree cell extending from 10 to 20 degrees, 10 is treated as low and 19 as high). This leading digit in a cycle is then followed simply by the next applicable digit for first latitude and then longitude: thus an input value of latitude +11.0, longitude +12.0 degrees will be encoded as the 5 degree c-square code 1101:1 and the 1 degree code 1101:112. Inspection of this code will show that the input latitude value can be recovered directly from the digits 1<u>1</u>01:1<u>1</u>2 while the longitude is included as 11<u>01</u>:11<u>2</u>; the sign for these is both positive, as indicated by the first digit of the leading 4 (1 in this case, indicating the north east global quadrant).

From 2002 onwards (still current at 2020), an online \"[http://www.marine.csiro.au/marq/csq_builder.init latlong to c-squares conversion page]\" is available at the website of CSIRO Marine Research (now CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere) which will convert input values of latitude and longitude to the equivalent c-square code at user selectable resolutions from 10 to 0.1 degree cell size. Alternatively it is a comparatively simple task to program from first principles (or construct as, for example, a [[Microsoft Excel]] worksheet) according to the c-squares specification;<ref name=\"c-squares_spec\">[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/spec1-1.htm C-squares Specification - Version 1.1 (December 2005)]</ref> an example is available [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/c-squares-encoder.xls here].

==C-squares strings, and the c-squares mapper==
A set of c-squares (contiguous or non contiguous) can be represented as a concatenated list of individual square codes, separated by the \"pipe\" (|) character, thus: 7500:110:3|7500:110:1|1500:110:3|1500:110:1 (etc.). This set of squares can then serve as an indication of a dataset extent, similar in function (but simpler to specify) to a MultiPolygon in the [[Well-known text representation of geometry]], the functional difference being that defined points forming the boundary of a polygon can be continuously variable, while those for the c-square boundaries are constrained to fixed intervals from the grid square resolution in use. If these strings are stored, for example as \"long text\" within a field of a conventional text storage system (e.g. spreadsheet, database, etc.) they can be used for the operation of spatial searches (see following section/s).

C-squares strings can also be used directly as input to an instance of the \"c-squares mapper\", a web-based utility in operation since 2002 at CSIRO in Australia (under the domain obis.org.au) and also at other global locations. To visualize the position of any set of squares on a map, the current syntax to address an installation of the \"c-squares mapper\" is (e.g.):

[[Image:Aquamap-mola-mola-20091106-med-res.png|right|240px|thumb|[[AquaMaps|AquaMap]] for ''Mola mola'', the ocean sunfish, generated via the c-squares mapper at 0.5 degree square resolution]]
It should be noted here that the above call to the c-squares mapper is a simple one, with only a single parameter (a single c-squares string) which produces a simple \"default map\"; the mapper is in fact quite highly customizable, capable of accepting up to seven c-squares strings concurrently, plotting them in user-specified colours, with a choice of empty of filled squares, user-selectable base map, etc. etc.; a full list of available input parameters is provided on the mapper \"technical information\" page.<ref>[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/mapper-tech.htm CMAR c-squares Mapper - Technical Information] page</ref> A more sophisticated map produced using a larger number of available parameters is the colour-coded example at right ([[AquaMaps|AquaMap]], i.e. modelled distribution, for the ocean sunfish).

==Spatial searching==
In a system that uses c-squares codes as units of spatial indexing, a text-based search on any of these square identifiers will retrieve data associated with the relevant square. If a wildcard search is supported (for example in the case that the wildcard character is a percent sign), a search on \"7500%\" will retrieve all data items in that ten degree square, a search on \"7500:1%\" will retrieve all data items in that five degree square, etc.

The asterisk character \"*\" has a special (reserved) meaning in c-squares notation, being a \"compact\" notation indicating that all finer cells within a higher level cell are included, to the level of resolution indicated by the number of asterisks. In the example above, \"7500:*\" would indicate that all 4 five-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, \"7500:***\" would indicate that all 100 one-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, etc. This approach enables the filling of contiguous blocks of cells with an economy of characters in many cases (a form of [[data compression]]), that is useful for efficient storage and transfer of c-squares codes as required.

==Spatial data exchange and assembly==
Examples of the use of c-squares for multi-national data reporting and assembly include the use of 0.05 × 0.05 degree c-squares for VMS (vessel monitoring systems) data and fishing logbook data for [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]], the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,<ref name = \"ICES_2019\" /> and the reporting and collation of fishing activity by member states into 0.5 × 0.5 degree c-squares by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) of the European Commission.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" /><ref name = \"Holmes_et_al_2018\">Holmes, S.J., Gibin, M., Scott, F., Zanzi, A., ''et al.''

'''C-squares''' (acronym for the '''''concise spatial query and representation system''''') is a system of spatially unique, location-based identifiers ([[geocodes]]) for areas on the surface of the [[earth]], represented as cells from a [[Discrete Global Grid]] at a hierarchical set of resolution steps. The identifiers incorporate literal values of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in an interleaved notation (producing grid resolutions of 10, 1, 0.1 degrees, etc.), together with additional digits that support intermediate grid resolutions of 5, 0.5, 0.05 degrees, etc. The system was initially designed to represent data \"footprints\" or spatial extents in a more flexible manner than a standard [[minimum bounding rectangle]], and to support \"lightweight\", text-based spatial querying; it can also provide a set of identifiers for grid cells used for assembly, storage and analysis of spatially organised data. Dataset extents expressed in c-squares notation can be visualised using a web-based utility, the c-squares mapper, an online instance of which is currently provided by [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia. C-squares codes and associated published software are free to use and the software is released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL), a licence of the Free Software Foundation.

==History==
The c-squares method was developed by Tony Rees at [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia (then \"CSIRO Marine Research\") in 2001-2, initially as a method for spatial indexing, rapid query, and compact storage and visualization of dataset spatial \"footprints\" in an agency-specific [[Geospatial metadata|metadata directory]] (data catalogue).<ref name=\"about_c-squares\">CSIRO Marine Research, 2002: [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/about-csquares.htm About C-Squares.]</ref><ref name = \"Rees_2002\">Rees, Tony (2002): \"C-squares–a new metadata element for improved spatial querying and representation of spatial dataset coverage in metadata records\".

==Rationale==
===Indexing spatial data===
{{Main|Grid (spatial index)}}
Spatial data are inherently (at least) 2-dimensional; without additional indexing, a numeric range query in 2 dimensions (e.g. ''x'' and ''y'', or latitude and longitude) is required to retrieve data items within a particular area. Such queries are computationally expensive so it can be beneficial to pre-process (index) the data in some manner that reduces the inherent dimensionality from two to one dimension, for example as labelled cells of a grid; the grid labels can then be [[database index|indexed]] by standard, one dimensional methods for rapid search and retrieval,<ref>Rigaux, P., Scholl, M., and Voisard, A. 2002. Spatial Databases - with application to GIS. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 410pp.</ref> and/or searched by simple alphanumeric text searches. C-squares is an example of such a grid where the cell identifiers are designed to be human- as well as machine-readable, and to be concordant with recognizable and commonly intervals of latitude and longitude.

===Dataset footprints===
[[Geographic data and information|Spatial data]], that is, data associated with particular geographic locations on the earth, have spatial \"footprints\" that ideally are recorded in metadata systems or data catalogues, to support spatial searching of the resources in question.<ref name = \"Hill_2006\">Hill, Linda (2006). ''Georeferencing: The Geographic Associations of Information''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 260 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-262-08354-6}}</ref> A \"basic\" generalization of any data footprint is the minimum bounding rectangle or MBR, that is, the smallest set of boundaries of latitude and longitude that completely contain the data. Such stored rectangles are relatively simple to query as a mathematical operation (look for overlap with an input \"search\" rectangle) but, with real world data, may not be a good surrogate for the true data \"footprint\" if the latter contains disjoint or sparsely populated data items, items on a diagonal line, or items with significant \"holes\", such as a vessel track around a continent.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /> Representation as a set of smaller \"tiles\", such those denoted by c-square codes at an appropriate resolution, can more accurately reflect the shape of such non-rectangular and/or non-contiguous datasets.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /><ref name = \"Hill_2006\" />

===Data binning===
{{Main|Data binning}}
\"Binning\" describes the process of converting continuously variable data (in the present case, spatial locations in degrees of latitude and longitude) into a set of discrete \"bins\" in order to apply the indexing and subsequent search/retrieval processes, other processing and reporting, etc. The optimal size of the spatial data \"bins\" can depend on the user's requirements (e.g. geographic coverage), desire for handling large vs. small datasets (which can affect the time required for processing or production of on-demand maps) and density of available data (with sparse input data, many \"bins\" may end up being empty). Large \"bins\" will have smaller data handling requirements and smooth out data deficiencies, but will result in a loss of resolution of fine scale data; small \"bins\" can result in large quantities of data to be handled (for example, a global coverage at 0.1 degree resolution requires over 6 million grid cells) which may be too much for easy handling. To date, 0.5 degree cells (50×50 km nominal size) have been found to be a reasonable compromise between resolution and data storage requirements for global coverages (259,200 cells), e.g. as used for Aquamaps,<ref name = \"Ready_et_al_2010\" /> while for more local applications, either 0.5 or 0.1 degree cells may be useful.

===Data reduction===
{{Main|data reduction}}
One advantage of binning spatial data as described above is that it offers the potential for [[data reduction]] in some use cases: for example rather than storing (say) hundreds of raw data points within the same bin, the data can be represented as an average value and/or number of data points held, or just as presence/absence (for example as a range map). By this means, the quantity of information required to be stored in the spatial index and associated information can be substantially reduced in many cases, with a concomitant improvement in performance (speed of spatial queries and result mapping as desired).

===Hierarchical representation===
{{Main|Discrete global grid#Hierarchical grids}}
As a property of a discrete global grid, hierarchical notation ensures that the geocodes for finer resolutions of the mesh incorporate those of all their parents, permitting rapid search and/or data aggregation at any desired equal or higher level of the hierarchy. In the c-squares case, the code is extended by additional alphanumeric characters as the spatial resolution increases, with the corollary that resolution can be decreased if desired, merely by truncating the code by the relevant amount.

[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|An equal angle spherical (global) grid, represented in a \"real world\" (orthographic) perspective.]]
===Equal angle grids===
Equal angle grids (the class that includes c-squares) have the advantage that transformation of spatial data (for example as simple coordinates of latitude and longitude) in and out of the grid notation can be simple, since the latitude–longitude grid is itself equal angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/85ec/ec57454e66e3326b4aaf834ab9c5fe4e073c.pdf |last1=Kimerling |first1=A. Jon |last2=Sahr |first2=Kevin |last3=White |first3=Denis |last4=Song |first4=Lian |year=1999 |title=Comparing geometrical properties of global grids |journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271–288 |doi=}}</ref> On the actual surface of the globe, the cells are approximately \"square\" only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four. By contrast, equal area grids attempt to preserve a constant area for all cells at the same hierarchical level (resolution), at the expense of losing concordance with familiar lines of latitude and/or longitude.

===Regional (local/national) vs. global grids===
Local and/or national grids have been developed for use within a number of countries, for example the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|UK National Grid]] has been in use since 1946,<ref name = \"Nature_1946\">{{Cite journal |url=https://tos.org/oceanography/article/c-squares-a-new-spatial-indexing-system-and-its-applicability-to-the-descri |last=Anonymous |first=|year=1946 |title=The National Grid of the Ordnance Survey |journal=Nature |volume=158 |issue= |pages=510 |doi=10.1038/158510a0}}</ref> while a separate system is in use for [[Irish grid reference system|Ireland]]. Discontinuities occur where such grids meet or overlap, and some areas (for example the more offshore portions of surrounding seas and the [[Channel Islands]]) are not covered at all. Global grids offer a solution to this problem (providing standard treatment for all areas of the globe) and also offer a potential format for collation of cross-national data into a single repository for analysis and reporting, for example see Vanhee ''et al''., 2018.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" />

==The c-squares global grid notation==
[[File:WMO-squares-global.gif|thumb|Global coverage of 10x10 degree World Meteorological Organization (WMO) squares (= c-squares 10-degree grid)]]

===Initial 10 degree squares===
10-degree c-squares are specified as being identical to equivalent World Meteteorological Organization (WMO) square codes, refer illustration at right. These squares are aligned with 10-degree subdivisions of the global latitude–longitude grid, which for c-squares use is specified as employing the [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS84 datum]]. WMO (10 degree) squares are encoded with four digits, in the series 1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx and 7xxx.<ref name=\"NODC_1998\" /> The leading digit indicates the \"global quadrant\" with 1 for north-east (latitude and longitude are both positive), 3 for south-east (latitude is negative and longitude positive), 5 for south-west (latitude and longitude are both negative) and 7 for north-west (latitude is positive and longitude negative). The next digit, 0 through 8, corresponds to the tens of latitude degrees either north or south; while the remaining 2 digits, 00 through 17, correspond to the tens of longitude degrees either east or west (by specification, 0 is treated as positive). Thus the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 0,0 (latitude,longitude) is encoded 1000, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 0 and 10 degrees north (actually, 0 and 9.999...) and 0 and 9.999... degrees east; the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 80 N, 170 E is encoded 1817, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 80 and 90 degrees north and 170 and 179.999... degrees east.

===Subsequent recursive subdivision===
C-squares extends the initial WMO 10×10 square notation via a recursive series of \"cycles\", each 3 digits long (the final one may be 1 digit), separated by the colon character, the number of characters (and cycles) indicating the resolution encoded, as per these examples:
*1000 ... 10×10 degree square (up to 1000×1000 km nominal)
*1000:1 ... 5×5 degree square (up to 500×500 km nominal)
*1000:100 ... 1×1 degree square (up to 100×100 km nominal)
*1000:100:1 ... 0.5×0.5 degree square (up to 50×50km nominal)
*1000:100:100 ... 0.1×0.1 degree square (up to 10×10 km nominal)
*1000:100:100:1 ... 0.05×0.05 degree square (up to 5×5km nominal)
(etc.)

The nominal sizes given reflect the fact that at the equator, 1 degree of both latitude and longitude correspond to around 110 km, with the actual value for longitude declining between there and the poles, where it becomes zero (latitude actual: 110.567 km at the equator, 111.699 km at the poles; longitude actual: 111.320 km at the equator, 78.847 km at latitude ±45 degrees, 0 km at the poles); at a sample northern hemisphere latitude e.g. that of [[London]] (51.5 degrees north), a 1×1 degree square measures approximately 111×69 km.<ref>U.S. National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center: [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml Latitude/Longitude Distance Calculator]</ref>

[[File:C-squares geocode principle - SE intermediate quadrant example.gif|thumb|C-squares recursive subdivision principle - intermediate quadrant example (south-east global quadrant)]]
To produce the 1 or 3 digits in any cycle following the initial 4-digit, 10-degree square identifier, first an \"intermediate quadrant\", 1 through 4 is designated (refer diagram at right), where 1 indicates low absolute values of both latitude and longitude (regardless of sign), 2 indicates low longitude and high latitude, 3 indicates high latitude and low longitude, and 4 indicates high values for both; \"low\" and high\" being taken from the relevant portion of the data to be gridded (for example within the 10 degree cell extending from 10 to 20 degrees, 10 is treated as low and 19 as high). This leading digit in a cycle is then followed simply by the next applicable digit for first latitude and then longitude: thus an input value of latitude +11.0, longitude +12.0 degrees will be encoded as the 5 degree c-square code 1101:1 and the 1 degree code 1101:112. Inspection of this code will show that the input latitude value can be recovered directly from the digits 1<u>1</u>01:1<u>1</u>2 while the longitude is included as 11<u>01</u>:11<u>2</u>; the sign for these is both positive, as indicated by the first digit of the leading 4 (1 in this case, indicating the north east global quadrant).

From 2002 onwards (still current at 2020), an online \"[http://www.marine.csiro.au/marq/csq_builder.init latlong to c-squares conversion page]\" is available at the website of CSIRO Marine Research (now CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere) which will convert input values of latitude and longitude to the equivalent c-square code at user selectable resolutions from 10 to 0.1 degree cell size. Alternatively it is a comparatively simple task to program from first principles (or construct as, for example, a [[Microsoft Excel]] worksheet) according to the c-squares specification;<ref name=\"c-squares_spec\">[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/spec1-1.htm C-squares Specification - Version 1.1 (December 2005)]</ref> an example is available [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/c-squares-encoder.xls here].

==C-squares strings, and the c-squares mapper==
A set of c-squares (contiguous or non contiguous) can be represented as a concatenated list of individual square codes, separated by the \"pipe\" (|) character, thus: 7500:110:3|7500:110:1|1500:110:3|1500:110:1 (etc.). This set of squares can then serve as an indication of a dataset extent, similar in function (but simpler to specify) to a MultiPolygon in the [[Well-known text representation of geometry]], the functional difference being that defined points forming the boundary of a polygon can be continuously variable, while those for the c-square boundaries are constrained to fixed intervals from the grid square resolution in use. If these strings are stored, for example as \"long text\" within a field of a conventional text storage system (e.g. spreadsheet, database, etc.) they can be used for the operation of spatial searches (see following section/s).

C-squares strings can also be used directly as input to an instance of the \"c-squares mapper\", a web-based utility in operation since 2002 at CSIRO in Australia (under the domain obis.org.au) and also at other global locations. To visualize the position of any set of squares on a map, the current syntax to address an installation of the \"c-squares mapper\" is (e.g.):

[http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2|3112:370:2|3112:360:4|3111:360:3|3110:469:3|3112:360:3|3111:469:2|3111:469:1|3110:469:1|3111:458:4|3111:458:3|3110:458:2|3111:457:2|3111:247:3|3110:248:3|3111:246:2|3110:247:2|3111:235:4|3111:134:1|3110:237:1|3112:235:2|3112:225:3|3111:122:4|3110:227:3|3112:124:4|3111:121:2|3112:124:1|3112:122:2|3112:123:1|3110:216:4|3112:112:3|3111:110:3|3110:217:1|3110:216:2|3110:205:3|3110:205:1|3110:206:2|3110:205:2|3010:496:4|3010:496:2 http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2| (etc.)].

[[Image:Aquamap-mola-mola-20091106-med-res.png|right|240px|thumb|[[AquaMaps|AquaMap]] for ''Mola mola'', the ocean sunfish, generated via the c-squares mapper at 0.5 degree square resolution]]
It should be noted here that the above call to the c-squares mapper is a simple one, with only a single parameter (a single c-squares string) which produces a simple \"default map\"; the mapper is in fact quite highly customizable, capable of accepting up to seven c-squares strings concurrently, plotting them in user-specified colours, with a choice of empty of filled squares, user-selectable base map, etc. etc.; a full list of available input parameters is provided on the mapper \"technical information\" page.<ref>[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/mapper-tech.htm CMAR c-squares Mapper - Technical Information] page</ref> A more sophisticated map produced using a larger number of available parameters is the colour-coded example at right ([[AquaMaps|AquaMap]], i.e. modelled distribution, for the ocean sunfish).

==Spatial searching==
In a system that uses c-squares codes as units of spatial indexing, a text-based search on any of these square identifiers will retrieve data associated with the relevant square. If a wildcard search is supported (for example in the case that the wildcard character is a percent sign), a search on \"7500%\" will retrieve all data items in that ten degree square, a search on \"7500:1%\" will retrieve all data items in that five degree square, etc.

The asterisk character \"*\" has a special (reserved) meaning in c-squares notation, being a \"compact\" notation indicating that all finer cells within a higher level cell are included, to the level of resolution indicated by the number of asterisks. In the example above, \"7500:*\" would indicate that all 4 five-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, \"7500:***\" would indicate that all 100 one-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, etc. This approach enables the filling of contiguous blocks of cells with an economy of characters in many cases (a form of [[data compression]]), that is useful for efficient storage and transfer of c-squares codes as required.

==Spatial data exchange and assembly==
Examples of the use of c-squares for multi-national data reporting and assembly include the use of 0.05 × 0.05 degree c-squares for VMS (vessel monitoring systems) data and fishing logbook data for [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]], the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,<ref name = \"ICES_2019\" /> and the reporting and collation of fishing activity by member states into 0.5 × 0.5 degree c-squares by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) of the European Commission.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" /><ref name = \"Holmes_et_al_2018\">Holmes, S.J., Gibin, M., Scott, F., Zanzi, A., ''et al.''

Its history goes back to the building of a Roman fort called [[Concangis]]. This Roman fort is the \"Chester\" (from the Latin ''[[castra]]'') of the town's name; the \"Street\" refers to the paved Roman road that ran north–south through the town, and which is now called Front Street.

Chester-le-Street is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} south of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} west of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] on the [[River Wear]]. The parish church of [[St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street|St Mary and St Cuthbert]] is where the body of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St Cuthbert]] remained for 112 years before being transferred to [[Durham Cathedral]], and the site of the first translation of the [[Gospels]] into English, [[Aldred the Scribe|Aldred]] writing the Old English [[Gloss (annotation)|gloss]] between the lines of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 339–40</ref>

A [[market town]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4durhamcounty.co.uk/towns.php?town=Chester-le-Street|title=Towns in County Durham: Chester-le-Street|accessdate=13 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328011245/http://www.4durhamcounty.co.uk/towns.php?town=Chester-le-Street|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the town holds markets Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

From 1894 until 2009 the town had its own local government district. Originally from 1894, this was the [[Chester-le-Street Rural District]], which covered the town and several outlying villages. In 1909 the inner part of the Rural District was separated out to form the new Chester-le-Street Urban District Council, which covered the town as it was at that time. By 1974, however, the town of Chester-le-Street had expanded far beyond the boundary of the Urban District and during that year's Local Government reorganisation, the Urban District was amalgamated with parts of the remaining Rural District to form the new [[Chester-le-Street (district)|Chester-le-Street District]]. The Chester-le-Street District Council was abolished in 2009 when County Durham became a unitary authority as part of the [[2009 structural changes to local government in England]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/newsediting/1884450.Unitary_authority_for_County_Durham_confirmed|title=Unitary authority for County Durham confirmed|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/6915882.stm|title=Durham unitary authority approved|accessdate=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|date=25 July 2007}}</ref> a move that was controversial at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/1436760.Public_misled_over_unitary_authority_support___claim

==History==
There is evidence of [[Iron Age]] use of the [[River Wear]] near the town,<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 6</ref> but the history of Chester-le-Street starts with the Roman fort of [[Concangis]]. This was built alongside the Roman road [[Cade's Road]] (now Front Street) and close to the River Wear, around 100 A.D., and was occupied till the Romans left Britain in 410 A.D. At the time the Wear was navigable to at least Concangis, and may also have provided food for the garrisons stationed there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 45–92</ref>

After the Romans left there is no record of who lived there (apart from some wounded soldiers from wars who had to live there), until 883 when a group of monks, driven out of [[Lindisfarne]] seven years earlier, stopped there to build a wooden shrine and church to St Cuthbert, whose body they had borne with them. While they were there the town was the centre of Christianity for much of the northeast, because it was the seat of the [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], making the church a cathedral. There the monks translated into English the Lindisfarne Gospels, which they had brought with them. They stayed for 112 years, leaving in 995 for the safer and more permanent home at Durham.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 337–40</ref>  The title has been revived as the Roman Catholic [[titular see]] of [[Cuncacestre]].

The church was rebuilt in stone in 1054, and despite the loss of its [[Diocese|bishopric]] seems to have retained a degree of wealth and influence. In 1080 most of the huts in the town were burned and many people killed in retaliation for the death of [[William Walcher]], the first [[prince-bishop]], at the hands of an English mob. After this devastation wrought by the [[Normans]] the region was left out of the [[Domesday Book]]; there was little left to record, and the region was by then being run from Durham by the prince-bishops so held little interest for London.<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 354</ref>

Cade's Road did not fall out of use but was hidden beneath later roads which became the Great North Road, the main route from London and the south to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh]]. The town's location on the road played a significant role in its development, as well as its name, as [[Public house#Inns|inn]]s sprang up to cater for the travelling trade: both riders and horses needed to rest on journeys usually taking days to complete. This trade reached a peak in the early 19th century as more and more people and new mail services were carried by [[stagecoach]], before falling off with the coming of the railways. The town was bypassed when the [[A167]] was routed around the town, and this was later supplanted by the faster [[A1(M)]].<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 16</ref>

The coal industry also left its mark on the town. From the late 17th century onwards coal was dug in increasing quantities in the region. Mining was centred around the rivers, for transportation by sea to other parts of the country, and Chester-le-Street was at the centre of the coal being dug and shipped away down the Wear, so a centre of coal related communication and commerce. At the same time the growth of the mines and the influx of miners supported local businesses, not just the many inns but new shops and services, themselves bringing in more people to work in them. These people would later work in new industries established in the town to take advantage of its good communications and access to raw materials.<ref>Selkirk (2001) pp. 391–427</ref>

One of the most tragic episodes in the town's history and that of the coal industry in NE England occurred during a miners' strike during the winter of 1811/12.<ref>William Page, ''The Victorian History of the County of Durham'' 3 volumes (London, 1907), vol II, p. 153</ref> Collieries owned by the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral were brought to a standstill by the strike, causing much hardship amongst the people of the town. The strike was broken on New Year's Day, 1 January 1812, when the Bishop of Durham, [[Shute Barrington]], sent a detachment of troops from Durham Castle to force a return to work. It is thought that this uncharacteristic act by Barrington was due to pressure from the national government in Westminster who were concerned that the strike was affecting industrial output of essential armaments for the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===The Jarrow March===
On the evening of 5 October 1936 the [[Jarrow March]]ers stopped at the town centre after their first day's walk. The church hall was used to house them before they continued onward the following day.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jarrow crusade: protest and legend|author=Matt Perry|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LVKyAAAAIAAJ|isbn=1-873757-60-3|year=2005|page=31}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The Romans called their fort ''Concangis'' or ''Concagium'', a Latinisation of the [[Celts|Celtic]] name for the area, which also gave name to the waterway through the town, [[Cong Burn]]. The precise name is uncertain as it does not appear in Roman records, but ''Concangis'' is the name most cited today.<ref>Selkirk (2001) p. 45</ref><ref>Purdon (1992) p. 8</ref> Although a meaning \"Place of the horse people\" has been given,{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} scholarly authorities consider the meaning of the name obscure.<ref name=\"heroicage.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html|title=Fox—The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland|website=www.heroicage.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html|title=Fox—P-Celtic Place-Names—Appendix|website=www.heroicage.org}}</ref>

[[Old English]] forms of the name include ''Cuneceastra''<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 10</ref> and ''Conceastre'',<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 337</ref> which takes its first two syllables from the Roman name, with the addition of the Old English word ''ceaster'' 'Roman fortification'.<ref name=\"heroicage.org\"/> This was shortened over time to Chester, the name used locally for the town ([[Latin]]ised as ''Cestria'').<ref group=\"nb\">For example the old bell in St Mary and St Cuthbert is inscribed in Latin {{quote|{{smallcaps|Magister Robertus Aschbern, Decanus Cestriae, me fecit. Hac campana data Cuthbertus sic cocitata}}<br>Master Robert Ashburn, Dean of Chester, made me. This bell given is thus named Cuthbert}}</ref> But \"Chester\" is a common name for towns in England, and in the Middle Ages \"Street\", for the Roman road, was added. The Universal etymological English dictionary of 1749 gives the town as \"Chester upon Street\" (and describes it as \"a Village in the Bishoprick of Durham\").<ref>{{cite book|title=An universal etymological English dictionary|author=Bailey, Nathan|year=1749|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UucIAAAAQAAJ|page=168}}</ref> At some point this was shortened to the modern form.

==Climate==
[[File:ChesterleStreetFlood.JPG|thumb|Flooding on Front Street in 2007]]

The town has a mild climate and gets well below average rainfall relative to the UK. It does though experience occasional [[flood]]s. To the east of the town lies the Riverside cricket ground and [[Riverside Park (Chester-le-Street)|Riverside Park]]. They were built on the flood plains of the River Wear, and are often flooded when the river bursts its banks. The town centre is subject to occasional [[flash flooding]], usually after very heavy rain over the town and surrounding areas, if the rain falls too quickly for it to be drained away by Cong Burn. The flooding occurs at the bottom of Front Street where the Cong Burn passes under the street, after it was enclosed in concrete in 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|title=The Great Flood|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024092636/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml|title=Market Refurbishment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024014620/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml| archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref>

==Landmarks==
[[File:St Mary and St Cuthbert's Church, Chester-le-Street, County Durham.jpg|thumb|left|Parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert]]

[[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] described Chester-le-Street in the 1530s as \"Chiefly one main street of very mean building in height.\", a sentiment echoed by [[Daniel Defoe]].

===St Mary and St Cuthbert church===
{{main| St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street}}
St Mary and St Cuthbert church possesses a rare surviving anchorage, one of the best-preserved in the country. It was built for an [[anchorite]], an extreme form of hermit. His or her walled-up cell had only a slit to observe the altar and an opening for food, while outside was an open grave for when the occupant died. It was occupied by six anchorites from 1383 to c. 1538, and is now a museum known as the Anker's House. The north aisle is occupied by a line of Lumley family effigies, only five genuine, assembled circa 1590. Some have been chopped off to fit and resemble a casualty station at Agincourt, according to [[Sir Simon Jenkins]] in his ''England's Thousand Best Churches''. It is Chester-le-Street's only Grade I [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11004 |title=Chester-le-Street, Church of St Mary & St Cuthbert; Listed building (Chester-le-Street) |publisher=[[Durham County Council]] |accessdate=28 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616212655/http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11004 |archivedate=16 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Chester Burn viaduct===
{{main|Chester Burn viaduct}}
The viaduct to the northwest of the town centre was completed in 1868 for the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]], to enable trains to travel at high speed on a more direct route between Newcastle and Durham. It is over 230m long with 11 arches, now spanning a road and supermarket car-park, and is a Grade II listed building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keystothepast.info/Pages/pgDetail.aspx?PRN=D34970|title=Railway Viaduct Over Chester Burn (Chester-le-Street)|publisher=[[Durham County Council]]|accessdate=1 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410130949/http://www.keystothepast.info/Pages/pgDetail.aspx?PRN=D34970#|archive-date=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Lumley Castle===
[[Lumley Castle]] was built in 1388. It sits upon the eastern bank of the [[River Wear]] and overlooks the town and the Riverside Park.

===Bethel United Reformed church===
The small [[United Reformed Church]] on Low Chare, just off the main Front Street, was built in 1814 as the Bethel [[Congregational church|Congregational Chapel]] and remodelled in 1860. It is still in use and is a Grade II listed building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11005|title=Chester-le-Street, United Reformed Church; Listed building (Chester-le-Street)|publisher=[[Durham County Council]]|accessdate=28 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616212807/http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11005|archivedate=16 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===The Queens Head Hotel===
The Queens Head Hotel, locally known as The Queens Head, is located in the central area of the Front Street. It was built over 250 years ago when this road was the main route from Edinburgh and Newcastle to the south and London. It is set back from the street and is still one of the largest buildings in the street and so the town centre, and is a Grade II listed building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11046|title=Queens Head Hotel; Listed building (Chester-le-Street)|publisher=[[Durham County Council]]|accessdate=28 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616212830/http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11046|archivedate=16 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===The Post Office===
Chester-le-Street Post Office at 137 Front Street is in the Art Deco style and replaced a smaller building located on the corner of Relton Terrace and Ivanhoe Terrace, and was opened in 1936. It is unusual in that it is one of a handful<ref>The website http://britishpostofficearchitects.weebly.com/ lists Bradford-on-Avon, Builth Wells, Havant, March and Wallingford</ref> of post offices that display the [[royal cypher]] from the brief reign of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]].

==Sport==

===Cricket===
The [[Riverside Ground]], known for sponsorship reasons as the Emirates Riverside, is home to [[Durham County Cricket Club]] which became a first class county in 1992. Since 1999, the ground has hosted many international fixtures, usually involving the [[England cricket team]]. The ground was also host to two fixtures at the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], and three fixtures at the [[2019 Cricket World Cup]].
The town also has its own cricket club, Chester-le-Street Cricket Club based at the [[Ropery Lane]] ground. They are the current Champions of the North East Premier League, won the national ECB 45 over tournament in 2009 and reached the quarter final of the national 20/20 club championship in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cles.play-cricket.com/home/home.asp|title=Chester-le-Street – Play-Cricket|accessdate=10 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711082709/http://cles.play-cricket.com/home/home.asp|archivedate=11 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesterlestreet-cc.com|title=Chester-le-Street Cricket Club|accessdate=10 February 2010}}</ref>

===Rowing===
[[File:Chester Le Street Amateur Rowing Club Rowing Blade.svg|thumb|Blade colours of Chester-le-Street rowing club]]

Chester-le-Street Amateur Rowing Club is based on the River Wear near the Riverside cricket ground and has been there for over 100 years. During the summer months the club operate mainly on the river, but in the winter move to indoor sessions during the evenings and use the river at weekends.

The Club has over 160 members of which 90 are junior members, with numbers increasing annually. The club are well thought of by British Rowing as a lead club for junior development with many juniors now competing at GB level, and some competing for GB at international events.

===Football===
[[Medieval football]] was once played in the town. The game was played annually on [[Shrove Tuesday]] between the \"Upstreeters\" and \"Downstreeters\". Play started at 1&nbsp;pm and finished at 6&nbsp;pm. To start the game, the ball was thrown from a window in the centre of the town and in one game more than 400 players took part. The centre of the street was the dividing line and the winner was the side where the ball was (Up or Down) at 6&nbsp;pm. It was played from the Middle Ages until 1932, when it was outlawed by the police and people trying to carry on the tradition were arrested.<ref>Purdon (1992) pp. 21–22</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page24.phtml|title=Shrove Tide Football|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111025115/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page24.phtml|archivedate=11 November 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  [[Chester-le-Street Town F.C.]] were founded in 1972 and compete in the [[Northern Football League]] Division Two.

==Transport==

===Road===
At the time of the football matches 'Front Street' was actually the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]] from London to [[Edinburgh]]. A bypass was built in the 1950s, which still exists today as the [[A167 road|A167]]. The bypass road itself was partly bypassed by, and partly incorporated in, the [[A1(M)]] motorway in the 1970s.

The northern end of Front Street used to be the start of the A6127, which is the road that would continue through [[Birtley, Tyne and Wear|Birtley]], [[Gateshead]], and eventually over the [[Tyne Bridge]] and become the A6127(M) central motorway in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. However, when the Gateshead-Newcastle Western Bypass of the [[A1(M)]] was opened, many roads in this area were renumbered, following the convention that roads originating between single digit A roads take their first digit from the single digit A road in an anticlockwise direction from their point of origin, and Newcastle Road, which was formerly designated [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], is now unclassified. The A6127 was renamed the [[A167 road|A167]]. Car traffic is now banned from the northern part of Front Street and it is restricted to buses, cyclists and delivery vehicles for the shops.

===Rail===
[[File:Chester-le-Street Railway Station.jpg|thumb|left|Chester-le-Street Railway Station]]
[[Chester-le-Street railway station]], on the [[East Coast Main Line]] of the [[National Rail]] network, between Newcastle and Durham, opened in 1868. It offers local connections and cross-country train services. {{As of|2008}}, train operators serving the station are [[CrossCountry]], [[TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]].

A local independent company, Chester-le-Track, has operated the station since 1999, as an agent for [[Arriva Trains Northern]] and Northern Rail, but ceased trading from close of business on Saturday 31 March 2018. The station is now staffed on a part-time basis by Northern Rail.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/CLS/details.aspx|title=National Rail Enquiries - Station facilities for Chester-le-Street|website=www.nationalrail.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}</ref>

The town is mentioned in the 1963 song \"Slow Train\" by Flanders and Swann: <blockquote>''<poem>
No churns, no porter, no cat on a seat,
At Chorlton-cum-Hardy or Chester-le-Street.<ref>{{cite web|title=At the Drop of Another Hat: Slow Train|website=Flanders and Swann Online|url=http://www.nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/fas/anotherhat_slow.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413054716/http://www.nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/fas/anotherhat_slow.html|archivedate=13 April 2013}}</ref></poem>''</blockquote>

===Bus===
The town is the original home of The Northern General Transport [Bus] Company, nowadays [[Go North East]], and the company still operates from the Picktree Lane Depot. It also pioneered the use of Minilink bus services in the North East in 1985.

Its history goes back to the building of a Roman fort called [[Concangis]]. This Roman fort is the \"Chester\" (from the Latin ''[[castra]]'') of the town's name; the \"Street\" refers to the paved Roman road that ran north–south through the town, and which is now called Front Street.

Chester-le-Street is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} south of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} west of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] on the [[River Wear]]. The parish church of [[St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street|St Mary and St Cuthbert]] is where the body of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St Cuthbert]] remained for 112 years before being transferred to [[Durham Cathedral]], and the site of the first translation of the [[Gospels]] into English, [[Aldred the Scribe|Aldred]] writing the Old English [[Gloss (annotation)|gloss]] between the lines of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 339–40</ref>

A [[market town]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4durhamcounty.co.uk/towns.php?town=Chester-le-Street|title=Towns in County Durham: Chester-le-Street|accessdate=13 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328011245/http://www.4durhamcounty.co.uk/towns.php?town=Chester-le-Street|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the town holds markets Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

From 1894 until 2009 the town had its own local government district. Originally from 1894, this was the [[Chester-le-Street Rural District]], which covered the town and several outlying villages. In 1909 the inner part of the Rural District was separated out to form the new Chester-le-Street Urban District Council, which covered the town as it was at that time. By 1974, however, the town of Chester-le-Street had expanded far beyond the boundary of the Urban District and during that year's Local Government reorganisation, the Urban District was amalgamated with parts of the remaining Rural District to form the new [[Chester-le-Street (district)|Chester-le-Street District]]. The Chester-le-Street District Council was abolished in 2009 when County Durham became a unitary authority as part of the [[2009 structural changes to local government in England]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/newsediting/1884450.Unitary_authority_for_County_Durham_confirmed|title=Unitary authority for County Durham confirmed|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/6915882.stm|title=Durham unitary authority approved|accessdate=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|date=25 July 2007}}</ref> a move that was controversial at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/1436760.Public_misled_over_unitary_authority_support___claim

==History==
There is evidence of [[Iron Age]] use of the [[River Wear]] near the town,<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 6</ref> but the history of Chester-le-Street starts with the Roman fort of [[Concangis]]. This was built alongside the Roman road [[Cade's Road]] (now Front Street) and close to the River Wear, around 100 A.D., and was occupied till the Romans left Britain in 410 A.D. At the time the Wear was navigable to at least Concangis, and may also have provided food for the garrisons stationed there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 45–92</ref>

After the Romans left there is no record of who lived there (apart from some wounded soldiers from wars who had to live there), until 883 when a group of monks, driven out of [[Lindisfarne]] seven years earlier, stopped there to build a wooden shrine and church to St Cuthbert, whose body they had borne with them. While they were there the town was the centre of Christianity for much of the northeast, because it was the seat of the [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], making the church a cathedral. There the monks translated into English the Lindisfarne Gospels, which they had brought with them. They stayed for 112 years, leaving in 995 for the safer and more permanent home at Durham.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 337–40</ref>  The title has been revived as the Roman Catholic [[titular see]] of [[Cuncacestre]].

The church was rebuilt in stone in 1054, and despite the loss of its [[Diocese|bishopric]] seems to have retained a degree of wealth and influence. In 1080 most of the huts in the town were burned and many people killed in retaliation for the death of [[William Walcher]], the first [[prince-bishop]], at the hands of an English mob. After this devastation wrought by the [[Normans]] the region was left out of the [[Domesday Book]]; there was little left to record, and the region was by then being run from Durham by the prince-bishops so held little interest for London.<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 354</ref>

Cade's Road did not fall out of use but was hidden beneath later roads which became the Great North Road, the main route from London and the south to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh]]. The town's location on the road played a significant role in its development, as well as its name, as [[Public house#Inns|inn]]s sprang up to cater for the travelling trade: both riders and horses needed to rest on journeys usually taking days to complete. This trade reached a peak in the early 19th century as more and more people and new mail services were carried by [[stagecoach]], before falling off with the coming of the railways. The town was bypassed when the [[A167]] was routed around the town, and this was later supplanted by the faster [[A1(M)]].<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 16</ref>

The coal industry also left its mark on the town. From the late 17th century onwards coal was dug in increasing quantities in the region. Mining was centred around the rivers, for transportation by sea to other parts of the country, and Chester-le-Street was at the centre of the coal being dug and shipped away down the Wear, so a centre of coal related communication and commerce. At the same time the growth of the mines and the influx of miners supported local businesses, not just the many inns but new shops and services, themselves bringing in more people to work in them. These people would later work in new industries established in the town to take advantage of its good communications and access to raw materials.<ref>Selkirk (2001) pp. 391–427</ref>

One of the most tragic episodes in the town's history and that of the coal industry in NE England occurred during a miners' strike during the winter of 1811/12.<ref>William Page, ''The Victorian History of the County of Durham'' 3 volumes (London, 1907), vol II, p. 153</ref> Collieries owned by the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral were brought to a standstill by the strike, causing much hardship amongst the people of the town. The strike was broken on New Year's Day, 1 January 1812, when the Bishop of Durham, [[Shute Barrington]], sent a detachment of troops from Durham Castle to force a return to work. It is thought that this uncharacteristic act by Barrington was due to pressure from the national government in Westminster who were concerned that the strike was affecting industrial output of essential armaments for the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===The Jarrow March===
On the evening of 5 October 1936 the [[Jarrow March]]ers stopped at the town centre after their first day's walk. The church hall was used to house them before they continued onward the following day.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jarrow crusade: protest and legend|author=Matt Perry|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LVKyAAAAIAAJ|isbn=1-873757-60-3|year=2005|page=31}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The Romans called their fort ''Concangis'' or ''Concagium'', a Latinisation of the [[Celts|Celtic]] name for the area, which also gave name to the waterway through the town, [[Cong Burn]]. The precise name is uncertain as it does not appear in Roman records, but ''Concangis'' is the name most cited today.<ref>Selkirk (2001) p. 45</ref><ref>Purdon (1992) p. 8</ref> Although a meaning \"Place of the horse people\" has been given,{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} scholarly authorities consider the meaning of the name obscure.<ref name=\"heroicage.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html|title=Fox—The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland|website=www.heroicage.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html|title=Fox—P-Celtic Place-Names—Appendix|website=www.heroicage.org}}</ref>

[[Old English]] forms of the name include ''Cuneceastra''<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 10</ref> and ''Conceastre'',<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 337</ref> which takes its first two syllables from the Roman name, with the addition of the Old English word ''ceaster'' 'Roman fortification'.<ref name=\"heroicage.org\"/> This was shortened over time to Chester, the name used locally for the town ([[Latin]]ised as ''Cestria'').<ref group=\"nb\">For example the old bell in St Mary and St Cuthbert is inscribed in Latin {{quote|{{smallcaps|Magister Robertus Aschbern, Decanus Cestriae, me fecit. Hac campana data Cuthbertus sic cocitata}}<br>Master Robert Ashburn, Dean of Chester, made me. This bell given is thus named Cuthbert}}</ref> But \"Chester\" is a common name for towns in England, and in the Middle Ages \"Street\", for the Roman road, was added. The Universal etymological English dictionary of 1749 gives the town as \"Chester upon Street\" (and describes it as \"a Village in the Bishoprick of Durham\").<ref>{{cite book|title=An universal etymological English dictionary|author=Bailey, Nathan|year=1749|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UucIAAAAQAAJ|page=168}}</ref> At some point this was shortened to the modern form.

==Climate==
[[File:ChesterleStreetFlood.JPG|thumb|Flooding on Front Street in 2007]]

The town has a mild climate and gets well below average rainfall relative to the UK. It does though experience occasional [[flood]]s. To the east of the town lies the Riverside cricket ground and [[Riverside Park (Chester-le-Street)|Riverside Park]]. They were built on the flood plains of the River Wear, and are often flooded when the river bursts its banks. The town centre is subject to occasional [[flash flooding]], usually after very heavy rain over the town and surrounding areas, if the rain falls too quickly for it to be drained away by Cong Burn. The flooding occurs at the bottom of Front Street where the Cong Burn passes under the street, after it was enclosed in concrete in 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|title=The Great Flood|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024092636/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml|title=Market Refurbishment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024014620/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml| archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref>

==Landmarks==
[[File:St Mary and St Cuthbert's Church, Chester-le-Street, County Durham.jpg|thumb|left|Parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert]]

[[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] described Chester-le-Street in the 1530s as \"Chiefly one main street of very mean building in height.\", a sentiment echoed by [[Daniel Defoe]].

===St Mary and St Cuthbert church===
{{main| St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street}}
St Mary and St Cuthbert church possesses a rare surviving anchorage, one of the best-preserved in the country. It was built for an [[anchorite]], an extreme form of hermit. His or her walled-up cell had only a slit to observe the altar and an opening for food, while outside was an open grave for when the occupant died. It was occupied by six anchorites from 1383 to c. 1538, and is now a museum known as the Anker's House. The north aisle is occupied by a line of Lumley family effigies, only five genuine, assembled circa 1590. Some have been chopped off to fit and resemble a casualty station at Agincourt, according to [[Sir Simon Jenkins]] in his ''England's Thousand Best Churches''. It is Chester-le-Street's only Grade I [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11004 |title=Chester-le-Street, Church of St Mary & St Cuthbert; Listed building (Chester-le-Street) |publisher=[[Durham County Council]] |accessdate=28 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616212655/http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11004 |archivedate=16 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Chester Burn viaduct===
{{main|Chester Burn viaduct}}
The viaduct to the northwest of the town centre was completed in 1868 for the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]], to enable trains to travel at high speed on a more direct route between Newcastle and Durham. It is over 230m long with 11 arches, now spanning a road and supermarket car-park, and is a Grade II listed building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keystothepast.info/Pages/pgDetail.aspx?PRN=D34970|title=Railway Viaduct Over Chester Burn (Chester-le-Street)|publisher=[[Durham County Council]]|accessdate=1 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410130949/http://www.keystothepast.info/Pages/pgDetail.aspx?PRN=D34970#|archive-date=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Lumley Castle===
[[Lumley Castle]] was built in 1388. It sits upon the eastern bank of the [[River Wear]] and overlooks the town and the Riverside Park.

===Bethel United Reformed church===
The small [[United Reformed Church]] on Low Chare, just off the main Front Street, was built in 1814 as the Bethel [[Congregational church|Congregational Chapel]] and remodelled in 1860. It is still in use and is a Grade II listed building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11005|title=Chester-le-Street, United Reformed Church; Listed building (Chester-le-Street)|publisher=[[Durham County Council]]|accessdate=28 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616212807/http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11005|archivedate=16 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===The Queens Head Hotel===
The Queens Head Hotel, locally known as The Queens Head, is located in the central area of the Front Street. It was built over 250 years ago when this road was the main route from Edinburgh and Newcastle to the south and London. It is set back from the street and is still one of the largest buildings in the street and so the town centre, and is a Grade II listed building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11046|title=Queens Head Hotel; Listed building (Chester-le-Street)|publisher=[[Durham County Council]]|accessdate=28 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616212830/http://www.keystothepast.info/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=D11046|archivedate=16 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===The Post Office===
Chester-le-Street Post Office at 137 Front Street is in the Art Deco style and replaced a smaller building located on the corner of Relton Terrace and Ivanhoe Terrace, and was opened in 1936. It is unusual in that it is one of a handful<ref>The website http://britishpostofficearchitects.weebly.com/ lists Bradford-on-Avon, Builth Wells, Havant, March and Wallingford</ref> of post offices that display the [[royal cypher]] from the brief reign of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]].

==Sport==

===Cricket===
The [[Riverside Ground]], known for sponsorship reasons as the Emirates Riverside, is home to [[Durham County Cricket Club]] which became a first class county in 1992. Since 1999, the ground has hosted many international fixtures, usually involving the [[England cricket team]]. The ground was also host to two fixtures at the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], and three fixtures at the [[2019 Cricket World Cup]].
The town also has its own cricket club, Chester-le-Street Cricket Club based at the [[Ropery Lane]] ground. They are the current Champions of the North East Premier League, won the national ECB 45 over tournament in 2009 and reached the quarter final of the national 20/20 club championship in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cles.play-cricket.com/home/home.asp|title=Chester-le-Street – Play-Cricket|accessdate=10 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711082709/http://cles.play-cricket.com/home/home.asp|archivedate=11 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesterlestreet-cc.com|title=Chester-le-Street Cricket Club|accessdate=10 February 2010}}</ref>

===Rowing===
[[File:Chester Le Street Amateur Rowing Club Rowing Blade.svg|thumb|Blade colours of Chester-le-Street rowing club]]

Chester-le-Street Amateur Rowing Club is based on the River Wear near the Riverside cricket ground and has been there for over 100 years. During the summer months the club operate mainly on the river, but in the winter move to indoor sessions during the evenings and use the river at weekends.

The Club has over 160 members of which 90 are junior members, with numbers increasing annually. The club are well thought of by British Rowing as a lead club for junior development with many juniors now competing at GB level, and some competing for GB at international events.

===Football===
[[Medieval football]] was once played in the town. The game was played annually on [[Shrove Tuesday]] between the \"Upstreeters\" and \"Downstreeters\". Play started at 1&nbsp;pm and finished at 6&nbsp;pm. To start the game, the ball was thrown from a window in the centre of the town and in one game more than 400 players took part.

==Transport==

===Road===
At the time of the football matches 'Front Street' was actually the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]] from London to [[Edinburgh]]. A bypass was built in the 1950s, which still exists today as the [[A167 road|A167]]. The bypass road itself was partly bypassed by, and partly incorporated in, the [[A1(M)]] motorway in the 1970s.

The northern end of Front Street used to be the start of the A6127, which is the road that would continue through [[Birtley, Tyne and Wear|Birtley]], [[Gateshead]], and eventually over the [[Tyne Bridge]] and become the A6127(M) central motorway in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. However, when the Gateshead-Newcastle Western Bypass of the [[A1(M)]] was opened, many roads in this area were renumbered, following the convention that roads originating between single digit A roads take their first digit from the single digit A road in an anticlockwise direction from their point of origin, and Newcastle Road, which was formerly designated [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], is now unclassified. The A6127 was renamed the [[A167 road|A167]]. Car traffic is now banned from the northern part of Front Street and it is restricted to buses, cyclists and delivery vehicles for the shops.

===Rail===
[[File:Chester-le-Street Railway Station.jpg|thumb|left|Chester-le-Street Railway Station]]
[[Chester-le-Street railway station]], on the [[East Coast Main Line]] of the [[National Rail]] network, between Newcastle and Durham, opened in 1868. It offers local connections and cross-country train services. {{As of|2008}}, train operators serving the station are [[CrossCountry]], [[TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]].

A local independent company, Chester-le-Track, has operated the station since 1999, as an agent for [[Arriva Trains Northern]] and Northern Rail, but ceased trading from close of business on Saturday 31 March 2018. The station is now staffed on a part-time basis by Northern Rail.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/CLS/details.aspx|title=National Rail Enquiries - Station facilities for Chester-le-Street|website=www.nationalrail.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}</ref>

The town is mentioned in the 1963 song \"Slow Train\" by Flanders and Swann: <blockquote>''<poem>
No churns, no porter, no cat on a seat,
At Chorlton-cum-Hardy or Chester-le-Street.<ref>{{cite web|title=At the Drop of Another Hat: Slow Train|website=Flanders and Swann Online|url=http://www.nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/fas/anotherhat_slow.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413054716/http://www.nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/fas/anotherhat_slow.html|archivedate=13 April 2013}}</ref></poem>''</blockquote>

===Bus===
The town is the original home of The Northern General Transport [Bus] Company, nowadays [[Go North East]], and the company still operates from the Picktree Lane Depot. It also pioneered the use of Minilink bus services in the North East in 1985.

'''Asociația Club Sportiv Progresul Pecica''', commonly known as '''ACS Progresul Pecica''', '''Progresul Pecica''', or simply as '''Pecica''' is a [[Romania]]n professional [[football (soccer)|football]] [[football team|club]] based in [[Pecica]], [[Arad County]].

Progresul Pecica was founded in 1949, under the name of ''Steaua Roșie Pecica'', as a result of the merger between ''Virtutea Pecica (est. in 1921)'' and ''Club Atletic Rovine (est. in 1924)''. Steaua Roșie was renamed in 1954 as ''Recolta Pecica'' and since 1965 was known as '''Progresul Pecica''' playing only at the level of the County or Districtual League (4th tier).

Progresul was renamed again in 1987, this time as ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' and started to be financially supported by the Pecica Oil Scaffold. In 1992, former [[Liga III|Divizia C]] member ''Petrolul Arad/ Zădăreni (est. 1983)'' merged with ''Aurul Negru Pecica (est. 1949)'' and formed a new entity, West Petrom Arad (Pecica). West Petrom was financially supported by [[Petrom]] and for 10 years (1994–2004) played in the third tier, but with oscillating results.

In 2001, ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' withdrew from the West Petrom Association, changed its name back to '''Progresul Pecica''' and enrolled a senior squad in the [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] – [[Liga IV Arad|Arad County]]. Progresul relegated in the [[Liga V|Honor Division]] after only one season, while West Petrom spent three more seasons in the third tier before it was dissolved. Progresul promoted back in the [[Liga IV]] after 2005 and won twice the competition, in 2015 and 2019, but it succeeded to promote in the third tier only in 2019.

''AS Virtutea Pecica'' was established on 15 August 1921 and was the first football club of Pecica, just a commune at that time. Virtutea was founded as a sporting and cultural club, in its composition entering three sports sections (football, tennis & table tennis, chess), but also a cultural section (literature), frequented by all the athletes of the club. The management of AS Virtutea was composed of: Prof. Nestor Blaga, Ioan Gh. Pălincaș, priest Teodor Șiclovan (honorary presidents), Dr. Tyurovschi (president), Augustin Bochiș (secretary) A.M. Iobb (cashier) and Dr. Olteanu (sporting director). Board members were: R. Ponta, Florea Locușteanu, Roman Jugu, E. Ponta and Aron Șiclovan. It is worth mentioning that A.S. Virtutea Pecica had legal personality.<ref name=\"monografieRO\">{{cite web|url=https://pecica.ro/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/18-Sport.pdf|title=Istoria sportului din localitatea Pecica|trans-title=History of sport in Pecica|publisher=pecica.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

Among the sports sections that had results at the level of [[Arad County]], was also the football team, which was in the first part of the standings. During the [[1946–47 Divizia C|1946–47]] season, the football section of AS Virtutea activated in the third tier, [[Liga III|Divizia C]]. One of the notable results obtained in this period was a 1–1 draw, in a match played against the former champion of Romania, [[FC Ripensia Timișoara|Ripensia Timișoara]]. These results were obtained with the following players: Alexandru Toth, Ioan Rotariu, Roman Teretean, Ștefan Ponta, Licu Igrișan, Alexandru Molnar, Gheorghe Ponta, Ilie Solomie, Mircea Popețiu, Rudolf Rutz, Iuliu Stainer, Liviu Barbu, Roman Rusu, Cornel Curea, Nicolae Grozav and Gheorge Haș. In the 1948–49 season of the districtual football championship (4th tier), Virtutea was ranked 3rd at the end of the first part of the season. In this edition, the championship included the following members: [[Vagonul Arad]], Patria Chișineu-Criș, Unirea Arad, Olimpia Arad, [[CS Șoimii Pâncota|Șoimii Pâncota]], Tricolorul Arad, Unirea Sântana, Frontiera Curtici, [[CS Național Sebiș|Sebișana Sebiș]], ''Club Atletic Rovine (Pecica)'', S.G. Arad, Găiana Arad and [[CS Șoimii Lipova|Șoimii Lipova]]. In addition to the domestic championship, friendly international matches were played against B.T.K. Battonya and Makó, both clubs from [[Hungary]].<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/>

During this period, another club was active around the commune of Pecica, ''Club Atletic Rovine'' or ''Rovine Atletikai Club''. Club Atletic was established in 1924 and was the [[Sports club|multi-sport]] club of the neighboring commune, Rovine, also the football club of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] community.<ref name=\"monografieHU\">{{cite web|url=https://pecica.ro/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/17-Din-viata-culturala-maghiara-din-Pecica.pdf|title=Viața culturală maghiară din Pecica|trans-title=Hungarian cultural life in Pecica|publisher=pecica.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> The club had only two sections (football, tennis & table tennis) and played only in the districtual championship (4th tier). In first part of the 1948–49 season AC Rovine was ranked 11th of 14, with the following ranking line: 13 (matches) 4 (wins) 1 (draw) 8 (losses) 23 (goals scored) 34 (goals conceded) and 9 (points). The club management included the following members: Pál Zvér, Miklós Gergely, Pál Kabát, Mihály Fais and Mihály Lelik, among others. From the long list of players who played for Club Atletic Rovine, these were the most notable: János Kovács (Kudel), József Jován, Mihály Magyar, József Szanda, András Hegedűs, József Szomorú, Dezső and Mihály Nagy-György.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/>

In 1949, the two sports societies based in Pecica (Virtutea) and Rovine (Club Atletic) merged and formed a new entity, named ''Steaua Roșie Pecica'' (Red Star Pecica).<ref name=\"monografieHU\"/><ref name=\"AMEFA\">{{cite web|url=http://amefa1911.blogspot.com/2017/01/remember-cupa-de-toamna-anului-1949-in.html|title=Remember: ”Cupa de Toamnă” a anului 1949 în districtul Arad|trans-title=Remember: \"Autumn Cup\" of 1949 in Arad district|publisher=amefa1911.blogspot.com|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

===Progresul cannot exceed its condition (1950–1992)===
[[File:Progresul Pecica squad 1960.png|thumb|left|300px|Progresul Pecica squad in the 1960–61 season.]]
Steaua Roșie Pecica played in four seasons at the level of the 4th tier and was one of the most important clubs from the Arad District.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/> In 1954, Steaua Roșie was renamed as ''Recolta Pecica'' and continued to play under this name, but at the same level.<ref name=\"monografieHU\"/>

In 1960, commune of Pecica and commune of Rovine merged, then forming commune of Pecica, one of the biggest communes in the country, at that time, then starting with 1965, a new administrative-territorial division has been implemented in Romania and a new district was founded, Pecica district. Recolta was renamed as '''Progresul Pecica''' in 1960 and activated for next years in the Banat regional championship (4th tier), with remarkable results.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/>

Even though Progresul Pecica was recognized as an uncomfortable team, it was unable to overcome its condition in the following years, continuing to evolve only in the 4th division.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/> However, in 1968 the youth academy of Progresul was opened and in only three years of activity, under the lead of some former important footballers, such as [[Sándor Schwartz]], Ștefan Dobra or Dușan Gavrilovici, but also with the collaboration of some local coaches, such as Romul Popețiu, Matei Kocsik or Silviu Frățilă, Progresul's Academy managed to propose some interesting players for the upper levels. The academy was dissolved in 1971 following political pressures, in that period the plan was that the county must have only a good football team and only one important academy, thus all forces had to be concentrated towards [[FC UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], the most successful club of the county.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/>

Supported financially and politically only at the level of the commune, Progresul continued to play for the next 21 years in the Arad County League (4th division), with no notable results. In 1987, Progresul Pecica was renamed again, this time as ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' (Black Gold Pecica) and from that moment, the team started to be financially supported by the Pecica Oil Scaffold.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/> But the new investments did not bring the much-anticipated promotion and Aurul Negru remained at amateur level.

On the other hand, in the neighboring commune of [[Zădăreni]], a football team founded in 1983 under the name of ''Petrolul Arad'' succeeded a fast ascension, promoting to [[Liga III|Divizia C]] at the end of the 1987–88 season, with, much later well known, [[Ionuț Popa]] as a player and manager.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\">{{cite web|url=http://amefa1911.blogspot.com/2017/01/legende-ale-fotbalului-amefist-mihai.html|title=Legende ale fotbalului amefist: Mihai Corsenți|trans-title=Legends of the amefist football: Mihai Corsenți|publisher=amefa1911.blogspot.com|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> Petrolul managed to avoid relegation for three consecutive seasons achieving the following rankings: 6th of 16 ([[1988–89 Divizia C|1988–89]]), 8th of 16 ([[1989–90 Divizia C|1988–89]]) and 14th of 16 ([[1990–91 Divizia C|1990–91]]).<ref name=\"ROSoccer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.romaniansoccer.ro/divizia_c/divizia_c.shtml|title=Clasamente Divizia C|trans-title=Divizia C league tables|publisher=romaniansoccer.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

During the [[1991–92 Divizia C|1991–92]] season, Petrolul withdrew from Divizia C due to certain financial problems and misunderstandings at local level.<ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/><ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/>

===New times, oil changes the situation (1992–2004)===
[[File:West Petrom Pecica squad 1993.png|thumb|right|330px|West Petrom squad in the 1993–94 season.]]
In the summer of 1992, the two teams, more or less financially supported by [[Petrom]], ''Petrolul Arad (Zădăreni)'' and ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' merged and formed a new entity, ''West Petrom Arad'', also known as ''West Petrom Pecica''.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/> The new formed entity was mainly the successor of Aurul Negru Pecica. This conclusion is resulting from certain organizational details, such as the club's colors (yellow and blue), home ground ([[Stadionul Progresul (Pecica)|Progresul Stadium]], renamed as Petrom Stadium and located in [[Pecica]]), the logo of the new entity (mainly yellow and blue, with an oil scaffold, the name \"West Petrom Pecica\" and 1924 as the year of foundation, which was the year of the establishment of Club Atletic Rovine, one of the Aurul Negru's parent clubs) and also enrolling in the [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] on the place of Aurul Negru.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.romaniansoccer.ro/clubs_2/west_petrom_pecica/west_petrom_pecica.shtml|title=West Petrom Arad|trans-title=West Petrom Arad|publisher=romaniansoccer.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

In the first season, 1992–93, \"the Oilmen\" were overtaken by CPL Arad, who then promoted to [[Liga III|Divizia C]], but in the following season, 1993–94, West Petrom Pecica became the champion of [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] – [[Liga IV Arad|Arad County]] and played in the promotion play-off. Although it does not won the play-off, West Petrom Pecica reached Divizia C due to the merger between [[Vagonul Arad|Astra Arad]] and Aris Arad, merge that had as result the club named [[Vagonul Arad|FC Arad]], \"pecicanii\" receiving the vacant place.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/><ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/> Formally, FC Arad was the legal successor of Astra Arad and West Petrom received the place of Aris (former Strungul), club which was absorbed in the merging process.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/> Apart from the title of county champion, West Petrom Pecica also won the preliminary round (Arad County round) of [[Cupa României]]. In the final, disputed on 23 June 1994, in [[Zăbrani]], West Petrom Pecica defeated Mureșul Zădăreni (the new team of Zădăreni, after the leaving of Petrolul to Pecica) with the score of 4–2.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/>

West Petrom Arad (Pecica) played for 10 years at the level of the third tier. This period was by far the best in the history of local football, despite the fact that West Petrom was an unpredictable team, often oscillating in results. At the end of the first season, \"the Oilmen\" were ranked 14th of 20th, in the following season their results getting better, 9th of 20, but just to be ranked 15th of 19 at the end of the [[1996–97 Divizia C|1996–97]] edition.<ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/> Starting with the [[1997–98 Divizia C|1997–98]] season, West Petrom it became an uncomfortable team for the rivals, hard to beat, and their rankings were mainly in the top of the standings. West Petrom finished in the late 1990s on the following positions: 5th ([[1997–98 Divizia C|1997–98]]), 4th ([[1998–99 Divizia C|1998–99]]) and 6th ([[1999–2000 Divizia C|1999–2000]]).<ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/>

The apogee moment of the football from Pecica was on 21 September 1999, when Petrom Stadium hosted the encounter between West Petrom Pecica and the most titled team in [[Romania]], [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]]. At the match assisted 5–6,000 supporters (the capacity of the stadium was only 2,500) and was part of the [[1999–2000 Cupa României]], Round of 32.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/> Steaua with a squad managed by [[Emerich Jenei]] and formed of playes such as: [[Martin Tudor]], [[Laurențiu Reghecampf]], [[Iulian Miu]], [[Eric Lincar]], [[Eugen Trică]], [[Laurențiu Roșu]] or [[Cristian Ciocoiu]], among others, won with the score of 1–0. In the West Petrom's squad entered the following players: Țapoș – V. Tofaș, Arman, Bene, Hardălău, Varga, R. Gerge, Balaș, Balaj, Ștefăligă and Toderaș, manager Gian Pio del Monaco.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/>

The beginning of the 2000s also meant the regress of West Petrom, club which was ranked only 10th of 15, at the end of the [[2000–01 Divizia C|2000–01]] season. In the summer of 2001, West Petrom Arad moved also its headquarter from [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] to [[Pecica]], but at the end of the season was ranked only 13th of 16.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/><ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/> Also this season is an important turning point for the future, as it was known, ''West Petrom Arad (Pecica)'' was founded in 1992 by the merger between ''Petrolul Arad (Zădăreni)'' and ''Aurul Negru Pecica'', only that in the same summer in which West Petrom was moved legally to Pecica, the local government withdrew ''Aurul Negru'' from the business and enrolled the team in the [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] – [[Liga IV Arad|Arad County]], under its former name of '''Progresul Pecica'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://glsa.ro/remember-de-cand-progresul-pecica-decis-campioana-aradului/|title=Remember de când Progresul Pecica a decis campioana Aradului|trans-title=Remember. The time when Progresul Pecica decided the champion of Arad|publisher=glsa.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/>

In this way it practically came to the original situation, precisely from 1924, when in Pecica were existing two fotball clubs. If in that period the supremacy was divided between Virtutea Pecica and Club Atletic Rovine, now West Petrom Pecica and Progresul Pecica were the contestants. The situation was in fact not great, Progresul relegated in the 5th tier at the end of the 2001–02 season and West Petrom played for three more seasons in the [[Liga III|Divizia C]], but with no notable results, [[Petrom]] withdrew its sponsorship and the team was dissolved.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/><ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/>

===Progresul is back (2004–present)===
Progresul Pecica withdrew from the West Petrom Association in the summer of 2001, was re-founded under the name of '''ACS Progresul Pecica''' and enrolled in the [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] – [[Liga IV Arad|Arad County]].

'''Asociația Club Sportiv Progresul Pecica''', commonly known as '''ACS Progresul Pecica''', '''Progresul Pecica''', or simply as '''Pecica''' is a [[Romania]]n professional [[football (soccer)|football]] [[football team|club]] based in [[Pecica]], [[Arad County]].

Progresul Pecica was founded in 1949, under the name of ''Steaua Roșie Pecica'', as a result of the merger between ''Virtutea Pecica (est. in 1921)'' and ''Club Atletic Rovine (est. in 1924)''. Steaua Roșie was renamed in 1954 as ''Recolta Pecica'' and since 1965 was known as '''Progresul Pecica''' playing only at the level of the County or Districtual League (4th tier).

Progresul was renamed again in 1987, this time as ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' and started to be financially supported by the Pecica Oil Scaffold. In 1992, former [[Liga III|Divizia C]] member ''Petrolul Arad/ Zădăreni (est. 1983)'' merged with ''Aurul Negru Pecica (est. 1949)'' and formed a new entity, West Petrom Arad (Pecica). West Petrom was financially supported by [[Petrom]] and for 10 years (1994–2004) played in the third tier, but with oscillating results.

In 2001, ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' withdrew from the West Petrom Association, changed its name back to '''Progresul Pecica''' and enrolled a senior squad in the [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] – [[Liga IV Arad|Arad County]]. Progresul relegated in the [[Liga V|Honor Division]] after only one season, while West Petrom spent three more seasons in the third tier before it was dissolved. Progresul promoted back in the [[Liga IV]] after 2005 and won twice the competition, in 2015 and 2019, but it succeeded to promote in the third tier only in 2019.

''AS Virtutea Pecica'' was established on 15 August 1921 and was the first football club of Pecica, just a commune at that time. Virtutea was founded as a sporting and cultural club, in its composition entering three sports sections (football, tennis & table tennis, chess), but also a cultural section (literature), frequented by all the athletes of the club. The management of AS Virtutea was composed of: Prof. Nestor Blaga, Ioan Gh. Pălincaș, priest Teodor Șiclovan (honorary presidents), Dr. Tyurovschi (president), Augustin Bochiș (secretary) A.M. Iobb (cashier) and Dr. Olteanu (sporting director). Board members were: R. Ponta, Florea Locușteanu, Roman Jugu, E. Ponta and Aron Șiclovan. It is worth mentioning that A.S. Virtutea Pecica had legal personality.<ref name=\"monografieRO\">{{cite web|url=https://pecica.ro/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/18-Sport.pdf|title=Istoria sportului din localitatea Pecica|trans-title=History of sport in Pecica|publisher=pecica.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

Among the sports sections that had results at the level of [[Arad County]], was also the football team, which was in the first part of the standings. During the [[1946–47 Divizia C|1946–47]] season, the football section of AS Virtutea activated in the third tier, [[Liga III|Divizia C]]. One of the notable results obtained in this period was a 1–1 draw, in a match played against the former champion of Romania, [[FC Ripensia Timișoara|Ripensia Timișoara]]. These results were obtained with the following players: Alexandru Toth, Ioan Rotariu, Roman Teretean, Ștefan Ponta, Licu Igrișan, Alexandru Molnar, Gheorghe Ponta, Ilie Solomie, Mircea Popețiu, Rudolf Rutz, Iuliu Stainer, Liviu Barbu, Roman Rusu, Cornel Curea, Nicolae Grozav and Gheorge Haș. In the 1948–49 season of the districtual football championship (4th tier), Virtutea was ranked 3rd at the end of the first part of the season. In this edition, the championship included the following members: [[Vagonul Arad]], Patria Chișineu-Criș, Unirea Arad, Olimpia Arad, [[CS Șoimii Pâncota|Șoimii Pâncota]], Tricolorul Arad, Unirea Sântana, Frontiera Curtici, [[CS Național Sebiș|Sebișana Sebiș]], ''Club Atletic Rovine (Pecica)'', S.G. Arad, Găiana Arad and [[CS Șoimii Lipova|Șoimii Lipova]]. In addition to the domestic championship, friendly international matches were played against B.T.K. Battonya and Makó, both clubs from [[Hungary]].<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/>

During this period, another club was active around the commune of Pecica, ''Club Atletic Rovine'' or ''Rovine Atletikai Club''. Club Atletic was established in 1924 and was the [[Sports club|multi-sport]] club of the neighboring commune, Rovine, also the football club of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] community.<ref name=\"monografieHU\">{{cite web|url=https://pecica.ro/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/17-Din-viata-culturala-maghiara-din-Pecica.pdf|title=Viața culturală maghiară din Pecica|trans-title=Hungarian cultural life in Pecica|publisher=pecica.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> The club had only two sections (football, tennis & table tennis) and played only in the districtual championship (4th tier). In first part of the 1948–49 season AC Rovine was ranked 11th of 14, with the following ranking line: 13 (matches) 4 (wins) 1 (draw) 8 (losses) 23 (goals scored) 34 (goals conceded) and 9 (points). The club management included the following members: Pál Zvér, Miklós Gergely, Pál Kabát, Mihály Fais and Mihály Lelik, among others.

In 1949, the two sports societies based in Pecica (Virtutea) and Rovine (Club Atletic) merged and formed a new entity, named ''Steaua Roșie Pecica'' (Red Star Pecica).<ref name=\"monografieHU\"/><ref name=\"AMEFA\">{{cite web|url=http://amefa1911.blogspot.com/2017/01/remember-cupa-de-toamna-anului-1949-in.html|title=Remember: ”Cupa de Toamnă” a anului 1949 în districtul Arad|trans-title=Remember: \"Autumn Cup\" of 1949 in Arad district|publisher=amefa1911.blogspot.com|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

===Progresul cannot exceed its condition (1950–1992)===
[[File:Progresul Pecica squad 1960.png|thumb|left|300px|Progresul Pecica squad in the 1960–61 season.]]
Steaua Roșie Pecica played in four seasons at the level of the 4th tier and was one of the most important clubs from the Arad District.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/> In 1954, Steaua Roșie was renamed as ''Recolta Pecica'' and continued to play under this name, but at the same level.<ref name=\"monografieHU\"/>

In 1960, commune of Pecica and commune of Rovine merged, then forming commune of Pecica, one of the biggest communes in the country, at that time, then starting with 1965, a new administrative-territorial division has been implemented in Romania and a new district was founded, Pecica district. Recolta was renamed as '''Progresul Pecica''' in 1960 and activated for next years in the Banat regional championship (4th tier), with remarkable results.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/>

Even though Progresul Pecica was recognized as an uncomfortable team, it was unable to overcome its condition in the following years, continuing to evolve only in the 4th division.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/> However, in 1968 the youth academy of Progresul was opened and in only three years of activity, under the lead of some former important footballers, such as [[Sándor Schwartz]], Ștefan Dobra or Dușan Gavrilovici, but also with the collaboration of some local coaches, such as Romul Popețiu, Matei Kocsik or Silviu Frățilă, Progresul's Academy managed to propose some interesting players for the upper levels. The academy was dissolved in 1971 following political pressures, in that period the plan was that the county must have only a good football team and only one important academy, thus all forces had to be concentrated towards [[FC UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], the most successful club of the county.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/>

Supported financially and politically only at the level of the commune, Progresul continued to play for the next 21 years in the Arad County League (4th division), with no notable results. In 1987, Progresul Pecica was renamed again, this time as ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' (Black Gold Pecica) and from that moment, the team started to be financially supported by the Pecica Oil Scaffold.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/> But the new investments did not bring the much-anticipated promotion and Aurul Negru remained at amateur level.

On the other hand, in the neighboring commune of [[Zădăreni]], a football team founded in 1983 under the name of ''Petrolul Arad'' succeeded a fast ascension, promoting to [[Liga III|Divizia C]] at the end of the 1987–88 season, with, much later well known, [[Ionuț Popa]] as a player and manager.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\">{{cite web|url=http://amefa1911.blogspot.com/2017/01/legende-ale-fotbalului-amefist-mihai.html|title=Legende ale fotbalului amefist: Mihai Corsenți|trans-title=Legends of the amefist football: Mihai Corsenți|publisher=amefa1911.blogspot.com|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> Petrolul managed to avoid relegation for three consecutive seasons achieving the following rankings: 6th of 16 ([[1988–89 Divizia C|1988–89]]), 8th of 16 ([[1989–90 Divizia C|1988–89]]) and 14th of 16 ([[1990–91 Divizia C|1990–91]]).<ref name=\"ROSoccer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.romaniansoccer.ro/divizia_c/divizia_c.shtml|title=Clasamente Divizia C|trans-title=Divizia C league tables|publisher=romaniansoccer.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

During the [[1991–92 Divizia C|1991–92]] season, Petrolul withdrew from Divizia C due to certain financial problems and misunderstandings at local level.<ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/><ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/>

===New times, oil changes the situation (1992–2004)===
[[File:West Petrom Pecica squad 1993.png|thumb|right|330px|West Petrom squad in the 1993–94 season.]]
In the summer of 1992, the two teams, more or less financially supported by [[Petrom]], ''Petrolul Arad (Zădăreni)'' and ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' merged and formed a new entity, ''West Petrom Arad'', also known as ''West Petrom Pecica''.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/> The new formed entity was mainly the successor of Aurul Negru Pecica. This conclusion is resulting from certain organizational details, such as the club's colors (yellow and blue), home ground ([[Stadionul Progresul (Pecica)|Progresul Stadium]], renamed as Petrom Stadium and located in [[Pecica]]), the logo of the new entity (mainly yellow and blue, with an oil scaffold, the name \"West Petrom Pecica\" and 1924 as the year of foundation, which was the year of the establishment of Club Atletic Rovine, one of the Aurul Negru's parent clubs) and also enrolling in the [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] on the place of Aurul Negru.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.romaniansoccer.ro/clubs_2/west_petrom_pecica/west_petrom_pecica.shtml|title=West Petrom Arad|trans-title=West Petrom Arad|publisher=romaniansoccer.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

In the first season, 1992–93, \"the Oilmen\" were overtaken by CPL Arad, who then promoted to [[Liga III|Divizia C]], but in the following season, 1993–94, West Petrom Pecica became the champion of [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] – [[Liga IV Arad|Arad County]] and played in the promotion play-off. Although it does not won the play-off, West Petrom Pecica reached Divizia C due to the merger between [[Vagonul Arad|Astra Arad]] and Aris Arad, merge that had as result the club named [[Vagonul Arad|FC Arad]], \"pecicanii\" receiving the vacant place.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/><ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/> Formally, FC Arad was the legal successor of Astra Arad and West Petrom received the place of Aris (former Strungul), club which was absorbed in the merging process.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/> Apart from the title of county champion, West Petrom Pecica also won the preliminary round (Arad County round) of [[Cupa României]]. In the final, disputed on 23 June 1994, in [[Zăbrani]], West Petrom Pecica defeated Mureșul Zădăreni (the new team of Zădăreni, after the leaving of Petrolul to Pecica) with the score of 4–2.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/>

West Petrom Arad (Pecica) played for 10 years at the level of the third tier. This period was by far the best in the history of local football, despite the fact that West Petrom was an unpredictable team, often oscillating in results. At the end of the first season, \"the Oilmen\" were ranked 14th of 20th, in the following season their results getting better, 9th of 20, but just to be ranked 15th of 19 at the end of the [[1996–97 Divizia C|1996–97]] edition.<ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/> Starting with the [[1997–98 Divizia C|1997–98]] season, West Petrom it became an uncomfortable team for the rivals, hard to beat, and their rankings were mainly in the top of the standings. West Petrom finished in the late 1990s on the following positions: 5th ([[1997–98 Divizia C|1997–98]]), 4th ([[1998–99 Divizia C|1998–99]]) and 6th ([[1999–2000 Divizia C|1999–2000]]).<ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/>

The apogee moment of the football from Pecica was on 21 September 1999, when Petrom Stadium hosted the encounter between West Petrom Pecica and the most titled team in [[Romania]], [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]]. At the match assisted 5–6,000 supporters (the capacity of the stadium was only 2,500) and was part of the [[1999–2000 Cupa României]], Round of 32.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/> Steaua with a squad managed by [[Emerich Jenei]] and formed of playes such as: [[Martin Tudor]], [[Laurențiu Reghecampf]], [[Iulian Miu]], [[Eric Lincar]], [[Eugen Trică]], [[Laurențiu Roșu]] or [[Cristian Ciocoiu]], among others, won with the score of 1–0. In the West Petrom's squad entered the following players: Țapoș – V. Tofaș, Arman, Bene, Hardălău, Varga, R. Gerge, Balaș, Balaj, Ștefăligă and Toderaș, manager Gian Pio del Monaco.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/>

The beginning of the 2000s also meant the regress of West Petrom, club which was ranked only 10th of 15, at the end of the [[2000–01 Divizia C|2000–01]] season. In the summer of 2001, West Petrom Arad moved also its headquarter from [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] to [[Pecica]], but at the end of the season was ranked only 13th of 16.<ref name=\"monografieRO\"/><ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/> Also this season is an important turning point for the future, as it was known, ''West Petrom Arad (Pecica)'' was founded in 1992 by the merger between ''Petrolul Arad (Zădăreni)'' and ''Aurul Negru Pecica'', only that in the same summer in which West Petrom was moved legally to Pecica, the local government withdrew ''Aurul Negru'' from the business and enrolled the team in the [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] – [[Liga IV Arad|Arad County]], under its former name of '''Progresul Pecica'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://glsa.ro/remember-de-cand-progresul-pecica-decis-campioana-aradului/|title=Remember de când Progresul Pecica a decis campioana Aradului|trans-title=Remember.

In this way it practically came to the original situation, precisely from 1924, when in Pecica were existing two fotball clubs. If in that period the supremacy was devided between Virtutea Pecica and Club Atletic Rovine, now West Petrom Pecica and Progresul Pecica were the contestants. The situation was in fact not great, Progresul relegated in the 5th tier at the end of the 2001–02 season and West Petrom played for three more seasons in the [[Liga III|Divizia C]], but with no notable results, [[Petrom]] withdrew its sponsorship and the team was dissolved.<ref name=\"AMEFA2\"/><ref name=\"ROSoccer\"/>

===Progresul is back (2004–present)===
Progresul Pecica withdrew from the West Petrom Association in the summer of 2001, was re-founded under the name of '''ACS Progresul Pecica''' and enrolled in the [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] – [[Liga IV Arad|Arad County]]. Progresul relegated to [[Liga V|Honor Division]] in 2002, where it remained for several years.

Progresul promoted back to [[Liga IV]] after 2005 and was in generally a middle table team. At the end of the [[2013–14 Liga IV|2013–14]] season, \"pecicanii\" were ranked 2nd, right after [[FC UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], then winning the championship in the following season, but missed the promotion, after a 1–6 defeat on aggregate, in the promotion play-off match disputed against Performanța Ighiu.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aradon.ro/aradon-sport-local/promovarea-se-joaca-pe-aradon-208158/|title=Progresul Pecica - Performanța Ighiu 0-5, final|trans-title=Progresul Pecica - Performanța Ighiu 0-5, in the final|publisher=aradon.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> After a few seasons ended on the seats 4–6 places, Progresul won again the County League in [[2018–19 Liga IV|2019]], but this time also promoted to [[Liga III]], after winning 3–1 on aggregate against Retezatul Hațeg. [[2019–20 Liga III]] season was the first one at this level for Pecica after 15 years of absence, since West Petrom Pecica withdrew from the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://criticarad.ro/progresul-pecica-a-promovat-in-liga-a-iii-a/|title=Progresul Pecica A PROMOVAT în LIGA a III-a|trans-title=Progresul Pecica PROMOTED in the LIGA III|publisher=criticarad.ro|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

\"'''A Scandal in Belgravia'''\" is the first episode of the second series of the [[BBC]] crime drama series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', which follows the modern-day adventures of [[Sherlock Holmes]], and was first broadcast by [[BBC One]] on 1 January 2012. It was written by co-creator [[Steven Moffat]], and directed by [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]]. The episode was based on \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\", a short story by  [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]].

The episode depicts Sherlock Holmes' ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) confrontation with [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), a [[dominatrix]] who has compromising photographs taken with a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]]. The photographs are stored inside her [[mobile phone]], along with other valuable information which makes her a target of various political factions. Sherlock spends much of the episode keeping the device out of enemy hands while trying to deduce its password. Besides referring to the Doyle short story, the episode title names [[Belgravia]], a district of London adjacent to the grounds of [[Buckingham Palace]].

After its broadcast on BBC One, the episode was given consolidated figures of 10.663 million viewers in the United Kingdom. Critical reactions toward the episode were largely positive, with reviewers praising the writing, acting and direction. The episode sparked controversy for showing the character of Irene Adler in the nude; carefully using camera angles to avoid exposing private areas, [[Watershed (television)|pre-watershed]].

==Plot==


Continuing the ending of [[The Great Game (Sherlock) | The Great Game]], [[List of Sherlock characters#Sherlock Holmes| Sherlock Holmes]] ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) and [[List of Sherlock characters#Dr. John Watson | John Watson]] ([[Martin Freeman]]) are confronting [[List of Sherlock characters#James 'Jim' Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]).
Moriarty intends at first to kill them, but as a phone call interrupts, he changes his mind, and dismisses the snipers.

Holmes has become a minor celebrity after Watson blogs about the cases they solved.
One day, Holmes and Watson are brought to meet [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] ([[Mark Gatiss]]) in [[Buckingham Palace]].
Mycroft reveals that [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), took compromising photographs of herself and a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]].
The authority wants to retrieve Adler's [[smartphone]], which contains those photographs.
Holmes and Watson try to get into Adler's home by deception, but she has been expecting them. Holmes meets Adler stark naked leaving him unable to deduce anything about her. 

As Watson deliberately triggers the fire alarm, Holmes finds Adler's hidden safe, which Adler has glanced at nervously.
Suddenly several [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operatives led by Neilson ([[Todd Boyce]]) break into the house and demand that Holmes open the safe.
Holmes solves the password, and in subsequent chaos, some agents are killed, Holmes gets the phone first, and Adler then sedates Holmes, takes the phone instead, and escapes.

On Christmas Eve, Holmes learns via text message that Adler has sent him her phone.
Considering the phone's importance, Holmes thinks she might die soon.
Indeed, the police find a mutilated body, identified to be Adler.

Later, on New Year's Eve, Watson is taken to see Adler, who is alive and faked her death.
Holmes followed them and learns this, too.
Meanwhile, Neilson's team holds [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] ([[Una Stubbs]]) hostage, and Holmes subdues Neilson.
Adler comes, and reveals that she is still being hunted.
She asks Holmes to decipher a code stolen from [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]].
Sherlock effortlessly cracks it, revealing it to be [[airline seat]] allocation numbers. Adler conveys this information to Moriarty, who taunts Mycroft Holmes that he (Moriarty) now knows their plan.

A government official brings Holmes to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]].
Mycroft confirms that the government had planned to fly a plane full of corpses, so as not to alert the terrorists planning to bomb the plane that they know of their plans, reminiscent of the [[Coventry myth]].
However, as Holmes unwittingly helped Adler (and thus Moriarty) crack the code, the scheme was foiled.
Adler reveals a list of demands to Mycroft, including protection, in exchange for the contents of her phone.
However, Holmes figures out the unlocking password to be \"SHER\", so that words on the screen together reads \"I AM SHER-LOCKED\".
Now without her leverage, Adler pleads for protection, but Sherlock and Mycroft turn her down.

Some months later, Mycroft informs Watson that Adler has been killed by terrorists, but intends to tell Holmes instead that she has entered a [[witness protection]] programme in America.
Holmes asks for Adler's phone, and says that Adler's last text message was \"Goodbye, Mr Holmes\", suggesting her death.
After Watson leaves, in the flashback it is shown that Holmes was disguised as the executioner and had rescued Adler.

==Production==

[[Lara Pulver]] decided to audition for the role of Irene Adler when she read the script shortly after wrapping on the espionage series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'', in which she had played Erin Watts. She was cast after meeting Steven Moffat and reading with Cumberbatch.<ref name=\"pulv-ds\">{{cite web |title='Sherlock' Lara Pulver interview: 'Playing Irene Adler is a privilege' |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s129/sherlock/interviews/a355965/sherlock-lara-pulver-interview-playing-irene-adler-is-a-privilege.html |date=29 December 2011 |first=Morgan |last=Jeffery |work=Digital Spy|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> Pulver told website [[Digital Spy]] that Moffat \"had written such a multi-dimensional role that I literally immersed myself in his writing. Everything else went out the window for me, research-wise, other than [the dominatrix angle]. Literally, if you search my computer, you'd think I was a porn star or something!\"<ref name=\"pulv-ds\"/> She says that she found the initial vulnerability when filming the nude scenes \"empowering\" because she was unable to \"hide behind anything – there's no mask. This is me, in the flesh! By the end of take two, it wasn't an issue.\"<ref name=\"pulv-ds\"/>

Musician [[Eos Chater]] worked as Benedict Cumberbatch's violin coach for this episode. Although Chater's playing is on the actual soundtrack, Cumberbatch was required to appear to be an expert violinist. To achieve this, Chater was positioned on set so that she could synchronise her playing with his. She says, \"On set I need to see him; to play when he lifts his violin and stop when he stops. And he needs to see me; to copy my bowings, to ghost what I'm doing. In one scene I have to stand outside on two boxes on a [[scissor lift]], watching him while he watches me out of the window.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2012/jan/04/how-taught-sherlock-holmes-violin?newsfeed=true |title=How I taught Sherlock Holmes to play the violin |first=Eos |last=Chater |authorlink=Eos Chater |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
Critical reaction to the episode was largely positive. ''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Neela Debnath observed a \"constant stream of comedy that ran alongside the suspense\",<ref>{{cite news|date=1 January 2012|title=Review of Sherlock 'A Scandal in Belgravia'|newspaper=The Independent|first=Neela|last=Debnath|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/01/01/review-of-sherlock-%E2%80%98a-scandal-in-belgravia%E2%80%99/|accessdate=4 January 2012|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103195806/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/01/01/review-of-sherlock-%E2%80%98a-scandal-in-belgravia%E2%80%99/|archive-date=3 January 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> while [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]], also for ''The Independent'', commends Moffat's \"real poignancy\" and how \"barely a minute passes without a line that's worth making a note of\".

Following the episode's broadcast, the tabloid ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Irene Adler's nude scene early in the episode had been met with disapproval from some viewers who were concerned that it had been shown before the 21:00 [[Watershed (television)#United Kingdom|watershed]] hour, before which adult-oriented content is not supposed to air.<ref name=DailyMailRaunchy>{{cite news |last=Revoir|first=Paul|title=Lara Pulver naked in Sherlock Holmes: BBC under fire for raunchy pre-watershed scenes|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2081486/Lara-Pulver-naked-Sherlock-Holmes-BBC-raunchy-pre-watershed-scenes.html|newspaper=Daily Mail |accessdate=3 January 2012|location=London|date=3 January 2012}}</ref> In the nude scene, camera angles and body posture hide sensitive body parts.<ref name=DailyMailRaunchy/> ''The Guardian'' claimed that there was \"no mystery about the Mail's reaction\", observing that the paper was \"so outraged by the scenes\" that it illustrated its story \"with a big blow-up picture on page 9\".<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC1's Sherlock: no mystery about the Mail's reaction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2012/jan/03/bbc1-sherlock-mystery-mail |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=3 January 2012}}</ref> Following the broadcast, a BBC spokesman said: \"We're delighted with the critical and audience response to the first episode, which has been extremely positive, and have received no complaints at this stage.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Sherlock nudity before the watershed shocks viewers |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8988949/Sherlock-nudity-before-the-watershed-shocks-viewers.html |work=The Telegraph |date=3 January 2012|accessdate=4 January 2012 |location=London}}</ref> As of 4 January 2012, the BBC had received 102 complaints \"relating to inappropriate scenes broadcast before the Watershed\", although \"it could not tell when the complaints had been made, or how many came before and after the ''Daily Mail'' story\".<ref name=repeat>{{cite news |title=Sherlock: BBC will not remove nude scenes for 7&nbsp;pm repeat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/04/sherlock-bbc-nude-scenes?newsfeed=true |first=Tara |last=Conlan |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 January 2012|accessdate=4 January 2012 |location=London}}</ref> The regulator [[Ofcom]] also received 20 complaints about the episode, but they decided that it didn't warrant investigating.<ref>{{citation |title=Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin |url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb199/obb199.pdf}}</ref>

Jane Clare Jones, a doctoral student of [[feminist ethics]] writing in her blog on ''The Guardian''{{'}}s website, criticised episode writer Steven Moffat's representation of Irene Adler, arguing that her sexualisation was a regressive step. She writes, \"While Conan Doyle's original is hardly an exemplar of gender evolution, you've got to worry when a woman comes off worse in 2012 than in 1891.\"<ref name=\"jones\">{{cite news |title=Is Sherlock sexist? Steven Moffat's wanton women |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/03/sherlock-sexist-steven-moffat?newsfeed=true |first=Jane Clare |last=Jones |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=3 January 2012|accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref> Jones argues that while Conan Doyle's Adler was a \"[[proto-feminist]]\", Moffat undermined \"her acumen and agency ... Not-so-subtly channelling the spirit of the predatory [[femme fatal]] ''[sic]'', Adler's power became, in Moffat's hands, less a matter of brains, and more a matter of knowing 'what men like' and how to give it to them ... Her masterminding of a cunning criminal plan was, it was revealed late in the day, not her own doing, but dependent on the advice of Holmes's arch nemesis, James Moriarty.\"<ref name=\"jones\"/> However, Laura Pledger of ''[[Radio Times]]'' listed Adler as a strong female television character, writing, \"Not since [[Scarlett O'Hara]] has a woman employed quite so many feminine wiles in pursuit of her ultimate goal – and with such chutzpah it feels churlish to criticise.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Laura|last=Pledger|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-08/ten-strong-tv-women|title=Ten strong TV women|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> Moffat rejected any suggestion that he or Conan Doyle's creation harboured sexist views, labelling the allegation \"deeply offensive\", and misguided in that the critics had assumed that he was \"presenting the characters as the way it is and the way it ought to be\". But, he says, both Adler and Sherlock \"are clearly defined as deranged – it's love among the mad. He's a psychopath, so is she.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries|title='There is a clue everybody's missed': Sherlock writer Steven Moffat interviewed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jan/20/steven-moffat-sherlock-doctor-who?newsfeed=true |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> In another interview with [[WalesOnline]], Moffat says:

<blockquote>I think it's one thing to criticise a programme and another thing to invent motives out of amateur psychology for the writer and then accuse him of having those feelings. I think that was beyond the pale and strayed from criticism to a defamation act. I'm certainly not a sexist, a misogynist and it was wrong. It's not true and in terms of the character Sherlock Holmes, it is interesting. He has been referred to as being a bit misogynist. He's not; the fact is one of the lovely threads of the original Sherlock Holmes is whatever he says, he cannot abide anyone being cruel to women – he actually becomes incensed and full of rage.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sherlock writer Steven Moffat furious with sexist claim |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2012/01/04/sherlock-writer-steven-moffat-furious-with-sexist-claim-91466-30062866/2/ |first=Simon |last=Gaskell |work=Wales Online |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113091342/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2012/01/04/sherlock-writer-steven-moffat-furious-with-sexist-claim-91466-30062866/2/ |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df= }}</ref></blockquote>

\"'''A Scandal in Belgravia'''\" is the first episode of the second series of the [[BBC]] crime drama series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', which follows the modern-day adventures of [[Sherlock Holmes]], and was first broadcast by [[BBC One]] on 1 January 2012. It was written by co-creator [[Steven Moffat]], and directed by [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]]. The episode was based on \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\", a short story by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].

The episode depicts Sherlock Holmes' ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) confrontation with [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), a [[dominatrix]] who has compromising photographs taken with a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]]. The photographs are stored inside her [[mobile phone]], along with other valuable information which makes her a target of various political factions. Sherlock spends much of the episode keeping the device out of enemy hands while trying to deduce its password. Besides referring to the Doyle short story, the episode title names [[Belgravia]], a district of London adjacent to the grounds of [[Buckingham Palace]].

After its broadcast on BBC One, the episode was given consolidated figures of 10.663 million viewers in the United Kingdom. Critical reactions toward the episode were largely positive, with reviewers praising the writing, acting and direction. The episode sparked controversy for showing the character of Irene Adler in the nude; carefully using camera angles to avoid exposing private areas, [[Watershed (television)|pre-watershed]].

==Plot==


Continuing the ending of [[The Great Game (Sherlock) | The Great Game]], [[List of Sherlock characters#Sherlock Holmes| Sherlock Holmes]] ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) and [[List of Sherlock characters#Dr. John Watson | John Watson]] ([[Martin Freeman]]) are confronting [[List of Sherlock characters#James 'Jim' Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]).
Moriarty intends at first to kill them, but as a phone call interrupts, he changes his mind, and dismisses the snipers.

Holmes has become a minor celebrity after Watson blogs about the cases they solved.
One day, Holmes and Watson are brought to meet [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] ([[Mark Gatiss]]) in [[Buckingham Palace]].
Mycroft reveals that [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), took compromising photographs of herself and a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]].
The authority wants to retrieve Adler's [[smartphone]], which contains those photographs.
Holmes and Watson try to get into Adler's home by deception, but she has been expecting them. Holmes meets Adler stark naked leaving him unable to deduce anything about her. 

As Watson deliberately triggers the fire alarm, Holmes finds Adler's hidden safe, which Adler has glanced at nervously.
Suddenly several [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operatives led by Neilson ([[Todd Boyce]]) break into the house and demand that Holmes open the safe.
Holmes solves the password, and in subsequent chaos, some agents are killed, Holmes gets the phone first, and Adler then sedates Holmes, takes the phone instead, and escapes.

On Christmas Eve, Holmes learns via text message that Adler has sent him her phone.
Considering the phone's importance, Holmes thinks she might die soon.
Indeed, the police find a mutilated body, identified to be Adler.

Later, on New Year's Eve, Watson is taken to see Adler, who is alive and faked her death.
Holmes followed them and learns this, too.
Meanwhile, Neilson's team holds [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] ([[Una Stubbs]]) hostage, and Holmes subdues Neilson.
Adler comes, and reveals that she is still being hunted.
She asks Holmes to decipher a code stolen from [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]].
Sherlock effortlessly cracks it, revealing it to be [[airline seat]] allocation numbers. Adler conveys this information to Moriarty, who taunts Mycroft Holmes that he (Moriarty) now knows their plan.

A government official brings Holmes to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]].
Mycroft confirms that the government had planned to fly a plane full of corpses, so as not to alert the terrorists planning to bomb the plane that they know of their plans, reminiscent of the [[Coventry myth]].
However, as Holmes unwittingly helped Adler (and thus Moriarty) crack the code, the scheme was foiled.
Adler reveals a list of demands to Mycroft, including protection, in exchange for the contents of her phone.
However, Holmes figures out the unlocking password to be \"SHER\", so that words on the screen together reads \"I AM SHER-LOCKED\".
Now without her leverage, Adler pleads for protection, but Sherlock and Mycroft turn her down.

Some months later, Mycroft informs Watson that Adler has been killed by terrorists, but intends to tell Holmes instead that she has entered a [[witness protection]] programme in America.
Holmes asks for Adler's phone, and says that Adler's last text message was \"Goodbye, Mr Holmes\", suggesting her death.
After Watson leaves, in the flashback it is shown that Holmes was disguised as the executioner and had rescued Adler.

==Production==

[[Lara Pulver]] decided to audition for the role of Irene Adler when she read the script shortly after wrapping on the espionage series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'', in which she had played Erin Watts. She was cast after meeting Steven Moffat and reading with Cumberbatch.<ref name=\"pulv-ds\">{{cite web |title='Sherlock' Lara Pulver interview: 'Playing Irene Adler is a privilege' |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s129/sherlock/interviews/a355965/sherlock-lara-pulver-interview-playing-irene-adler-is-a-privilege.html |date=29 December 2011 |first=Morgan |last=Jeffery |work=Digital Spy|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> Pulver told website [[Digital Spy]] that Moffat \"had written such a multi-dimensional role that I literally immersed myself in his writing. Everything else went out the window for me, research-wise, other than [the dominatrix angle]. Literally, if you search my computer, you'd think I was a porn star or something!\"<ref name=\"pulv-ds\"/> She says that she found the initial vulnerability when filming the nude scenes \"empowering\" because she was unable to \"hide behind anything – there's no mask. This is me, in the flesh! By the end of take two, it wasn't an issue.\"<ref name=\"pulv-ds\"/>

Musician [[Eos Chater]] worked as Benedict Cumberbatch's violin coach for this episode. Although Chater's playing is on the actual soundtrack, Cumberbatch was required to appear to be an expert violinist.

Critical reaction to the episode was largely positive.

===Controversy===
Following the episode's broadcast, the tabloid ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Irene Adler's nude scene early in the episode had been met with disapproval from some viewers who were concerned that it had been shown before the 21:00 [[Watershed (television)#United Kingdom|watershed]] hour, before which adult-oriented content is not supposed to air.<ref name=DailyMailRaunchy>{{cite news |last=Revoir|first=Paul|title=Lara Pulver naked in Sherlock Holmes: BBC under fire for raunchy pre-watershed scenes|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2081486/Lara-Pulver-naked-Sherlock-Holmes-BBC-raunchy-pre-watershed-scenes.html|newspaper=Daily Mail |accessdate=3 January 2012|location=London|date=3 January 2012}}</ref> In the nude scene, camera angles and body posture hide sensitive body parts.<ref name=DailyMailRaunchy/> ''The Guardian'' claimed that there was \"no mystery about the Mail's reaction\", observing that the paper was \"so outraged by the scenes\" that it illustrated its story \"with a big blow-up picture on page 9\".<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC1's Sherlock: no mystery about the Mail's reaction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2012/jan/03/bbc1-sherlock-mystery-mail |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=3 January 2012}}</ref> Following the broadcast, a BBC spokesman said: \"We're delighted with the critical and audience response to the first episode, which has been extremely positive, and have received no complaints at this stage.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Sherlock nudity before the watershed shocks viewers |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8988949/Sherlock-nudity-before-the-watershed-shocks-viewers.html |work=The Telegraph |date=3 January 2012|accessdate=4 January 2012 |location=London}}</ref> As of 4 January 2012, the BBC had received 102 complaints \"relating to inappropriate scenes broadcast before the Watershed\", although \"it could not tell when the complaints had been made, or how many came before and after the ''Daily Mail'' story\".<ref name=repeat>{{cite news |title=Sherlock: BBC will not remove nude scenes for 7&nbsp;pm repeat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/04/sherlock-bbc-nude-scenes?newsfeed=true |first=Tara |last=Conlan |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 January 2012|accessdate=4 January 2012 |location=London}}</ref> The regulator [[Ofcom]] also received 20 complaints about the episode, but they decided that it didn't warrant investigating.<ref>{{citation |title=Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin |url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb199/obb199.pdf}}</ref>

Jane Clare Jones, a doctoral student of [[feminist ethics]] writing in her blog on ''The Guardian''{{'}}s website, criticised episode writer Steven Moffat's representation of Irene Adler, arguing that her sexualisation was a regressive step. She writes, \"While Conan Doyle's original is hardly an exemplar of gender evolution, you've got to worry when a woman comes off worse in 2012 than in 1891.\"<ref name=\"jones\">{{cite news |title=Is Sherlock sexist? Steven Moffat's wanton women |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/03/sherlock-sexist-steven-moffat?newsfeed=true |first=Jane Clare |last=Jones |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=3 January 2012|accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref> Jones argues that while Conan Doyle's Adler was a \"[[proto-feminist]]\", Moffat undermined \"her acumen and agency ... Not-so-subtly channelling the spirit of the predatory [[femme fatal]] ''[sic]'', Adler's power became, in Moffat's hands, less a matter of brains, and more a matter of knowing 'what men like' and how to give it to them ... Her masterminding of a cunning criminal plan was, it was revealed late in the day, not her own doing, but dependent on the advice of Holmes's arch nemesis, James Moriarty.\"<ref name=\"jones\"/> However, Laura Pledger of ''[[Radio Times]]'' listed Adler as a strong female television character, writing, \"Not since [[Scarlett O'Hara]] has a woman employed quite so many feminine wiles in pursuit of her ultimate goal – and with such chutzpah it feels churlish to criticise.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Laura|last=Pledger|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-08/ten-strong-tv-women|title=Ten strong TV women|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> Moffat rejected any suggestion that he or Conan Doyle's creation harboured sexist views, labelling the allegation \"deeply offensive\", and misguided in that the critics had assumed that he was \"presenting the characters as the way it is and the way it ought to be\". But, he says, both Adler and Sherlock \"are clearly defined as deranged – it's love among the mad. He's a psychopath, so is she.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries|title='There is a clue everybody's missed': Sherlock writer Steven Moffat interviewed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jan/20/steven-moffat-sherlock-doctor-who?newsfeed=true |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> In another interview with [[WalesOnline]], Moffat says:

<blockquote>I think it's one thing to criticise a programme and another thing to invent motives out of amateur psychology for the writer and then accuse him of having those feelings. I think that was beyond the pale and strayed from criticism to a defamation act. I'm certainly not a sexist, a misogynist and it was wrong. It's not true and in terms of the character Sherlock Holmes, it is interesting. He has been referred to as being a bit misogynist. He's not; the fact is one of the lovely threads of the original Sherlock Holmes is whatever he says, he cannot abide anyone being cruel to women – he actually becomes incensed and full of rage.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sherlock writer Steven Moffat furious with sexist claim |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2012/01/04/sherlock-writer-steven-moffat-furious-with-sexist-claim-91466-30062866/2/ |first=Simon |last=Gaskell |work=Wales Online |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113091342/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2012/01/04/sherlock-writer-steven-moffat-furious-with-sexist-claim-91466-30062866/2/ |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df= }}</ref></blockquote>

In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]].

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |format=PDF|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

'''Robert John Riggins''' (born August 4, 1949), nicknamed '''\"The Diesel\"''' and '''\"Riggo\"''', is an American former [[American football|football]] [[running back]] who played professionally in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[New York Jets]] and [[Washington Redskins]]. He was known for his powerful running style and productivity well into the latter years of his career; in 1983 at age 34, he rushed for an NFL single-season record 24 touchdowns, and again led the league in rushing touchdowns the following season at age 35. Although he had only one [[Pro Bowl]] appearance in his career, Riggins had his greatest success in the [[NFL playoffs|postseason]], and was named the [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]] of [[Super Bowl XVII]] where he scored one touchdown and rushed for 166 yards in a 27-17 win for the [[Washington Redskins]] over the [[Miami Dolphins]]. Riggins was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1992.

==Early life==
Riggins was born in [[Seneca, Kansas]] of partial [[Czech people|Czech]] ancestry and attended Centralia High School in [[Centralia, Kansas]]. While there, he was a three-sport athlete, earning high school [[All-America]]n recognition in football, all-state honors in basketball and twice winning the Class B [[100-yard dash]] state title.<ref name=capitaljournal>{{cite web | work=Capital-Journal | url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/082207/haw_193423571.shtml | title=Jayhawks to induct Riggins into Ring of Honor | accessdate=June 20, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805225214/http://cjonline.com/stories/082207/haw_193423571.shtml | archive-date=August 5, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Riggins' high school is now located on John Riggins Avenue, which runs through a main part of Centralia.<ref>{{cite web | work=Capital-Journal | url=http://www.cjonline.com/PalmPilot/stories/091401/ksp_centralia.html | title=Centralia is town full of pride | accessdate=June 20, 2008}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On October 12, 2012 John with his brothers Frank (Junior) and Bill Riggins were on hand to dedicate the Centralia High School football field renaming it Riggins Field in honoring their parents, Franklin Eugene and Mildred Riggins.  The Pro Football Hall of Fame dedicated a plaque and NFL Films was there to film the event.  The Riggins brothers took center field for the opening coin toss and the Centralia High School Panthers went on to beat the Troy (Kansas) High School Trojans with a final score of 55–0.

==Professional career==
===New York Jets===
Riggins was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] #6 in the first round of the [[1971 NFL Draft]] by the [[New York Jets]] and as a rookie he became the first Jet to lead the team in both rushing and receiving.<ref name=jetsprofile>{{cite web | work=New York Jets | url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/all_time/player/651-john-riggins | title=John Riggins' Profile | accessdate=June 21, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613005306/http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/all_time/player/651-john-riggins <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 13, 2008}}</ref>  On October 15, 1972, the Jets set a team-record of 333 rushing yards against the [[New England Patriots]], beating them 41–13.<ref name=seventytwo>{{cite web | work=New York Jets | url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history/1972 | title=History of the New York Jets: 1972 | accessdate=June 21, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516063905/http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history/1972 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 16, 2008}}</ref>  Riggins, who had 168 yards, and [[Emerson Boozer]], who had 150 yards, became the only [[running back]] tandem in franchise history who both rushed for 150 yards in a game.<ref name=seventytwo />  Although he missed the final two games in 1972 because of knee surgery, Riggins rushed for 944 yards, four yards less than [[Matt Snell]]'s franchise record.<ref name=jetsprofile />

Riggins was among the top ten rushers in the [[American Football Conference]] in [[1974 NFL season|1974]] despite missing four games with a shoulder injury.<ref name=jetsprofile />  After only four years with the Jets, he was already the fourth leading rusher in team history with 2,875 yards.<ref name=jetsprofile />  In [[1975 NFL season|1975]], Riggins became the first player in franchise history to rush for 1,000 or more yards in a season.<ref name=seventyfive>{{cite web | work=New York Jets | url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history/1975 | title=History of the New York Jets: 1975 | accessdate=June 21, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516063923/http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history/1975 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 16, 2008}}</ref>  On December 21, 1975, he ran for 121 yards against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] which gave him 1,005 for the season.<ref name=seventyfive />  In what turned out to be his last season with the Jets, Riggins made his only appearance in the [[1976 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]].<ref name=profootballhof />

===Washington Redskins===
In [[1976 NFL season|1976]], Riggins signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Washington Redskins]],<ref name=profootballhof /> who offered him a five-year, $1.5 million contract, compared to the $63,000 he earned in his final year with the Jets.<ref name=hickok>{{cite web|work=Hickok Sports |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/rigginsjohn.shtml |title=Biography – John Riggins |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121210194435/http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/rigginsjohn.shtml |archivedate=December 10, 2012 }}</ref>  He was used mostly in short-yardage situations in his first season with Washington and missed much of the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]] with a knee injury.<ref name=hickok />  However, he gained more than 1,000 yards each of the next two seasons and was a major part of the Redskins' offense.<ref name=hickok />

====Contract dispute====
During [[National Football League Training Camp|training camp]] in July 1980, Riggins requested to renegotiate his $300,000-per-year contract and the Redskins refused.<ref name=newyorktimes>{{cite news | work=New York Times | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E7DB1338F931A25755C0A967948260 | title=Riggins Returns to Redskins | accessdate=June 22, 2008 | date=June 12, 1981}}</ref> He then chose to leave camp and the Redskins placed him on the left camp-retired list, a move that made him ineligible to play for any other team in the league.<ref name=newyorktimes /> Riggins sat out the [[1980 NFL season|1980 season]]<ref name=profootballhof /> and did not rejoin the Redskins until [[1981 NFL season|1981]], when new Washington head coach [[Joe Gibbs]] traveled to Kansas to make a peace offering.<ref name=redskinsbook>{{cite news | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/longterm/book/pages/123.htm | title=The Redskins Book: Page 123 | accessdate=June 22, 2008 | date=February 2, 1998}}</ref>

\"He had a [[camouflage]] outfit on\", Gibbs recalled. {{cquote|He had been hunting, him and a buddy. He had a beer can in his hand. It was 10 o'clock in the morning and he's meeting his coach for the first time and I'm thinking [sarcastically], 'This guy really impresses me.' But I went in there, and halfway through the conversation he says, 'You need to get me back there. I'll make you famous.<ref name=redskinsbook />

I thought to myself, 'Oh, my God, he's an egomaniac.' I thought, 'I'll get him back and then I'll trade him. I'm not putting up with a fruitcake.' So I fly back to Washington, and two days later he calls me. He says, 'Joe, I made up my mind, and I'm going to play next season.' I thought it was great. I've got him back, and I'll trade that sucker. But then he says, 'There's only one thing I want in my contract.' I ask what it was. He says, 'A no-trade clause.'<ref name=redskinsbook />}}

Riggins' return also came at the suggestion of [[Ed Garvey]], who was the executive director of the [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]].<ref name=newyorktimes />

Eleven months after he left, Riggins returned to training camp in 1981 with a new contract,<ref name=hickok /> telling the media \"I'm bored, I'm broke, and I'm back.\"<ref name=newyorktimes />

====Return to the Redskins====
[[File:John Riggins Super Bowl XVII TD Run.jpg|thumb|right|Riggins' Super Bowl XVII 43-yard touchdown run]]
Upon Riggins' return in [[1981 NFL season|1981]], he managed just 714 rushing yards but scored 13 touchdowns.<ref name=hickok />

During the [[National Football League Players Association#1982 strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]], Riggins gained 553 yards.<ref name=hickok />  He was much more successful during the [[NFL playoffs, 1982–83|playoffs]], during which he gained 444 yards in victories over the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Minnesota Vikings]] (where he had a franchise playoff record 185 yards), and [[Dallas Cowboys]], and helped the Redskins reach [[Super Bowl XVII]].<ref name=hickok />  Riggins rushed for a then-Super Bowl record 166 yards on 38 carries as the Redskins beat the [[Miami Dolphins]] 27–17.<ref name=profootballhof />  He was then named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]].<ref name=profootballhof />

A play that was designed for gaining short yardage called \"70 chip\" turned out to be the key play of the game.  With 10 minutes remaining, Riggins took a handoff on 4th-and-inches, [[Stiff-arm fend|stiffarmed]] [[cornerback]] [[Don McNeal]] and ran for a 43-yard touchdown.<ref>{{cite news | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/memories/gibbs/82sbowl.htm | title=Magic '70 Chip' Ends Four Decades of Trying | accessdate=June 22, 2008 | date=July 27, 1996}}</ref>  The Super Bowl win was the Redskins' first championship victory since [[1942 NFL season|1942]].<ref name=mvp>{{cite web | work=NFL | url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/mvp/sbxvii | title=Super Bowl XVII MVP: John Riggins | accessdate=June 22, 2008}}</ref>  Riggins' total of 610 yards amounted to 43 percent of Washington's offense in the four playoff games.<ref name=hickok />  His four consecutive playoff games with over 100 yards was an NFL postseason record.<ref name=mvp />  On December 6, 2007, Riggins' run was voted by fans as the Redskins' Greatest Moment.<ref>{{cite web | work=Washington Redskins | url=http://www.redskins.com/news/newsDetail.jsp?id=9092 | title=Riggins' Run Is Redskins' Greatest Moment | accessdate=June 22, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080131072832/http://www.redskins.com/news/newsDetail.jsp?id=9092 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = January 31, 2008}}</ref>

The 610 rushing yards and 625 yards from scrimmage he gained in the 1982 playoffs are both single NFL postseason records.

In [[1983 NFL season|1983]], Riggins rushed for 1,347 yards, scored a then-NFL record 24 touchdowns, won the [[Bert Bell Award]],<ref name=hickok /> and was named All-Pro for the first time in his career.<ref name=profootballhof />  Riggins went on to have another outstanding postseason, rushing for 242 yards and two touchdowns in their two playoff games, extending his NFL record of postseason games with at least 100 rushing yards to six.<ref name=profootballhof />  However, he only rushed for 64 yards and a touchdown in the Redskins' 38-9 [[Super Bowl XVIII]] loss against the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]].<ref>{{cite news | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/longterm/1997/history/allart/xviii.htm | title=Raiders Dismantle Redskins, Records in Super Bowl, 38-9 | accessdate=June 22, 2008 | date=July 23, 1998}}</ref>

Two other career milestones happened in the 1983 season for Riggins. On November 20, 1983, he set an NFL record by scoring in his 12th consecutive game during a 42–20 win over the [[Los Angeles Rams]].  His record would end at 13 consecutive games the following week.<ref name=history>{{cite web | work=Washington Redskins | url= http://www.redskins.com/team/history-history.jsp#1980 | title=Washington Redskins History: 1980s | accessdate=June 25, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613202828/http://www.redskins.com/team/history-history.jsp#1980 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 13, 2008}}</ref>  Then on December 17, 1983, [[Mark Moseley]] set an NFL kicking record by scoring 161 points in a season, which also made him the league leader in scoring that season.

Riggins' acting career began at Centralia High when a teacher cast him as the lead role in his junior play.<ref name=acting />  His career as a professional actor started in 1992 when he appeared in \"Illegal Motion\" at the [[Olney Theatre Center for the Arts]].<ref name=acting /> He starred as a beleaguered head football coach accused of inappropriate recruiting practices.

===Commentating===
Since retiring from professional football, Riggins has worked as a sports commentator on [[television]] and [[radio]].

In [[1998 NFL season|1998]], John and [[Chris Russo]] hosted ''Riggins and Russo'' on Sundays during the football season. The show was aired on [[WCBS-TV]] in [[New York City]], focusing primarily on the [[New York Jets|Jets]]' and [[New York Giants|Giants]]' upcoming games.

Since [[2006 NFL season|2006]], Riggins has served as [[color commentator]] on [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] for the network's weekly national radio broadcast of ''[[NFL on Westwood One#Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''.<ref name=usatoday>{{cite news | work=USA Today | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2005-08-09-hiestand-tv_x.htm | title=ABC, in its 'MNF' swan song, will be changing tunes weekly | accessdate=June 26, 2008 | date=August 9, 2005}}</ref>

On July 18, 2006, [[Triple X ESPN Radio]] was launched with Riggins hosting ''The John Riggins Show''.<ref name=espnradio>{{cite web | work=Washington Redskins | url=http://www.redskins.com/news/newsDetail.jsp?id=3798 | title=Red Zebra Launches Triple X ESPN Radio | accessdate=June 26, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080723184657/http://www.redskins.com/news/newsDetail.jsp?id=3798 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 23, 2008}}</ref>  Riggins could be heard in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area weekdays from 4-7pm on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM & 730 AM, [[WXGI]] 950 AM in [[Richmond, Virginia]] and [[WXTG-FM]] 102.1 FM in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] and [[WXTG (AM)]] 1490 in [[Hampton, Virginia]].<ref name=espnradio />  The last show of the series aired on its second anniversary, July 18, 2008. With the merger of Triple X into [[WTEM]] to form ''ESPN 980'', Riggins' afternoon show was replaced by WTEM's afternoon drive show, ''The Sports Reporters''.  Riggins stayed with ESPN 980 as a commentator at large.

On January 3, 2008, Riggins co-hosted the [[2008 Orange Bowl|74th Orange Bowl]] pre-game show. That same night, the [[2008 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas Jayhawks]] defeated the [[Virginia Tech Hokies]] 24–21. It came 39 years after Riggins and the Jayhawks last played in the game in 1969. He offered congratulations to his Alma Mater in his closing comments, saying \"The KU ship's been out at sea since '48. It finally came to port tonight!\"

In September 2008 it was announced that Riggins would co-host the program \"Sirius Blitz\" with Adam Schein on Satellite Radio Stations Sirius 124 and XM 105. Following his involvement with \"Sirius Blitz\" Riggins began hosting his own show, The John Riggins Show, which simulcasts on television and radio on MASN-TV and WTOP-HD3, which airs each weekday afternoon. Riggins has been critical on his radio shows of the current management of the Washington Redskins under owner Dan Snyder.

Previously, he had been a panelist on ''Redskins Report'' until that show was canceled in December 2008 due to budget cuts.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/29/AR2008122901353.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Leonard Shapiro: Loss of Michael Is a Truly Deep Cut | date=December 29, 2008 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>

In 2016, Riggins returned to ESPN 980 Redskins radio in a variety of roles.

'''Robert John Riggins''' (born August 4, 1949), nicknamed '''\"The Diesel\"''' and '''\"Riggo\"''', is an American former [[American football|football]] [[running back]] who played professionally in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[New York Jets]] and [[Washington Redskins]]. He was known for his powerful running style and productivity well into the latter years of his career; in 1983 at age 34, he rushed for an NFL single-season record 24 touchdowns, and again led the league in rushing touchdowns the following season at age 35. Although he had only one [[Pro Bowl]] appearance in his career, Riggins had his greatest success in the [[NFL playoffs|postseason]], and was named the [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]] of [[Super Bowl XVII]] where he scored one touchdown and rushed for 166 yards in a 27-17 win for the [[Washington Redskins]] over the [[Miami Dolphins]]. Riggins was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1992.

==Early life==
Riggins was born in [[Seneca, Kansas]] of partial [[Czech people|Czech]] ancestry and attended Centralia High School in [[Centralia, Kansas]]. While there, he was a three-sport athlete, earning high school [[All-America]]n recognition in football, all-state honors in basketball and twice winning the Class B [[100-yard dash]] state title.<ref name=capitaljournal>{{cite web | work=Capital-Journal | url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/082207/haw_193423571.shtml | title=Jayhawks to induct Riggins into Ring of Honor | accessdate=June 20, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805225214/http://cjonline.com/stories/082207/haw_193423571.shtml | archive-date=August 5, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Riggins' high school is now located on John Riggins Avenue, which runs through a main part of Centralia.<ref>{{cite web | work=Capital-Journal | url=http://www.cjonline.com/PalmPilot/stories/091401/ksp_centralia.html | title=Centralia is town full of pride | accessdate=June 20, 2008}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On October 12, 2012 John with his brothers Frank (Junior) and Bill Riggins were on hand to dedicate the Centralia High School football field renaming it Riggins Field in honoring their parents, Franklin Eugene and Mildred Riggins.  The Pro Football Hall of Fame dedicated a plaque and NFL Films was there to film the event.  The Riggins brothers took center field for the opening coin toss and the Centralia High School Panthers went on to beat the Troy (Kansas) High School Trojans with a final score of 55–0.

===Washington Redskins===
In [[1976 NFL season|1976]], Riggins signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Washington Redskins]],<ref name=profootballhof /> who offered him a five-year, $1.5 million contract, compared to the $63,000 he earned in his final year with the Jets.<ref name=hickok>{{cite web|work=Hickok Sports |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/rigginsjohn.shtml |title=Biography – John Riggins |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121210194435/http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/rigginsjohn.shtml |archivedate=December 10, 2012 }}</ref>  He was used mostly in short-yardage situations in his first season with Washington and missed much of the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]] with a knee injury.<ref name=hickok />  However, he gained more than 1,000 yards each of the next two seasons and was a major part of the Redskins' offense.<ref name=hickok />

====Contract dispute====
During [[National Football League Training Camp|training camp]] in July 1980, Riggins requested to renegotiate his $300,000-per-year contract and the Redskins refused.<ref name=newyorktimes>{{cite news | work=New York Times | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E7DB1338F931A25755C0A967948260 | title=Riggins Returns to Redskins | accessdate=June 22, 2008 | date=June 12, 1981}}</ref> He then chose to leave camp and the Redskins placed him on the left camp-retired list, a move that made him ineligible to play for any other team in the league.<ref name=newyorktimes /> Riggins sat out the [[1980 NFL season|1980 season]]<ref name=profootballhof /> and did not rejoin the Redskins until [[1981 NFL season|1981]], when new Washington head coach [[Joe Gibbs]] traveled to Kansas to make a peace offering.<ref name=redskinsbook>{{cite news | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/longterm/book/pages/123.htm | title=The Redskins Book: Page 123 | accessdate=June 22, 2008 | date=February 2, 1998}}</ref>

\"He had a [[camouflage]] outfit on\", Gibbs recalled. {{cquote|He had been hunting, him and a buddy. He had a beer can in his hand. It was 10 o'clock in the morning and he's meeting his coach for the first time and I'm thinking [sarcastically], 'This guy really impresses me.' But I went in there, and halfway through the conversation he says, 'You need to get me back there. I'll make you famous.<ref name=redskinsbook />

I thought to myself, 'Oh, my God, he's an egomaniac.' I thought, 'I'll get him back and then I'll trade him. I'm not putting up with a fruitcake.' So I fly back to Washington, and two days later he calls me. He says, 'Joe, I made up my mind, and I'm going to play next season.' I thought it was great. I've got him back, and I'll trade that sucker. But then he says, 'There's only one thing I want in my contract.' I ask what it was. He says, 'A no-trade clause.'<ref name=redskinsbook />}}

Riggins' return also came at the suggestion of [[Ed Garvey]], who was the executive director of the [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]].<ref name=newyorktimes />

Eleven months after he left, Riggins returned to training camp in 1981 with a new contract,<ref name=hickok /> telling the media \"I'm bored, I'm broke, and I'm back.\"<ref name=newyorktimes />

====Return to the Redskins====
[[File:John Riggins Super Bowl XVII TD Run.jpg|thumb|right|Riggins' Super Bowl XVII 43-yard touchdown run]]
Upon Riggins' return in [[1981 NFL season|1981]], he managed just 714 rushing yards but scored 13 touchdowns.<ref name=hickok />

During the [[National Football League Players Association#1982 strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]], Riggins gained 553 yards.<ref name=hickok />  He was much more successful during the [[NFL playoffs, 1982–83|playoffs]], during which he gained 444 yards in victories over the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Minnesota Vikings]] (where he had a franchise playoff record 185 yards), and [[Dallas Cowboys]], and helped the Redskins reach [[Super Bowl XVII]].<ref name=hickok />  Riggins rushed for a then-Super Bowl record 166 yards on 38 carries as the Redskins beat the [[Miami Dolphins]] 27–17.<ref name=profootballhof />  He was then named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]].<ref name=profootballhof />

A play that was designed for gaining short yardage called \"70 chip\" turned out to be the key play of the game.  With 10 minutes remaining, Riggins took a handoff on 4th-and-inches, [[Stiff-arm fend|stiffarmed]] [[cornerback]] [[Don McNeal]] and ran for a 43-yard touchdown.<ref>{{cite news | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/memories/gibbs/82sbowl.htm | title=Magic '70 Chip' Ends Four Decades of Trying | accessdate=June 22, 2008 | date=July 27, 1996}}</ref>  The Super Bowl win was the Redskins' first championship victory since [[1942 NFL season|1942]].<ref name=mvp>{{cite web | work=NFL | url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/mvp/sbxvii | title=Super Bowl XVII MVP: John Riggins | accessdate=June 22, 2008}}</ref>  Riggins' total of 610 yards amounted to 43 percent of Washington's offense in the four playoff games.<ref name=hickok />  His four consecutive playoff games with over 100 yards was an NFL postseason record.<ref name=mvp />  On December 6, 2007, Riggins' run was voted by fans as the Redskins' Greatest Moment.<ref>{{cite web | work=Washington Redskins | url=http://www.redskins.com/news/newsDetail.jsp?id=9092 | title=Riggins' Run Is Redskins' Greatest Moment | accessdate=June 22, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080131072832/http://www.redskins.com/news/newsDetail.jsp?id=9092 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = January 31, 2008}}</ref>

The 610 rushing yards and 625 yards from scrimmage he gained in the 1982 playoffs are both single NFL postseason records.

In [[1983 NFL season|1983]], Riggins rushed for 1,347 yards, scored a then-NFL record 24 touchdowns, won the [[Bert Bell Award]],<ref name=hickok /> and was named All-Pro for the first time in his career.<ref name=profootballhof />  Riggins went on to have another outstanding postseason, rushing for 242 yards and two touchdowns in their two playoff games, extending his NFL record of postseason games with at least 100 rushing yards to six.<ref name=profootballhof />  However, he only rushed for 64 yards and a touchdown in the Redskins' 38-9 [[Super Bowl XVIII]] loss against the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]].<ref>{{cite news | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/longterm/1997/history/allart/xviii.htm | title=Raiders Dismantle Redskins, Records in Super Bowl, 38-9 | accessdate=June 22, 2008 | date=July 23, 1998}}</ref>

Two other career milestones happened in the 1983 season for Riggins. On November 20, 1983, he set an NFL record by scoring in his 12th consecutive game during a 42–20 win over the [[Los Angeles Rams]].  His record would end at 13 consecutive games the following week.<ref name=history>{{cite web | work=Washington Redskins | url= http://www.redskins.com/team/history-history.jsp#1980 | title=Washington Redskins History: 1980s | accessdate=June 25, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613202828/http://www.redskins.com/team/history-history.jsp#1980 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 13, 2008}}</ref>  Then on December 17, 1983, [[Mark Moseley]] set an NFL kicking record by scoring 161 points in a season, which also made him the league leader in scoring that season.  Riggins, who scored 144 points, was second on the season scoring list.  This was the first time since [[1951 NFL season|1951]] that the top two scorers in a season played on the same team.<ref name=history />

Riggins gained 1,239 yards in [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and tied for the league lead in rushing TDs (14), despite a bad back.<ref name=hickok />  In [[1985 NFL season|1985]], he rushed for more than 100 yards in three of his last four starts before being replaced by [[George Rogers (American football)|George Rogers]] as the starter.<ref name=hickok />  He retired after that season.

Riggins played 175 games in 14 seasons, had 13,442 total yards ([[List of National Football League rushing yards leaders|11,352 rushing]] and 2,090 receiving) and 116 total touchdowns (104 rushing and 12 receiving).<ref name=profootballhof />  Riggins rushed over 1,000 yards five times in his career and over 100 yards in 35 games, including a then-record six in post-season. He rushed 251 times for 996 yards in the playoffs. He also had 12 touchdowns in nine post-season contests, good for fourth all-time tied with [[Terrell Davis]] and [[Marshawn Lynch]].<ref>{{cite web |title=NFL Rushing Touchdowns Career Leaders |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rush_td_career_playoffs.htm |website=pro-football-reference.com |publisher=Pro Football Reference |accessdate=February 11, 2020 |date=February 11, 2020}}</ref>

===Honors===
On October 21, 1990, Riggins and [[Joe Theismann]] were inducted into the [[Washington Redskins#Washington Hall of Stars|Redskins' Ring of Fame]].  As Riggins' name was called, he ran onto the field in full Redskins uniform, including pads, and was received by the crowd at [[RFK Stadium]] with thunderous applause.  Riggins later explained that he \"just had to hear <nowiki>[</nowiki>the roar of the crowd<nowiki>]</nowiki> one more time\".<ref>{{cite web | work=Washington Post | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1154368.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624034740/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1154368.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 24, 2011 | title=One Last Hurrah | accessdate=June 25, 2008}}</ref>

In 1992, he was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

On October 13, 2007, Riggins was inducted into the [[University of Kansas]]' Ring of Honor at [[University of Kansas Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]].<ref name=capitaljournal />

==After football==

===Acting===
In 1994, he began acting lessons and has since starred in [[off-off-Broadway]] productions of the plays ''Gillette'' and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (in which he played [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]]).<ref>{{cite web | work=Broadway World | url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=913 | title='Sight Unseen' (Broadway) and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (Storm Theatre) | accessdate=June 25, 2008}}</ref>  His television credits include ''[[Guiding Light]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'' and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''.<ref name=acting />

Riggins' acting career began at Centralia High when a teacher cast him as the lead role in his junior play.<ref name=acting />  His career as a professional actor started in 1992 when he appeared in \"Illegal Motion\" at the [[Olney Theatre Center for the Arts]].<ref name=acting /> He starred as a beleaguered head football coach accused of inappropriate recruiting practices.

===Commentating===
Since retiring from professional football, Riggins has worked as a sports commentator on [[television]] and [[radio]].

In [[1998 NFL season|1998]], John and [[Chris Russo]] hosted ''Riggins and Russo'' on Sundays during the football season. The show was aired on [[WCBS-TV]] in [[New York City]], focusing primarily on the [[New York Jets|Jets]]' and [[New York Giants|Giants]]' upcoming games.

Since [[2006 NFL season|2006]], Riggins has served as [[color commentator]] on [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] for the network's weekly national radio broadcast of ''[[NFL on Westwood One#Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''.<ref name=usatoday>{{cite news | work=USA Today | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2005-08-09-hiestand-tv_x.htm | title=ABC, in its 'MNF' swan song, will be changing tunes weekly | accessdate=June 26, 2008 | date=August 9, 2005}}</ref>

On July 18, 2006, [[Triple X ESPN Radio]] was launched with Riggins hosting ''The John Riggins Show''.<ref name=espnradio>{{cite web | work=Washington Redskins | url=http://www.redskins.com/news/newsDetail.jsp?id=3798 | title=Red Zebra Launches Triple X ESPN Radio | accessdate=June 26, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080723184657/http://www.redskins.com/news/newsDetail.jsp?id=3798 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 23, 2008}}</ref>  Riggins could be heard in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area weekdays from 4-7pm on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM & 730 AM, [[WXGI]] 950 AM in [[Richmond, Virginia]] and [[WXTG-FM]] 102.1 FM in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] and [[WXTG (AM)]] 1490 in [[Hampton, Virginia]].<ref name=espnradio />  The last show of the series aired on its second anniversary, July 18, 2008. With the merger of Triple X into [[WTEM]] to form ''ESPN 980'', Riggins' afternoon show was replaced by WTEM's afternoon drive show, ''The Sports Reporters''.  Riggins stayed with ESPN 980 as a commentator at large.

On January 3, 2008, Riggins co-hosted the [[2008 Orange Bowl|74th Orange Bowl]] pre-game show. That same night, the [[2008 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas Jayhawks]] defeated the [[Virginia Tech Hokies]] 24–21. It came 39 years after Riggins and the Jayhawks last played in the game in 1969. He offered congratulations to his Alma Mater in his closing comments, saying \"The KU ship's been out at sea since '48. It finally came to port tonight!\"

In September 2008 it was announced that Riggins would co-host the program \"Sirius Blitz\" with Adam Schein on Satellite Radio Stations Sirius 124 and XM 105. Following his involvement with \"Sirius Blitz\" Riggins began hosting his own show, The John Riggins Show, which simulcasts on television and radio on MASN-TV and WTOP-HD3, which airs each weekday afternoon. Riggins has been critical on his radio shows of the current management of the Washington Redskins under owner Dan Snyder.

Previously, he had been a panelist on ''Redskins Report'' until that show was canceled in December 2008 due to budget cuts.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/29/AR2008122901353.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Leonard Shapiro: Loss of Michael Is a Truly Deep Cut | date=December 29, 2008 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>

In 2016, Riggins returned to ESPN 980 Redskins radio in a variety of roles. Weekly appearances consisted of a one-hour appearance on Tuesdays with Bram Weinstein, a Thursday appearance on moving drive with Kevin Sheehan & Chris Cooley and a Friday appearance on Inside The Locker Room with Doc Walker, Brian Mitchell and Scott Jackson. Additionally, Riggins co-hosted the Washington Redskins Radio Network pregame show with Kevin Sheehan before every Redskins game.

'''C-squares''' (acronym for the '''''concise spatial query and representation system''''') is a system of spatially unique, location-based identifiers ([[geocodes]]) for areas on the surface of the [[earth]], represented as cells from a [[Discrete Global Grid]] at a hierarchical set of resolution steps. The identifiers incorporate literal values of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in an interleaved notation (producing grid resolutions of 10, 1, 0.1 degrees, etc.), together with additional digits that support intermediate grid resolutions of 5, 0.5, 0.05 degrees, etc. The system was initially designed to represent data \"footprints\" or spatial extents in a more flexible manner than a standard [[minimum bounding rectangle]], and to support \"lightweight\", text-based spatial querying; it can also provide a set of identifiers for grid cells used for assembly, storage and analysis of spatially organised data. Dataset extents expressed in c-squares notation can be visualised using a web-based utility, the c-squares mapper, an online instance of which is currently provided by [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia. C-squares codes and associated published software are free to use and the software is released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL), a licence of the Free Software Foundation.

==History==
The c-squares method was developed by Tony Rees at [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia (then \"CSIRO Marine Research\") in 2001-2, initially as a method for spatial indexing, rapid query, and compact storage and visualization of dataset spatial \"footprints\" in an agency-specific [[Geospatial metadata|metadata directory]] (data catalogue);.<ref name=\"about_c-squares\">CSIRO Marine Research, 2002: [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/about-csquares.htm About C-Squares.]</ref><ref name = \"Rees_2002\">Rees, Tony (2002): \"C-squares–a new metadata element for improved spatial querying and representation of spatial dataset coverage in metadata records\". Proceedings of EOGEO Technical Workshop May 2002, Ispra, Italy.</ref> It was later published in the scientific literature as a freely available tool for use by other workers, together with a web-accessible mapping utility entitled the \"c-squares mapper\" for visualisation of data extents expressed in the c-squares notation.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\">{{Cite journal |url=https://tos.org/oceanography/article/c-squares-a-new-spatial-indexing-system-and-its-applicability-to-the-descri |last=Rees |first=Tony |year=2003 |title='C-squares', a new spatial indexing system and its applicability to the description of oceanographic datasets |journal=Oceanography |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=11–19 |doi=10.5670/oceanog.2003.52}}</ref> Since that time, a number of projects and international collaborations have employed c-squares to support spatial indexing and/or map production, including [[Fishbase]] (to map stored data points for any species), the [[Ocean Biogeographic Information System]] (OBIS),<ref name=\"Rees_Zhang_2007\">[https://www.oceandocs.org/bitstream/handle/1834/5643/202.pdf?sequence=1#page=167 Tony Rees and Phoebe Zhang, 2007. \"Evolving concepts in the architecture and functionality of OBIS, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System\". in Vanden Berghe, E. et al.

==Rationale==
===Indexing spatial data===
{{Main|Grid (spatial index)}}
Spatial data are inherently (at least) 2-dimensional; without additional indexing, a numeric range query in 2 dimensions (e.g. ''x'' and ''y'', or latitude and longitude) is required to retrieve data items within a particular area. Such queries are computationally expensive so it can be beneficial to pre-process (index) the data in some manner that reduces the inherent dimensionality from two to one dimension, for example as labelled cells of a grid; the grid labels can then be [[database index|indexed]] by standard, one dimensional methods for rapid search and retrieval,<ref>Rigaux, P., Scholl, M., and Voisard, A. 2002. Spatial Databases - with application to GIS. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 410pp.</ref> and/or searched by simple alphanumeric text searches. C-squares is an example of such a grid where the cell identifiers are designed to be human- as well as machine-readable, and to be concordant with recognizable and commonly intervals of latitude and longitude.

===Dataset footprints===
[[Geographic data and information|Spatial data]], that is, data associated with particular geographic locations on the earth, have spatial \"footprints\" that ideally are recorded in metadata systems or data catalogues, to support spatial searching of the resources in question.<ref name = \"Hill_2006\">Hill, Linda (2006). ''Georeferencing: The Geographic Associations of Information''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 260 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-262-08354-6}}</ref> A \"basic\" generalization of any data footprint is the minimum bounding rectangle or MBR, that is, the smallest set of boundaries of latitude and longitude that completely contain the data. Such stored rectangles are relatively simple to query as a mathematical operation (look for overlap with an input \"search\" rectangle) but, with real world data, may not be a good surrogate for the true data \"footprint\" if the latter contains disjoint or sparsely populated data items, items on a diagonal line, or items with significant \"holes\", such as a vessel track around a continent.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /> Representation as a set of smaller \"tiles\", such those denoted by c-square codes at an appropriate resolution, can more accurately reflect the shape of such non-rectangular and/or non-contiguous datasets.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /><ref name = \"Hill_2006\" />

\"Binning\" describes the process of converting continuously variable data (in the present case, spatial locations in degrees of latitude and longitude) into a set of discrete \"bins\" in order to apply the indexing and subsequent search/retrieval processes, other processing and reporting, etc. The optimal size of the spatial data \"bins\" can depend on the user's requirements (e.g. geographic coverage), desire for handling large vs. small datasets (which can affect the time required for processing or production of on-demand maps) and density of available data (with sparse input data, many \"bins\" may end up being empty). Large \"bins\" will have smaller data handling requirements and smooth out data deficiencies, but will result in a loss of resolution of fine scale data; small \"bins\" can result in large quantities of data to be handled (for example, a global coverage at 0.1 degree resolution requires over 6 million grid cells) which may be too much for easy handling. To date, 0.5 degree cells (50×50 km nominal size) have been found to be a reasonable compromise between resolution and data storage requirements for global coverages (259,200 cells), e.g. as used for Aquamaps,<ref name = \"Ready_et_al_2010\" /> while for more local applications, either 0.5 or 0.1 degree cells may be useful.

===Data reduction===
{{Main|data reduction}}
One advantage of binning spatial data as described above is that it offers the potential for [[data reduction]] in some use cases: for example rather than storing (say) hundreds of raw data points within the same bin, the data can be represented as an average value and/or number of data points held, or just as presence/absence (for example as a range map). By this means, the quantity of information required to be stored in the spatial index and associated information can be substantially reduced in many cases, with a concomitant improvement in performance (speed of spatial queries and result mapping as desired).

===Hierarchical representation===
{{Main|Discrete global grid#Hierarchical grids}}
As a property of a discrete global grid, hierarchical notation ensures that the geocodes for finer resolutions of the mesh incorporate those of all their parents, permitting rapid search and/or data aggregation at any desired equal or higher level of the hierarchy. In the c-squares case, the code is extended by additional alphanumeric characters as the spatial resolution increases, with the corollary that resolution can be decreased if desired, merely by truncating the code by the relevant amount.

[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|An equal angle spherical (global) grid, represented in a \"real world\" (orthographic) perspective.]]
===Equal angle grids===
Equal angle grids (the class that includes c-squares) have the advantage that transformation of spatial data (for example as simple coordinates of latitude and longitude) in and out of the grid notation can be simple, since the latitude–longitude grid is itself equal angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/85ec/ec57454e66e3326b4aaf834ab9c5fe4e073c.pdf |last1=Kimerling |first1=A. Jon |last2=Sahr |first2=Kevin |last3=White |first3=Denis |last4=Song |first4=Lian |year=1999 |title=Comparing geometrical properties of global grids |journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271–288 |doi=}}</ref> On the actual surface of the globe, the cells are approximately \"square\" only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four. By contrast, equal area grids attempt to preserve a constant area for all cells at the same hierarchical level (resolution), at the expense of losing concordance with familiar lines of latitude and/or longitude.

===Regional (local/national) vs. global grids===
Local and/or national grids have been developed for use within a number of countries, for example the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|UK National Grid]] has been in use since 1946,<ref name = \"Nature_1946\">{{Cite journal |url=https://tos.org/oceanography/article/c-squares-a-new-spatial-indexing-system-and-its-applicability-to-the-descri |last=Anonymous |first=|year=1946 |title=The National Grid of the Ordnance Survey |journal=Nature |volume=158 |issue= |pages=510 |doi=10.1038/158510a0}}</ref> while a separate system is in use for [[Irish grid reference system|Ireland]]. Discontinuities occur where such grids meet or overlap, and some areas (for example the more offshore portions of surrounding seas and the [[Channel Islands]]) are not covered at all. Global grids offer a solution to this problem (providing standard treatment for all areas of the globe) and also offer a potential format for collation of cross-national data into a single repository for analysis and reporting, for example see Vanhee ''et al''., 2018.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" />

==The c-squares global grid notation==
[[File:WMO-squares-global.gif|thumb|Global coverage of 10x10 degree World Meteorological Organization (WMO) squares (= c-squares 10-degree grid)]]

===Initial 10 degree squares===
10-degree c-squares are specified as being identical to equivalent World Meteteorological Organization (WMO) square codes, refer illustration at right. These squares are aligned with 10-degree subdivisions of the global latitude–longitude grid, which for c-squares use is specified as employing the [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS84 datum]]. WMO (10 degree) squares are encoded with four digits, in the series 1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx and 7xxx.<ref name=\"NODC_1998\" /> The leading digit indicates the \"global quadrant\" with 1 for north-east (latitude and longitude are both positive), 3 for south-east (latitude is negative and longitude positive), 5 for south-west (latitude and longitude are both negative) and 7 for north-west (latitude is positive and longitude negative). The next digit, 0 through 8, corresponds to the tens of latitude degrees either north or south; while the remaining 2 digits, 00 through 17, correspond to the tens of longitude degrees either east or west (by specification, 0 is treated as positive). Thus the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 0,0 (latitude,longitude) is encoded 1000, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 0 and 10 degrees north (actually, 0 and 9.999...) and 0 and 9.999... degrees east; the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 80 N, 170 E is encoded 1817, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 80 and 90 degrees north and 170 and 179.999... degrees east.

===Subsequent recursive subdivision===
C-squares extends the initial WMO 10×10 square notation via a recursive series of \"cycles\", each 3 digits long (the final one may be 1 digit), separated by the colon character, the number of characters (and cycles) indicating the resolution encoded, as per these examples:
*1000 ... 10×10 degree square (up to 1000×1000 km nominal)
*1000:1 ... 5×5 degree square (up to 500×500 km nominal)
*1000:100 ... 1×1 degree square (up to 100×100 km nominal)
*1000:100:1 ... 0.5×0.5 degree square (up to 50×50km nominal)
*1000:100:100 ... 0.1×0.1 degree square (up to 10×10 km nominal)
*1000:100:100:1 ... 0.05×0.05 degree square (up to 5×5km nominal)
(etc.)

The nominal sizes given reflect the fact that at the equator, 1 degree of both latitude and longitude correspond to around 110 km, with the actual value for longitude declining between there and the poles, where it becomes zero (latitude actual: 110.567 km at the equator, 111.699 km at the poles; longitude actual: 111.320 km at the equator, 78.847 km at latitude ±45 degrees, 0 km at the poles); at a sample northern hemisphere latitude e.g. that of [[London]] (51.5 degrees north), a 1×1 degree square measures approximately 111×69 km.<ref>U.S. National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center: [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml Latitude/Longitude Distance Calculator]</ref>

[[File:C-squares geocode principle - SE intermediate quadrant example.gif|thumb|C-squares recursive subdivision principle - intermediate quadrant example (south-east global quadrant)]]
To produce the 1 or 3 digits in any cycle following the initial 4-digit, 10-degree square identifier, first an \"intermediate quadrant\", 1 through 4 is designated (refer diagram at right), where 1 indicates low absolute values of both latitude and longitude (regardless of sign), 2 indicates low longitude and high latitude, 3 indicates high latitude and low longitude, and 4 indicates high values for both; \"low\" and high\" being taken from the relevant portion of the data to be gridded (for example within the 10 degree cell extending from 10 to 20 degrees, 10 is treated as low and 19 as high). This leading digit in a cycle is then followed simply by the next applicable digit for first latitude and then longitude: thus an input value of latitude +11.0, longitude +12.0 degrees will be encoded as the 5 degree c-square code 1101:1 and the 1 degree code 1101:112. Inspection of this code will show that the input latitude value can be recovered directly from the digits 1<u>1</u>01:1<u>1</u>2 while the longitude is included as 11<u>01</u>:11<u>2</u>; the sign for these is both positive, as indicated by the first digit of the leading 4 (1 in this case, indicating the north east global quadrant).

From 2002 onwards (still current at 2020), an online \"[http://www.marine.csiro.au/marq/csq_builder.init latlong to c-squares conversion page]\" is available at the website of CSIRO Marine Research (now CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere) which will convert input values of latitude and longitude to the equivalent c-square code at user selectable resolutions from 10 to 0.1 degree cell size. Alternatively it is a comparatively simple task to program from first principles (or construct as, for example, a [[Microsoft Excel]] worksheet) according to the c-squares specification;<ref name=\"c-squares_spec\">[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/spec1-1.htm C-squares Specification - Version 1.1 (December 2005)]</ref> an example is available [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/c-squares-encoder.xls here].

==C-squares strings, and the c-squares mapper==
A set of c-squares (contiguous or non contiguous) can be represented as a concatenated list of individual square codes, separated by the \"pipe\" (|) character, thus: 7500:110:3|7500:110:1|1500:110:3|1500:110:1 (etc.). This set of squares can then serve as an indication of a dataset extent, similar in function (but simpler to specify) to a MultiPolygon in the [[Well-known text representation of geometry]], the functional difference being that defined points forming the boundary of a polygon can be continuously variable, while those for the c-square boundaries are constrained to fixed intervals from the grid square resolution in use. If these strings are stored, for example as \"long text\" within a field of a conventional text storage system (e.g. spreadsheet, database, etc.) they can be used for the operation of spatial searches (see following section/s).

C-squares strings can also be used directly as input to an instance of the \"c-squares mapper\", a web-based utility in operation since 2002 at CSIRO in Australia (under the domain obis.org.au) and also at other global locations. To visualize the position of any set of squares on a map, the current syntax to address an installation of the \"c-squares mapper\" is (e.g.):

[http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2|3112:370:2|3112:360:4|3111:360:3|3110:469:3|3112:360:3|3111:469:2|3111:469:1|3110:469:1|3111:458:4|3111:458:3|3110:458:2|3111:457:2|3111:247:3|3110:248:3|3111:246:2|3110:247:2|3111:235:4|3111:134:1|3110:237:1|3112:235:2|3112:225:3|3111:122:4|3110:227:3|3112:124:4|3111:121:2|3112:124:1|3112:122:2|3112:123:1|3110:216:4|3112:112:3|3111:110:3|3110:217:1|3110:216:2|3110:205:3|3110:205:1|3110:206:2|3110:205:2|3010:496:4|3010:496:2 http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2| (etc.)].

[[Image:Aquamap-mola-mola-20091106-med-res.png|right|240px|thumb|[[AquaMaps|AquaMap]] for ''Mola mola'', the ocean sunfish, generated via the c-squares mapper at 0.5 degree square resolution]]
It should be noted here that the above call to the c-squares mapper is a simple one, with only a single parameter (a single c-squares string) which produces a simple \"default map\"; the mapper is in fact quite highly customizable, capable of accepting up to seven c-squares strings concurrently, plotting them in user-specified colours, with a choice of empty of filled squares, user-selectable base map, etc. etc.; a full list of available input parameters is provided on the mapper \"technical information\" page.<ref>[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/mapper-tech.htm CMAR c-squares Mapper - Technical Information] page</ref> A more sophisticated map produced using a larger number of available parameters is the colour-coded example at right ([[AquaMaps|AquaMap]], i.e. modelled distribution, for the ocean sunfish).

==Spatial searching==
In a system that uses c-squares codes as units of spatial indexing, a text-based search on any of these square identifiers will retrieve data associated with the relevant square. If a wildcard search is supported (for example in the case that the wildcard character is a percent sign), a search on \"7500%\" will retrieve all data items in that ten degree square, a search on \"7500:1%\" will retrieve all data items in that five degree square, etc.

The asterisk character \"*\" has a special (reserved) meaning in c-squares notation, being a \"compact\" notation indicating that all finer cells within a higher level cell are included, to the level of resolution indicated by the number of asterisks. In the example above, \"7500:*\" would indicate that all 4 five-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, \"7500:***\" would indicate that all 100 one-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, etc. This approach enables the filling of contiguous blocks of cells with an economy of characters in many cases (a form of [[data compression]]), that is useful for efficient storage and transfer of c-squares codes as required.

==Spatial data exchange and assembly==
Examples of the use of c-squares for multi-national data reporting and assembly include the use of 0.05 × 0.05 degree c-squares for VMS (vessel monitoring systems) data and fishing logbook data for [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]], the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,<ref name = \"ICES_2019\" >International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (2019) ICES Technical Guidelines: 16.3.3.3 Spatial distribution of fishing effort and physical disturbance of benthic habitats by mobile bottom trawl fishing gear using VMS. doi: 10.17895/ices.advice.4683 1 Available at https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Guidelines%20and%20Policies/16.03.03.03_Guidelines_Vessel_Monitoring_Systems_Data.pdf</ref> and the reporting and collation of fishing activity by member states into 0.5 × 0.5 degree c-squares by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) of the European Commission.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" /><ref name = \"Holmes_et_al_2018\">Holmes, S.J., Gibin, M., Scott, F., Zanzi, A., ''et al.''

'''C-squares''' (acronym for the '''''concise spatial query and representation system''''') is a system of spatially unique, location-based identifiers ([[geocodes]]) for areas on the surface of the [[earth]], represented as cells from a [[Discrete Global Grid]] at a hierarchical set of resolution steps. The identifiers incorporate literal values of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in an interleaved notation (producing grid resolutions of 10, 1, 0.1 degrees, etc.), together with additional digits that support intermediate grid resolutions of 5, 0.5, 0.05 degrees, etc. The system was initially designed to represent data \"footprints\" or spatial extents in a more flexible manner than a standard [[minimum bounding rectangle]], and to support \"lightweight\", text-based spatial querying; it can also provide a set of identifiers for grid cells used for assembly, storage and analysis of spatially organised data. Dataset extents expressed in c-squares notation can be visualised using a web-based utility, the c-squares mapper, an online instance of which is currently provided by [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia. C-squares codes and associated published software are free to use and the software is released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL), a licence of the Free Software Foundation.

==History==
The c-squares method was developed by Tony Rees at [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia (then \"CSIRO Marine Research\") in 2001-2, initially as a method for spatial indexing, rapid query, and compact storage and visualization of dataset spatial \"footprints\" in an agency-specific [[Geospatial metadata|metadata directory]] (data catalogue);.<ref name=\"about_c-squares\">CSIRO Marine Research, 2002: [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/about-csquares.htm About C-Squares.]</ref><ref name = \"Rees_2002\">Rees, Tony (2002): \"C-squares–a new metadata element for improved spatial querying and representation of spatial dataset coverage in metadata records\".

==Rationale==
===Indexing spatial data===
{{Main|Grid (spatial index)}}
Spatial data are inherently (at least) 2-dimensional; without additional indexing, a numeric range query in 2 dimensions (e.g. ''x'' and ''y'', or latitude and longitude) is required to retrieve data items within a particular area. Such queries are computationally expensive so it can be beneficial to pre-process (index) the data in some manner that reduces the inherent dimensionality from two to one dimension, for example as labelled cells of a grid; the grid labels can then be [[database index|indexed]] by standard, one dimensional methods for rapid search and retrieval,<ref>Rigaux, P., Scholl, M., and Voisard, A. 2002. Spatial Databases - with application to GIS. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 410pp.</ref> and/or searched by simple alphanumeric text searches. C-squares is an example of such a grid where the cell identifiers are designed to be human- as well as machine-readable, and to be concordant with recognizable and commonly intervals of latitude and longitude.

===Dataset footprints===
[[Geographic data and information|Spatial data]], that is, data associated with particular geographic locations on the earth, have spatial \"footprints\" that ideally are recorded in metadata systems or data catalogues, to support spatial searching of the resources in question.<ref name = \"Hill_2006\">Hill, Linda (2006). ''Georeferencing: The Geographic Associations of Information''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 260 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-262-08354-6}}</ref> A \"basic\" generalization of any data footprint is the minimum bounding rectangle or MBR, that is, the smallest set of boundaries of latitude and longitude that completely contain the data. Such stored rectangles are relatively simple to query as a mathematical operation (look for overlap with an input \"search\" rectangle) but, with real world data, may not be a good surrogate for the true data \"footprint\" if the latter contains disjoint or sparsely populated data items, items on a diagonal line, or items with significant \"holes\", such as a vessel track around a continent.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /> Representation as a set of smaller \"tiles\", such those denoted by c-square codes at an appropriate resolution, can more accurately reflect the shape of such non-rectangular and/or non-contiguous datasets.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /><ref name = \"Hill_2006\" />

===Data binning===
{{Main|Data binning}}
\"Binning\" describes the process of converting continuously variable data (in the present case, spatial locations in degrees of latitude and longitude) into a set of discrete \"bins\" in order to apply the indexing and subsequent search/retrieval processes, other processing and reporting, etc. The optimal size of the spatial data \"bins\" can depend on the user's requirements (e.g. geographic coverage), desire for handling large vs. small datasets (which can affect the time required for processing or production of on-demand maps) and density of available data (with sparse input data, many \"bins\" may end up being empty). Large \"bins\" will have smaller data handling requirements and smooth out data deficiencies, but will result in a loss of resolution of fine scale data; small \"bins\" can result in large quantities of data to be handled (for example, a global coverage at 0.1 degree resolution requires over 6 million grid cells) which may be too much for easy handling. To date, 0.5 degree cells (50×50 km nominal size) have been found to be a reasonable compromise between resolution and data storage requirements for global coverages (259,200 cells), e.g. as used for Aquamaps,<ref name = \"Ready_et_al_2010\" /> while for more local applications, either 0.5 or 0.1 degree cells may be useful.

===Data reduction===
{{Main|data reduction}}
One advantage of binning spatial data as described above is that it offers the potential for [[data reduction]] in some use cases: for example rather than storing (say) hundreds of raw data points within the same bin, the data can be represented as an average value and/or number of data points held, or just as presence/absence (for example as a range map). By this means, the quantity of information required to be stored in the spatial index and associated information can be substantially reduced in many cases, with a concomitant improvement in performance (speed of spatial queries and resulting mapping as desired).

===Hierarchical representation===
{{Main|Discrete global grid#Hierarchical grids}}
As a property of a discrete global grid, hierarchical notation ensures that the geocodes for finer resolutions of the mesh incorporate those of all their parents, permitting rapid search and/or data aggregation at any desired equal or higher level of the hierarchy. In the c-squares case, the code is extended by additional alphanumeric characters as the spatial resolution increases, with the corollary that resolution can be decreased if desired, merely by truncating the code by the relevant amount.

[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|An equal angle spherical (global) grid, represented in a \"real world\" (orthographic) perspective.]]
===Equal angle grids===
Equal angle grids (the class that includes c-squares) have the advantage that transformation of spatial data (for example as simple coordinates of latitude and longitude) in and out of the grid notation can be simple, since the latitude–longitude grid is itself equal angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/85ec/ec57454e66e3326b4aaf834ab9c5fe4e073c.pdf |last1=Kimerling |first1=A. Jon |last2=Sahr |first2=Kevin |last3=White |first3=Denis |last4=Song |first4=Lian |year=1999 |title=Comparing geometrical properties of global grids |journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271–288 |doi=}}</ref> On the actual surface of the globe, the cells are approximately \"square\" only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four. By contrast, equal area grids attempt to preserve a constant area for all cells at the same hierarchical level (resolution), at the expense of losing concordance with familiar lines of latitude and/or longitude.

===Regional (local/national) vs. global grids===
Local and/or national grids have been developed for use within a number of countries, for example the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|UK National Grid]] has been in use since 1946,<ref name = \"Nature_1946\">{{Cite journal |url=https://tos.org/oceanography/article/c-squares-a-new-spatial-indexing-system-and-its-applicability-to-the-descri |last=Anonymous |first=|year=1946 |title=The National Grid of the Ordnance Survey |journal=Nature |volume=158 |issue= |pages=510 |doi=10.1038/158510a0}}</ref> while a separate system is in use for [[Irish grid reference system|Ireland]]. Discontinuities occur where such grids meet or overlap, and some areas (for example the more offshore portions of surrounding seas and the [[Channel Islands]]) are not covered at all. Global grids offer a solution to this problem (providing standard treatment for all areas of the globe) and also offer a potential format for collation of cross-national data into a single repository for analysis and reporting, for example see Vanhee ''et al''., 2018.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" />

==The c-squares global grid notation==
[[File:WMO-squares-global.gif|thumb|Global coverage of 10x10 degree World Meteorological Organization (WMO) squares (= c-squares 10-degree grid)]]

===Initial 10 degree squares===
10-degree c-squares are specified as being identical to equivalent World Meteteorological Organization (WMO) square codes, refer illustration at right. These squares are aligned with 10-degree subdivisions of the global latitude–longitude grid, which for c-squares use is specified as employing the [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS84 datum]]. WMO (10 degree) squares are encoded with four digits, in the series 1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx and 7xxx.<ref name=\"NODC_1998\" /> The leading digit indicates the \"global quadrant\" with 1 for north-east (latitude and longitude are both positive), 3 for south-east (latitude is negative and longitude positive), 5 for south-west (latitude and longitude are both negative) and 7 for north-west (latitude is positive and longitude negative). The next digit, 0 through 8, corresponds to the tens of latitude degrees either north or south; while the remaining 2 digits, 00 through 17, correspond to the tens of longitude degrees either east or west (by specification, 0 is treated as positive). Thus the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 0,0 (latitude,longitude) is encoded 1000, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 0 and 10 degrees north (actually, 0 and 9.999...) and 0 and 9.999... degrees east; the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 80 N, 170 E is encoded 1817, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 80 and 90 degrees north and 170 and 179.999... degrees east.

===Subsequent recursive subdivision===
C-squares extends the initial WMO 10×10 square notation via a recursive series of \"cycles\", each 3 digits long (the final one may be 1 digit), separated by the colon character, the number of characters (and cycles) indicating the resolution encoded, as per these examples:
*1000 ... 10×10 degree square (up to 1000×1000 km nominal)
*1000:1 ... 5×5 degree square (up to 500×500 km nominal)
*1000:100 ... 1×1 degree square (up to 100×100 km nominal)
*1000:100:1 ... 0.5×0.5 degree square (up to 50×50km nominal)
*1000:100:100 ... 0.1×0.1 degree square (up to 10×10 km nominal)
*1000:100:100:1 ... 0.05×0.05 degree square (up to 5×5km nominal)
(etc.)

The nominal sizes given reflect the fact that at the equator, 1 degree of both latitude and longitude correspond to around 110 km, with the actual value for longitude declining between there and the poles, where it becomes zero (latitude actual: 110.567 km at the equator, 111.699 km at the poles; longitude actual: 111.320 km at the equator, 78.847 km at latitude ±45 degrees, 0 km at the poles); at a sample northern hemisphere latitude e.g. that of [[London]] (51.5 degrees north), a 1×1 degree square measures approximately 111×69 km.<ref>U.S. National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center: [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml Latitude/Longitude Distance Calculator]</ref>

[[File:C-squares geocode principle - SE intermediate quadrant example.gif|thumb|C-squares recursive subdivision principle - intermediate quadrant example (south-east global quadrant)]]
To produce the 1 or 3 digits in any cycle following the initial 4-digit, 10-degree square identifier, first an \"intermediate quadrant\", 1 through 4 is designated (refer diagram at right), where 1 indicates low absolute values of both latitude and longitude (regardless of sign), 2 indicates low longitude and high latitude, 3 indicates high latitude and low longitude, and 4 indicates high values for both; \"low\" and high\" being taken from the relevant portion of the data to be gridded (for example within the 10 degree cell extending from 10 to 20 degrees, 10 is treated as low and 19 as high). This leading digit in a cycle is then followed simply by the next applicable digit for first latitude and then longitude: thus an input value of latitude +11.0, longitude +12.0 degrees will be encoded as the 5 degree c-square code 1101:1 and the 1 degree code 1101:112. Inspection of this code will show that the input latitude value can be recovered directly from the digits 1<u>1</u>01:1<u>1</u>2 while the longitude is included as 11<u>01</u>:11<u>2</u>; the sign for these is both positive, as indicated by the first digit of the leading 4 (1 in this case, indicating the north east global quadrant).

From 2002 onwards (still current at 2020), an online \"[http://www.marine.csiro.au/marq/csq_builder.init latlong to c-squares conversion page]\" is available at the website of CSIRO Marine Research (now CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere) which will convert input values of latitude and longitude to the equivalent c-square code at user selectable resolutions from 10 to 0.1 degree cell size. Alternatively it is a comparatively simple task to program from first principles (or construct as, for example, a [[Microsoft Excel]] worksheet) according to the c-squares specification;<ref name=\"c-squares_spec\">[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/spec1-1.htm C-squares Specification - Version 1.1 (December 2005)]</ref> an example is available [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/c-squares-encoder.xls here].

==C-squares strings, and the c-squares mapper==
A set of c-squares (contiguous or non contiguous) can be represented as a concatenated list of individual square codes, separated by the \"pipe\" (|) character, thus: 7500:110:3|7500:110:1|1500:110:3|1500:110:1 (etc.). This set of squares can then serve as an indication of a dataset extent, similar in function (but simpler to specify) to a MultiPolygon in the [[Well-known text representation of geometry]], the functional difference being that defined points forming the boundary of a polygon can be continuously variable, while those for the c-square boundaries are constrained to fixed intervals from the grid square resolution in use. If these strings are stored, for example as \"long text\" within a field of a conventional text storage system (e.g. spreadsheet, database, etc.) they can be used for the operation of spatial searches (see following section/s).

C-squares strings can also be used directly as input to an instance of the \"c-squares mapper\", a web-based utility in operation since 2002 at CSIRO in Australia (under the domain obis.org.au) and also at other global locations. To visualize the position of any set of squares on a map, the current syntax to address an installation of the \"c-squares mapper\" is (e.g.):

[http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2|3112:370:2|3112:360:4|3111:360:3|3110:469:3|3112:360:3|3111:469:2|3111:469:1|3110:469:1|3111:458:4|3111:458:3|3110:458:2|3111:457:2|3111:247:3|3110:248:3|3111:246:2|3110:247:2|3111:235:4|3111:134:1|3110:237:1|3112:235:2|3112:225:3|3111:122:4|3110:227:3|3112:124:4|3111:121:2|3112:124:1|3112:122:2|3112:123:1|3110:216:4|3112:112:3|3111:110:3|3110:217:1|3110:216:2|3110:205:3|3110:205:1|3110:206:2|3110:205:2|3010:496:4|3010:496:2 http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2| (etc.)].

[[Image:Aquamap-mola-mola-20091106-med-res.png|right|240px|thumb|[[AquaMaps|AquaMap]] for ''Mola mola'', the ocean sunfish, generated via the c-squares mapper at 0.5 degree square resolution]]
It should be noted here that the above call to the c-squares mapper is a simple one, with only a single parameter (a single c-squares string) which produces a simple \"default map\"; the mapper is in fact quite highly customizable, capable of accepting up to seven c-squares strings concurrently, plotting them in user-specified colours, with a choice of empty of filled squares, user-selectable base map, etc. etc.; a full list of available input parameters is provided on the mapper \"technical information\" page.<ref>[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/mapper-tech.htm CMAR c-squares Mapper - Technical Information] page</ref> A more sophisticated map produced using a larger number of available parameters is the colour-coded example at right ([[AquaMaps|AquaMap]], i.e. modelled distribution, for the ocean sunfish).

==Spatial searching==
In a system that uses c-squares codes as units of spatial indexing, a text-based search on any of these square identifiers will retrieve data associated with the relevant square. If a wildcard search is supported (for example in the case that the wildcard character is a percent sign), a search on \"7500%\" will retrieve all data items in that ten degree square, a search on \"7500:1%\" will retrieve all data items in that five degree square, etc.

The asterisk character \"*\" has a special (reserved) meaning in c-squares notation, being a \"compact\" notation indicating that all finer cells within a higher level cell are included, to the level of resolution indicated by the number of asterisks. In the example above, \"7500:*\" would indicate that all 4 five-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, \"7500:***\" would indicate that all 100 one-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, etc. This approach enables the filling of contiguous blocks of cells with an economy of characters in many cases (a form of [[data compression]]), that is useful for efficient storage and transfer of c-squares codes as required.

==Spatial data exchange and assembly==
Examples of the use of c-squares for multi-national data reporting and assembly include the use of 0.05 × 0.05 degree c-squares for VMS (vessel monitoring systems) data and fishing logbook data for [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]], the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,<ref name = \"ICES_2019\" >International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (2019) ICES Technical Guidelines: 16.3.3.3 Spatial distribution of fishing effort and physical disturbance of benthic habitats by mobile bottom trawl fishing gear using VMS. doi: 10.17895/ices.advice.4683 1 Available at https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Guidelines%20and%20Policies/16.03.03.03_Guidelines_Vessel_Monitoring_Systems_Data.pdf</ref> and the reporting and collation of fishing activity by member states into 0.5 × 0.5 degree c-squares by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) of the European Commission.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" /><ref name = \"Holmes_et_al_2018\">Holmes, S.J., Gibin, M., Scott, F., Zanzi, A., ''et al.''

Yang debuted in 1991 at the age of 22 with a song titled \"Rebecca\". \"Rebecca\" and \"Help me Cupid!\" were performed on the air, but not a big hit. His 2nd full length album was released in 1992. He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /><ref name=\"koreajoongangdaily\" /><ref name=\"yonhap\" />

He was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S. 

Active in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.

In 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". V2 meant his \"Version 2\". He was in active under the name of JIY instead of his real name, Yang Joon-il. He lied about his age and made a big change in his look.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news1.kr/articles/?3860343|title='배철수 잼' 양준일, 험난했던 인생사→신드롬에 대한 솔직 고백까지(종합)|date=2020-03-02|website=뉴스1|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years.  In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    

In 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\".

If there's any plans, I hope to live as a humble husband and dad.\" When the show hosts asked him to give a message to 20-year-old himself living 30 years ago, Yang said: \"I know nothing will happen how you want.

==Career==
When he was in [[Glendale High School (Glendale, California)|Glendale High School]] in LA, he was persuaded to make a debut as an entertainer by the late Hollywood actor [[Soon-Tek Oh|Soon-tek Oh]], who was a member to the same church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tenasia.hankyung.com/topic/article/2020012937744|title=故 오순택 누구?...양준일과 미국서 깊은 인연 {{!}} 텐아시아|last=tenasia.hankyung.com|first=Digital|date=2020-01-29|website=텐아시아 연예뉴스|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Yang was a soloist in his high school choir.

He entered [[University of Southern California]] [[USC Marshall School of Business|Marshall School of Business]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hankookilbo.com/News/Read/201912311633093457|title=[코리아타임스 뉴스] 시간여행자 양준일, 30년이 지나서야 인정받다|date=2020-01-01|website=한국일보|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> During his studies, he was selected by Lee Beom-hee, who was the famous composer of the day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.issueinfact.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=13883|title=양준일 리베카 신드롬 열풍 “역주행 아이콘 양준일 누구?”|date=2019-12-26|website=이슈인팩트|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Yang dropped out to debut as a singer in Korea in 1990.

Yang debuted in 1991 at the age of 22 with a song titled \"Rebecca\". \"Rebecca\" and \"Help me Cupid!\" were performed on the air, but not a big hit. His 2nd full length album was released in 1992. He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /><ref name=\"koreajoongangdaily\" /><ref name=\"yonhap\" />

He was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S. 

Active in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.

In 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". V2 meant his \"Version 2\". He was in active under the name of JIY instead of his real name, Yang Joon-il. He lied about his age and made a big change in his look.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news1.kr/articles/?3860343|title='배철수 잼' 양준일, 험난했던 인생사→신드롬에 대한 솔직 고백까지(종합)|date=2020-03-02|website=뉴스1|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years.  In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    

In 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\".

If there's any plans, I hope to live as a humble husband and dad.\" When the show hosts asked him to give a message to 20-year-old himself living 30 years ago, Yang said: \"I know nothing will happen how you want.

On December 25, Christmas Day, he appeared on [[JTBC Newsroom]]. He said \"It's like a dream every day\", \"I've been trying to get rid of my prejudice against myself, which is full of my mind as if I had to abandon my unhappiness before I was happy.\"  \"There are no more tears\" Yang said, adding that his powerful fandom, which claims to be a support group, is also a big boost to Yang.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.habkorea.net/celebrity-of-celebrity-yang-joon-il-syndrome-in-korea/|title=Celebrity of celebrity, Yang Joon-il Syndrome in Korea {{!}} HaB Korea.net|date=2019-12-26|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>

'''Clubul Sportiv Pandurii Lignitul Târgu Jiu''' ({{IPA-ro|ˌklubul sporˈtiv panˈdurij liɡˈnitul ˌtɨrɡu ˈʒiw}}), commonly known as '''Pandurii Târgu Jiu''', or simply as '''Pandurii''', is a [[Romania]]n professional [[Association football|football]] [[Club (organization)|club]] based in [[Târgu Jiu]], [[Gorj County]], currently playing in the [[Liga II]].

Founded in 1962,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prosport.ro/fotbal-intern/liga-1/de-50-de-ani-panduri-gorjenii-sarbatoresc-jumatate-de-secol-prin-lansarea-unei-sigle-aniversare-10228427|title=De 50 de ani \"Panduri\"!

Domestically, ''Gorjenii'' have never won any major honour, but finished as runners-up in the league at the end of the [[2012–13 Liga I|2012–13 season]] and lost a [[Cupa Ligii|League Cup]] final in [[2014–15 Cupa Ligii|2015]]. They qualified for the very first time in a European competition in 2013, playing in the [[UEFA Europa League]] and reaching the group stage.

The colors of the team are white and blue.

==History==
[[File:Pandurii Târgu Jiu League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of Pandurii Târgu Jiu in the national leagues.]]

===Founding and lower divisions (1962–2005)===
Pandurii Târgu Jiu was founded in August 1962, after the merger of the two big rivals from the town, ''Flacăra-Unirea Târgu Jiu'' and ''CIL Târgu-Jiu''. The club entered the [[Divizia D|fourth division of Romanian football]], with a strong objective, to promote immediately in the third division. And the target was reached, Pandurii gaining the promotion to [[Divizia C]] in June 1963. Their first game in this division was played on 1 September 1963, against Siderurgistul Hunedoara. Pandurii won by a big margin, 6–0, goals scored by Chițu (12'), Nelu Băloi (35'), Melinte (53', 80') and Vasilescu (83', 85').

In the first years, Pandurii finished constantly in the first half of the standings, so the club decided to attack a promotion to [[Liga II|Divizia B]]. In the 1976–77 season, with a young team and with [[Titus Ozon]] as coach, the dream came true. Pandurii dominated the competition, climbed from the first stages on top of the standings and won the promotion to the second division. But this level was a much bigger hat to wear for Pandurii, who relegated the next season back to Divizia C.

The following years, the team changed frequently the division, promoting to Divizia B and relegating after a few years. They played in Divizia B between 1979 and 1983 then between 1986 and 1991. After a decade in Divizia C, in 2000 the team promoted again in the second league, and in [[2003–04 Divizia B|2004]] finished second, behind [[FC Sportul Studențesc București|Sportul Studențesc]].

===Beginning years in the top league (2005–2011)=== 
The performance from the last seasons was an incentive for the management who decided to push for the first presence of Pandurii in [[Divizia A]]. With [[Emil Săndoi]] as coach, and with a young group of players like Tiberiu Lung and Sorin Vintilescu but also with some experienced players like, [[Florin Popete]], [[Robert Vancea]] and [[Romulus Buia]], the team won the promotion.

It was difficult to maintain its position in Divizia A, and Pandurii finished their [[2005–06 Divizia A|first season]] in the 15th place, right below the relegation line. But the [[Romanian Football Federation]] decided at the end of the season not to give [[Sportul Studențesc]] their licence for the following year, and kept instead the first team under the line, Pandurii. With the bullet dodged, the management decided to enforce the team, so the relegation shouldn't be a problem.

[[Alexandru Păcurar]], [[Ciprian Vasilache]] and [[Liviu Mihai]] were brought, and the team finished 11th in the [[2006–07 Liga I|2006–07 season]]. They kept their position at the middle of the table for the next seasons.

In [[2009–10 Liga I|2010]], they finished below the line but avoided the relegation after the withdrawal of [[FC Internațional Curtea de Argeș|Internațional Curtea de Argeș]], team that ended tenth but the owner decided to disband the club. With a lot of players from Internațional Curtea de Argeș like [[Vlad Chiricheș]], [[Mihai Pintilii]], and [[Dan Nistor]], Pandurii were 13th the [[2010–11 Liga I|following season]].

===Ascent and first European participation (2011–2013)===

In the [[2011–12 Liga I|2011–12 season]] the team reached the highest place in history, finishing seventh. For a while, they were fifth and the fans hoped for Europa League.

The [[2012–13 Liga I|following season]] saw Pandurii finishing as Liga I runners-up for the first time ever, qualifying for the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League]], the club's first ever European participation. After defeating [[FC Levadia Tallinn|Levadia Tallinn]], [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] and [[S.C. Braga|Braga]], Pandurii entered the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League group stage|Group stage]], being drawn into Group E with [[F.C. Paços de Ferreira]], [[FC Dnipro]] and [[ACF Fiorentina]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=1988014.html|title=Former winners learn group stage fates|date=30 August 2013|accessdate=|work=[[UEFA]]}}</ref>

===Achieving performance (2013–2017)===

On 10 March 2015, with [[Edward Iordănescu]] as coach Pandurii defeated [[FC Dinamo București]] in the semi-finals of the new established competition [[Cupa Ligii]], to qualify for their first ever cup final. On their way to play the final they beat one of the Romanian giants [[FC Petrolul Ploiești]] at [[Ilie Oană Stadium]]. In the final [[FC Steaua București]] beat Pandurii at [[Arena Națională]] stadium but with a controversial penalty in the beginning of the match.

In the [[2015–16 Liga I|2015–16]], season of [[Liga I]] Pandurii had many achievements along the season with the same coach and players like [[UEFA Europa League]] winner [[Cristian Săpunaru]], [[Dan Nistor]], [[Ioan Hora]] and [[Mihai Răduț]] and [[Narcis Răducan]] as president. In April 2015 they became the first team to win a match in [[Liga I]] with the new play-off, play-out system. On 6 February 2016, they secured both a place in the competition play-offs and a place in a European competition next year with a victory with [[ASA 2013 Târgu Mureș]]. During this season they had the most matches without a defeat, about 10 games. At the end of the season, Pandurii finished on the podium as third-place qualifying for the second time in UEFA Europa League, but this time in the third qualifying round.

===Back to the lower leagues (2017–present)===

Although the team had a fairly good start for the season [[2016–17 Liga I|2016–17]], with players like [[Lucian Sânmărtean]] or [[George Țucudean]] coming at the club, and playing in the summer against [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.]] in Europa League, problems occurred in the second half of the season. The main sponsor started having problems and for this reason they did not fund the team anymore. Many players have left the team so the young players from the second team where brought to the first team along with other players from elsewhere.  Unfortunately after 12 seasons in Liga 1 Pandurii relegated for the first time since the 2005 promotion but fought to avoid it until the last round.

For the [[2017–18 Liga II|2017–18]] [[Liga II]], Pandurii has been prepared with some players promoted from the second team or from the youth teams and moved to [[Motru]] until the new stadium was completed.

Founded in 1962,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prosport.ro/fotbal-intern/liga-1/de-50-de-ani-panduri-gorjenii-sarbatoresc-jumatate-de-secol-prin-lansarea-unei-sigle-aniversare-10228427|title=De 50 de ani \"Panduri\"!

Domestically, ''Gorjenii'' have never won any major honour, but finished as runners-up in the league at the end of the [[2012–13 Liga I|2012–13 season]] and lost a [[Cupa Ligii|League Cup]] final in [[2014–15 Cupa Ligii|2015]]. They qualified for the very first time in a European competition in 2013, playing in the [[UEFA Europa League]] and reaching the group stage.

The colors of the team are white and blue.

==History==
[[File:Pandurii Târgu Jiu League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of Pandurii Târgu Jiu in the national leagues.]]

===Founding and lower divisions (1962–2005)===
Pandurii Târgu Jiu was founded in August 1962, after the merger of the two big rivals from the town, ''Flacăra-Unirea Târgu Jiu'' and ''CIL Târgu-Jiu''. The club entered the [[Divizia D|fourth division of Romanian football]], with a strong objective, to promote immediately in the third division. And the target was reached, Pandurii gaining the promotion to [[Divizia C]] in June 1963. Their first game in this division was played on 1 September 1963, against Siderurgistul Hunedoara. Pandurii won by a big margin, 6–0, goals scored by Chițu (12'), Nelu Băloi (35'), Melinte (53', 80') and Vasilescu (83', 85').

In the first years, Pandurii finished constantly in the first half of the standings, so the club decided to attack a promotion to [[Liga II|Divizia B]]. In the 1976–77 season, with a young team and with [[Titus Ozon]] as coach, the dream came true. Pandurii dominated the competition, climbed from the first stages on top of the standings and won the promotion to the second division. But this level was a much bigger hat to wear for Pandurii, who relegated the next season back to Divizia C.

The following years, the team changed frequently the division, promoting to Divizia B and relegating after a few years. They played in Divizia B between 1979 and 1983 then between 1986 and 1991. After a decade in Divizia C, in 2000 the team promoted again in the second league, and in [[2003–04 Divizia B|2004]] finished second, behind [[FC Sportul Studențesc București|Sportul Studențesc]].

===Beginning years in the top league (2005–2011)=== 
The performance from the last seasons was an incentive for the management who decided to push for the first presence of Pandurii in [[Divizia A]]. With [[Emil Săndoi]] as coach, and with a young group of players like Tiberiu Lung and Sorin Vintilescu but also with some experienced players like, [[Florin Popete]], [[Robert Vancea]] and [[Romulus Buia]], the team won the promotion.

It was difficult to maintain its position in Divizia A, and Pandurii finished their [[2005–06 Divizia A|first season]] in the 15th place, right below the relegation line. But the [[Romanian Football Federation]] decided at the end of the season not to give [[Sportul Studențesc]] their licence for the following year, and kept instead the first team under the line, Pandurii. With the bullet dodged, the management decided to enforce the team, so the relegation shouldn't be a problem.

[[Alexandru Păcurar]], [[Ciprian Vasilache]] and [[Liviu Mihai]] were brought, and the team finished 11th in the [[2006–07 Liga I|2006–07 season]]. They kept their position at the middle of the table for the next seasons.

In [[2009–10 Liga I|2010]], they finished below the line but avoided the relegation after the withdrawal of [[FC Internațional Curtea de Argeș|Internațional Curtea de Argeș]], team that ended tenth but the owner decided to disband the club. With a lot of players from Internațional Curtea de Argeș like [[Vlad Chiricheș]], [[Mihai Pintilii]], and [[Dan Nistor]], Pandurii were 13th the [[2010–11 Liga I|following season]].

In the [[2011–12 Liga I|2011–12 season]] the team reached the highest place in history, finishing seventh. For a while, they were fifth and the fans hoped for Europa League.

The [[2012–13 Liga I|following season]] saw Pandurii finishing as Liga I runners-up for the first time ever, qualifying for the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League]], the club's first ever European participation. After defeating [[FC Levadia Tallinn|Levadia Tallinn]], [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] and [[S.C. Braga|Braga]], Pandurii entered the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League group stage|Group stage]], being drawn into Group E with [[F.C. Paços de Ferreira]], [[FC Dnipro]] and [[ACF Fiorentina]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=1988014.html|title=Former winners learn group stage fates|date=30 August 2013|accessdate=|work=[[UEFA]]}}</ref>

===Achieving performance (2013–2017)===

On 10 March 2015, with [[Edward Iordănescu]] as coach Pandurii defeated [[FC Dinamo București]] in the semi-finals of the new established competition [[Cupa Ligii]], to qualify for their first ever cup final. On their way to play the final they beat one of the Romanian giants [[FC Petrolul Ploiești]] at [[Ilie Oană Stadium]]. In the final [[FC Steaua București]] beat Pandurii at [[Arena Națională]] stadium but with a controversial penalty in the beginning of the match.

In the [[2015–16 Liga I|2015–16]], season of [[Liga I]] Pandurii had many achievements along the season with the same coach and players like [[UEFA Europa League]] winner [[Cristian Săpunaru]], [[Dan Nistor]], [[Ioan Hora]] and [[Mihai Răduț]] and [[Narcis Răducan]] as president. In April 2015 they became the first team to win a match in [[Liga I]] with the new play-off, play-out system. On 6 February 2016, they secured both a place in the competition play-offs and a place in a European competition next year with a victory with [[ASA 2013 Târgu Mureș]]. During this season they had the most matches without a defeat, about 10 games. At the end of the season, Pandurii finished on the podium as third-place qualifying for the second time in UEFA Europa League, but this time in the third qualifying round.

===Back to the lower leagues (2017–present)===

Although the team had a fairly good start for the season [[2016–17 Liga I|2016–17]], with players like [[Lucian Sânmărtean]] or [[George Țucudean]] coming at the club, and playing in the summer against [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.]] in Europa League, problems occurred in the second half of the season. The main sponsor started having problems and for this reason they did not fund the team anymore. Many players have left the team so the young players from the second team where brought to the first team along with other players from elsewhere.  Unfortunately after 12 seasons in Liga 1 Pandurii relegated for the first time since the 2005 promotion but fought to avoid it until the last round.

For the [[2017–18 Liga II|2017–18]] [[Liga II]], Pandurii has been prepared with some players promoted from the second team or from the youth teams and moved to [[Motru]] until the new stadium was completed.

==Government==
{{See also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |format=PDF|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains circuit and superior courts with the latter having a small claims division. Both courts have general jurisdiction with the circuit court having exclusive jurisdiction of juvenile and probate matters. The judges of each court are elected to a six (6) year term and must be admitted to practice law before the state supreme court. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including prosecuting attorney, assessor, [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]] Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

''Jens looked at a map he'd filched from an abandoned gas station.  If he was where he thought he was, he'd soon be approaching the grand metropolis of Fiat, by God, Indiana.  He managed a smile when he saw that, and declaimed, \"And God said,'' Fiat, Indiana, ''and there was Indiana.\"''

--[[Harry Turtledove]], ''Worldwar: In the Balance'', New York:Random House (1994), Chapter 14, copyright 1994 by Harry Turtledove.  The reference is to the unincorporated town of Fiat near the intersection of Indiana State Routes 1 and 18 in Jay County.

==Government==
{{See also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |format=PDF|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains circuit and superior courts with the latter having a small claims division. Both courts have general jurisdiction with the circuit court having exclusive jurisdiction of juvenile and probate matters. The judges of each court are elected to a six (6) year term and must be admitted to practice law before the state supreme court. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including prosecuting attorney, assessor, [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]] Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

==History==
There is no mention in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of a settlement where the current town is. There is little mention of the town until the 15th century when the population had risen enough for a [[chapel of ease]] to be built.<ref name=\"History\"/> The settlement was first recorded in 1307 as having a marketplace.<ref name=\"Hawes - Yorkshire Dales\"/>

The place's name is derived from the [[Old Norse]] word ''hals'', meaning \"neck\" or \"pass between mountains\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Watts|title=Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-names|page=288|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0521168557}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=A.D. Mills|title=Dictionary of English Place-Names|page=233|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|year=1998|isbn=978-0192800749}}</ref>

The town was granted a charter to hold markets by [[William III of England|King William III]] in 1699. It allowed for a weekly Tuesday market and two fairs a year. In 1887 an auction market was established in the town that held cattle sales fortnightly. In addition, five cattle fairs and three sheep fairs were held each year. Soon after, four cheese fairs spread over the year also became a regular event in the town.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64744|title=History|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Bulmers\">{{cite book|title=Bulmer's Topography, History and Directory (Private and Commercial) of North Yorkshire 1890|pages=343–345|year=1890|publisher= S&N Publishing|isbn=1-86150-299-0}}</ref>

Just south of Hawes, the 18th century Gayle Mill is now a Grade II listed building, a scheduled monument.  In 2004, it was featured in [[BBC2]]'s [[Restoration (TV series)|Restoration]] programme.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> It came in the top three in the national finals. Restoration of the mill started in the same year and works to bring the site to operational standard took four years and cost over £1m.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/news/2136871.joy_as_historic_mill_reopens_after_1m_restoration/ |title=Joy as historic mill reopens after £1m restoration |work= Darlington and Stockton Times|date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> Although it was still open to visitors during the 2017 tourist season, the Gayle Mill Trust that operates the attraction was advised by the North of England Civic Trust in early 2018 that the mill would need to be closed. Work would be necessary to remedy problems discovered since the restoration in order to ensure safety and to comply with insurance regulations. The site was vacated in March 2018. The Civic Trust was hoping that the work could be completed in time to reopen it at Easter 2019.

===Saving village services===
The only petrol station at Hawes was expected to close in 2017 due to falling sales, and the next nearest re-fuelling station involved a {{convert|36|mi|0|adj=on}} round trip. A non-profit community group, the Upper Dales Community Partnership (UDCP), took a three-year lease on the station October 2017 after [[North Yorkshire County Council]] awarded a grant to the community grant. The Dale Head Garage is so remote that the town receives a £0.05 rebate from the government on every litre of fuel sold. This benefit is passed on directly to consumers at the pump.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Copeland|first1=Alexa|title=Town takes over filling station to guarantee fuel|work=Darlington and Stockton Times|issue=41-2017|date=13 October 2017|page=1|issn=2040-3933}}</ref> A grant in May 2018 from the
Richmondshire District Council’s Economic Growth Fund enabled the petrol station to remain open 24 hours a day.<ref name=\"Round the clock fuel in Dales\">{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/environment/round-the-clock-fuel-in-dales-1-9179729|title=Round the clock fuel in Dales|work=Yorkshire Post|date=26 May 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}</ref> 
 
In previous years, UDCP had also taken over the library and the post office. In February 2018 however, Royal Mail announced that the sorting department in the village would close. In addition to the loss of jobs, the plan would have meant that residents would be required to drive 30 minutes to Leyburn to pick up packages. Lobbying by village residents convinced the Post Office to cancel its plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/our-region/west-yorkshire-and-the-dales/reprieve-for-hawes-sorting-office-as-post-office-says-no-to-royal-mail-closure-proposal-1-9035984|title=Reprieve for Hawes sorting office as Post Office says no to Royal Mail closure proposal|work=Yorkshire Post|date=14 February 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}</ref>

The Partnership also started a bus service in 2011 when the previous service ceased operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawescommunityoffice.co.uk/resources/Readers%20Digest%20Hawes.compressed.pdf|title=The Village that Refused to Die|work=Readers Digest|date=May 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}</ref> The Little White Bus has 11 vehicles and transports 60,000 visitors per year. After the police station was shut down, the constables were given a room in the community group's office which houses the Post Office and Library, and also offers free Wi-Fi, a coffee machine and a scanner/printer for use by residents. In 2018, the Partnership was considering a plan to start a Land Trust that would build four new houses and rent them to low-income families with children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawescommunityoffice.co.uk/resources/Readers%20Digest%20Hawes.compressed.pdf|title=The Village that Refused to Die|work=Readers Digest|date=May 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}</ref>

Formed over 20 years ago, the  Partnership has 25 paid staff and 60 volunteers (May 2018).<ref name=\"Round the clock fuel in Dales\"/> In 2017, the head of the non-profit group explained the original concept to ''[[The Times]]''. Unlike other communities which ask, \"Why isn't the government providing for us?\", the philosophy at Hawes has been, \"If you aren't going to provide for us we are going to provide it for ourselves\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5073199/Self-sufficient-Yorkshire-village-overtakes-petrol-station.html|title=Self-sufficient Yorkshire village takes over petrol station|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref>

==History==
There is no mention in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of a settlement where the current town is. There is little mention of the town until the 15th century when the population had risen enough for a [[chapel of ease]] to be built.<ref name=\"History\"/> The settlement was first recorded in 1307 as having a marketplace.<ref name=\"Hawes - Yorkshire Dales\"/>

The place's name is derived from the [[Old Norse]] word ''hals'', meaning \"neck\" or \"pass between mountains\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Watts|title=Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-names|page=288|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0521168557}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=A.D. Mills|title=Dictionary of English Place-Names|page=233|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|year=1998|isbn=978-0192800749}}</ref>

The town was granted a charter to hold markets by [[William III of England|King William III]] in 1699. It allowed for a weekly Tuesday market and two fairs a year. In 1887 an auction market was established in the town that held cattle sales fortnightly. In addition, five cattle fairs and three sheep fairs were held each year. Soon after, four cheese fairs spread over the year also became a regular event in the town.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64744|title=History|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Bulmers\">{{cite book|title=Bulmer's Topography, History and Directory (Private and Commercial) of North Yorkshire 1890|pages=343–345|year=1890|publisher= S&N Publishing|isbn=1-86150-299-0}}</ref>

The [[Richmond to Lancaster Turnpike]] was diverted in 1795 and from then on, it passed through Hawes. The Wensleydale Railway reached Hawes in 1878.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wensleydale.org/Wensleydale/LocalHistory.aspx|title=Wensleydale - Local History|first=|last=|publisher=Wensleydale|accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref> The village once had a [[Hawes railway station|railway station]] that was the terminus of the Hawes branch of the [[Midland Railway]] and an end-on terminus of the line from Northallerton from its opening in 1878 to its closure in April 1954. British Railways kept the line to Garsdale Junction open for passengers until 1959.

In the past, a water powered mill operated at Gayle and in Hawes; the [[Gayle Mill, North Yorkshire]], for example, was built in 1784.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gaylemill.org.uk/about-gayle-mill|publisher=Gayle Mill Trust |title= About Gayle Mill|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref> The mills were used to grind corn, produce textiles (wool, cotton, linen, silk, flax), generate electricity or saw wood.

The latter flows through the town of Hawes. There are many abandoned lead mines, quarries and limekilns in the parish indicating its industrial past. A short distance from the town on Gayle Beck are the Aysgill Force waterfalls. The highest point in the parish is Great Knoutberry Hill at {{convert|2205|ft}}. The parish extends as far north as Hellgill Bridge along a narrow strip either side of the Ure.<ref name=\"Survey\"/>

The civil parish of Hawes also includes the neighbouring [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] of [[Gayle, North Yorkshire|Gayle]], [[Appersett]] and [[Burtersett]]. The [[A684 road]] from [[Sedbergh]] to [[Osmotherley, North Yorkshire|Osmotherley]] passes through the town and the [[B6255 road|B6255]] begins at the western edge of the town and links it to [[Ingleton, North Yorkshire|Ingleton]].<ref name=\"Survey\"/>

The M6 and the A1 to the east are under an hour away by car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairview-hawes.co.uk/local-attractions/|title=Hawes, Wensleydale, Yorkshire Dales, North Yorkshire - tourist information and attractions|website=www.fairview-hawes.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref>

Just south of Hawes, the 18th century Gayle Mill is now a Grade II listed building, a scheduled monument.  In 2004, it was featured in [[BBC2]]'s [[Restoration (TV series)|Restoration]] programme.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> It came in the top three in the national finals. Restoration of the mill started in the same year and works to bring the site to operational standard took four years and cost over £1m.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/news/2136871.joy_as_historic_mill_reopens_after_1m_restoration/ |title=Joy as historic mill reopens after £1m restoration |work= Darlington and Stockton Times|date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> Although it was still open to visitors during the 2017 tourist season, the Gayle Mill Trust that operates the attraction was advised by the North of England Civic Trust in early 2018 that the mill would need to be closed.

The Civic Trust was hoping that the work could be completed in time to reopen it at Easter 2019.

===Saving village services===
The only petrol station at Hawes was expected to close in 2017 due to falling sales, and the next nearest re-fuelling station involved a {{convert|36|mi|0|adj=on}} round trip. A non-profit community group, the Upper Dales Community Partnership (UDCP), took a three-year lease on the station October 2017 after [[North Yorkshire County Council]] awarded a grant to the community grant. The Dale Head Garage is so remote that the town receives a £0.05 rebate from the government on every litre of fuel sold. This benefit is passed on directly to consumers at the pump.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Copeland|first1=Alexa|title=Town takes over filling station to guarantee fuel|work=Darlington and Stockton Times|issue=41-2017|date=13 October 2017|page=1|issn=2040-3933}}</ref> A grant in May 2018 from the
Richmondshire District Council’s Economic Growth Fund enabled the petrol station to remain open 24 hours a day.<ref name=\"Round the clock fuel in Dales\">{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/environment/round-the-clock-fuel-in-dales-1-9179729|title=Round the clock fuel in Dales|work=Yorkshire Post|date=26 May 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}</ref> 
 
In previous years, UDCP had also taken over the library and the post office. In February 2018 however, Royal Mail announced that the sorting department in the village would close. In addition to the loss of jobs, the plan would have meant that residents would be required to drive 30 minutes to Leyburn to pick up packages. Lobbying by village residents convinced the Post Office to cancel its plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/our-region/west-yorkshire-and-the-dales/reprieve-for-hawes-sorting-office-as-post-office-says-no-to-royal-mail-closure-proposal-1-9035984|title=Reprieve for Hawes sorting office as Post Office says no to Royal Mail closure proposal|work=Yorkshire Post|date=14 February 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}</ref>

The Partnership also started a bus service in 2011 when the previous service ceased operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawescommunityoffice.co.uk/resources/Readers%20Digest%20Hawes.compressed.pdf|title=The Village that Refused to Die|work=Readers Digest|date=May 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}</ref> The Little White Bus has 11 vehicles and transports 60,000 visitors per year. After the police station was shut down, the constables were given a room in the community group's office which houses the Post Office and Library, and also offers free Wi-Fi, a coffee machine and a scanner/printer for use by residents. In 2018, the Partnership was considering a plan to start a Land Trust that would build four new houses and rent them to low-income families with children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawescommunityoffice.co.uk/resources/Readers%20Digest%20Hawes.compressed.pdf|title=The Village that Refused to Die|work=Readers Digest|date=May 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}</ref>

Formed over 20 years ago, the  Partnership has 25 paid staff and 60 volunteers (May 2018).<ref name=\"Round the clock fuel in Dales\"/> In 2017, the head of the non-profit group explained the original concept to ''[[The Times]]''. Unlike other communities which ask, \"Why isn't the government providing for us?\", the philosophy at Hawes has been, \"If you aren't going to provide for us we are going to provide it for ourselves\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5073199/Self-sufficient-Yorkshire-village-overtakes-petrol-station.html|title=Self-sufficient Yorkshire village takes over petrol station|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref>

:''This article is about the ancient site and holy tree north of historical Hebron. For the Russian Orthodox monastery at Hebron and the ancient tree within, see [[Abraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery]] and [[Oak of Mamre]]''

'''Mamre''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|m|r|i}}; {{lang-he-n|מַמְרֵא}}), full Hebrew name ''Elonei Mamre'' (\"Oaks/[[Pistacia palaestina|Terebinth]]s of Mamre\"), refers to an ancient [[religion|cultic]] [[shrine]] originally focused on a single holy tree, growing since times immemorial at Hebron in Canaan.<ref name=\"Niesiolowski-Spano\" >Lukasz Niesiolowski-Spano,   [https://books.google.com/books?id=y7fsCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA132  'The Origin Myths and Holy Places in the Old Testament: A Study of Aetiological Narratives''], Routledge, 2016 p.132.</ref> [[Talmud]]ic sources refer to the site as ''Beth Ilanim'' or ''Botnah'', where it was one of the three most important \"fairs\", or market places, in [[Judea]]. Mamre lies approximately halfway between [[Halhul]] and historical [[Hebron]], 4 kilometres north of the latter.

==Hebrew Bible==
===Names and events===
Mamre is the site where [[Abraham]] pitched the tents for his camp, built an [[altar]] ({{bibleref2|Genesis 13:18}}), and was brought divine tidings, in the guise of three angels, of [[Sarah]]'s pregnancy ({{bibleref2|Genesis 18:1-15}}).

Genesis 13:18 has Abraham settling by 'the great trees of Mamre'. The original Hebrew tradition appears, to judge from a textual variation conserved in the [[Septuagint]], to have referred to a single great oak tree, which Josephus called [[Ogyges]].<ref name=\"Niesiolowski-Spano\" /> Mamre may have been an [[Amorites|Amorite]], a tribal chieftain after whom a grove of trees was named. Genesis connected it with Hebron or a place nearby that city.<ref name=Pagolu>Pagolu, Augustine,[https://books.google.com/books?id=vRolnGU5KvAC&pg=PA59 ''The Religion of the Patriarchs''], A&C Black, 1998, pp.59-60.</ref> Mamre has frequently been associated with the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]. According to one scholar, there is considerable confusion in the Biblical narrative concerning not only Mamre, but also Machpelah, Hebron and [[Kiryat Arba]], all four of which are aligned repeatedly.<ref>Francesca Stavrakopoulou, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vbaoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA51 ''Land of Our Fathers: The Roles of Ancestor Veneration in Biblical Land Claims,''] Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2011 pp.51-52 :'Throughout Genesis, all these toponyms crowd the ancestral burial site, jostling for recognition. Though it is often assumed these were all essentially the same place, the aligning, glossing or renaming of locations is frequently suggestive of changing or competing claims to ownership.'</ref> In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Mamre is also identified with Hebron itself ({{bibleref2|Genesis 23:19, 25:27}}).<ref>Jericke, Detlef (2003) ''Abraham in Mamre: Historische und exegetische Studien zur Region von Hebron'' BRILL, {{ISBN|90-04-12939-1}} p.4: Book of Genesis, 23:19;25:27.</ref><ref>[[Robert Letellier|Letellier, Robert Ignatius]] (1995) ''Day in Mamre, Night in Sodom: Abraham and Lot in Genesis 18 and 19'' BRILL, {{ISBN|90-04-10250-7}}</ref> The Christian tradition of identifying a ruined site surrounded by walls and called in Arabic ''Rāmet el-Ḥalīl'' ('Hill of the Friend', meaning: \"the friend of God\", i.e. Abraham), with the Old Testament Mamre, goes back to the earliest Christian pilgrims in the 4th century CE, and connect to a tradition from the time of Herod (1st century BCE).<ref>Jericke p.1.</ref>

Elsewhere ({{bibleref2|Genesis 14:13}})<ref>David M. Gitlitz & Linda Kay Davidson, ''Pilgrimage and the Jews'' (Westport: CT: Praeger, 2006).</ref> it is called 'the [[Terebinth]]s of Mamre the Amorite'.<ref>Robert Alter, (tr.) ''Genesis'', W.W.Norton & Co. āāNew York, London 1996 p.60</ref><ref>Horne, Thomas Hartwell (1856) ''An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures'' Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts, p 63</ref> Mamre being the name of one of the three Amorite chiefs who joined forces with those of Abraham in pursuit of [[Chedorlaomer]] to save [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] (Gen. 14:13,24).<ref>Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard (1998) ''Mercer Dictionary of the Bible'' Mercer University Press, {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} p 543</ref><ref>Haran, Menahem (1985) ''Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel: An Inquiry Into Biblical Cult Phenomena and the Historical Setting of the Priestly School'' Eisenbrauns, {{ISBN|0-931464-18-8}} p 53</ref>

The supposed discrepancy is often explained as reflecting the discordance between the different scribal traditions behind the composition of the [[Pentateuch]], the former relating to the [[Yahwist]], the latter to the [[Elohist]] [[recension]], according to the [[documentary hypothesis]] of modern scholarship.<ref>Menahem Haran,''Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel: An Inquiry Into Biblical Cult Phenomena and the Historical Setting of the Priestly School'', Eisenbrauns, 1985 p.53. The third, Priestly recension excludes any such attachment of Abraham to the Terebinth cult.</ref>

==Identification==
'''Ramat el-Khalil''' is the site identified as Mamre in the time of King Herod (1st century BCE), Constantine the Great (3rd century CE), and possibly the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] (12th-13th centuries CE).

'''Khirbet es-Sibte''' (also '''Ain Sebta'''), the present-day site of the so-called [[Oak of Mamre]], two kilometres southwest of Ramat el-Khalil, has been considered since the 19th century as the place where Abraham pitched his tents and saw the angels.<ref>Jericke p.2.</ref>

The archaeological site of Mamre (Ramat el-Khalil, Grid Ref. 160300/107200) has been first excavated by [[:de|Andreas Evaristus Mader]] in 1926-28, followed by Sayf al-Din Haddad (1977), 'Abd el-Aziz Arjub (1984-85),<ref name=Greenberg/> and Yitzhak Magen (1986-88),<ref name=\"Langfur\"/> Magen publishing his findings in 1991 and 2003.<ref name=Greenberg/> The outstanding components of the site are a large Roman-era enclosure, a Byzantine church, and a Crusader church.<ref name=Greenberg/> The main periods of settlement are: Early Roman, Late Roman, Byzantine, and Crusader, with less substantial findings from the Iron Age IIc and the Hellenistic period.<ref name=Greenberg>{{cite book |first1= Raphael |last1= Greenberg |first2= Adi |last2= Keinan |title= Israeli Archaeological Activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem 1967-2007: A Sourcebook |publisher= Ostracon Press |year= 2009 |page= 130 |isbn= 978-965-91468-0-2 |url= http://alt-arch.org/he/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/WBADB_sourcebook1.pdf |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> Archaeological excavation by Yitzhak Magen indicate that findings previously attributed to the biblical time of the [[Kings of Judea|Kings]] during the Iron Age, and the Hellenistic [[Hasmonean]]s, are in fact of far newer date, [[Byzantine]] or later.<ref name=Kristensen>{{cite book |first= Vlastimil |last= Drbal |title= Pilgrimage and multi-religious worship: Palestinian Mamre in Late Antiquity |editor-first1= Troels Myrup |editor-last1= Kristensen |editor-first2= Wiebke |editor-last2= Friese |work= Excavating Pilgrimage: Archaeological Approaches to Sacred Travel and Movement in the Ancient World |publisher= Taylor & Francis |series= Routledge Studies in Pilgrimage, Religious Travel and Tourism |year= 2017 |page= 245-264 (247) |isbn= 9781351856263 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AUElDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA247 |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Bronze Age===
[[Bronze Age]] pottery shards found at the Ramat el-Khalil site may indicate that the cultic shrine was in use from 2600-2000 BCE,<ref name=\"JETCHP\"/> though there is no archaeological evidence for the site being occupied from the first half of the second millennium down to the end of the Iron Age.<ref name=Pagolu/>

===Herod: the enclosure===
The 2&nbsp;m thick stone wall enclosing area 49&nbsp;m wide and 65&nbsp;m long was constructed by [[Herod the Great]], possibly as a cultic place of worship.<ref>[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor|Murphy-O'Connor, Jerome]] (2008) ''The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700'' Oxford University Press US, {{ISBN|0-19-923666-6}} p 370</ref><ref>Robinson, Edward (1856) ''Biblical Researches in Palestine, 1838-52: A Journal of Travels in the Year 1838'' pp 215-216</ref> It contained an ancient well, more than 5&nbsp;m in diameter, referred to as Abraham's Well.<ref>Jericke p.?.</ref><ref>[[Robert Letellier|Letellier, Robert Ignatius]] (1995) ''Day in Mamre, Night in Sodom: Abraham and Lot in Genesis 18 and 19'' BRILL, {{ISBN|90-04-10250-7}}</ref>

According to Jericke among others, Persian and Hellenistic Mamre was located at nearby Khirbet Nimra, 1 km north of modern Hebron, where a pagan tree cult predated the composition of the biblical Abraham narrative.<ref name=Heyden2016>{{cite book |first= Katharina |last= Heyden |title= Hain der Religionen: Das Abrahamsheiligtum von Mamre als Begegnungsort und locus theologicus |work= Fremdenliebe – Fremdenangst: Zwei akademische Reden zur interreligiösen Begegnungin Spätantike und Gegenwart |publisher= Theologischer Verlag Zürich (TVZ) |year= 2016 |page= 21 (with footnote 10) |lang= German |isbn= 9783290178635 }}</ref> Herod transferred the Mamre tradition 2,5 km to the north, from the site at Khirbet Nimra to the site at Ramet el-Khalil.<ref name=Heyden2016/> This was part of Herod's upgrade of Hebron as a cult centre dedicated to patriarch Abraham, by erecting two shrines: one at [[Machpela Cave|his tomb]], and one at a site he connected to Abraham's place of residence, where the patriarch dined under a tree together with the three men.<ref name=Heyden2016/> It has been noted that Hebron and Mamre were located in Idumaean territory, that both Jews and Idumaeans regarded Abraham as their common ancestor, and that Herod came from an Idumaean family that had only recently converted to Judaism.<ref name=>{{cite book |first= Peter |last= Richardson |title= Herod: king of the Jews and friend of the Romans |publisher= University of South Carolina Press |series= Studies on personalities of the New Testament |year= 1996 |pages= 61-62 |isbn= 9781570031366 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MWTakr1BbvkC&pg=PA61 |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Josephus: the terebinth===
:'''''Josephus' terebinth tree is distinct from the modern [[Oak of Mamre]] and stands at a different location'''''
[[Josephus]] (37–c. 100) records a tradition according to which the terebinth at Mamre was as old as the world itself (''[[The Jewish War|War]]'' 4.534). The site was soaked in legend. Jews, Christians and Pagans made sacrifices on the site, burning animals, and the tree was considered immune to the flames of the sacrifices.<ref name=\"Adler\">William Adler, The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy, in Natalie B. Dohrmann, Annette Yoshiko Reed  (eds.)

===Late Roman period: Hadrian's temple===
The Herodian structure was destroyed by [[Simon bar Kokhba]]'s army, only to be rebuilt by the [[Roman emperor]] [[Hadrian]]. Hadrian revived the fair, which had long been an important one as it took place at an intersection forming the transport and communications nub of the southern [[Judea]]n mountains. This ''[[wikt:mercatus|mercatus]]'' (Heb. ''yerid'' or ''shuq'': {{lang-grc|[[wikt:πανήγυρις|πανήγυρις]]}}) or \"fair, market\" was one of the sites, according to a Jewish tradition conserved in [[Jerome]],<ref name=\"Adler\">William Adler, The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy, in Natalie B. Dohrmann, Annette Yoshiko Reed  (eds.)

===Rabbinical tradition===
Due to the [[idolatry|idolatrous]] nature of the rituals at the fair, Jews were forbidden to participate by their [[rabbi]]s.<ref name=\"ZS ERP\">Safrai, Zeev (1994) ''The Economy of Roman Palestine'', Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-10243-X}} p 254</ref> According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]:<ref name=\"Adler\" />

===Byzantine Christian rule===
Notwithstanding the rabbinic ban, by the time of [[Constantine the Great]]'s reign (302–337), the market had become an informal interdenominational festival, in addition to its functions as a trade fair, frequented by Christians, Jews and pagans. The cultic shrine was made over for Christian use after [[Eutropia]], Constantine's mother-in-law, visited it and was scandalised by its pagan character.<ref name=\"Safrai\"/> Constantine, informed of these pagan practices, attempted without success to put an end to the festive rituals celebrated around the tree.<ref name=\"Adler\"/> He ordered the ''[[comes]]'' Acacius to destroy all pagan idols and banned the pagan practices.<ref>''Life of Constantine'' By Eusebius, Translated by Averil Cameron, Stuart George Hall Oxford University Press, (1999) {{ISBN|0-19-814917-4}} p 301</ref> The enclosure was then consecrated, Constantine had a [[basilica]] built, dedicated to [[Saint George]] and the enclosure of the [[Terebinth]] of Mamre roofed over, the foundations of which are still visible.<ref name=\"ZS ERP\"/><ref>Fergusson, James (2004) ''Tree and Serpent Worship Or Illustrations of Mythology and Arts in India: In the 1st and 4th Century After Christ'' Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|81-206-1236-1}} p 7</ref>

The 1957 plan and reconstruction of the site made after the excavation performed by German scholar A. E. Mader in 1926-1928, shows the Constantinian basilica along the eastern wall of the ''Haram Ramet el-Khalil'' enclosure, with a well, altar, and tree in the unroofed western part of the enclosure.<ref name=\"ChrRex\"/><ref name=quondam>[http://www.quondam.com/82/8281.htm Itzhaq Magen, ''The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land'', Jerusalem 1993, via www.quondam.com]</ref>{{dubious|How was the 20th c. excavation plan showing the long-gone tree?

The fifth-century account by [[Sozomen]] (''Historia Ecclesiastica'' Book II 4-54) is the most detailed account of the practices at Mamre during the early Christian period.<ref name=\"JETCHP\"/>
{{quote|The place is presently called the Terebinth, and is situated at the distance of fifteen stadia from Hebron, ... . There every year a very famous festival is held in the summer time, by people of the neighbourhood as well as by the inhabitants of more distant parts of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and by [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Arabia Petraea|Arabian]]s. Very many go there for the sake of business, some to sell and some to buy. The feast is celebrated by a very big congregation of Jews, since they boast of Abraham as their forefather, of heathens since angels came there, of Christians since he who should be born from the Virgin for the salvation of humankind appeared there to that pious man. Everyone venerates this place according to his religion: some praying God the ruler of all, some calling upon the angels and offering libations of wine, burning incense or sacrificing an ox, a goat, a sheep or a cock... Constantine's mother in law (Euthropia), having gone there to fulfill a vow, gave notice of all this to the Emperor. So he wrote to the bishops of Palestine reproaching them for having forgot their mission and permitted such a most holy place to be defiled by those [[libation]]s and sacrifices.'<ref>Frazer, James George (2003) Folklore in the Old Testament Studies in Comparative Religion Legend and Law: Studies in Comparative Religion, Legend, and Law Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7661-3238-2}} p 336</ref>}}

[[Antoninus of Piacenza (pilgrim)|Antoninus of Piacenza]] in his ''Itinerarium'', an account of his journey to the Holy Land (ca.570 CE) comments on the basilica, with its four porticoes, and an unroofed [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. Both Christians and Jews worshipped there, separated by a small screen (''cancellus''). The Jewish worshippers would flock there to celebrate the deposition of Jacob and David on the day after the traditional date of Christ's birthday.<ref>Andrew S. Jacobs, ''Remains of the Jews: The Holy Land and Christian Empire in Late Antiquity,'' Stanford University Press, 2004 p.130.</ref>

[[Arculf]], a Frankish bishop who toured the Levant in around 680, writes, indicating a slightly erroneous location in relation to the Tombs of the Patriarchs:	
<blockquote>''A mile to the north of [[Cave of Machpelah|the Tombs]] that have been described above, is the very grassy and flowery hill of Mambre, looking towards Hebron, which lies to the south of it. This little mountain, which is called Mambre, has a level summit, at the north side of which a great stone church has been built, in the right side of which between the two walls of this great Basilica, the Oak of Mambre, wonderful to relate, stands rooted in the earth; it is also called the oak of Abraham, because under it he once hospitably received the Angels. St. Hieronymus elsewhere relates, that this tree had existed from the beginning of the world to the reign of the Emperor Constantine; but he did not say that it had utterly perished, perhaps because at that time, although the whole of that vast tree was not to be seen as it had been formerly, yet a spurious trunk still remained rooted in the ground, protected under the roof of the church, of the height of two men; from this wasted spurious trunk, which has been cut on all sides by axes, small chips are carried to the different provinces of the world, on account of the veneration and memory of that oak, under which, as has been mentioned above, that famous and notable visit of the Angels was granted to the patriarch Abraham.'' <ref name=\"PPTS\">{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti03paleuoft#page/n57/mode/2up/search/hebron |title=The Pilgrimage of Arculfus in the Holy Land (About the Year A.D. 670) |author=Arculf |website=archive.org |publisher=[[Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society]] |location=London |date=1895 |pages=33–34 |access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref></blockquote>

A vignette of the Constantinian basilica with its colonnaded atrium appears on the 6th-century [[Madaba Map]], under the partially preserved Greek caption \"Arbo, also the Terebinth. The Oak of Mambre\".<ref name=\"ChrRex\">[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/078discuss.html Franciscan cyberspot] {{Webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180306212118/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/078discuss.html |date=2018-03-06 }} ''Arbo, also the Terebinth. The Oak of Mambre - (Ramat al-Khalil)''</ref>

===Early Muslim period===
The [[monastery]] on the site continued after [[Umar]]'s conquest.<ref>Adamnanus, ''De Locis Sanctis,'' 11, 11. 6, CCSL 175, 211.</ref>

===Crusader period===

===After mid-12th century: new locations===
The last clear identification and description of the Byzantine church remains at Ramat el-Khalil come from the Russian pilgrim known as [[Abbot Daniel]] (1106/8).<ref name=\"NegevGibson\"/> After the middle of the 12th century the reports become vague and the location of \"Abraham's Oak\" seems to have migrated to one or more locations situated on the road connecting Ramat el-Khalil with Hebron.<ref name=\"NegevGibson\"/> What is nowadays considered the traditional location of the Oak of Abraham is a site originally known in Arabic as Ain Sebta,<ref name=\"NegevGibson\">{{cite book |work=Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land |title=Mamre (Plain of), and Ramat el-Khalil |author=Avraham Negev and Shimon Gibson |year=2001 |location=New York and London |publisher=Continuum |pages=312–313, 427–428 |isbn=0-8264-1316-1 }}</ref> which used to be outside historical Hebron but is now within the urban sprawl of the Palestinian city.

As written in a footnote from an 1895 publication of Arculf's pilgrimage report, \"[t]he Oak or Terebinth of Abraham has been shown in two different sites. Arculf and many others (Jerome, [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Itin[erarium] Hierosol[ymitanum]]], Sozomen, Eucherius [possibly [[Eucherius of Lyon]]], [[Benjamin of Tudela]], the Abbot Daniel,.... etc.) seem to point to the ruin of er Râmeh, near which is Beit el Khulil, or Abraham's House, with a fine spring well. This is still held by the Jews to be the Oak of Mamre. The Christians point to another site, [[Oak of Mamre|Ballûtet Sebta]], where is a fine specimen of Sindian ([[Quercus pseudococcifera|Quercus Pseudococcifera]]).\"<ref name=\"PPTS\"/> ''Ballut'' is the Arabic word for oak.

==Today==
The Palestinian authorities have made the site accessible to visitors under the name Haram Ramat Al Khalil.<ref name=haram>[http://visitpalestine.ps/where-to-go/listing/hebron/sites-attractions-hebron/archeological-sites-hebron/mamre-haram-ramat-al-khalil/ Mamre (Haram Ramat Al Khalil)], visit Palestine.com, retrieved 13 April 2020</ref>

'''Mamre''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|m|r|i}}; {{lang-he-n|מַמְרֵא}}), full Hebrew name ''Elonei Mamre'' (\"Oaks/[[Pistacia palaestina|Terebinth]]s of Mamre\"), refers to an ancient [[religion|cultic]] [[shrine]] originally focused on a single holy tree, growing since times immemorial at Hebron in Canaan.<ref name=\"Niesiolowski-Spano\" >Lukasz Niesiolowski-Spano,   [https://books.google.com/books?id=y7fsCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA132  'The Origin Myths and Holy Places in the Old Testament: A Study of Aetiological Narratives''], Routledge, 2016 p.132.</ref> [[Talmud]]ic sources refer to the site as ''Beth Ilanim'' or ''Botnah'', where it was one of the three most important \"fairs\", or market places, in [[Judea]].

==Hebrew Bible==
===Names and events===
Mamre is the site where [[Abraham]] pitched the tents for his camp, built an [[altar]] ({{bibleref2|Genesis 13:18}}), and was brought divine tidings, in the guise of three angels, of [[Sarah]]'s pregnancy ({{bibleref2|Genesis 18:1-15}}).

Genesis 13:18 has Abraham settling by 'the great trees of Mamre'. The original Hebrew tradition appears, to judge from a textual variation conserved in the [[Septuagint]], to have referred to a single great oak tree, which Josephus called [[Ogyges]].<ref name=\"Niesiolowski-Spano\" /> Mamre may have been an [[Amorites|Amorite]], a tribal chieftain after whom a grove of trees was named. Genesis connected it with Hebron or a place nearby that city.<ref name =\"Pagolu\">Augustine Pagolu,[https://books.google.com/books?id=vRolnGU5KvAC&pg=PA59 ''The Religion of the Patriarchs,''] A&C Black, 1998 pp.59-60.</ref> Mamre has frequently been associated with the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]. According to one scholar, there is considerable confusion in the Biblical narrative concerning not only Mamre, but also Machpelah, Hebron and [[Kiryat Arba]], all four of which are aligned repeatedly.<ref>Francesca Stavrakopoulou, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vbaoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA51 ''Land of Our Fathers: The Roles of Ancestor Veneration in Biblical Land Claims,''] Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2011 pp.51-52 :'Throughout Genesis, all these toponyms crowd the ancestral burial site, jostling for recognition. Though it is often assumed these were all essentially the same place, the aligning, glossing or renaming of locations is frequently suggestive of changing or competing claims to ownership.'</ref> In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Mamre is also identified with Hebron itself ({{bibleref2|Genesis 23:19, 25:27}}).<ref>Jericke, Detlef (2003) ''Abraham in Mamre: Historische und exegetische Studien zur Region von Hebron'' BRILL, {{ISBN|90-04-12939-1}} p.4: Book of Genesis, 23:19;25:27.</ref><ref>[[Robert Letellier|Letellier, Robert Ignatius]] (1995) ''Day in Mamre, Night in Sodom: Abraham and Lot in Genesis 18 and 19'' BRILL, {{ISBN|90-04-10250-7}}</ref> The Christian tradition of identifying a ruined site surrounded by walls and called in Arabic ''Rāmet el-Ḥalīl'' ('Hill of the Friend', meaning: \"the friend of God\", i.e. Abraham), with the Old Testament Mamre, goes back to the earliest Christian pilgrims in the 4th century CE, and connect to a tradition from the time of Herod (1st century BCE).<ref>Jericke p.1.</ref>

The supposed discrepancy is often explained as reflecting the discordance between the different scribal traditions behind the composition of the [[Pentateuch]], the former relating to the [[Yahwist]], the latter to the [[Elohist]] [[recension]], according to the [[documentary hypothesis]] of modern scholarship.<ref>Menahem Haran,''Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel: An Inquiry Into Biblical Cult Phenomena and the Historical Setting of the Priestly School'', Eisenbrauns, 1985 p.53.

==Identification==
'''Ramat el-Khalil''' is the site identified as Mamre in the time of King Herod (1st century BCE), Constantine the Great (3rd century CE), and possibly the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] (12th-13th centuries CE).

'''Khirbet es-Sibte''' (also '''Ain Sebta'''), the present-day site of the so-called [[Oak of Mamre]], two kilometres southwest of Ramat el-Khalil, has been considered since the 19th century as the place where Abraham pitched his tents and saw the angels.<ref>Jericke p.2.</ref>

==History and archaeology==
===Main findings===
The archaeological site of Mamre (Ramat el-Khalil, Grid Ref. 160300/107200) has been first excavated by [[:de|Andreas Evaristus Mader]] in 1926-28, followed by Sayf al-Din Haddad (1977), 'Abd el-Aziz Arjub (1984-85),<ref name=Greenberg/> and Yitzhak Magen (1986-88),<ref name=\"Langfur\"/> Magen publishing his findings in 1991 and 2003.<ref name=Greenberg/> The outstanding components of the site are a large Roman-era enclosure, a Byzantine church, and a Crusader church.<ref name=Greenberg/> The main periods of settlement are: Early Roman, Late Roman, Byzantine, and Crusader, with less substantial findings from the Iron Age IIc and the Hellenistic period.<ref name=Greenberg>{{cite book |first1= Raphael |last1= Greenberg |first2= Adi |last2= Keinan |title= Israeli Archaeological Activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem 1967-2007: A Sourcebook |publisher= Ostracon Press |year= 2009 |page= 130 |isbn= 978-965-91468-0-2 |url= http://alt-arch.org/he/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/WBADB_sourcebook1.pdf |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> Archaeological excavation by Yitzhak Magen indicate that findings previously attributed to the biblical time of the [[Kings of Judea|Kings]] during the Iron Age, and the Hellenistic [[Hasmonean]]s, are in fact of far newer date, [[Byzantine]] or later.<ref name=Kristensen>{{cite book |first= Vlastimil |last= Drbal |title= Pilgrimage and multi-religious worship: Palestinian Mamre in Late Antiquity |editor-first1= Troels Myrup |editor-last1= Kristensen |editor-first2= Wiebke |editor-last2= Friese |work= Excavating Pilgrimage: Archaeological Approaches to Sacred Travel and Movement in the Ancient World |publisher= Taylor & Francis |series= Routledge Studies in Pilgrimage, Religious Travel and Tourism |year= 2017 |page= 245-264 (247) |isbn= 9781351856263 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AUElDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA247 |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Bronze Age===
[[Bronze Age]] pottery shards found at the Ramat el-Khalil site may indicate that the cultic shrine was in use from 2600-2000 BCE,<ref name=\"JETCHP\"/> though there is no archaeological evidence for the site being occupied from the first half of the second millennium down to the end of the Iron Age.<ref name=\"Pagolu\" />

===Herod: the enclosure===
The 2&nbsp;m thick stone wall enclosing area 49&nbsp;m wide and 65&nbsp;m long was constructed by [[Herod the Great]], possibly as a cultic place of worship.<ref>[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor|Murphy-O'Connor, Jerome]] (2008) ''The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700'' Oxford University Press US, {{ISBN|0-19-923666-6}} p 370</ref><ref>Robinson, Edward (1856) ''Biblical Researches in Palestine, 1838-52: A Journal of Travels in the Year 1838'' pp 215-216</ref> It contained an ancient well, more than 5&nbsp;m in diameter, referred to as Abraham's Well.<ref>Jericke p.?.</ref><ref>[[Robert Letellier|Letellier, Robert Ignatius]] (1995) ''Day in Mamre, Night in Sodom: Abraham and Lot in Genesis 18 and 19'' BRILL, {{ISBN|90-04-10250-7}}</ref>

According to Jericke among others, Persian and Hellenistic Mamre was located at nearby Khirbet Nimra, 1 km north of modern Hebron, where a pagan tree cult predated the composition of the biblical Abraham narrative.<ref name=Heyden2016>{{cite book |first= Katharina |last= Heyden |title= Hain der Religionen: Das Abrahamsheiligtum von Mamre als Begegnungsort und locus theologicus |work= Fremdenliebe – Fremdenangst: Zwei akademische Reden zur interreligiösen Begegnungin Spätantike und Gegenwart |publisher= Theologischer Verlag Zürich (TVZ) |year= 2016 |page= 21 (with footnote 10) |lang= German |isbn= 9783290178635 }}</ref> Herod transferred the Mamre tradition 2,5 km to the north, from the site at Khirbet Nimra to the site at Ramet el-Khalil.<ref name=Heyden2016/> This was part of Herod's upgrade of Hebron as a cult centre dedicated to patriarch Abraham, by erecting two shrines: one at [[Machpela Cave|his tomb]], and one at a site he connected to Abraham's place of residence, where the patriarch dined under a tree together with the three men.<ref name=Heyden2016/> It has been noted that Hebron and Mamre were located in Idumaean territory, that both Jews and Idumaeans regarded Abraham as their common ancestor, and that Herod came from an Idumaean family that had only recently converted to Judaism.<ref name=>{{cite book |first= Peter |last= Richardson |title= Herod: king of the Jews and friend of the Romans |publisher= University of South Carolina Press |series= Studies on personalities of the New Testament |year= 1996 |pages= 61-62 |isbn= 9781570031366 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MWTakr1BbvkC&pg=PA61 |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Josephus: the terebinth===
:'''''Josephus' terebinth tree is distinct from the modern [[Oak of Mamre]] and stands at a different location'''''
[[Josephus]] (37–c. 100) records a tradition according to which the terebinth at Mamre was as old as the world itself (''[[The Jewish War|War]]'' 4.534). The site was soaked in legend. Jews, Christians and Pagans made sacrifices on the site, burning animals, and the tree was considered immune to the flames of the sacrifices.<ref name=\"Adler\">William Adler, The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy, in Natalie B.

===Late Roman period: Hadrian's temple===
The Herodian structure was destroyed by [[Simon bar Kokhba]]'s army, only to be rebuilt by the [[Roman emperor]] [[Hadrian]]. Hadrian revived the fair, which had long been an important one as it took place at an intersection forming the transport and communications nub of the southern [[Judea]]n mountains. This ''[[wikt:mercatus|mercatus]]'' (Heb. ''yerid'' or ''shuq'': {{lang-grc|[[wikt:πανήγυρις|πανήγυρις]]}}) or \"fair, market\" was one of the sites, according to a Jewish tradition conserved in [[Jerome]],<ref name=\"Adler\">William Adler, The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy, in Natalie B.

===Byzantine Christian rule===
Notwithstanding the rabbinic ban, by the time of [[Constantine the Great]]'s reign (302–337), the market had become an informal interdenominational festival, in addition to its functions as a trade fair, frequented by Christians, Jews and pagans. The cultic shrine was made over for Christian use after [[Eutropia]], Constantine's mother-in-law, visited it and was scandalised by its pagan character.<ref name=\"Safrai\"/> Constantine, informed of these pagan practices, attempted without success to put an end to the festive rituals celebrated around the tree.<ref name=\"Adler\"/> He ordered the ''[[comes]]'' Acacius to destroy all pagan idols and banned the pagan practices.<ref>''Life of Constantine'' By Eusebius, Translated by Averil Cameron, Stuart George Hall Oxford University Press, (1999) {{ISBN|0-19-814917-4}} p 301</ref> The enclosure was then consecrated, Constantine had a [[basilica]] built, dedicated to [[Saint George]] and the enclosure of the [[Terebinth]] of Mamre roofed over, the foundations of which are still visible.<ref name=\"ZS ERP\"/><ref>Fergusson, James (2004) ''Tree and Serpent Worship Or Illustrations of Mythology and Arts in India: In the 1st and 4th Century After Christ'' Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|81-206-1236-1}} p 7</ref>

Very many go there for the sake of business, some to sell and some to buy. The feast is celebrated by a very big congregation of Jews, since they boast of Abraham as their forefather, of heathens since angels came there, of Christians since he who should be born from the Virgin for the salvation of humankind appeared there to that pious man. Everyone venerates this place according to his religion: some praying God the ruler of all, some calling upon the angels and offering libations of wine, burning incense or sacrificing an ox, a goat, a sheep or a cock... Constantine's mother in law (Euthropia), having gone there to fulfill a vow, gave notice of all this to the Emperor.

[[Antoninus of Piacenza (pilgrim)|Antoninus of Piacenza]] in his ''Itinerarium'', an account of his journey to the Holy Land (ca.570 CE) comments on the basilica, with its four porticoes, and an unroofed [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. Both Christians and Jews worshipped there, separated by a small screen (''cancellus''). The Jewish worshippers would flock there to celebrate the deposition of Jacob and David on the day after the traditional date of Christ's birthday.<ref>Andrew S. Jacobs, ''Remains of the Jews: The Holy Land and Christian Empire in Late Antiquity,'' Stanford University Press, 2004 p.130.</ref>

[[Arculf]], a Frankish bishop who toured the Levant in around 680, writes, indicating a slightly erroneous location in relation to the Tombs of the Patriarchs:	
<blockquote>''A mile to the north of [[Cave of Machpelah|the Tombs]] that have been described above, is the very grassy and flowery hill of Mambre, looking towards Hebron, which lies to the south of it. This little mountain, which is called Mambre, has a level summit, at the north side of which a great stone church has been built, in the right side of which between the two walls of this great Basilica, the Oak of Mambre, wonderful to relate, stands rooted in the earth; it is also called the oak of Abraham, because under it he once hospitably received the Angels. St. Hieronymus elsewhere relates, that this tree had existed from the beginning of the world to the reign of the Emperor Constantine; but he did not say that it had utterly perished, perhaps because at that time, although the whole of that vast tree was not to be seen as it had been formerly, yet a spurious trunk still remained rooted in the ground, protected under the roof of the church, of the height of two men; from this wasted spurious trunk, which has been cut on all sides by axes, small chips are carried to the different provinces of the world, on account of the veneration and memory of that oak, under which, as has been mentioned above, that famous and notable visit of the Angels was granted to the patriarch Abraham.'' <ref name=\"PPTS\">{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti03paleuoft#page/n57/mode/2up/search/hebron |title=The Pilgrimage of Arculfus in the Holy Land (About the Year A.D. 670) |author=Arculf |website=archive.org |publisher=[[Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society]] |location=London |date=1895 |pages=33–34 |access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref></blockquote>

As written in a footnote from an 1895 publication of Arculf's pilgrimage report, \"[t]he Oak or Terebinth of Abraham has been shown in two different sites. Arculf and many others (Jerome, [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Itin[erarium] Hierosol[ymitanum]]], Sozomen, Eucherius [possibly [[Eucherius of Lyon]]], [[Benjamin of Tudela]], the Abbot Daniel,.... etc.) seem to point to the ruin of er Râmeh, near which is Beit el Khulil, or Abraham's House, with a fine spring well. This is still held by the Jews to be the Oak of Mamre. The Christians point to another site, [[Oak of Mamre|Ballûtet Sebta]], where is a fine specimen of Sindian ([[Quercus pseudococcifera|Quercus Pseudococcifera]]).\"<ref name=\"PPTS\"/> ''Ballut'' is the Arabic word for oak.

=== Slavery and Abolition ===
{{Main|Slavery in Brazil}}

Soon after the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] began to settle in Brazil in the year 1500, they began to enslave the indigenous population in order to sustain their growing sugar economy. However, European induced wars and disease quickly began to deplete the indigenous populations and Portuguese colonizers soon looked to Africa to satisfy their labor demands.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=24}}</ref> By the end of the Slave Trade in 1850, the Brazilian colony had imported an estimated four million slaves from Africa, the largest number of any other country in the Americas and seven times more than what was imported to the United States.<ref name=\":0\" /> Slavery brought with it dehumanization of Africans and a multitude of negative stereotypes that set the stage for a racial hierarchy in Brazil where blacks and those of African descent would become the subservient class to whites.

Along with being the largest importer of Africans during the Slave Trade, Brazil was also the last country in the Americas to eradicate Slavery. Calls for the end of slavery in Brazil began in the early 19th century. In 1825, [[José Bonifácio de Andrada|José Bonifácio Andrada e Silva]], who was a prominent figure in leading Brazil to independence from Portugal, was in high favor of gradual emancipation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-3/slavery-and-aboliton/|title=Slavery and Abolition in the 19th Century {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> Britain also contributed to the push for abolition in Brazil, by abolishing the slave trade. This was a significant move due to the fact that the British was Brazil's main trade partner. A small amount of legislation also helped lead up to the official abolition of slavery in 1888. First, in 1871 the [[Rio Branco Law|Law of the Free Womb]] declared that all the children of slaves that were born after the law was passed were to be freed; followed by the 1885 Sexagenarian Law, which freed slaves over sixty years of age.<ref name=\":0\" />
[[File:Lei Áurea (Golden Law).tif|thumb|The Golden Law. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]
A large contributor to the lengthy abolition process in Brazil was in part due to the dynamics of the royal family. By the 1870s, the last king, Pedro II had only one surviving child, the princess Isabel.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-4/abolition/|title=Abolition {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> Due to her gender and her marriage to a foreigner, Isabel had trouble gaining support, despite having twice served as regent during her father's reign. During her brief time as regent, she took small measures to abolish slavery. Due to the obstacles she faced, she had to appoint an entirely new cabinet in order to completely abolish slavery. She succeeded, and the abolition of slavery was referred to as the [[Lei Áurea|Golden Law]].<ref name=\":1\" />

=== Post Emancipation Brazil (1888- Early 1900s) ===
The abolition of slavery in Brazil meant the end of legal [[Racial segregation|segregation]] between blacks and whites. However, racism did not die with the institution of slavery. The racial hierarchies put in place by slavery stood strong after abolition. There was no period of “[[Reconstruction (United States)|reconstruction]]” such as that which was instituted in the United States.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Elizabeth|date=February 2017|title=The 'Africanization' of Salvador: Race, Work, and Politics in Post-Emancipation Salvador Da Bahia, Brazil|journal=Latin American and Caribbean Ethnic Studies|volume=12|issue=3|pages=227–249|doi=10.1080/17442222.2017.1365429}}</ref> Rather, newly freed black Brazilians were left to create a life for themselves out of nothing—no land, money, or education. This disadvantaged state left the country with massive amounts of inequality between whites and non-whites. Because of this, the conversation about race in Brazil became closely intertwined with conversations about poverty and class.

Though there were no laws directly targeting those of African descent on the basis of race, there were laws that put in place that created inequality between whites and blacks. For example, when Brazil first became a republic in 1889, voting was restricted to only literate men, which barred the majority of the black population from voting since there were large inequities in education after the abolition of slavery.<ref name=\":3\" /> In addition to this, there was a redefining of crime that criminalized many aspects of African culture.<ref name=\":1\" />

==== [[Eugenics]] ====
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fear began to spur among the elite classes about how Brazil's early history of [[miscegenation]] would affect its development.<ref name=\":1\" /> This fear in combination with the growing popularity of using [[pseudoscience]] to explain racial differences led to the growth of eugenics in Brazil.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sebastião de Souza|first=Vanderlei|date=December 2016|title=Brazilian Eugenics and Its International Connections: an Analysis Based on the Controversies between Renato Kehl and Edgard Roquette-Pinto, 1920-1930|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-59702016000900093&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en|journal=Hist. Cienc. Saude-Manguinhos|volume=23|pages=|via=sciELO}}</ref>

European critics had long criticized Brazil's racially diverse society for its lack of “[[Racial hygiene|racial purity]].” Eugenics of the time suggested that blacks were inferior, and mulattoes were “degenerate,” putting Brazil's large black and mixed populations in question.<ref name=\":4\" /> Further, it was thought that tropical climates, like Brazil's, hindered a country's development.<ref name=\":0\" /> One French eugenicist, Count [[Arthur de Gobineau]], attacked Brazil saying that racial mixing in the country had affected every stratosphere of class making the entire country “lazy, ugly and infertile.”<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=26}}</ref> These thoughts began to spark fear among Brazil's elite who sought to use ideas of eugenics to better the country's economic standing. One anthropologist who adopted eugenic thought, Raimundo Nina Rodgrigues, began to become concerned with the racial mixing occurring in Brazil. He conducted a ‘study’ on people of African origin in Brazil and found that the ethnic group was “unequivocally inferior.”<ref name=\":5\" /> He advocated for separate criminal laws by race and that blacks be subject to separate laws because they were not free to choose crime because of their diminished capacities. However, Rodrigues himself was mixed race and expressed confusion about the status of mixed race individuals in the racial hierarchy. To counter this, he proposed the creation of several categories to express the spectrum of mixed people going from superior to ordinary, to degenerate.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=27}}</ref>

In the end, eugenics in Brazil never took on as strong as it did in Europe or North America. Some attribute the pseudoscience's limited success to the fact that Brazil already had a very large mixed-race population. Nina Rodrigues’ confusion about how racial superiority works outside of a racial binary demonstrates this thought. Even at the time slavery was abolished in 1888, 6 percent of all marriages were interracial.<ref name=\":7\" /> This means that, at some level, racial barriers had already been broken down, making it difficult to institute hardline eugenics policies like [[Racial segregation|segregation]] or racial [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]]. Others argue that the large presence of [[Catholic Church in Brazil|Catholicism]] in Brazil may have saved the country from harsher racial policies.<ref name=\":4\" /><blockquote>''“The broad influence of Catholicism in Brazil and the rest of Latin America constrained eugenicists’ interventions in discussions on marriage restrictions and human reproduction. In the eyes of Catholic intellectuals, these were matters of a moral and religious nature and as such not open to political or medical intervention; this kept them from making any more radical proposals such as eugenic sterilization”'' <ref name=\":4\" /> (From: Sebastião de Souza, Vanderlei (December 2016). \"Brazilian Eugenics and Its International Connections: an Analysis Based on the Controversies between Renato Kehl and Edgard Roquette-Pinto, 1920-1930\")</blockquote>

==== The Policy of Racial Whitening ====
{{Main|Racial whitening|l1=Racial Whitening}}

Amidst discussions of eugenics and the country's demographics hindering its development, the first Brazilian Republic decided to institute a policy of “whitening” wherein it would try to dilute the black population and drive out all signs of African culture.<ref name=\":3\" /> This was done by incentives encouraging immigrants from Europe to come and skew demographics along with suppression of African culture all in an effort to erase the presence of blacks from Brazil. The policy lasted until 1910 and because of it the percentage of whites in Brazil jumped from 34 percent in 1870 to 64 percent in 1940.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref>

== Shifting Views on Race ==

=== 1910-1920s ===
The end of European immigration in 1910 meant the resurfacing of fears among Brazil elite about the “blackening” of the Brazilian population.<ref name=\":3\" /> Suggestions about increasing immigration of Afro- North Americans sparked contentious debates inside and outside of the eugenics community.<ref name=\":8\" /> One such person who was troubled by this idea was eugenicist Renato Khel. Khel was influenced by aggressive eugenics policies that were being used in Germany and advocated for similar policies in Brazil, such as the sterilization of degenerates and criminals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref> However, the majority of the Brazilian population, including those within the eugenics community, were beginning to see miscegenation as a path to racial harmony.

=== 1930s to 1980s: Brazil as a “Racial Democracy” ===
{{Main|Racial democracy|l1=Racial Democracy}}

As Brazilian society drew farther and farther away from ideas of racial purity, [[Gilberto Freyre|Gilberto Freye]] popularized the idea of Brazil as a racial democracy in his book ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala|The Masters and the Slaves]]''. Freye's book transformed the idea of miscegenation into a positive part of Brazilian culture and national identity and it became widely accepted that Brazil's history of intermixing between races had rendered the country a post-racial society, as it would come to be hailed for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blackness Without Ethnicity: constructing race in BRazil|last=Sansone|first=Livio|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=2}}</ref> Importantly, the idea of racial democracy became central dogma to the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military governments of 1964-1985]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=40}}</ref> While it was in power, the military preferred to think of race as a non-issue and pushed the idea of a unified identity among all Brazilians in order to quell resistance.<ref name=\":9\" />

During military rule, racial democracy became a consensus among almost all Brazilians. The idea became so popular that the mentioning of race would become taboo and bringing up issues of race was deemed as racist.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=41}}</ref> Some argue that the long consensus of Brazil as a racial democracy was what prevented the country from dealing with issues of race. In her article “''From ‘Racial Democracy’ to Affirmative Action”'' [[Mala Htun]] argues that the unwillingness of the Brazilian government to define race prevented Afro-Brazilian rights organizations from forming and limited the group's political power.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Htun|first=Mala|date=2004|title=From \"Racial Democracy\" to Affirmative Action: Changing State Policy on Race in Brazil|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=39|pages=66|doi=10.1353/lar.2004.0010}}</ref> She also argues that refusing to acknowledge race created inaction that allowed for racism to continue.<ref name=\":6\" />

=== 1980s to present: The Emergence of a Race Conscious State ===
The common narrative of Brazil as a racial democracy persisted until the 1990s. In 1985, [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military rule]] officially ended and the year marked the beginning of re-democratization. The public greatly influenced the writing of the 1988 constitution and black rights organization successfully petitioned for the inclusion of an anti-racist clause that would make racism a punishable offense. In the 1990s, with the reintroduction of democratic systems, the use of NGOs and international organizations brought color consciousness and issues of persisting racial inequality to the forefront of national discussions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=52}}</ref> In particular, the 2001 [[World Conference against Racism 2001|Durban conference]] (World conference on Racism) attracted large amounts of attention to existing racial inequality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Htun|first=Mala|date=2004|title=From 'Racial Democracy' to Affirmative Action: Changing State Policy on Race in Brazil|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=39|pages=68|doi=10.1353/lar.2004.0010}}</ref> The issue stayed on the front page of national newspapers for months and even prompted comments from the president. In 2003, President Luiz Lula made race a central issue of his presidency and the government began to initiate affirmative action programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nacla.org/article/lula’s-approach-affirmative-action-and-race|title=Lula's Approach to Affirmative Action and Race|last=João|first=Feres Júnior|date=May 12, 2011|website=NACLA|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref>{{Undue weight section|date=June 2018}}

== Persisting Inequality ==
Many Brazilians still think that race impacts life in their country. A research article published in 2011 indicated that 63.7% of [[Brazilians]] believe that [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] interferes with the [[quality of life]], 59% believe it makes a difference at work, and 68.3% in questions related to police justice. According to Ivanir dos Santos (the former Justice Ministry's specialist on race affairs), \"There is a hierarchy of skin color: where blacks, mixed race and dark skinned people are expected to know their place in society.\"<ref name=\":10\">[http://brazilchronicle.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/brazilians-think-race-intefere-on-quality-of-life-but-not-everyone-is-concerned-over-equality/ Brazilians Think Race {{sic|Intefere|nolink=y}} on Quality of Life, but not Everyone is Concerned About Equality {{in lang|en}}]</ref> Although 54% of the population is black or has black ancestry, they represented only 24% of the 513 chosen representatives the legislature as of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brazilian.report/power/2018/11/20/ethnic-representation-brazil-congress/|title=Ethnic Representation in Brazil's Congress: a long road ahead|last=The Brazilian Report|date=November 20, 2018|website=The Brazilian Report|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

For many decades, discussions of inequality in Brazil largely ignored the disproportionate correlation between race and class. Under the racial democracy thesis, it was assumed that any disparity in wealth between white and non-white Brazilians was due to the legacy of slavery and broader issues of inequality and lack of economic mobility in the country. The general consensus was that the problem would fix itself given enough time. This hypothesis was examined in 1982 by sociologist José Pastore in his book ''Social Mobility in Brazil''. In his book, Pastore examines the 1973 household survey and compares the income and occupations of father-son pairs. Based on his findings, he concluded that the level of economic mobility in Brazil should have been enough to overcome inequality left from slavery had opportunities been available equally.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Mobility in Brazil|last=Pastore|first=Jose|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Racial inequality is seen primarily through lower levels of education and income for non-whites than whites.<ref name=\":2\" /> Economic inequality is most dramatically seen in the near absence of non-whites from the upper levels of Brazil's income bracket. According to sociologist Edward Telles, whites are five times more likely to be earning in the highest income bracket (more than $2,000/month).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the consequences of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=110}}</ref> Overall, The salary of Whites in [[Brazil]] are, on average, 46% over the salary of Blacks.<ref name=\":10\" />

Additionally, racial discrimination in education is a well documented phenomenon in Brazil. Ellis Monk, Professor of sociology at Harvard University, found that one unit of darkness in a student's skin corresponds to a 26 percent lower change of the student receiving more education as compared to lighter-skinned students.<ref name=\":2\" /> Further, a study on racial bias in teacher evaluations in Brazil found that Brazilian math teachers gave better grading assessments of white students than equally proficient and equivalently well-behaved black students.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=AEJ: Applied (7,4) p. 37 - Racial Discrimination in Grading: Evidence from Brazil|doi=10.1257/app.20140352|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aa721601434c10052e0321288ede89653399ec0c}}</ref>

== Studies on Racialized Violence ==

Due to the ongoing questions surrounding race in Brazil, there have been various studies of violence in the country and whether race was a contributing or main factor in these crimes. One particular study looked at a series of [[homicide]]s that occurred in Brazil, spanning from 2000 to 2009. The statistics were obtained by the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]]. The explanatory variables the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]] looked at for potential causes of racialized killings were, [[race (classification of humans)|race]]/[[skin color]], [[gender]] and [[education]]. In the discussion section, the findings of the study suggested that anti-gun legislation in Brazil has yielded different outcomes among Brazil's population due to race or color. The risk of death by homicide in the white population declined during the period studied. In the black population, the risk of being victimized based on race increased regardless of gender, even after gun control measures took place over the studied period of time.<ref>[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en Homicide victimization according to racial characteristics in Brazil {{in lang|en}}]</ref>

As the overall homicide rate registered in Brazil has been rising, the number of homicides per 100,000 [[Afro-Brazilians|afro]] and [[Pardo Brazilians|pardo brazilians]] also increased from 32.42 in 2006 to 43.15 in 2017, whereas the number of homicides per 100,000 for [[White Brazilians|white]] and [[Asian Brazilians|asian brazilians]] has decreased from 17.12 in 2006 to 15.97 recorded in 2017.<ref>https://www.statista.com/statistics/867757/homicide-rate-brazil-ethnicity/</ref>

Another study determined that in 2008, 111.2% more blacks died proportionally than whites in Brazil. The disparity is especially pronounced among young adults between 15 and 24 years of age. Among whites, the number of murders fell from 6,592 to 4,582 between 2002 and 2008, a difference of 30%. Meanwhile, the murders of young black men rose from 11,308 to 12,749 —- an increase of 13%. In 2008, 127.6% more young black men died proportionately than whites. Ten years earlier, this difference was 39%. In the State of [[Paraíba]] in 2008, 1083% more blacks died than whites. In the State of [[Alagoas]], 974.8% more blacks died than whites. In 11 States, this ratio exceeds 200%.<ref>[http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,1-branco-e-morto-no-pais-para-cada-2-negros,683821,0.htm For every death of a white person in Brazil, 2 black people die {{in lang|pt}}]</ref>

== Definition of Race in Brazil ==
{{Main|Race and ethnicity in Brazil|l1=Race and Ethnicity in Brazil}}

Because the country has a long history of [[miscegenation]], color lines in Brazil have long been blurred.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Monk|first=Ellis P.|date=July 20, 2016|title=The Consequences of 'Race and Color' in Brazil|url=https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/emonk/files/monk_-_the_consequences_of_race_and_color_in_brazil_-_sp.pdf.|journal=Social Problems|volume=63|issue=3|pages=413–430|via=Oxford Academic|doi=10.1093/socpro/spw014}}</ref> The [[Brazilian census]] organizes the population into five, albeit imperfect, racial groups. These are ''branco'' (white), ''preto'' (black), ''pardo'' (brown, or multi-racial), ''amarelo'' (yellow, or Asian), and ''indígena'' (indigenous). Because there was never a legal genetic definition for these categories, throughout history, each of these racial groups has been defined in different ways. Racial classification in Brazilian society is often inconsistent and influenced by a myriad of factors including: class, status, education, location and [[phenotype]].<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, a light-skinned multiracial person who held an important, well-paying position in society may be considered ''branco'' while someone else with the same [[Ethnogenesis|ethnogenetic]] make up who had darker skin or was of a lower class may be considered ''pardo'' or even ''preto''.

== History ==

=== Slavery and Abolition ===
{{Main|Slavery in Brazil}}

Soon after the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] began to settle in Brazil in the year 1500, they began to enslave the indigenous population in order to sustain their growing sugar economy. However, European induced wars and disease quickly began to deplete the indigenous populations and Portuguese colonizers soon looked to Africa to satisfy their labor demands.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=24}}</ref> By the end of the Slave Trade in 1850, the Brazilian colony had imported an estimated four million slaves from Africa, the largest number of any other country in the Americas and seven times more than what was imported to the United States.<ref name=\":0\" /> Slavery brought with it dehumanization of Africans and a multitude of negative stereotypes that set the stage for a racial hierarchy in Brazil where blacks and those of African descent would become the subservient class to whites.

Along with being the largest importer of Africans during the Slave Trade, Brazil was also the last country in the Americas to eradicate Slavery. Calls for the end of slavery in Brazil began in the early 19th century. In 1825, [[José Bonifácio de Andrada|José Bonifácio Andrada e Silva]], who was a prominent figure in leading Brazil to independence from Portugal, was in high favor of gradual emancipation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-3/slavery-and-aboliton/|title=Slavery and Abolition in the 19th Century {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> Britain also contributed to the push for abolition in Brazil, by abolishing the slave trade. This was a significant move due to the fact that the British was Brazil's main trade partner. A small amount of legislation also helped lead up to the official abolition of slavery in 1888. First, in 1871 the [[Rio Branco Law|Law of the Free Womb]] declared that all the children of slaves that were born after the law was passed were to be freed; followed by the 1885 Sexagenarian Law, which freed slaves over sixty years of age.<ref name=\":0\" />
[[File:Lei Áurea (Golden Law).tif|thumb|The Golden Law. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]
A large contributor to the lengthy abolition process in Brazil was in part due to the dynamics of the royal family. By the 1870s, the last king, Pedro II had only one surviving child, the princess Isabel.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-4/abolition/|title=Abolition {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> Due to her gender and her marriage to a foreigner, Isabel had trouble gaining support, despite having twice served as regent during her father's reign. During her brief time as regent, she took small measures to abolish slavery. Due to the obstacles she faced, she had to appoint an entirely new cabinet in order to completely abolish slavery. She succeeded, and the abolition of slavery was referred to as the [[Lei Áurea|Golden Law]].<ref name=\":1\" />

=== Post Emancipation Brazil (1888- Early 1900s) ===
The abolition of slavery in Brazil meant the end of legal [[Racial segregation|segregation]] between blacks and whites. However, racism did not die with the institution of slavery. The racial hierarchies put in place by slavery stood strong after abolition. There was no period of “[[Reconstruction (United States)|reconstruction]]” such as that which was instituted in the United States.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Elizabeth|date=February 2017|title=The 'Africanization' of Salvador: Race, Work, and Politics in Post-Emancipation Salvador Da Bahia, Brazil|journal=Latin American and Caribbean Ethnic Studies|volume=12|issue=3|pages=227–249|doi=10.1080/17442222.2017.1365429}}</ref> Rather, newly freed black Brazilians were left to create a life for themselves out of nothing—no land, money, or education. This disadvantaged state left the country with massive amounts of inequality between whites and non-whites. Because of this, the conversation about race in Brazil became closely intertwined with conversations about poverty and class.

Though there were no laws directly targeting those of African descent on the basis of race, there were laws that put in place that created inequality between whites and blacks. For example, when Brazil first became a republic in 1889, voting was restricted to only literate men, which barred the majority of the black population from voting since there were large inequities in education after the abolition of slavery.<ref name=\":3\" /> In addition to this, there was a redefining of crime that criminalized many aspects of African culture.<ref name=\":1\" />

==== [[Eugenics]] ====
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fear began to spur among the elite classes about how Brazil's early history of [[miscegenation]] would affect its development.<ref name=\":1\" /> This fear in combination with the growing popularity of using [[pseudoscience]] to explain racial differences led to the growth of eugenics in Brazil.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sebastião de Souza|first=Vanderlei|date=December 2016|title=Brazilian Eugenics and Its International Connections: an Analysis Based on the Controversies between Renato Kehl and Edgard Roquette-Pinto, 1920-1930|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-59702016000900093&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en|journal=Hist. Cienc. Saude-Manguinhos|volume=23|pages=|via=sciELO}}</ref>

European critics had long criticized Brazil's racially diverse society for its lack of “[[Racial hygiene|racial purity]].” Eugenics of the time suggested that blacks were inferior, and mulattoes were “degenerate,” putting Brazil's large black and mixed populations in question.<ref name=\":4\" /> Further, it was thought that tropical climates, like Brazil's, hindered a country's development.<ref name=\":0\" /> One French eugenicist, Count [[Arthur de Gobineau]], attacked Brazil saying that racial mixing in the country had affected every stratosphere of class making the entire country “lazy, ugly and infertile.”<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=26}}</ref> These thoughts began to spark fear among Brazil's elite who sought to use ideas of eugenics to better the country's economic standing. One anthropologist who adopted eugenic thought, Raimundo Nina Rodgrigues, began to become concerned with the racial mixing occurring in Brazil. He conducted a ‘study’ on people of African origin in Brazil and found that the ethnic group was “unequivocally inferior.”<ref name=\":5\" /> He advocated for separate criminal laws by race and that blacks be subject to separate laws because they were not free to choose crime because of their diminished capacities. However, Rodrigues himself was mixed race and expressed confusion about the status of mixed race individuals in the racial hierarchy. To counter this, he proposed the creation of several categories to express the spectrum of mixed people going from superior to ordinary, to degenerate.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=27}}</ref>

In the end, eugenics in Brazil never took on as strong as it did in Europe or North America. Some attribute the pseudoscience's limited success to the fact that Brazil already had a very large mixed-race population. Nina Rodrigues’ confusion about how racial superiority works outside of a racial binary demonstrates this thought. Even at the time slavery was abolished in 1888, 6 percent of all marriages were interracial.<ref name=\":7\" /> This means that, at some level, racial barriers had already been broken down, making it difficult to institute hardline eugenics policies like [[Racial segregation|segregation]] or racial [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]]. Others argue that the large presence of [[Catholic Church in Brazil|Catholicism]] in Brazil may have saved the country from harsher racial policies.<ref name=\":4\" /><blockquote>''“The broad influence of Catholicism in Brazil and the rest of Latin America constrained eugenicists’ interventions in discussions on marriage restrictions and human reproduction. In the eyes of Catholic intellectuals, these were matters of a moral and religious nature and as such not open to political or medical intervention; this kept them from making any more radical proposals such as eugenic sterilization”'' <ref name=\":4\" /> (From: Sebastião de Souza, Vanderlei (December 2016). \"Brazilian Eugenics and Its International Connections: an Analysis Based on the Controversies between Renato Kehl and Edgard Roquette-Pinto, 1920-1930\")</blockquote>

==== The Policy of Racial Whitening ====
{{Main|Racial whitening|l1=Racial Whitening}}

Amidst discussions of eugenics and the country's demographics hindering its development, the first Brazilian Republic decided to institute a policy of “whitening” wherein it would try to dilute the black population and drive out all signs of African culture.<ref name=\":3\" /> This was done by incentives encouraging immigrants from Europe to come and skew demographics along with suppression of African culture all in an effort to erase the presence of blacks from Brazil. The policy lasted until 1910 and because of it the percentage of whites in Brazil jumped from 34 percent in 1870 to 64 percent in 1940.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref>

== Shifting Views on Race ==

=== 1910-1920s ===
The end of European immigration in 1910 meant the resurfacing of fears among Brazil elite about the “blackening” of the Brazilian population.<ref name=\":3\" /> Suggestions about increasing immigration of Afro- North Americans sparked contentious debates inside and outside of the eugenics community.<ref name=\":8\" /> One such person who was troubled by this idea was eugenicist Renato Khel. Khel was influenced by aggressive eugenics policies that were being used in Germany and advocated for similar policies in Brazil, such as the sterilization of degenerates and criminals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref> However, the majority of the Brazilian population, including those within the eugenics community, were beginning to see miscegenation as a path to racial harmony.

=== 1930s to 1980s: Brazil as a “Racial Democracy” ===
{{Main|Racial democracy|l1=Racial Democracy}}

As Brazilian society drew farther and farther away from ideas of racial purity, [[Gilberto Freyre|Gilberto Freye]] popularized the idea of Brazil as a racial democracy in his book ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala|The Masters and the Slaves]]''. Freye's book transformed the idea of miscegenation into a positive part of Brazilian culture and national identity and it became widely accepted that Brazil's history of intermixing between races had rendered the country a post-racial society, as it would come to be hailed for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blackness Without Ethnicity: constructing race in BRazil|last=Sansone|first=Livio|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=2}}</ref> Importantly, the idea of racial democracy became central dogma to the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military governments of 1964-1985]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=40}}</ref> While it was in power, the military preferred to think of race as a non-issue and pushed the idea of a unified identity among all Brazilians in order to quell resistance.<ref name=\":9\" />

During military rule, racial democracy became a consensus among almost all Brazilians. The idea became so popular that the mentioning of race would become taboo and bringing up issues of race was deemed as racist.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=41}}</ref> Some argue that the long consensus of Brazil as a racial democracy was what prevented the country from dealing with issues of race. In her article “''From ‘Racial Democracy’ to Affirmative Action”'' [[Mala Htun]] argues that the unwillingness of the Brazilian government to define race prevented Afro-Brazilian rights organizations from forming and limited the group's political power.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Htun|first=Mala|date=2004|title=From \"Racial Democracy\" to Affirmative Action: Changing State Policy on Race in Brazil|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=39|pages=66|doi=10.1353/lar.2004.0010}}</ref> She also argues that refusing to acknowledge race created inaction that allowed for racism to continue.<ref name=\":6\" />

=== 1980s to present: The Emergence of a Race Conscious State ===
The common narrative of Brazil as a racial democracy persisted until the 1990s. In 1985, [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military rule]] officially ended and the year marked the beginning of re-democratization. The public greatly influenced the writing of the 1988 constitution and black rights organization successfully petitioned for the inclusion of an anti-racist clause that would make racism a punishable offense. In the 1990s, with the reintroduction of democratic systems, the use of NGOs and international organizations brought color consciousness and issues of persisting racial inequality to the forefront of national discussions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=52}}</ref> In particular, the 2001 [[World Conference against Racism 2001|Durban conference]] (World conference on Racism) attracted large amounts of attention to existing racial inequality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Htun|first=Mala|date=2004|title=From 'Racial Democracy' to Affirmative Action: Changing State Policy on Race in Brazil|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=39|pages=68|doi=10.1353/lar.2004.0010}}</ref> The issue stayed on the front page of national newspapers for months and even prompted comments from the president. In 2003, President Luiz Lula made race a central issue of his presidency and the government began to initiate affirmative action programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nacla.org/article/lula’s-approach-affirmative-action-and-race|title=Lula's Approach to Affirmative Action and Race|last=João|first=Feres Júnior|date=May 12, 2011|website=NACLA|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref>{{Undue weight section|date=June 2018}}

== Persisting Inequality ==
Many Brazilians still think that race impacts life in their country. A research article published in 2011 indicated that 63.7% of [[Brazilians]] believe that [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] interferes with the [[quality of life]], 59% believe it makes a difference at work, and 68.3% in questions related to police justice. According to Ivanir dos Santos (the former Justice Ministry's specialist on race affairs), \"There is a hierarchy of skin color: where blacks, mixed race and dark skinned people are expected to know their place in society.\"<ref name=\":10\">[http://brazilchronicle.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/brazilians-think-race-intefere-on-quality-of-life-but-not-everyone-is-concerned-over-equality/ Brazilians Think Race {{sic|Intefere|nolink=y}} on Quality of Life, but not Everyone is Concerned About Equality {{in lang|en}}]</ref> Although 54% of the population is black or has black ancestry, they represented only 24% of the 513 chosen representatives the legislature as of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brazilian.report/power/2018/11/20/ethnic-representation-brazil-congress/|title=Ethnic Representation in Brazil's Congress: a long road ahead|last=The Brazilian Report|date=November 20, 2018|website=The Brazilian Report|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

For many decades, discussions of inequality in Brazil largely ignored the disproportionate correlation between race and class. Under the racial democracy thesis, it was assumed that any disparity in wealth between white and non-white Brazilians was due to the legacy of slavery and broader issues of inequality and lack of economic mobility in the country. The general consensus was that the problem would fix itself given enough time. This hypothesis was examined in 1982 by sociologist José Pastore in his book ''Social Mobility in Brazil''. In his book, Pastore examines the 1973 household survey and compares the income and occupations of father-son pairs. Based on his findings, he concluded that the level of economic mobility in Brazil should have been enough to overcome inequality left from slavery had opportunities been available equally.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Mobility in Brazil|last=Pastore|first=Jose|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Racial inequality is seen primarily through lower levels of education and income for non-whites than whites.<ref name=\":2\" /> Economic inequality is most dramatically seen in the near absence of non-whites from the upper levels of Brazil's income bracket. According to sociologist Edward Telles, whites are five times more likely to be earning in the highest income bracket (more than $2,000/month).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the consequences of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=110}}</ref> Overall, The salary of Whites in [[Brazil]] are, on average, 46% over the salary of Blacks.<ref name=\":10\" />

Additionally, racial discrimination in education is a well documented phenomenon in Brazil. Ellis Monk, Professor of sociology at Harvard University, found that one unit of darkness in a student's skin corresponds to a 26 percent lower change of the student receiving more education as compared to lighter-skinned students.<ref name=\":2\" /> Further, a study on racial bias in teacher evaluations in Brazil found that Brazilian math teachers gave better grading assessments of white students than equally proficient and equivalently well-behaved black students.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=AEJ: Applied (7,4) p. 37 - Racial Discrimination in Grading: Evidence from Brazil|doi=10.1257/app.20140352|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aa721601434c10052e0321288ede89653399ec0c}}</ref>

== Studies on Racialized Violence ==

Due to the ongoing questions surrounding race in Brazil, there have been various studies of violence in the country and whether race was a contributing or main factor in these crimes. One particular study looked at a series of [[homicide]]s that occurred in Brazil, spanning from 2000 to 2009. The statistics were obtained by the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]]. The explanatory variables the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]] looked at for potential causes of racialized killings were, [[race (classification of humans)|race]]/[[skin color]], [[gender]] and [[education]]. In the discussion section, the findings of the study suggested that anti-gun legislation in Brazil has yielded different outcomes among Brazil's population due to race or color. The risk of death by homicide in the white population declined during the period studied. In the black population, the risk of being victimized based on race increased regardless of gender, even after gun control measures took place over the studied period of time.<ref>[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en Homicide victimization according to racial characteristics in Brazil {{in lang|en}}]</ref>

As the overall homicide rate registered in Brazil has been rising, the number of homicides per 100,000 [[Afro-Brazilians|afro]] and [[Pardo Brazilians|pardo brazilians]] also increased from 32.42 in 2006 to 43.15 in 2017, whereas the number of homicides per 100,000 for [[White Brazilians|white]] and [[Asian Brazilians|asian brazilians]] has decreased from 17.12 in 2006 to 15.97 recorded in 2017.<ref>https://www.statista.com/statistics/867757/homicide-rate-brazil-ethnicity/</ref>

Another study determined that in 2008, 111.2% more blacks died proportionally than whites in Brazil. The disparity is especially pronounced among young adults between 15 and 24 years of age. Among whites, the number of murders fell from 6,592 to 4,582 between 2002 and 2008, a difference of 30%. Meanwhile, the murders of young black men rose from 11,308 to 12,749 —- an increase of 13%. In 2008, 127.6% more young black men died proportionately than whites. Ten years earlier, this difference was 39%. In the State of [[Paraíba]] in 2008, 1083% more blacks died than whites. In the State of [[Alagoas]], 974.8% more blacks died than whites. In 11 States, this ratio exceeds 200%.<ref>[http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,1-branco-e-morto-no-pais-para-cada-2-negros,683821,0.htm For every death of a white person in Brazil, 2 black people die {{in lang|pt}}]</ref>

[[File:LA2 Skultuna kontorsljusstake.jpg|thumb|upright|A candle in a candle stick]]

A '''candle''' is an ignitable [[candle wick|wick]] embedded in [[wax]], or another flammable solid substance such as [[tallow]], that provides [[light]], and in some cases, a [[Aroma compound|fragrance]].  A candle can also provide [[heat]] or a method of keeping [[time]].

A person who makes candles is traditionally known as a [[chandlery|chandler]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandler|title=Chandler |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref> Various devices have been invented to hold candles, from simple tabletop [[candlestick|candlesticks, also known as candle holders,]] to elaborate [[candelabra]] and  [[chandelier]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandelier |title=chandelier |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>

For a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame from a [[match]] or [[lighter]]) is used to light the candle's wick, which melts and [[vaporizes]] a small amount of fuel (the wax). Once vaporized, the fuel combines with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant [[flame]]. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via [[capillary action]]; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.

As the fuel (wax) is melted and burned, the candle becomes shorter. Portions of the wick that are not emitting vaporized fuel are consumed in the flame. The incineration of the wick limits the length of the exposed portion of the wick, thus maintaining a constant burning temperature and rate of fuel consumption. Some wicks require regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized wick trimmer), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7&nbsp;cm), to promote slower, steady burning, and also to prevent smoking. Special candle-scissors called \"[[Candle snuffer|snuffers]]\" were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher. In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns.  This ensures that the end of the wick gets oxygen and is then consumed by [[fire]]—a self-trimming wick.<ref>[http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz European Candle Association FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154928/http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz |date=2012-01-13 }}.</ref>

==Etymology==
The word candle comes from Middle English ''candel'', from Old English and from Anglo-Norman ''candele'', both from Latin ''candēla'', from ''candēre'', to shine.<ref name=Farlex>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/candle |title=Candle |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of candle making}}
[[File:Roman oil lamp.jpg|thumb|Roman oil lamp]]
Prior to the candle, people used [[oil lamp]]s in which a lit wick rested in a container of liquid oil. Liquid oil lamps had a tendency to spill, and the wick had to be advanced by hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began making true dipped candles from tallow, beginning around 500 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/candles2.html |title=Candles, Roman, 500 BCE |website=Smith College Museum}}</ref> European candles of antiquity were made from various forms of natural fat, tallow, and wax. In [[Ancient Rome]], candles were made of tallow due to the prohibitive cost of beeswax.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=R J|title=Studies in Ancient technology|date=1955|isbn=978-9004006263|pages=139–40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VmmHdm5STIC|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> It is possible that they also existed in [[Ancient Greece]], but imprecise terminology makes it difficult to determine.<ref name=\"Forbes\" /> The earliest surviving candles originated in [[Han China]] around 200 BC. These early Chinese candles were made from whale fat.

During the Middle Ages, [[tallow]] candles were most commonly used. By the 13th century, candle making had become a guild craft in England and France. The candle makers (chandlers) went from house to house making candles from the kitchen fats saved for that purpose, or made and sold their own candles from small candle shops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.candles.org/about_history.html |title=History of candles |publisher=National Candle Association |accessdate=2012-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517112023/http://www.candles.org/about_history.html |archivedate=May 17, 2012 }}</ref> Beeswax, compared to animal-based tallow, burned cleanly, without smoky flame. Beeswax candles were expensive, and relatively few people could afford to burn them in their homes in medieval Europe. However, they were widely used for church ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|title=history of candle|url=http://candles.org/history/|publisher=national candle association}}</ref>

In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[spermaceti]], a waxy substance produced by the [[sperm whale]], was used to produce a superior candle that burned longer, brighter and gave off no offensive smell.<ref>{{cite book | last = Shillito | first = M.

===Modern era===
[[File:Price's Palmitine Candles00.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Price's Candles]] became the largest candle manufacturer in the world by the end of the 19th century]]

The manufacture of candles became an industrialized mass market in the mid 19th century. In 1834, Joseph Morgan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Joseph_Morgan_and_Son|title=Joseph Morgan and Son |publisher=Graces Guide}}</ref> a [[pewter]]er from [[Manchester]], England, patented a machine that revolutionised candle making. It allowed for continuous production of molded candles by using a cylinder with a moveable piston to eject candles as they solidified. This more efficient mechanized production produced about 1,500 candles per hour. This allowed candles to be an affordable commodity for the masses.<ref>{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Gordon  | title = Seven Centuries of Light: The Tallow Chandlers Company | publisher = Book Production Consultants  | year = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=OWt03_on0qUC&pg=PA74&dq=Joseph+Morgan+candles+1834 | isbn = 978-1-85757-064-9 | page = 74}}</ref> Candlemakers also began to fashion wicks out of tightly [[braid]]ed (rather than simply twisted) strands of [[cotton]]. This technique makes wicks curl over as they burn, maintaining the height of the wick and therefore the flame. Because much of the excess wick is incinerated, these are referred to as \"self-trimming\" or \"self-consuming\" wicks.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php# |title=A Brief History of Candles |access-date=2015-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318072713/http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php# |archive-date=2013-03-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the mid-1850s, [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] succeeded in distilling [[paraffin wax]] from coal and oil shales at [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]] and developed a commercially viable method of production.<ref>{{cite book | last = Golan | first = Tal  | title = Laws of Men and Laws of Nature: The History of Scientific Expert Testimony in England and America | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2004 | pages = 89–91 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=kQhYsAmcj-EC&pg=PA90&dq=james+young+patent+paraffin#PPA90,M1  | isbn = 978-0674012868}}</ref> Paraffin could be used to make inexpensive candles of high quality. It was a bluish-white wax, which burned cleanly and left no unpleasant odor, unlike [[tallow]] candles. By the end of the 19th century, candles were made from paraffin wax and [[stearic acid]].

By the late 19th century, [[Price's Candles]], based in London, was the largest candle manufacturer in the world.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJo7AwAAQBAJ|title=London's Industrial Heritage|author=Geoff Marshall|year=2013|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780752492391}}</ref> Founded by William Wilson in 1830,<ref>{{cite book | last = Ball  | first = Michael  |author2=David Sunderland | title = An Economic History of London, 1800-1914 | publisher = Routledge | year = 2001 | pages = 131–132 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=MI6JfTiEcdAC&pg=PA132&dq=Prices+Candles+Coconut | isbn = 978-0415246910}}</ref> the company pioneered the implementation of the technique of [[steam distillation]], and was thus able to manufacture candles from a wide range of raw materials, including skin fat, bone fat, fish oil and industrial greases.

Despite advances in candle making, the candle industry declined rapidly upon the introduction of superior methods of lighting, including [[kerosene]] and [[Kerosene lamp|lamps]] and the 1879 invention of the [[incandescent light bulb]]. From this point on, candles came to be marketed as more of a decorative item.

Before the invention of [[electric light]]ing, candles and oil lamps were commonly used for illumination. In areas without electricity, they are still used routinely.  Until the 20th century, candles were more common in northern Europe. In southern Europe and the Mediterranean, oil lamps predominated.

In the developed world today, candles are used mainly for their aesthetic value and scent, particularly to set a soft, warm, or romantic ambiance, for emergency lighting during electrical [[Power failure|power failures]], and for religious or ritual purposes.

===Other uses===
With the fairly consistent and measurable burning of a candle, a common use of candles was to tell the [[candle clock|time]]. The candle designed for this purpose might have time measurements, usually in hours, marked along the wax. The [[Song dynasty]] in China (960–1279) used [[candle clock]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitrow |first=G. J. |title=Time in History: Views of Time from Prehistory to the Present Day |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |pages=90–91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Nb5KLBxVQC&pg=PA91&dq=Sung+dynasty+incense+clocks#PPA91,M1 |isbn=978-0-19-285211-3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610204616/https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Nb5KLBxVQC&pg=PA91&dq=Sung+dynasty+incense+clocks |archivedate=June 10, 2015 }}</ref>

By the 18th century, candle clocks were being made with weights set into the sides of the candle. As the candle melted, the weights fell off and made a noise as they fell into a bowl.

In the days leading to Christmas, some people burn a candle a set amount to represent each day, as marked on the candle. The type of candle used in this way is called the ''[[Advent candle]]'',<ref>{{cite book | last = Geddes | first = Gordon  |author2=Jane Griffiths | title = Christianity | publisher = Heinemann | page = 89 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn-38NunUnAC&pg=PT98&dq=advent+candle#PPT98,M1 | isbn = 978-0-435-30693-9| year = 2002  }}</ref> although this term is also used to refer to a candle that decorates an [[Advent wreath]].

==Components==

===Wax===

[[File:7candles.JPG|thumb|upright|Unlit candles]]
[[File:Candles (Christmas 2009).jpg|thumb|Candles for Christmas.]]
For most of recorded history candles were made from [[tallow]] (rendered from beef or mutton-fat) or [[beeswax]]. From the mid 1800s they were also made from [[spermaceti]], a waxy substance derived from the [[Sperm whale]], which in turn spurred demand for the substance. Candles were also made from [[stearin]] (initially manufactured from animal fats but now produced almost exclusively from palm waxes).<ref>{{cite web|title=Using stearic acid or stearin in candlemaking|url=http://www.happynews.com/living/create/using-stearic-acid.htm|website=happynews.com|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Stearic acid (stearin)|url=http://www.howtomakecandles.info/cm_article.asp?ID=ADDIT0003|website=howtomakecandles.info|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref> Today, most candles are made from [[paraffin wax]], a product of [[petroleum]] refining.<ref name= Ullmann>Franz Willhöft and Fredrick Horn \"Candles\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_029}}</ref>

Candles can also be made from [[microcrystalline wax]], [[beeswax]] (a byproduct of [[honey collection]]), [[gel]] (a mixture of [[polymer]] and [[mineral oil]]),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Camp|first=William R.|last2=Vollenweider |first2=Jeffrey L. |last3=Schutz |first3= Wendy J. |title=Scented candle gel|journal=United States Patent 5,964,905|date=12 October 1999}}</ref> or some [[Wax#Plant waxes|plant waxes]] (generally palm, [[carnauba wax|carnauba]], [[bayberry]], or [[soybean wax]]).

The size of the flame and corresponding rate of burning is controlled largely by the [[candle wick]].

Production methods utilize [[extrusion moulding]].<ref name= Ullmann/> More traditional production methods entail [[melting]] the solid fuel by the controlled application of heat. The liquid is then poured into a mould, or a wick is repeatedly immersed in the liquid to create a dipped tapered candle. Often [[fragrance oil]]s, [[essential oil]]s or [[aniline]]-based [[dye]] is added.

===Wick===
{{main|Candle wick}}

A candle wick works by [[capillary action]], drawing (\"wicking\") the melted wax or [[fuel]] up to the flame. When the liquid fuel reaches the flame, it [[vaporize]]s and [[Combustion|combusts]]. The candle wick influences how the candle burns.  Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, [[Fireproofing|fire-resistance]], and tethering.

A candle wick is a piece of string or cord that holds the flame of a candle.  Commercial wicks are made from braided cotton.  The wick's [[capillary action|capillarity]] determines the rate at which the melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame.  If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle.  Wicks are often infused with a variety of [[chemical]]s to modify their burning characteristics.  For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished.  Typical agents are [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]].<ref name= Ullmann/>

==Characteristics==

===Light===
[[File:candles.jpg|thumb|A room lit by the glow of many candles]]

Based on measurements of a taper-type, paraffin wax candle, a modern candle typically burns at a steady rate of about 0.1&nbsp;g/min, releasing heat at roughly 80&nbsp;W.<ref name=Hamins>{{cite journal |last1=Hamins |first1=Anthony |last2=Bundy |first2=Matthew |last3=Dillon |first3=Scott E. |date=November 2005 |title=Characterization of Candle Flames |journal=Journal of Fire Protection Engineering |volume=15 |issue= 4|page=277 |publisher= |doi=10.1177/1042391505053163 |url=https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101159  |format=PDF|citeseerx=10.1.1.548.3798 }}</ref> The light produced is about 13 [[lumen (unit)|lumens]], for a [[luminous efficacy]] of about 0.16 lumens per watt (luminous efficacy of a source) – almost a hundred times lower than an [[incandescent light bulb]].

The [[luminous intensity]] of a typical candle is approximately one [[candela]]. The [[SI]] unit, candela, was in fact based on an older unit called the ''[[candlepower]]'', which represented the luminous intensity emitted by a candle made to particular specifications (a \"standard candle\"). The modern unit is defined in a more precise and repeatable way, but was chosen such that a candle's luminous intensity is still about one candela.

===Temperature===
{{see also|Combustion}}

The hottest part of a candle flame is just above the very dull blue part to one side of the flame, at the base. At this point, the flame is about {{convert|1400|C|F}}. However note that this part of the flame is very small and releases little heat energy.  The blue color is due to [[chemiluminescence]], while the visible yellow color is due to radiative emission from hot [[soot]] particles.  The soot is formed through a series of complex chemical reactions, leading from the fuel molecule through molecular growth, until multi-carbon ring compounds are formed.  The thermal structure of a flame is complex, hundreds of degrees over very short distances leading to extremely steep temperature gradients. On average, the flame temperature is about {{convert|1000|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.onfire/on-fire/|title=On Fire – Background Essay|website=PBS LearningMedia|publisher=[[PBS]] and [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> The [[color temperature]] is approximately 1000 K.

===Candle flame===
[[File:Anatomy of a candle flame.svg|thumb|Five zones of a standard domestic candle flame]]

A candle flame is formed because wax vaporizes on burning. A candle flame is widely recognized as having between three and five regions or \"zones\":
* Zone I - this is the non-luminous, lowest, and coolest part of the candle flame.  It is located around the base of the wick where there is insufficient oxygen for fuel to burn.  Temperatures are around {{convert|600|C|F}}.
* Zone II - this is the ''blue zone'' which surrounds the base of the flame.  Here the supply of oxygen is plentiful, and the fuel burns clean and blue.  It is heat from this zone which causes the wax to melt. Temperatures are around {{convert|800|C|F}}
* Zone III - the ''dark zone'' is a region directly above the wick containing unburnt wax.  [[Pyrolysis]] takes place here.  Temperature is around {{convert|1000|C|F}}
*Zone IV - the ''middle'' or ''luminous zone'' is yellow/ white and is located above the dark zone.  It is the brightest zone, but not the hottest.  It is an oxygen-depleted zone with insufficient oxygen to burn all of the wax vapor rising from below it resulting in only partial combustion. The zone also contains unburnt carbon particles. Temperature is around {{convert|1200|C|F}}.
* Zone V - The non-luminous  ''outer zone'' or ''veil'' surrounds Zone IV.  Here the flame is at its hottest, at around {{convert|1400|C|F}}, and complete combustion occurs. It is light blue in color though most of it is invisible.<ref>{{cite web|work=Ohio State University|title=FTIR STUDY OF COMBUSTION SPECIES IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF A CANDLE FLAME|url=https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/55436|accessdate=26 January 2019|author=Allen R. White|date=2013}}</ref><ref>[[National Council of Educational Research and Training]]. \"Science: Textbook for Class VIII\". Publication Department, 2010, p.72.</ref>

The main determinant of the height of a candle flame is the diameter of the wick. This is evidenced in [[tealight]]s where the wick is very thin and the flame is very small. Candles whose main purpose is illumination use a much thicker wick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sunderland |first1=P.B. |last2=Quintiere |first2=J.G. |last3=Tabaka |first3=G.A. |last4=Lian |first4=D. |last5=Chiu |first5=C.-W. |title=Analysis and measurement of candle flame shapes |url=http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~pbs/2011-Sunderland-et-al-PCI.pdf |date=6 October 2010 |journal=Proceedings of the Combustion Institute |volume=33 |pp=2489–2496 |accessdate=2015-02-10}}</ref>

===History of study===
One of [[Michael Faraday]]'s significant works was ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]'', where he gives an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary development, workings and science of candles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1860Faraday-candle.asp |title=Internet History Sourcebooks |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>

==Hazards==
According to the U.S. National Fire Protection Association, candles are a leading source of residential fires in the United States with almost 10% of civilian injuries and 6% of fatalities from fire attributed to candles.<ref>John Hall, NFPA 2009,  {{cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124011/http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files//PDF/Research/Fire_overview_2009.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}.</ref>
A candle flame that is longer than its laminar smoke point will emit [[soot]].<ref>K.M. Allan, J.R. Kaminski, J.C. Bertrand, J. Head, [[Peter B. Sunderland]], Laminar Smoke Points of Wax Candles, Combustion Science and Technology 181 (2009) 800–811.</ref> Proper wick trimming will reduce soot emissions from most candles.

The liquid wax is hot and can cause skin burns, but the amount and temperature are generally rather limited and the burns are seldom serious. The best way to avoid getting burned from splashed wax is to use a [[candle snuffer]] instead of blowing on the flame. A candle snuffer is usually a small metal cup on the end of a long handle. Placing the snuffer over the flame cuts off the oxygen supply. Snuffers were common in the home when candles were the main source of lighting before electric lights were available.  Ornate snuffers, often combined with a taper for lighting, are still found in those churches which regularly use large candles.

Glass candle-holders are sometimes cracked by thermal shock from the candle flame, particularly when the candle burns down to the end. When burning candles in glass holders or jars, users should avoid lighting candles with chipped or cracked containers, and stop use once 1/2&nbsp;inch or less of wax remains.

A former worry regarding the safety of candles was that a [[lead]] core was used in the wicks to keep them upright in container candles. Without a stiff core, the wicks of a container candle could sag and drown in the deep wax pool. Concerns rose that the lead in these wicks would vaporize during the burning process, releasing lead vapors — a known health and developmental hazard. Lead core wicks have not been common since the 1970s. Today, most metal-cored wicks use [[zinc]] or a zinc [[alloy]], which has become the industry standard. Wicks made from specially treated paper and cotton are also available.

==Regulation==
International markets have developed a range of standards and [[regulation]]s to ensure compliance, while maintaining and improving [[safety]], including:
* Europe: GPSD, EN 15493, EN 15494, EN 15426, EN 14059, [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], RAL-GZ 041 Candles (Germany), French Decree 91-1175
* United States: ASTM F2058, ASTM F2179, ASTM F2417, ASTM F2601, ASTM F2326, [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]], CONEG
* China: QB/T 2119 Basic Candle, QB/T 2902 Art Candle, QB/T 2903 Jar Candle, GB/T 22256 Jelly Candle

==Accessories==
[[File:Wick-Trimmer.jpg|thumb|Wick-trimmer]]
===Candle holders===
Decorative candleholders, especially those shaped as a pedestal, are called [[candlestick]]s; if multiple candle tapers are held, the term ''candelabrum'' is also used. The root form of ''[[chandelier]]'' is from the word for candle, but now usually refers to an electric fixture. The word ''chandelier'' is sometimes now used to describe a hanging fixture designed to hold multiple tapers.

Many candle holders use a friction-tight socket to keep the candle upright. In this case, a candle that is slightly too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders were made in the same place, so they were appropriately sized, but [[common market|international trade]] has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. For [[tea light]] candles, there is a variety of candle holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for [[votive candle|votives]]. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive candles. For pillar-type candles, the assortment of candle holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, can be a candle holder for a pillar-style candle. A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. A large glass bowl with a large flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane. The pillar-style candle is placed at the bottom center of the hurricane. A hurricane on a pedestal is sometimes sold as a unit.

A [[bobèche]] is a drip-catching ring, which may also be affixed to a candle holder, or used independently of one. Bobèches can range from ornate metal or glass to simple plastic, cardboard, or wax paper. Use of paper or plastic bobèches is common at events where candles are distributed to a crowd or audience, such as Christmas carolers or people at other concerts/festivals.

===Candle followers===
These are glass or metal tubes with an internal stricture partway along, which sit around the top of a lit candle. As the candle burns, the wax melts and the follower holds the melted wax in, whilst the stricture rests on the topmost solid portion of wax. Candle followers are often deliberately heavy or weighted to ensure they move down as the candle burns lower, maintaining a seal and preventing wax escape. The purpose of a candle follower is threefold:
* To contain the melted wax, making the candle more efficient, avoiding mess, and producing a more even burn.
* As a decoration, either due to the ornate nature of the device, or (in the case of a glass follower) through light dispersion or colouration.
* If necessary, to shield the flame from wind.

Candle followers are often found in churches on [[altar candle]]s.

===Candle snuffers===
{{main|Candle snuffer}}
Candle snuffers are instruments used to extinguish burning candles by smothering the flame with a small metal cup that is suspended from a long handle, and thus depriving it of oxygen. An older meaning refers to a scissor-like tool used to trim the wick of a candle. With skill, this could be done without extinguishing the flame. The instrument now known as a candle snuffer was formerly called an \"extinguisher\" or \"douter\".

A '''candle''' is an ignitable [[candle wick|wick]] embedded in [[wax]], or another flammable solid substance such as [[tallow]], that provides [[light]], and in some cases, a [[Aroma compound|fragrance]].  A candle can also provide [[heat]] or a method of keeping [[time]].

A person who makes candles is traditionally known as a [[chandlery|chandler]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandler|title=Chandler |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref> Various devices have been invented to hold candles, from simple tabletop [[candlestick|candlesticks, also known as candle holders,]] to elaborate [[candelabra]] and  [[chandelier]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandelier |title=chandelier |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>

For a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame from a [[match]] or [[lighter]]) is used to light the candle's wick, which melts and [[vaporizes]] a small amount of fuel (the wax). Once vaporized, the fuel combines with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant [[flame]]. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via [[capillary action]]; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.

As the fuel (wax) is melted and burned, the candle becomes shorter. Portions of the wick that are not emitting vaporized fuel are consumed in the flame. The incineration of the wick limits the length of the exposed portion of the wick, thus maintaining a constant burning temperature and rate of fuel consumption. Some wicks require regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized wick trimmer), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7&nbsp;cm), to promote slower, steady burning, and also to prevent smoking. Special candle-scissors called \"[[Candle snuffer|snuffers]]\" were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher. In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns.  This ensures that the end of the wick gets oxygen and is then consumed by [[fire]]—a self-trimming wick.<ref>[http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz European Candle Association FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154928/http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz |date=2012-01-13 }}.</ref>

{{Main|History of candle making}}
[[File:Roman oil lamp.jpg|thumb|Roman oil lamp]]
Prior to the candle, people used [[oil lamp]]s in which a lit wick rested in a container of liquid oil. Liquid oil lamps had a tendency to spill, and the wick had to be advanced by hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began making true dipped candles from tallow, beginning around 500 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/candles2.html |title=Candles, Roman, 500 BCE |website=Smith College Museum}}</ref> European candles of antiquity were made from various forms of natural fat, tallow, and wax.

[[File:Price's Palmitine Candles00.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Price's Candles]] became the largest candle manufacturer in the world by the end of the 19th century]]

The manufacture of candles became an industrialized mass market in the mid 19th century. In 1834, Joseph Morgan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Joseph_Morgan_and_Son|title=Joseph Morgan and Son |publisher=Graces Guide}}</ref> a [[pewter]]er from [[Manchester]], England, patented a machine that revolutionised candle making.

This allowed candles to be an affordable commodity for the masses.<ref>{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Gordon  | title = Seven Centuries of Light: The Tallow Chandlers Company | publisher = Book Production Consultants  | year = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=OWt03_on0qUC&pg=PA74&dq=Joseph+Morgan+candles+1834 | isbn = 978-1-85757-064-9 | page = 74}}</ref> Candlemakers also began to fashion wicks out of tightly [[braid]]ed (rather than simply twisted) strands of [[cotton]]. This technique makes wicks curl over as they burn, maintaining the height of the wick and therefore the flame. Because much of the excess wick is incinerated, these are referred to as \"self-trimming\" or \"self-consuming\" wicks.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php# |title=A Brief History of Candles |access-date=2015-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318072713/http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php# |archive-date=2013-03-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the mid-1850s, [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] succeeded in distilling [[paraffin wax]] from coal and oil shales at [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]] and developed a commercially viable method of production.<ref>{{cite book | last = Golan | first = Tal  | title = Laws of Men and Laws of Nature: The History of Scientific Expert Testimony in England and America | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2004 | pages = 89–91 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=kQhYsAmcj-EC&pg=PA90&dq=james+young+patent+paraffin#PPA90,M1  | isbn = 978-0674012868}}</ref> Paraffin could be used to make inexpensive candles of high quality. It was a bluish-white wax, which burned cleanly and left no unpleasant odor, unlike [[tallow]] candles. By the end of the 19th century, candles were made from paraffin wax and [[stearic acid]].

By the late 19th century, [[Price's Candles]], based in London, was the largest candle manufacturer in the world.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJo7AwAAQBAJ|title=London's Industrial Heritage|author=Geoff Marshall|year=2013|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780752492391}}</ref> Founded by William Wilson in 1830,<ref>{{cite book | last = Ball  | first = Michael  |author2=David Sunderland | title = An Economic History of London, 1800-1914 | publisher = Routledge | year = 2001 | pages = 131–132 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=MI6JfTiEcdAC&pg=PA132&dq=Prices+Candles+Coconut | isbn = 978-0415246910}}</ref> the company pioneered the implementation of the technique of [[steam distillation]], and was thus able to manufacture candles from a wide range of raw materials, including skin fat, bone fat, fish oil and industrial greases.

Despite advances in candle making, the candle industry declined rapidly upon the introduction of superior methods of lighting, including [[kerosene]] and [[Kerosene lamp|lamps]] and the 1879 invention of the [[incandescent light bulb]]. From this point on, candles came to be marketed as more of a decorative item.

Before the invention of [[electric light]]ing, candles and oil lamps were commonly used for illumination. In areas without electricity, they are still used routinely.  Until the 20th century, candles were more common in northern Europe. In southern Europe and the Mediterranean, oil lamps predominated.

In the developed world today, candles are used mainly for their aesthetic value and scent, particularly to set a soft, warm, or romantic ambiance, for emergency lighting during electrical [[Power failure|power failures]], and for religious or ritual purposes.

===Other uses===
With the fairly consistent and measurable burning of a candle, a common use of candles was to tell the [[candle clock|time]]. The candle designed for this purpose might have time measurements, usually in hours, marked along the wax. The [[Song dynasty]] in China (960–1279) used [[candle clock]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitrow |first=G. J. |title=Time in History: Views of Time from Prehistory to the Present Day |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |pages=90–91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Nb5KLBxVQC&pg=PA91&dq=Sung+dynasty+incense+clocks#PPA91,M1 |isbn=978-0-19-285211-3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610204616/https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Nb5KLBxVQC&pg=PA91&dq=Sung+dynasty+incense+clocks |archivedate=June 10, 2015 }}</ref>

By the 18th century, candle clocks were being made with weights set into the sides of the candle. As the candle melted, the weights fell off and made a noise as they fell into a bowl.

In the days leading to Christmas, some people burn a candle a set amount to represent each day, as marked on the candle. The type of candle used in this way is called the ''[[Advent candle]]'',<ref>{{cite book | last = Geddes | first = Gordon  |author2=Jane Griffiths | title = Christianity | publisher = Heinemann | page = 89 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn-38NunUnAC&pg=PT98&dq=advent+candle#PPT98,M1 | isbn = 978-0-435-30693-9| year = 2002  }}</ref> although this term is also used to refer to a candle that decorates an [[Advent wreath]].

==Components==

===Wax===
[[File:Hentriacontane.svg|thumb|The hydrocarbon [[Hentriacontane|C<sub>31</sub>H<sub>64</sub>]] is a typical component of paraffin wax, from which most modern candles are produced.]]
[[File:7candles.JPG|thumb|upright|Unlit candles]]
[[File:Candles (Christmas 2009).jpg|thumb|Candles for Christmas.]]
For most of recorded history candles were made from [[tallow]] (rendered from beef or mutton-fat) or [[beeswax]]. From the mid 1800s they were also made from [[spermaceti]], a waxy substance derived from the [[Sperm whale]], which in turn spurred demand for the substance. Candles were also made from [[stearin]] (initially manufactured from animal fats but now produced almost exclusively from palm waxes).<ref>{{cite web|title=Using stearic acid or stearin in candlemaking|url=http://www.happynews.com/living/create/using-stearic-acid.htm|website=happynews.com|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Stearic acid (stearin)|url=http://www.howtomakecandles.info/cm_article.asp?ID=ADDIT0003|website=howtomakecandles.info|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref> Today, most candles are made from [[paraffin wax]], a product of [[petroleum]] refining.<ref name= Ullmann>Franz Willhöft and Fredrick Horn \"Candles\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_029}}</ref>

Candles can also be made from [[microcrystalline wax]], [[beeswax]] (a byproduct of [[honey collection]]), [[gel]] (a mixture of [[polymer]] and [[mineral oil]]),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Camp|first=William R.|last2=Vollenweider |first2=Jeffrey L. |last3=Schutz |first3= Wendy J. |title=Scented candle gel|journal=United States Patent 5,964,905|date=12 October 1999}}</ref> or some [[Wax#Plant waxes|plant waxes]] (generally palm, [[carnauba wax|carnauba]], [[bayberry]], or [[soybean wax]]).

The size of the flame and corresponding rate of burning is controlled largely by the [[candle wick]].

Production methods utilize [[extrusion moulding]].<ref name= Ullmann/> More traditional production methods entail [[melting]] the solid fuel by the controlled application of heat. The liquid is then poured into a mould, or a wick is repeatedly immersed in the liquid to create a dipped tapered candle. Often [[fragrance oil]]s, [[essential oil]]s or [[aniline]]-based [[dye]] is added.

===Wick===
{{main|Candle wick}}

A candle wick works by [[capillary action]], drawing (\"wicking\") the melted wax or [[fuel]] up to the flame. When the liquid fuel reaches the flame, it [[vaporize]]s and [[Combustion|combusts]]. The candle wick influences how the candle burns.  Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, [[Fireproofing|fire-resistance]], and tethering.

A candle wick is a piece of string or cord that holds the flame of a candle.  Commercial wicks are made from braided cotton.  The wick's [[capillary action|capillarity]] determines the rate at which the melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame.  If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle.  Wicks are often infused with a variety of [[chemical]]s to modify their burning characteristics.  For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished.  Typical agents are [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]].<ref name= Ullmann/>

==Characteristics==

===Light===
[[File:candles.jpg|thumb|A room lit by the glow of many candles]]

Based on measurements of a taper-type, paraffin wax candle, a modern candle typically burns at a steady rate of about 0.1&nbsp;g/min, releasing heat at roughly 80&nbsp;W.<ref name=Hamins>{{cite journal |last1=Hamins |first1=Anthony |last2=Bundy |first2=Matthew |last3=Dillon |first3=Scott E. |date=November 2005 |title=Characterization of Candle Flames |journal=Journal of Fire Protection Engineering |volume=15 |issue= 4|page=277 |publisher= |doi=10.1177/1042391505053163 |url=https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101159  |format=PDF|citeseerx=10.1.1.548.3798 }}</ref> The light produced is about 13 [[lumen (unit)|lumens]], for a [[luminous efficacy]] of about 0.16 lumens per watt (luminous efficacy of a source) – almost a hundred times lower than an [[incandescent light bulb]].

The [[luminous intensity]] of a typical candle is approximately one [[candela]]. The [[SI]] unit, candela, was in fact based on an older unit called the ''[[candlepower]]'', which represented the luminous intensity emitted by a candle made to particular specifications (a \"standard candle\"). The modern unit is defined in a more precise and repeatable way, but was chosen such that a candle's luminous intensity is still about one candela.

===Temperature===
{{see also|Combustion}}

The hottest part of a candle flame is just above the very dull blue part to one side of the flame, at the base. At this point, the flame is about {{convert|1400|C|F}}. However note that this part of the flame is very small and releases little heat energy.  The blue color is due to [[chemiluminescence]], while the visible yellow color is due to radiative emission from hot [[soot]] particles.  The soot is formed through a series of complex chemical reactions, leading from the fuel molecule through molecular growth, until multi-carbon ring compounds are formed.  The thermal structure of a flame is complex, hundreds of degrees over very short distances leading to extremely steep temperature gradients. On average, the flame temperature is about {{convert|1000|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.onfire/on-fire/|title=On Fire – Background Essay|website=PBS LearningMedia|publisher=[[PBS]] and [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> The [[color temperature]] is approximately 1000 K.

===Candle flame===
[[File:Anatomy of a candle flame.svg|thumb|Five zones of a standard domestic candle flame]]

A candle flame is formed because wax vaporizes on burning. A candle flame is widely recognized as having between three and five regions or \"zones\":
* Zone I - this is the non-luminous, lowest, and coolest part of the candle flame.  It is located around the base of the wick where there is insufficient oxygen for fuel to burn.  Temperatures are around {{convert|600|C|F}}.
* Zone II - this is the ''blue zone'' which surrounds the base of the flame.  Here the supply of oxygen is plentiful, and the fuel burns clean and blue.  It is heat from this zone which causes the wax to melt. Temperatures are around {{convert|800|C|F}}
* Zone III - the ''dark zone'' is a region directly above the wick containing unburnt wax.  [[Pyrolysis]] takes place here.  Temperature is around {{convert|1000|C|F}}
*Zone IV - the ''middle'' or ''luminous zone'' is yellow/ white and is located above the dark zone.  It is the brightest zone, but not the hottest.  It is an oxygen-depleted zone with insufficient oxygen to burn all of the wax vapor rising from below it resulting in only partial combustion. The zone also contains unburnt carbon particles. Temperature is around {{convert|1200|C|F}}.
* Zone V - The non-luminous  ''outer zone'' or ''veil'' surrounds Zone IV.  Here the flame is at its hottest, at around {{convert|1400|C|F}}, and complete combustion occurs. It is light blue in color though most of it is invisible.<ref>{{cite web|work=Ohio State University|title=FTIR STUDY OF COMBUSTION SPECIES IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF A CANDLE FLAME|url=https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/55436|accessdate=26 January 2019|author=Allen R. White|date=2013}}</ref><ref>[[National Council of Educational Research and Training]]. \"Science: Textbook for Class VIII\". Publication Department, 2010, p.72.</ref>

The main determinant of the height of a candle flame is the diameter of the wick. This is evidenced in [[tealight]]s where the wick is very thin and the flame is very small. Candles whose main purpose is illumination use a much thicker wick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sunderland |first1=P.B. |last2=Quintiere |first2=J.G. |last3=Tabaka |first3=G.A. |last4=Lian |first4=D. |last5=Chiu |first5=C.-W. |title=Analysis and measurement of candle flame shapes |url=http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~pbs/2011-Sunderland-et-al-PCI.pdf |date=6 October 2010 |journal=Proceedings of the Combustion Institute |volume=33 |pp=2489–2496 |accessdate=2015-02-10}}</ref>

===History of study===
One of [[Michael Faraday]]'s significant works was ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]'', where he gives an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary development, workings and science of candles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1860Faraday-candle.asp |title=Internet History Sourcebooks |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>

==Hazards==
According to the U.S. National Fire Protection Association, candles are a leading source of residential fires in the United States with almost 10% of civilian injuries and 6% of fatalities from fire attributed to candles.<ref>John Hall, NFPA 2009,  {{cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124011/http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files//PDF/Research/Fire_overview_2009.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}.</ref>
A candle flame that is longer than its laminar smoke point will emit [[soot]].<ref>K.M. Allan, J.R. Kaminski, J.C. Bertrand, J. Head, [[Peter B. Sunderland]], Laminar Smoke Points of Wax Candles, Combustion Science and Technology 181 (2009) 800–811.</ref> Proper wick trimming will reduce soot emissions from most candles.

The liquid wax is hot and can cause skin burns, but the amount and temperature are generally rather limited and the burns are seldom serious. The best way to avoid getting burned from splashed wax is to use a [[candle snuffer]] instead of blowing on the flame. A candle snuffer is usually a small metal cup on the end of a long handle. Placing the snuffer over the flame cuts off the oxygen supply. Snuffers were common in the home when candles were the main source of lighting before electric lights were available.  Ornate snuffers, often combined with a taper for lighting, are still found in those churches which regularly use large candles.

Glass candle-holders are sometimes cracked by thermal shock from the candle flame, particularly when the candle burns down to the end. When burning candles in glass holders or jars, users should avoid lighting candles with chipped or cracked containers, and stop use once 1/2&nbsp;inch or less of wax remains.

A former worry regarding the safety of candles was that a [[lead]] core was used in the wicks to keep them upright in container candles. Without a stiff core, the wicks of a container candle could sag and drown in the deep wax pool. Concerns rose that the lead in these wicks would vaporize during the burning process, releasing lead vapors — a known health and developmental hazard. Lead core wicks have not been common since the 1970s. Today, most metal-cored wicks use [[zinc]] or a zinc [[alloy]], which has become the industry standard. Wicks made from specially treated paper and cotton are also available.

==Regulation==
International markets have developed a range of standards and [[regulation]]s to ensure compliance, while maintaining and improving [[safety]], including:
* Europe: GPSD, EN 15493, EN 15494, EN 15426, EN 14059, [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], RAL-GZ 041 Candles (Germany), French Decree 91-1175
* United States: ASTM F2058, ASTM F2179, ASTM F2417, ASTM F2601, ASTM F2326, [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]], CONEG
* China: QB/T 2119 Basic Candle, QB/T 2902 Art Candle, QB/T 2903 Jar Candle, GB/T 22256 Jelly Candle

==Accessories==
[[File:Wick-Trimmer.jpg|thumb|Wick-trimmer]]
===Candle holders===
Decorative candleholders, especially those shaped as a pedestal, are called [[candlestick]]s; if multiple candle tapers are held, the term ''candelabrum'' is also used. The root form of ''[[chandelier]]'' is from the word for candle, but now usually refers to an electric fixture. The word ''chandelier'' is sometimes now used to describe a hanging fixture designed to hold multiple tapers.

Many candle holders use a friction-tight socket to keep the candle upright. In this case, a candle that is slightly too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders were made in the same place, so they were appropriately sized, but [[common market|international trade]] has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. For [[tea light]] candles, there is a variety of candle holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for [[votive candle|votives]]. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive candles. For pillar-type candles, the assortment of candle holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, can be a candle holder for a pillar-style candle. A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. A large glass bowl with a large flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane. The pillar-style candle is placed at the bottom center of the hurricane. A hurricane on a pedestal is sometimes sold as a unit.

A [[bobèche]] is a drip-catching ring, which may also be affixed to a candle holder, or used independently of one. Bobèches can range from ornate metal or glass to simple plastic, cardboard, or wax paper. Use of paper or plastic bobèches is common at events where candles are distributed to a crowd or audience, such as Christmas carolers or people at other concerts/festivals.

===Candle followers===
These are glass or metal tubes with an internal stricture partway along, which sit around the top of a lit candle. As the candle burns, the wax melts and the follower holds the melted wax in, whilst the stricture rests on the topmost solid portion of wax. Candle followers are often deliberately heavy or weighted to ensure they move down as the candle burns lower, maintaining a seal and preventing wax escape. The purpose of a candle follower is threefold:
* To contain the melted wax, making the candle more efficient, avoiding mess, and producing a more even burn.
* As a decoration, either due to the ornate nature of the device, or (in the case of a glass follower) through light dispersion or colouration.
* If necessary, to shield the flame from wind.

Candle followers are often found in churches on [[altar candle]]s.

===Candle snuffers===
{{main|Candle snuffer}}
Candle snuffers are instruments used to extinguish burning candles by smothering the flame with a small metal cup that is suspended from a long handle, and thus depriving it of oxygen. An older meaning refers to a scissor-like tool used to trim the wick of a candle. With skill, this could be done without extinguishing the flame. The instrument now known as a candle snuffer was formerly called an \"extinguisher\" or \"douter\".

===Names and events===
Mamre is the site where [[Abraham]] pitched the tents for his camp, built an [[altar]] ({{bibleref2|Genesis 13:18}}), and was brought divine tidings, in the guise of three angels, of [[Sarah]]'s pregnancy ({{bibleref2|Genesis 18:1-15}}).

Genesis 13:18 has Abraham settling by 'the great trees of Mamre'. The original Hebrew tradition appears, to judge from a textual variation conserved in the [[Septuagint]], to have referred to a single great oak tree, which Josephus called [[Ogyges]].<ref name=\"Niesiolowski-Spano\" /> Mamre may have been an [[Amorites|Amorite]], a tribal chieftain after whom a grove of trees was named.

The supposed discrepancy is often explained as reflecting the discordance between the different scribal traditions behind the composition of the [[Pentateuch]], the former relating to the [[Yahwist]], the latter to the [[Elohist]] [[recension]], according to the [[documentary hypothesis]] of modern scholarship.<ref>Menahem Haran,''Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel: An Inquiry Into Biblical Cult Phenomena and the Historical Setting of the Priestly School'', Eisenbrauns, 1985 p.53.

==Identification==
'''Ramat el-Khalil''' is the site identified as Mamre in the time of King Herod (1st century BCE), Constantine the Great (3rd century CE), and possibly the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] (12th-13th centuries CE).

'''Khirbet es-Sibte''' (also '''Ain Sebta'''), the present-day site of the so-called [[Oak of Mamre]], two kilometres southwest of Ramat el-Khalil, has been considered since the 19th century as the place where Abraham pitched his tents and saw the angels.<ref>Jericke p.2.</ref>

==History and archaeology==
===Main findings===
The archaeological site of Mamre (Ramat el-Khalil, Grid Ref. 160300/107200) has been first excavated by [[:de|Andreas Evaristus Mader]] in 1926-28, followed by Sayf al-Din Haddad (1977), 'Abd el-Aziz Arjub (1984-85),<ref name=Greenberg/> and Yitzhak Magen (1986-88),<ref name=\"Langfur\"/> Magen publishing his findings in 1991 and 2003.<ref name=Greenberg/> The outstanding components of the site are a large Roman-era enclosure, a Byzantine church, and a Crusader church.<ref name=Greenberg/> The main periods of settlement are: Early Roman, Late Roman, Byzantine, and Crusader, with less substantial findings from the Iron Age IIc and the Hellenistic period.<ref name=Greenberg>{{cite book |first1= Raphael |last1= Greenberg |first2= Adi |last2= Keinan |title= Israeli Archaeological Activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem 1967-2007: A Sourcebook |publisher= Ostracon Press |year= 2009 |page= 130 |isbn= 978-965-91468-0-2 |url= http://alt-arch.org/he/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/WBADB_sourcebook1.pdf |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> Archaeological excavation by Yitzhak Magen indicate that findings previously attributed to the biblical time of the [[Kings of Judea|Kings]] during the Iron Age, and the Hellenistic [[Hasmonean]]s, are in fact of far newer date, [[Byzantine]] or later.<ref name=Kristensen>{{cite book |first= Vlastimil |last= Drbal |title= Pilgrimage and multi-religious worship: Palestinian Mamre in Late Antiquity |editor-first1= Troels Myrup |editor-last1= Kristensen |editor-first2= Wiebke |editor-last2= Friese |work= Excavating Pilgrimage: Archaeological Approaches to Sacred Travel and Movement in the Ancient World |publisher= Taylor & Francis |series= Routledge Studies in Pilgrimage, Religious Travel and Tourism |year= 2017 |page= 245-264 (247) |isbn= 9781351856263 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AUElDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA247 |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Bronze Age===
[[Bronze Age]] pottery shards found at the Ramat el-Khalil site may indicate that the cultic shrine was in use from 2600-2000 BCE,<ref name=\"JETCHP\"/> though there is no archaeological evidence for the site being occupied from the first half of the second millennium down to the end of the Iron Age.<ref name=Pagolu/>

===Herod: the enclosure===
The 2&nbsp;m thick stone wall enclosing area 49&nbsp;m wide and 65&nbsp;m long was constructed by [[Herod the Great]], possibly as a cultic place of worship.<ref>[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor|Murphy-O'Connor, Jerome]] (2008) ''The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700'' Oxford University Press US, {{ISBN|0-19-923666-6}} p 370</ref><ref>Robinson, Edward (1856) ''Biblical Researches in Palestine, 1838-52: A Journal of Travels in the Year 1838'' pp 215-216</ref> It contained an ancient well, more than 5&nbsp;m in diameter, referred to as Abraham's Well.<ref>Jericke p.?.</ref><ref name=Letellier/>

According to Jericke among others, Persian and Hellenistic Mamre was located at nearby Khirbet Nimra, 1 km north of modern Hebron, where a pagan tree cult predated the composition of the biblical Abraham narrative.<ref name=Heyden2016>{{cite book |first= Katharina |last= Heyden |title= Hain der Religionen: Das Abrahamsheiligtum von Mamre als Begegnungsort und locus theologicus |work= Fremdenliebe – Fremdenangst: Zwei akademische Reden zur interreligiösen Begegnungin Spätantike und Gegenwart |publisher= Theologischer Verlag Zürich (TVZ) |year= 2016 |page= 21 (with footnote 10) |lang= German |isbn= 9783290178635 }}</ref> Herod transferred the Mamre tradition 2,5 km to the north, from the site at Khirbet Nimra to the site at Ramet el-Khalil.<ref name=Heyden2016/> This was part of Herod's upgrade of Hebron as a cult centre dedicated to patriarch Abraham, by erecting two shrines: one at [[Machpela Cave|his tomb]], and one at a site he connected to Abraham's place of residence, where the patriarch dined under a tree together with the three men.<ref name=Heyden2016/> It has been noted that Hebron and Mamre were located in Idumaean territory, that both Jews and Idumaeans regarded Abraham as their common ancestor, and that Herod came from an Idumaean family that had only recently converted to Judaism.<ref name=>{{cite book |first= Peter |last= Richardson |title= Herod: king of the Jews and friend of the Romans |publisher= University of South Carolina Press |series= Studies on personalities of the New Testament |year= 1996 |pages= 61-62 |isbn= 9781570031366 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MWTakr1BbvkC&pg=PA61 |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Josephus: the terebinth===
:'''''Josephus' terebinth tree is distinct from the modern [[Oak of Mamre]] and stands at a different location'''''
[[Josephus]] (37–c. 100) records a tradition according to which the terebinth at Mamre was as old as the world itself (''[[The Jewish War|War]]'' 4.534). The site was soaked in legend. Jews, Christians and Pagans made sacrifices on the site, burning animals, and the tree was considered immune to the flames of the sacrifices.<ref name=\"Adler\">William Adler, The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy, in Natalie B.

===Late Roman period: Hadrian's temple===
The Herodian structure was destroyed by [[Simon bar Kokhba]]'s army, only to be rebuilt by the [[Roman emperor]] [[Hadrian]]. Hadrian revived the fair, which had long been an important one as it took place at an intersection forming the transport and communications nub of the southern [[Judea]]n mountains. This ''[[wikt:mercatus|mercatus]]'' (Heb. ''yerid'' or ''shuq'': {{lang-grc|[[wikt:πανήγυρις|πανήγυρις]]}}) or \"fair, market\" was one of the sites, according to a Jewish tradition conserved in [[Jerome]],<ref name=\"Adler\">William Adler, The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy, in Natalie B.

===Rabbinical tradition===
Due to the [[idolatry|idolatrous]] nature of the rituals at the fair, Jews were forbidden to participate by their [[rabbi]]s.<ref name=\"ZS ERP\">Safrai, Zeev (1994) ''The Economy of Roman Palestine'', Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-10243-X}} p 254</ref> According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]:<ref name=\"Adler\" />

===Byzantine Christian rule===
Notwithstanding the rabbinic ban, by the time of [[Constantine the Great]]'s reign (302–337), the market had become an informal interdenominational festival, in addition to its functions as a trade fair, frequented by Christians, Jews and pagans. The cultic shrine was made over for Christian use after [[Eutropia]], Constantine's mother-in-law, visited it and was scandalised by its pagan character.<ref name=\"Safrai\"/> Constantine, informed of these pagan practices, attempted without success to put an end to the festive rituals celebrated around the tree.<ref name=\"Adler\"/> He ordered the ''[[comes]]'' Acacius to destroy all pagan idols and banned the pagan practices.<ref>''Life of Constantine'' By Eusebius, Translated by Averil Cameron, Stuart George Hall Oxford University Press, (1999) {{ISBN|0-19-814917-4}} p 301</ref> The enclosure was then consecrated, Constantine had a [[basilica]] built, dedicated to [[Saint George]] and the enclosure of the [[Terebinth]] of Mamre roofed over, the foundations of which are still visible.<ref name=\"ZS ERP\"/><ref>Fergusson, James (2004) ''Tree and Serpent Worship Or Illustrations of Mythology and Arts in India: In the 1st and 4th Century After Christ'' Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|81-206-1236-1}} p 7</ref>

The 1957 plan and reconstruction of the site made after the excavation performed by German scholar A. E.

The fifth-century account by [[Sozomen]] (''Historia Ecclesiastica'' Book II 4-54) is the most detailed account of the practices at Mamre during the early Christian period.<ref name=\"JETCHP\"/>
{{quote|The place is presently called the Terebinth, and is situated at the distance of fifteen stadia from Hebron, ... .

Very many go there for the sake of business, some to sell and some to buy. The feast is celebrated by a very big congregation of Jews, since they boast of Abraham as their forefather, of heathens since angels came there, of Christians since he who should be born from the Virgin for the salvation of humankind appeared there to that pious man. Everyone venerates this place according to his religion: some praying God the ruler of all, some calling upon the angels and offering libations of wine, burning incense or sacrificing an ox, a goat, a sheep or a cock... Constantine's mother in law (Euthropia), having gone there to fulfill a vow, gave notice of all this to the Emperor. So he wrote to the bishops of Palestine reproaching them for having forgot their mission and permitted such a most holy place to be defiled by those [[libation]]s and sacrifices.'<ref>Frazer, James George (2003) Folklore in the Old Testament Studies in Comparative Religion Legend and Law: Studies in Comparative Religion, Legend, and Law Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7661-3238-2}} p 336</ref>}}

[[Antoninus of Piacenza (pilgrim)|Antoninus of Piacenza]] in his ''Itinerarium'', an account of his journey to the Holy Land (ca.570 CE) comments on the basilica, with its four porticoes, and an unroofed [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. Both Christians and Jews worshipped there, separated by a small screen (''cancellus''). The Jewish worshippers would flock there to celebrate the deposition of Jacob and David on the day after the traditional date of Christ's birthday.<ref>Andrew S. Jacobs, ''Remains of the Jews: The Holy Land and Christian Empire in Late Antiquity,'' Stanford University Press, 2004 p.130.</ref>

[[Arculf]], a Frankish bishop who toured the Levant in around 680, writes, indicating a slightly erroneous location in relation to the Tombs of the Patriarchs:	
<blockquote>''A mile to the north of [[Cave of Machpelah|the Tombs]] that have been described above, is the very grassy and flowery hill of Mambre, looking towards Hebron, which lies to the south of it. This little mountain, which is called Mambre, has a level summit, at the north side of which a great stone church has been built, in the right side of which between the two walls of this great Basilica, the Oak of Mambre, wonderful to relate, stands rooted in the earth; it is also called the oak of Abraham, because under it he once hospitably received the Angels. St. Hieronymus elsewhere relates, that this tree had existed from the beginning of the world to the reign of the Emperor Constantine; but he did not say that it had utterly perished, perhaps because at that time, although the whole of that vast tree was not to be seen as it had been formerly, yet a spurious trunk still remained rooted in the ground, protected under the roof of the church, of the height of two men; from this wasted spurious trunk, which has been cut on all sides by axes, small chips are carried to the different provinces of the world, on account of the veneration and memory of that oak, under which, as has been mentioned above, that famous and notable visit of the Angels was granted to the patriarch Abraham.'' <ref name=\"PPTS\">{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti03paleuoft#page/n57/mode/2up/search/hebron |title=The Pilgrimage of Arculfus in the Holy Land (About the Year A.D. 670) |author=Arculf |website=archive.org |publisher=[[Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society]] |location=London |date=1895 |pages=33–34 |access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref></blockquote>

A vignette of the Constantinian basilica with its colonnaded atrium appears on the 6th-century [[Madaba Map]], under the partially preserved Greek caption \"Arbo, also the Terebinth.

===Early Muslim period===

===After mid-12th century: new locations===
The last clear identification and description of the Byzantine church remains at Ramat el-Khalil come from the Russian pilgrim known as [[Abbot Daniel]] (1106/8).<ref name=\"NegevGibson\"/> After the middle of the 12th century the reports become vague and the location of \"Abraham's Oak\" seems to have migrated to one or more locations situated on the road connecting Ramat el-Khalil with Hebron.<ref name=\"NegevGibson\"/> What is nowadays considered the traditional location of the Oak of Abraham is a site originally known in Arabic as Ain Sebta,<ref name=\"NegevGibson\">{{cite book |work=Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land |title=Mamre (Plain of), and Ramat el-Khalil |author=Avraham Negev and Shimon Gibson |year=2001 |location=New York and London |publisher=Continuum |pages=312–313, 427–428 |isbn=0-8264-1316-1 }}</ref> which used to be outside historical Hebron but is now within the urban sprawl of the Palestinian city.

As written in a footnote from an 1895 publication of Arculf's pilgrimage report, \"[t]he Oak or Terebinth of Abraham has been shown in two different sites. Arculf and many others (Jerome, [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Itin[erarium] Hierosol[ymitanum]]], Sozomen, Eucherius [possibly [[Eucherius of Lyon]]], [[Benjamin of Tudela]], the Abbot Daniel,.... etc.) seem to point to the ruin of er Râmeh, near which is Beit el Khulil, or Abraham's House, with a fine spring well. This is still held by the Jews to be the Oak of Mamre. The Christians point to another site, [[Oak of Mamre|Ballûtet Sebta]], where is a fine specimen of Sindian ([[Quercus pseudococcifera|Quercus Pseudococcifera]]).\"<ref name=\"PPTS\"/> ''Ballut'' is the Arabic word for oak.

==Hebrew Bible==
===Names and events===
Mamre is the site where [[Abraham]] pitched the tents for his camp, built an [[altar]] ({{bibleref2|Genesis 13:18}}), and was brought divine tidings, in the guise of three angels, of [[Sarah]]'s pregnancy ({{bibleref2|Genesis 18:1-15}}).

Genesis 13:18 has Abraham settling by 'the great trees of Mamre'.

The supposed discrepancy is often explained as reflecting the discordance between the different scribal traditions behind the composition of the [[Pentateuch]], the former relating to the [[Yahwist]], the latter to the [[Elohist]] [[recension]], according to the [[documentary hypothesis]] of modern scholarship.<ref>Menahem Haran,''Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel: An Inquiry Into Biblical Cult Phenomena and the Historical Setting of the Priestly School'', Eisenbrauns, 1985 p.53. The third, Priestly recension excludes any such attachment of Abraham to the Terebinth cult.</ref>

==Identification==
'''Ramat el-Khalil''' is the site identified as Mamre in the time of King Herod (1st century BCE), Constantine the Great (3rd century CE), and possibly the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] (12th-13th centuries CE).

'''Khirbet es-Sibte''' (also '''Ain Sebta'''), the present-day site of the so-called [[Oak of Mamre]], two kilometres southwest of Ramat el-Khalil, has been considered since the 19th century as the place where Abraham pitched his tents and saw the angels.<ref>Jericke p.2.</ref>

==History and archaeology==
===Main findings===
The archaeological site of Mamre (Ramat el-Khalil, Grid Ref. 160300/107200) has been first excavated by [[:de|Andreas Evaristus Mader]] in 1926-28, followed by Sayf al-Din Haddad (1977), 'Abd el-Aziz Arjub (1984-85),<ref name=Greenberg/> and Yitzhak Magen (1986-88),<ref name=\"Langfur\"/> Magen publishing his findings in 1991 and 2003.<ref name=Greenberg/> The outstanding components of the site are a large Roman-era enclosure, a Byzantine church, and a Crusader church.<ref name=Greenberg/> The main periods of settlement are: Early Roman, Late Roman, Byzantine, and Crusader, with less substantial findings from the Iron Age IIc and the Hellenistic period.<ref name=Greenberg>{{cite book |first1= Raphael |last1= Greenberg |first2= Adi |last2= Keinan |title= Israeli Archaeological Activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem 1967-2007: A Sourcebook |publisher= Ostracon Press |year= 2009 |page= 130 |isbn= 978-965-91468-0-2 |url= http://alt-arch.org/he/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/WBADB_sourcebook1.pdf |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> Archaeological excavation by Yitzhak Magen indicate that findings previously attributed to the biblical time of the [[Kings of Judea|Kings]] during the Iron Age, and the Hellenistic [[Hasmonean]]s, are in fact of far newer date, [[Byzantine]] or later.<ref name=Kristensen>{{cite book |first= Vlastimil |last= Drbal |title= Pilgrimage and multi-religious worship: Palestinian Mamre in Late Antiquity |editor-first1= Troels Myrup |editor-last1= Kristensen |editor-first2= Wiebke |editor-last2= Friese |work= Excavating Pilgrimage: Archaeological Approaches to Sacred Travel and Movement in the Ancient World |publisher= Taylor & Francis |series= Routledge Studies in Pilgrimage, Religious Travel and Tourism |year= 2017 |page= 245-264 (247) |isbn= 9781351856263 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AUElDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA247 |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Bronze Age===
[[Bronze Age]] pottery shards found at the Ramat el-Khalil site may indicate that the cultic shrine was in use from 2600-2000 BCE,<ref name=\"JETCHP\"/> though there is no archaeological evidence for the site being occupied from the first half of the second millennium down to the end of the Iron Age.<ref name=Pagolu/>

===Herod: the enclosure===
The 2&nbsp;m thick stone wall enclosing area 49&nbsp;m wide and 65&nbsp;m long was constructed by [[Herod the Great]], possibly as a cultic place of worship.<ref>[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor|Murphy-O'Connor, Jerome]] (2008) ''The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700'' Oxford University Press US, {{ISBN|0-19-923666-6}} p 370</ref><ref>Robinson, Edward (1856) ''Biblical Researches in Palestine, 1838-52: A Journal of Travels in the Year 1838'' pp 215-216</ref> It contained an ancient well, more than 5&nbsp;m in diameter, referred to as Abraham's Well.<ref>Jericke p.?.</ref><ref name=Letellier/>

According to Jericke among others, Persian and Hellenistic Mamre was located at nearby Khirbet Nimra, 1 km north of modern Hebron, where a pagan tree cult predated the composition of the biblical Abraham narrative.<ref name=Heyden2016>{{cite book |first= Katharina |last= Heyden |title= Hain der Religionen: Das Abrahamsheiligtum von Mamre als Begegnungsort und locus theologicus |work= Fremdenliebe – Fremdenangst: Zwei akademische Reden zur interreligiösen Begegnungin Spätantike und Gegenwart |publisher= Theologischer Verlag Zürich (TVZ) |year= 2016 |page= 21 (with footnote 10) |lang= German |isbn= 9783290178635 }}</ref> Herod transferred the Mamre tradition 2,5 km to the north, from the site at Khirbet Nimra to the site at Ramet el-Khalil.<ref name=Heyden2016/> This was part of Herod's upgrade of Hebron as a cult centre dedicated to patriarch Abraham, by erecting two shrines: one at [[Machpela Cave|his tomb]], and one at a site he connected to Abraham's place of residence, where the patriarch dined under a tree together with the three men.<ref name=Heyden2016/> It has been noted that Hebron and Mamre were located in Idumaean territory, that both Jews and Idumaeans regarded Abraham as their common ancestor, and that Herod came from an Idumaean family that had only recently converted to Judaism.<ref name=>{{cite book |first= Peter |last= Richardson |title= Herod: king of the Jews and friend of the Romans |publisher= University of South Carolina Press |series= Studies on personalities of the New Testament |year= 1996 |pages= 61-62 |isbn= 9781570031366 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MWTakr1BbvkC&pg=PA61 |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Josephus: the terebinth===
:'''''Josephus' terebinth tree is distinct from the modern [[Oak of Mamre]] and stands at a different location'''''
[[Josephus]] (37–c. 100) records a tradition according to which the terebinth at Mamre was as old as the world itself (''[[The Jewish War|War]]'' 4.534). The site was soaked in legend. Jews, Christians and Pagans made sacrifices on the site, burning animals, and the tree was considered immune to the flames of the sacrifices.<ref name=\"Adler\">William Adler, The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy, in Natalie B.

===Late Roman period: Hadrian's temple===
The Herodian structure was destroyed by [[Simon bar Kokhba]]'s army, only to be rebuilt by the [[Roman emperor]] [[Hadrian]]. Hadrian revived the fair, which had long been an important one as it took place at an intersection forming the transport and communications nub of the southern [[Judea]]n mountains. This ''[[wikt:mercatus|mercatus]]'' (Heb. ''yerid'' or ''shuq'': {{lang-grc|[[wikt:πανήγυρις|πανήγυρις]]}}) or \"fair, market\" was one of the sites, according to a Jewish tradition conserved in [[Jerome]],<ref name=\"Adler\">William Adler, The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy, in Natalie B.

===Rabbinical tradition===
Due to the [[idolatry|idolatrous]] nature of the rituals at the fair, Jews were forbidden to participate by their [[rabbi]]s.<ref name=\"ZS ERP\">Safrai, Zeev (1994) ''The Economy of Roman Palestine'', Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-10243-X}} p 254</ref> According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]:<ref name=\"Adler\" />

===Byzantine Christian rule===
Notwithstanding the rabbinic ban, by the time of [[Constantine the Great]]'s reign (302–337), the market had become an informal interdenominational festival, in addition to its functions as a trade fair, frequented by Christians, Jews and pagans. The cultic shrine was made over for Christian use after [[Eutropia]], Constantine's mother-in-law, visited it and was scandalised by its pagan character.<ref name=\"Safrai\"/> Constantine, informed of these pagan practices, attempted without success to put an end to the festive rituals celebrated around the tree.<ref name=\"Adler\"/> He ordered the ''[[comes]]'' Acacius to destroy all pagan idols and banned the pagan practices.<ref>''Life of Constantine'' By Eusebius, Translated by Averil Cameron, Stuart George Hall Oxford University Press, (1999) {{ISBN|0-19-814917-4}} p 301</ref> The enclosure was then consecrated, Constantine had a [[basilica]] built, dedicated to [[Saint George]] and the enclosure of the [[Terebinth]] of Mamre roofed over, the foundations of which are still visible.<ref name=\"ZS ERP\"/><ref>Fergusson, James (2004) ''Tree and Serpent Worship Or Illustrations of Mythology and Arts in India: In the 1st and 4th Century After Christ'' Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|81-206-1236-1}} p 7</ref>

The 1957 plan and reconstruction of the site made after the excavation performed by German scholar A. E.

The fifth-century account by [[Sozomen]] (''Historia Ecclesiastica'' Book II 4-54) is the most detailed account of the practices at Mamre during the early Christian period.<ref name=\"JETCHP\"/>
{{quote|The place is presently called the Terebinth, and is situated at the distance of fifteen stadia from Hebron, ... .

Very many go there for the sake of business, some to sell and some to buy. The feast is celebrated by a very big congregation of Jews, since they boast of Abraham as their forefather, of heathens since angels came there, of Christians since he who should be born from the Virgin for the salvation of humankind appeared there to that pious man. Everyone venerates this place according to his religion: some praying God the ruler of all, some calling upon the angels and offering libations of wine, burning incense or sacrificing an ox, a goat, a sheep or a cock... Constantine's mother in law (Euthropia), having gone there to fulfill a vow, gave notice of all this to the Emperor. So he wrote to the bishops of Palestine reproaching them for having forgot their mission and permitted such a most holy place to be defiled by those [[libation]]s and sacrifices.'<ref>Frazer, James George (2003) Folklore in the Old Testament Studies in Comparative Religion Legend and Law: Studies in Comparative Religion, Legend, and Law Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7661-3238-2}} p 336</ref>}}

[[Antoninus of Piacenza (pilgrim)|Antoninus of Piacenza]] in his ''Itinerarium'', an account of his journey to the Holy Land (ca.570 CE) comments on the basilica, with its four porticoes, and an unroofed [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. Both Christians and Jews worshipped there, separated by a small screen (''cancellus''). The Jewish worshippers would flock there to celebrate the deposition of Jacob and David on the day after the traditional date of Christ's birthday.<ref>Andrew S. Jacobs, ''Remains of the Jews: The Holy Land and Christian Empire in Late Antiquity,'' Stanford University Press, 2004 p.130.</ref>

[[Arculf]], a Frankish bishop who toured the Levant in around 680, writes, indicating a slightly erroneous location in relation to the Tombs of the Patriarchs:	
<blockquote>''A mile to the north of [[Cave of Machpelah|the Tombs]] that have been described above, is the very grassy and flowery hill of Mambre, looking towards Hebron, which lies to the south of it. This little mountain, which is called Mambre, has a level summit, at the north side of which a great stone church has been built, in the right side of which between the two walls of this great Basilica, the Oak of Mambre, wonderful to relate, stands rooted in the earth; it is also called the oak of Abraham, because under it he once hospitably received the Angels. St. Hieronymus elsewhere relates, that this tree had existed from the beginning of the world to the reign of the Emperor Constantine; but he did not say that it had utterly perished, perhaps because at that time, although the whole of that vast tree was not to be seen as it had been formerly, yet a spurious trunk still remained rooted in the ground, protected under the roof of the church, of the height of two men; from this wasted spurious trunk, which has been cut on all sides by axes, small chips are carried to the different provinces of the world, on account of the veneration and memory of that oak, under which, as has been mentioned above, that famous and notable visit of the Angels was granted to the patriarch Abraham.'' <ref name=\"PPTS\">{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti03paleuoft#page/n57/mode/2up/search/hebron |title=The Pilgrimage of Arculfus in the Holy Land (About the Year A.D. 670) |author=Arculf |website=archive.org |publisher=[[Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society]] |location=London |date=1895 |pages=33–34 |access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref></blockquote>

===Early Muslim period===

===After mid-12th century: new locations===
The last clear identification and description of the Byzantine church remains at Ramat el-Khalil come from the Russian pilgrim known as [[Abbot Daniel]] (1106/8).<ref name=\"NegevGibson\"/> After the middle of the 12th century the reports become vague and the location of \"Abraham's Oak\" seems to have migrated to one or more locations situated on the road connecting Ramat el-Khalil with Hebron.<ref name=\"NegevGibson\"/> What is nowadays considered the traditional location of the Oak of Abraham is a site originally known in Arabic as Ain Sebta,<ref name=\"NegevGibson\">{{cite book |work=Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land |title=Mamre (Plain of), and Ramat el-Khalil |author=Avraham Negev and Shimon Gibson |year=2001 |location=New York and London |publisher=Continuum |pages=312–313, 427–428 |isbn=0-8264-1316-1 }}</ref> which used to be outside historical Hebron but is now within the urban sprawl of the Palestinian city.

As written in a footnote from an 1895 publication of Arculf's pilgrimage report, \"[t]he Oak or Terebinth of Abraham has been shown in two different sites. Arculf and many others (Jerome, [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Itin[erarium] Hierosol[ymitanum]]], Sozomen, Eucherius [possibly [[Eucherius of Lyon]]], [[Benjamin of Tudela]], the Abbot Daniel,.... etc.) seem to point to the ruin of er Râmeh, near which is Beit el Khulil, or Abraham's House, with a fine spring well. This is still held by the Jews to be the Oak of Mamre. The Christians point to another site, [[Oak of Mamre|Ballûtet Sebta]], where is a fine specimen of Sindian ([[Quercus pseudococcifera|Quercus Pseudococcifera]]).\"<ref name=\"PPTS\"/> ''Ballut'' is the Arabic word for oak.

'''Grangegorman''' ({{Irish place name| Gráinseach Ghormáin}}) is a suburb on the [[Northside, Dublin|northside]] of [[Dublin]] city, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The area is administered by [[Dublin City Council]]. It was best known for decades as the location of [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)|St Brendan's Hospital]], which was the main psychiatric hospital serving the greater Dublin region. The area is currently the subject of a major redevelopment plan under the aegis of the [[Grangegorman Development Agency]], including the new [[Technological University Dublin]] campus.

Grangegorman is also a [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in the historical [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]].<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/2977.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - Grangegorman civil parish</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Grangegorman, as with other [[placenames]] containing the name \"gorman\" in the [[Leinster]] region, probably indicates that at one time this territory was held by the [[Uí Bairrche]], an [[Irish clans|Irish clan]] based in Leinster. The two main representatives of this clan were Uí Treasaig (Tracey) and Mac Gormáin (MacGorman). They were displaced following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] from the twelfth-century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tracey|first=Declan|title=Uí Bairrche (Leinster)|url=http://traceyclann.com/index_files/..%5Cfiles%5CUi%20Bairrche.htm|work=Tracey Family: An Irish Family History|accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref>

Grangegorman has evolved over time to its current boundaries, which, like those of most Dublin suburbs, are imprecise, while for the purposes of redevelopment, an extended \"neighbourhood\" was defined.  A major historic feature was the Bradogue River, now culverted but still cutting right through the area on its way to the [[River Liffey]].

===Modern suburb of Grangegorman===
Grangegorman is located in the [[Dublin 7]] [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]], north of the [[River Liffey]] and about 1&nbsp;km from [[Dublin]] city centre, and its boundaries run, approximately, along Brunswick Street North, Prussia Street and Manor Street, the [[R101 road (Ireland)|North Circular Road]] and Phibsborough Road and Constitution Hill. Grangegorman is surrounded to the south east by [[Smithfield, Dublin|Smithfield]] to the west by [[Stoneybatter]], north by [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]], to the north and east by [[Phibsborough]] / [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]].

The geographical definition of the north Dublin [[District Electoral Division|electoral division]] known as Arran Quay B, encompasses Grangegorman. The 2006 [[Census#Ireland|Census]] gives the population of Arran Quay B as 3,692. This represents a 19.5 per cent increase from the population of the area in 2002.<ref name=cso20065960>{{cite book|last=Central Statistics Office, Ireland|year=2007|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Amended%20census2006_%20Volume%201%20Pop%20Classified%20by%20Area.pdf|title=Census 2006 Volume I: Population Defined by Area|location=Dublin|pages=59–60}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Grangegorman Development Agency|title=GDA Draft Strategic Plan 2010: Environmental Report|date=2 November 2010|location=Dublin|page=8 (chapter 6), fig 6.3|url=http://www.grangegormandevelopmentagency.ie/assets/strategic_plan/GG_Strategic_Plan_Corrected_Environmental_Report.pdf}}</ref>

===The historical civil parish of Grangegorman===
Grangegorman [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] consisted of five separate districts comprising Grangegorman North, South, East, West and Middle. According to this division, Grangegorman at the start of the nineteenth century was spread over a significant area of north west Dublin relative to its present contracted state. Bordered by the parishes of [[Castleknock]], [[Finglas]], [[Glasnevin]], St. George's, St. Paul's and [[St. Michan's Church|St. Michan's]] it encompassed the localities of Broadstone, Cabra, Phibsborough and the northern half of Stoneybatter .<ref>This is the commercial site for Ordnance Survey Ireland but you can view the map without having to purchase it. {{cite web|url=http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,714099,735570,5,7|title=Ordnance Survey Map 1802|last=Ordnance Survey Ireland|accessdate=20 March 2011|year=1802|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829114800/http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,714099,735570,5,7|archive-date=29 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The census data of 1901 records a population of 14,970 in the civil parish of Grangegorman while that for 1971, the last year for which there is any data, records a population of 32,105, equalling a 114.5 per cent increase between these dates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Central Statistics Office, Ireland|year=1972|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/census_1971_results/Volume1/A%20C%201%201971%20V1.pdf|title=Census of Population of Ireland 1971 Volume I: Population of District Electoral Divisions, Towns and Larger Units of Area|location=Dublin|page=147}}</ref>

===The Neighbourhood of Grangegorman===
The 'Neighbourhood of Grangegorman' is defined by Irish statute, the ''Grangegorman Development Agency Act (2005)''. Schedule 2, section 4 of this act defines the 'Neighbourhood of Grangegorman' as consisting of the [[District Electoral Division|electoral wards]] of [[Dublin quays|Arran Quay]] A, Arran Quay B, Arran Quay C, Arran Quay D, Arran Quay E, Inns Quay B, Inns Quay C and Cabra East C. Essentially, this act, for the purposes of the statutory body of the [[Grangegorman Development Agency]], extends the spatial definition of Grangegorman as far south as the River Liffey, and encompasses parts of east Cabra, Phibsborough, Broadstone and Stoneybatter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ireland|year=2005|url=http://www.achtanna.ie/en.act.2005.0021.6.html|title=Grangegorman Development Agency Act (2005), Schedule 2, Section 4}} For a map of the electoral wards comprising the region defined by this statute as the ''Neighbourhood of Grangegorman'', see: {{cite book|last=Grangegorman Development Agency|title=GDA Draft Strategic Plan 2010: Environmental Report|date=2 November 2010|location=Dublin|page=8 (chapter 6), fig. 6.3|url=http://www.grangegormandevelopmentagency.ie/assets/strategic_plan/GG_Strategic_Plan_Corrected_Environmental_Report.pdf}}</ref>

According to this definition the population of the 'Neighbourhood of Grangegorman' was equal to 24,534 in 2006.<ref name=cso20065960/>

==History==

Along with [[Stoneybatter]] and [[Broadstone, Dublin|Glassmanogue]], Grangegorman was recorded in 1610 as one of only three remote villages in this region and at that stage, lying north of [[Oxmantown|Ostman town]] and north of the [[River Liffey]], they were not joined to the city of Dublin.<ref>Glasmanogue, although covering a wider region, was a village centred around the location of present day [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]] at the point where Constitution Hill meets the modern Phibsborough Road. {{cite book|last=Cromwell|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Cromwell (antiquary)|year=1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhUHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA43|title=Excursions through Ireland Volume I|location=London|page=43}} {{cite book|last=McGregor|first=John James|year=1821|url=https://archive.org/details/newpictureofdubl00mcgr|quote=grange.|title=New Picture of Dublin|publisher=Johnston|location=Dublin|page=[https://archive.org/details/newpictureofdubl00mcgr/page/56 56]}}</ref>

The Rev. William Basil Kingsbury Maturin (1803-1887), a Tractarian, was the Church of Ireland perpetual curate of Grangegorman and also librarian of [[Archbishop Marsh's Library]], Dublin, from 1872 until 1887.<ref>Muriel McCarthy, ''Marsh's Library: All Graduates and Gentlemen''. 2nd ed. Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2003</ref><ref>\"Maturin, William\" in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''</ref>

[[File:Richmond District Asylum and North Dublin Union.png|thumb|right|Map (1862) showing the north west of Dublin including the eastern half of the region of Grangegorman.<ref>On this map is shown the Richmond General Penitentiary (1810), the new North Dublin Union (1791) and the Richmond Surgical Hospital (1810), which was rebuilt in the early 20th century. As shown, the original quadrangular building of the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum (1815) was built beside the new premises of the North Dublin Union. The Richmond Asylum also purchased land and constructed buildings on the western side of Grangegorman Lane. A tunnel running underground across Grangegorman Lane connected the east and west half of the Richmond's facilities. The original section on the eastern half became known as the \"lower house\" which that on the western side became known as the \"upper house\" or \"male house\". Not shown are the Hardwicke Fever Hospital (1803) or the Whitworth Chronic Hospital (1814) and its Dispensary (1820). These medical buildings were situated on Brunswick Street North or off Morning Star Avenue. This avenue is shown on the map although it is not named. It is the avenue leading northward from Brunswick Street North towards the North Dublin Union. The House of Industry (1773) became the North Dublin Union following the passage of the Irish Poor Law (1838).</ref>]]

In the fourteenth-century Dublin was a small walled city with perhaps 10,000 inhabitants. At this time Grangegorman functioned as one of three home farms, the others being [[Glasnevin]] and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as [[Deansgrange]]), which served to meet the expenditure of the [[Prior]] of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at The Church of the Holy Trinity. The [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] of this priory served The Church of the Holy Trinity, which was the State Church until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the sixteenth-century when it was re-established as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mac Giolla Phadraig|first=Brian|year=1938|title=14th century life in a Dublin Monastery|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69, 72}}</ref> The farm buildings at Grangegorman consisted of one large hall with some rooms attached and an enclosed farmyard around which there stood a barn, a malthouse, a workshop and a haggard (a farm enclosure for stacking grain or hay, etc.). All of these buildings had thatched roofs.<ref name=macg75>{{cite journal|last=Mac Giolla Phadraig|first=Brian|year=1938|title=14th century life in a Dublin Monastery|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=3|page=75}}</ref> The [[Manor house|Manor]] of Grangegorman was located in the north end of [[Stoneybatter]] in present-day Manor Street.

The territory of Grangegorman has had a long association with orchards which only passed into history in the mid-nineteenth century. The lease of Grangegorman dated 1485 refers to its lands as \"the Orchard\". With the dissolution of the monasteries, [[King Henry VIII]] on 10 May 1541 by [[letters patent]] authorised the transformation of the Prior and Canons of Christ Church to a [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] and [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]]. The lease granted that same year refers to \"the Great Orchard\" and in 1542 to \"an orchard belonging to the Dean situate beyond the town of Oxmantown Green\". In 1560 the lease simply referred to '''\"the Dean's Orchard\"'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|year=1945|title=The district of Grangegorman (Part III)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=7|issue=3|page=103}}</ref>

The possession of the Manor of Grangegorman passed into the hands of Rt. Hon. Francis Agard after the formation of Dean and Chapter for the management of Christ Church Cathedral. Following Agard's death in 1577, this possession passed to the control of his son-in-law, [[Henry Harington (d. 1613)|Sir Henry Harrington]]. In the period after the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]], the residential expanse of Grangegorman consisted of forty houses. The Manor House at this time was held by Sir [[John Stanley (died 1674)|Thomas Stanley]]. It is assumed that the domicile to which the now defunct Stanley Street once led was the manorial house.<ref>{{cite book |author=Old Dublin Society |year=1945 |title=Dublin Historical Record |volume=7–9 |publisher=The Old Dublin Society|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&dq=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IdecUvuEHYWS7Aal-IFI&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg 67]}}</ref> This site is currently occupied by the Stanhope Street Convent of the [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sisters of Charity]]. In 1674 the Manor of Grangegorman was held by [[Sir John Stanley, 1st Baronet|Sir John Stanley]] (the son of the previous owner). In the early eighteenth-century it passed to [[Charles Monck, 1st Viscount Monck|Charles Monck]] who was Stanley's nephew and an ancestor of [[Henry Monck, 1st Earl of Rathdowne|Viscount Monck]], the Earl of Rathdowne who was the landlord holding most of the property in the area.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|year=1945|title=The district of Grangegorman (Part III)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=7|issue=3|pages=103–04}}</ref>

=== The House of Industry ===
{{main|House of Industry (Dublin)}}

[[File:Whitworth Hospital.jpg|right|thumb|The Whitworth Hospital (1814), located off Morning Star Avenue.]]

From the eighteenth century onwards, Grangegorman was to be transformed from an agricultural hamlet to an urban centre dominated by penal and welfare institutions. In 1704 Dublin's first [[House of Industry]] was established on St. James's Street south of the River Liffey, on the site currently occupied by [[St. James's Hospital]]. However, from 1729 this institution was converted into the rather notorious [[Foundling hospital#Ireland|Dublin Foundling Hospital]]. In 1771–72 a philanthropic body called \"The Corporation for the Relief of the Poor\" was instituted following the passage of permissive legislation and this entity was responsible for the opening in 1773 of Dublin's second House of Industry<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tutty|first=M.J.|year=1961|title=Dublin's oldest charity|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=16|issue=3|page=73}}</ref> which was situated at the site of the derelict malthouse on Channel Row on what is now North Brunswick Street.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|year=1992|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|page=5}}</ref> Channel Row at this time was considered to form part of the locality of Glassmanogue to which also belonged the area known as Broadstone. The establishment of this institution was to be the single most important factor in shaping the urban character of Grangegorman as a site increasingly predominated by the presence of a range of institutions meeting nineteenth-century expectations of philanthropy, care and social control.<ref>The minutes of the Corporation's first meeting on Monday 3 August 1772 describes its purpose as a body in the following terms: 'The Corporation instituted for the relief of the Poor and for punishing Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars in the County of the City of Dublin'. Quoted in, {{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|page=45}}</ref>

The decision to site the House of Industry in this part of the city no doubt reflected the fact that the local population in Grangegorman and the surrounding districts of the north west of Dublin were and are overwhelming proletarian in nature. Indeed, this reflects a long-standing east-west divide in the city, which continues into the present day. In the parishes of St. Paul's and St. Michan's, resting either side of Smithfield in the north west, between 76 per cent and 79 per cent of the population were considered working class in 1797. Conversely, in the parishes of St. Thomas and St. George in the north east of the city the percentage of the population which was working class was 45 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Tommy|year=1944|title=Whitelaw's 1798 Census of Dublin|journal=History Ireland|volume=2|issue=3|page=14}}</ref> A degree of elite distaste toward the behaviour of working class populations is revealed in the visitation report of an episcopalian archbishop to the region of Grangegorman-Glassmanogue in 1727 when he described the local population, who lacked a church at this point, as lewd and unruly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Canon E.J.|year=1940|title=St. Michan's Parish in the eighteenth century|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=3|issue=1|page=3}}</ref>

In 1787 the Governors of the House of Industry considered the need for new accommodation to provide facilities for some two thousand inmates. The old malt house was in a ruinous condition and by the 1790s was deemed in danger of collapse. In September 1791 work began on the New House of Industry at a plot adjoining and to the north of the original building. The site of this building, now demolished, was located at the end of Morning Star Avenue. In 1798 the Governors of the House of Industry petitioned the [[Irish House of Commons]] to build a proper infirmary. Work on this, the Hardwicke Fever Hospital, began in 1803. To cope with the increasing number of children in the workhouse, the Bedford Asylum for Industrious Children, named after the then Lord Lieutenant and the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and designed by the noted architect, [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]] to accommodate one thousand children, was constructed in 1806 on a site on North Brunswick Street. To care for the 'ruptured poor', the [[Richmond Surgical Hospital]] was opened in 1810. The building used for this hospital had been a convent constructed in 1688 by the [[Benedictine Nuns]] in Channel Row, opposite Red Cow Lane. Subsequently, it passed into the possession of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican Nuns]] who largely rebuilt the structure. The hospital was subsequently rebuilt in 1900 in distinctive red-brick. This building still stands and from 1996 to 2013 functioned as the Dublin Metropolitan Court before being purchased by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which after extensive renovations reopened the building on 20th April 2018 (117 years to the day since the building was originally opened) as an education and events centre<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therichmond.ie/history|title=History|website=The Richmond Education and Event Centre|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. In 1814 the [[Whitworth Hospital]] for chronic patients was built on a site just to the south of the new House of Industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and sturdy beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|pages=66–9}}</ref> On 24 April 1820, the Talbot dispensary was opened and attached to the Richmond Surgical Hospital to afford relief to those among the sick poor who were not considered suitable for hospital accommodation and were resident in the north west district of Dublin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thom|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Thom (almanac editor)|year=1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=518NAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA715|title=Thom's Directory of Ireland|location=Dublin|page=715}}</ref>

===Richmond General Penitentiary===
[[File:Richmond Penitentiary Architectural Drawing Francis Johnson 1811.jpg|thumb|right|Architectural drawing of the Richmond General Penitentiary by Francis Johnston (1811)]]
{{Main|Richmond General Penitentiary}}

In 1810, the Governors of the House Industry were instructed by the Lord Lieutenant to purchase land for the construction of a penitentiary. They obtained a three half acre site from Lord Monck in Grangegorman which was at that time planted with apple and pear trees.  They were assigned the task of overseeing the building of the institution that would be known as the Richmond General Penitentiary. The architect appointed was Francis Johnston.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|title=The District of Grangegorman (Part II)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|year=1945|volume=7|issue=2|pages=56}}</ref> The building was completed in 1816.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman : psychiatric care in Dublin since 1815|year=1992|location=Dublin|isbn=1-872002-61-7|page=55}}</ref> It received its first prisoners in 1820.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heaney|first=Henry|title=Ireland's Penitentiary 1820–1831: An Experiment that Failed|journal=Studia Hibernica|year=1974|volume=14|page=30}}</ref>

===Richmond District Asylum===
{{main|St. Brendan's Hospital, Dublin}}
At the beginning of the nineteenth-century there was minimal specialist institutional provision for those deemed insane in Ireland. The lunatic department of the House of Industry, which in 1809 had forty-six cells reserved for this population, was heavily over-subscribed as individuals were sent there from throughout Ireland. Therefore, the governors of the House of Industry petitioned the British parliament for funds to construct additional buildings to meet this demand. The government agreed to fund the construction of an asylum and at the cost of £2,000 lands adjoining and to the east of the site of the House of Industry were purchased and an architect, Francis Johnston, was appointed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=20–1}} {{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Brian |last2=Falvey |first2=Jane|chapter=A history of the Richmond Asylum (St. Brendan's Hospital), Dublin|editor=Hugh Freeman |editor2=German E.

It was named after Charles Lennox who was the Duke of Richmond and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1807–1813). Initially, it was established as a national asylum to receive curable lunatics from throughout the island of Ireland. From 1830, however, it was incorporated into the district asylum system. Thereafter it was renamed the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum and its catchment area was defined as the city and county of Dublin, the counties of [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], [[County Louth|Louth]], [[County Meath|Meath]], and the town of [[Drogheda]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=24, 46}}</ref>

'''Grangegorman''' ({{Irish place name| Gráinseach Ghormáin}}) is a suburb on the [[Northside, Dublin|northside]] of [[Dublin]] city, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The area is administered by [[Dublin City Council]]. It was best known for decades as the location of [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)|St Brendan's Hospital]], which was the main psychiatric hospital serving the greater Dublin region. The area is currently the subject of a major redevelopment plan under the aegis of the [[Grangegorman Development Agency]], including the new [[Technological University Dublin]] campus.

Grangegorman is also a [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in the historical [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]].<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/2977.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - Grangegorman civil parish</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Grangegorman, as with other [[placenames]] containing the name \"gorman\" in the [[Leinster]] region, probably indicates that at one time this territory was held by the [[Uí Bairrche]], an [[Irish clans|Irish clan]] based in Leinster. The two main representatives of this clan were Uí Treasaig (Tracey) and Mac Gormáin (MacGorman). They were displaced following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] from the twelfth-century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tracey|first=Declan|title=Uí Bairrche (Leinster)|url=http://traceyclann.com/index_files/..%5Cfiles%5CUi%20Bairrche.htm|work=Tracey Family: An Irish Family History|accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref>

==Location==
[[File:Dublin u01.JPG|right|thumb|The Richmond Surgical Hospital, rebuilt in 1900. Situated on North Brunswick Street, it now forms part of the Dublin operations of the Court Service.]]
Grangegorman has evolved over time to its current boundaries, which, like those of most Dublin suburbs, are imprecise, while for the purposes of redevelopment, an extended \"neighbourhood\" was defined.  A major historic feature was the Bradogue River, now culverted but still cutting right through the area on its way to the [[River Liffey]].

===Modern suburb of Grangegorman===
Grangegorman is located in the [[Dublin 7]] [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]], north of the [[River Liffey]] and about 1&nbsp;km from [[Dublin]] city centre, and its boundaries run, approximately, along Brunswick Street North, Prussia Street and Manor Street, the [[R101 road (Ireland)|North Circular Road]] and Phibsborough Road and Constitution Hill. Grangegorman is surrounded to the south east by [[Smithfield, Dublin|Smithfield]] to the west by [[Stoneybatter]], north by [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]], to the north and east by [[Phibsborough]] / [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]].

The geographical definition of the north Dublin [[District Electoral Division|electoral division]] known as Arran Quay B, encompasses Grangegorman. The 2006 [[Census#Ireland|Census]] gives the population of Arran Quay B as 3,692. This represents a 19.5 per cent increase from the population of the area in 2002.<ref name=cso20065960>{{cite book|last=Central Statistics Office, Ireland|year=2007|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Amended%20census2006_%20Volume%201%20Pop%20Classified%20by%20Area.pdf|title=Census 2006 Volume I: Population Defined by Area|location=Dublin|pages=59–60}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Grangegorman Development Agency|title=GDA Draft Strategic Plan 2010: Environmental Report|date=2 November 2010|location=Dublin|page=8 (chapter 6), fig 6.3|url=http://www.grangegormandevelopmentagency.ie/assets/strategic_plan/GG_Strategic_Plan_Corrected_Environmental_Report.pdf}}</ref>

===The historical civil parish of Grangegorman===
Grangegorman [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] consisted of five separate districts comprising Grangegorman North, South, East, West and Middle. According to this division, Grangegorman at the start of the nineteenth century was spread over a significant area of north west Dublin relative to its present contracted state. Bordered by the parishes of [[Castleknock]], [[Finglas]], [[Glasnevin]], St. George's, St. Paul's and [[St. Michan's Church|St. Michan's]] it encompassed the localities of Broadstone, Cabra, Phibsborough and the northern half of Stoneybatter .<ref>This is the commercial site for Ordnance Survey Ireland but you can view the map without having to purchase it. {{cite web|url=http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,714099,735570,5,7|title=Ordnance Survey Map 1802|last=Ordnance Survey Ireland|accessdate=20 March 2011|year=1802|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829114800/http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,714099,735570,5,7|archive-date=29 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The census data of 1901 records a population of 14,970 in the civil parish of Grangegorman while that for 1971, the last year for which there is any data, records a population of 32,105, equalling a 114.5 per cent increase between these dates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Central Statistics Office, Ireland|year=1972|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/census_1971_results/Volume1/A%20C%201%201971%20V1.pdf|title=Census of Population of Ireland 1971 Volume I: Population of District Electoral Divisions, Towns and Larger Units of Area|location=Dublin|page=147}}</ref>

===The Neighbourhood of Grangegorman===
The 'Neighbourhood of Grangegorman' is defined by Irish statute, the ''Grangegorman Development Agency Act (2005)''. Schedule 2, section 4 of this act defines the 'Neighbourhood of Grangegorman' as consisting of the [[District Electoral Division|electoral wards]] of [[Dublin quays|Arran Quay]] A, Arran Quay B, Arran Quay C, Arran Quay D, Arran Quay E, Inns Quay B, Inns Quay C and Cabra East C. Essentially, this act, for the purposes of the statutory body of the [[Grangegorman Development Agency]], extends the spatial definition of Grangegorman as far south as the River Liffey, and encompasses parts of east Cabra, Phibsborough, Broadstone and Stoneybatter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ireland|year=2005|url=http://www.achtanna.ie/en.act.2005.0021.6.html|title=Grangegorman Development Agency Act (2005), Schedule 2, Section 4}} For a map of the electoral wards comprising the region defined by this statute as the ''Neighbourhood of Grangegorman'', see: {{cite book|last=Grangegorman Development Agency|title=GDA Draft Strategic Plan 2010: Environmental Report|date=2 November 2010|location=Dublin|page=8 (chapter 6), fig. 6.3|url=http://www.grangegormandevelopmentagency.ie/assets/strategic_plan/GG_Strategic_Plan_Corrected_Environmental_Report.pdf}}</ref>

According to this definition the population of the 'Neighbourhood of Grangegorman' was equal to 24,534 in 2006.<ref name=cso20065960/>

==History==

Along with [[Stoneybatter]] and [[Broadstone, Dublin|Glassmanogue]], Grangegorman was recorded in 1610 as one of only three remote villages in this region and at that stage, lying north of [[Oxmantown|Ostman town]] and north of the [[River Liffey]], they were not joined to the city of Dublin.<ref>Glasmanogue, although covering a wider region, was a village centred around the location of present day [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]] at the point where Constitution Hill meets the modern Phibsborough Road. {{cite book|last=Cromwell|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Cromwell (antiquary)|year=1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhUHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA43|title=Excursions through Ireland Volume I|location=London|page=43}} {{cite book|last=McGregor|first=John James|year=1821|url=https://archive.org/details/newpictureofdubl00mcgr|quote=grange.|title=New Picture of Dublin|publisher=Johnston|location=Dublin|page=[https://archive.org/details/newpictureofdubl00mcgr/page/56 56]}}</ref>

The Rev. William Basil Kingsbury Maturin (1803-1887), a Tractarian, was the Church of Ireland perpetual curate of Grangegorman and also librarian of [[Archbishop Marsh's Library]], Dublin, from 1872 until 1887.<ref>Muriel McCarthy, ''Marsh's Library: All Graduates and Gentlemen''. 2nd ed. Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2003</ref><ref>\"Maturin, William\" in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''</ref>

[[File:Richmond District Asylum and North Dublin Union.png|thumb|right|Map (1862) showing the north west of Dublin including the eastern half of the region of Grangegorman.<ref>On this map is shown the Richmond General Penitentiary (1810), the new North Dublin Union (1791) and the Richmond Surgical Hospital (1810), which was rebuilt in the early 20th century. As shown, the original quadrangular building of the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum (1815) was built beside the new premises of the North Dublin Union. The Richmond Asylum also purchased land and constructed buildings on the western side of Grangegorman Lane. A tunnel running underground across Grangegorman Lane connected the east and west half of the Richmond's facilities. The original section on the eastern half became known as the \"lower house\" which that on the western side became known as the \"upper house\" or \"male house\". Not shown are the Hardwicke Fever Hospital (1803) or the Whitworth Chronic Hospital (1814) and its Dispensary (1820). These medical buildings were situated on Brunswick Street North or off Morning Star Avenue. This avenue is shown on the map although it is not named. It is the avenue leading northward from Brunswick Street North towards the North Dublin Union. The House of Industry (1773) became the North Dublin Union following the passage of the Irish Poor Law (1838).</ref>]]

In the fourteenth-century Dublin was a small walled city with perhaps 10,000 inhabitants. At this time Grangegorman functioned as one of three home farms, the others being [[Glasnevin]] and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as [[Deansgrange]]), which served to meet the expenditure of the [[Prior]] of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at The Church of the Holy Trinity. The [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] of this priory served The Church of the Holy Trinity, which was the State Church until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the sixteenth-century when it was re-established as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mac Giolla Phadraig|first=Brian|year=1938|title=14th century life in a Dublin Monastery|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69, 72}}</ref> The farm buildings at Grangegorman consisted of one large hall with some rooms attached and an enclosed farmyard around which there stood a barn, a malthouse, a workshop and a haggard (a farm enclosure for stacking grain or hay, etc.). All of these buildings had thatched roofs.<ref name=macg75>{{cite journal|last=Mac Giolla Phadraig|first=Brian|year=1938|title=14th century life in a Dublin Monastery|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=3|page=75}}</ref> The [[Manor house|Manor]] of Grangegorman was located in the north end of [[Stoneybatter]] in present-day Manor Street.

The territory of Grangegorman has had a long association with orchards which only passed into history in the mid-nineteenth century. The lease of Grangegorman dated 1485 refers to its lands as \"the Orchard\". With the dissolution of the monasteries, [[King Henry VIII]] on 10 May 1541 by [[letters patent]] authorised the transformation of the Prior and Canons of Christ Church to a [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] and [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]]. The lease granted that same year refers to \"the Great Orchard\" and in 1542 to \"an orchard belonging to the Dean situate beyond the town of Oxmantown Green\". In 1560 the lease simply referred to '''\"the Dean's Orchard\"'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|year=1945|title=The district of Grangegorman (Part III)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=7|issue=3|page=103}}</ref>

The possession of the Manor of Grangegorman passed into the hands of Rt. Hon. Francis Agard after the formation of Dean and Chapter for the management of Christ Church Cathedral. Following Agard's death in 1577, this possession passed to the control of his son-in-law, [[Henry Harington (d. 1613)|Sir Henry Harrington]]. In the period after the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]], the residential expanse of Grangegorman consisted of forty houses. The Manor House at this time was held by Sir [[John Stanley (died 1674)|Thomas Stanley]]. It is assumed that the domicile to which the now defunct Stanley Street once led was the manorial house.<ref>{{cite book |author=Old Dublin Society |year=1945 |title=Dublin Historical Record |volume=7–9 |publisher=The Old Dublin Society|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&dq=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IdecUvuEHYWS7Aal-IFI&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg 67]}}</ref> This site is currently occupied by the Stanhope Street Convent of the [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sisters of Charity]]. In 1674 the Manor of Grangegorman was held by [[Sir John Stanley, 1st Baronet|Sir John Stanley]] (the son of the previous owner). In the early eighteenth-century it passed to [[Charles Monck, 1st Viscount Monck|Charles Monck]] who was Stanley's nephew and an ancestor of [[Henry Monck, 1st Earl of Rathdowne|Viscount Monck]], the Earl of Rathdowne who was the landlord holding most of the property in the area.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|year=1945|title=The district of Grangegorman (Part III)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=7|issue=3|pages=103–04}}</ref>

=== The House of Industry ===
{{main|House of Industry (Dublin)}}

[[File:Whitworth Hospital.jpg|right|thumb|The Whitworth Hospital (1814), located off Morning Star Avenue.]]

From the eighteenth century onwards, Grangegorman was to be transformed from an agricultural hamlet to an urban centre dominated by penal and welfare institutions. In 1704 Dublin's first [[House of Industry]] was established on St. James's Street south of the River Liffey, on the site currently occupied by [[St. James's Hospital]]. However, from 1729 this institution was converted into the rather notorious [[Foundling hospital#Ireland|Dublin Foundling Hospital]]. In 1771–72 a philanthropic body called \"The Corporation for the Relief of the Poor\" was instituted following the passage of permissive legislation and this entity was responsible for the opening in 1773 of Dublin's second House of Industry<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tutty|first=M.J.|year=1961|title=Dublin's oldest charity|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=16|issue=3|page=73}}</ref> which was situated at the site of the derelict malthouse on Channel Row on what is now North Brunswick Street.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|year=1992|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|page=5}}</ref> Channel Row at this time was considered to form part of the locality of Glassmanogue to which also belonged the area known as Broadstone. The establishment of this institution was to be the single most important factor in shaping the urban character of Grangegorman as a site increasingly predominated by the presence of a range of institutions meeting nineteenth-century expectations of philanthropy, care and social control.<ref>The minutes of the Corporation's first meeting on Monday 3 August 1772 describes its purpose as a body in the following terms: 'The Corporation instituted for the relief of the Poor and for punishing Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars in the County of the City of Dublin'. Quoted in, {{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|page=45}}</ref>

The decision to site the House of Industry in this part of the city no doubt reflected the fact that the local population in Grangegorman and the surrounding districts of the north west of Dublin were and are overwhelming proletarian in nature. Indeed, this reflects a long-standing east-west divide in the city, which continues into the present day. In the parishes of St. Paul's and St. Michan's, resting either side of Smithfield in the north west, between 76 per cent and 79 per cent of the population were considered working class in 1797. Conversely, in the parishes of St. Thomas and St. George in the north east of the city the percentage of the population which was working class was 45 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Tommy|year=1944|title=Whitelaw's 1798 Census of Dublin|journal=History Ireland|volume=2|issue=3|page=14}}</ref> A degree of elite distaste toward the behaviour of working class populations is revealed in the visitation report of an episcopalian archbishop to the region of Grangegorman-Glassmanogue in 1727 when he described the local population, who lacked a church at this point, as lewd and unruly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Canon E.J.|year=1940|title=St. Michan's Parish in the eighteenth century|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=3|issue=1|page=3}}</ref>

In 1787 the Governors of the House of Industry considered the need for new accommodation to provide facilities for some two thousand inmates. The old malt house was in a ruinous condition and by the 1790s was deemed in danger of collapse. In September 1791 work began on the New House of Industry at a plot adjoining and to the north of the original building. The site of this building, now demolished, was located at the end of Morning Star Avenue. In 1798 the Governors of the House of Industry petitioned the [[Irish House of Commons]] to build a proper infirmary. Work on this, the Hardwicke Fever Hospital, began in 1803. To cope with the increasing number of children in the workhouse, the Bedford Asylum for Industrious Children, named after the then Lord Lieutenant and the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and designed by the noted architect, [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]] to accommodate one thousand children, was constructed in 1806 on a site on North Brunswick Street. To care for the 'ruptured poor', the [[Richmond Surgical Hospital]] was opened in 1810. The building used for this hospital had been a convent constructed in 1688 by the [[Benedictine Nuns]] in Channel Row, opposite Red Cow Lane. Subsequently, it passed into the possession of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican Nuns]] who largely rebuilt the structure. The hospital was subsequently rebuilt in 1900 in distinctive red-brick. This building still stands and currently functions as the Dublin Metropolitan Court. In 1814 the [[Whitworth Hospital]] for chronic patients was built on a site just to the south of the new House of Industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and sturdy beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|pages=66–9}}</ref> On 24 April 1820, the Talbot dispensary was opened and attached to the Richmond Surgical Hospital to afford relief to those among the sick poor who were not considered suitable for hospital accommodation and were resident in the north west district of Dublin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thom|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Thom (almanac editor)|year=1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=518NAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA715|title=Thom's Directory of Ireland|location=Dublin|page=715}}</ref>

===Richmond General Penitentiary===
[[File:Richmond Penitentiary Architectural Drawing Francis Johnson 1811.jpg|thumb|right|Architectural drawing of the Richmond General Penitentiary by Francis Johnston (1811)]]
{{Main|Richmond General Penitentiary}}

In 1810, the Governors of the House Industry were instructed by the Lord Lieutenant to purchase land for the construction of a penitentiary. They obtained a three half acre site from Lord Monck in Grangegorman which was at that time planted with apple and pear trees.  They were assigned the task of overseeing the building of the institution that would be known as the Richmond General Penitentiary. The architect appointed was Francis Johnston.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|title=The District of Grangegorman (Part II)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|year=1945|volume=7|issue=2|pages=56}}</ref> The building was completed in 1816.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman : psychiatric care in Dublin since 1815|year=1992|location=Dublin|isbn=1-872002-61-7|page=55}}</ref> It received its first prisoners in 1820.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heaney|first=Henry|title=Ireland's Penitentiary 1820–1831: An Experiment that Failed|journal=Studia Hibernica|year=1974|volume=14|page=30}}</ref>

===Richmond District Asylum===
{{main|St. Brendan's Hospital, Dublin}}
At the beginning of the nineteenth-century there was minimal specialist institutional provision for those deemed insane in Ireland. The lunatic department of the House of Industry, which in 1809 had forty-six cells reserved for this population, was heavily over-subscribed as individuals were sent there from throughout Ireland. Therefore, the governors of the House of Industry petitioned the British parliament for funds to construct additional buildings to meet this demand. The government agreed to fund the construction of an asylum and at the cost of £2,000 lands adjoining and to the east of the site of the House of Industry were purchased and an architect, Francis Johnston, was appointed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=20–1}} {{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Brian |last2=Falvey |first2=Jane|chapter=A history of the Richmond Asylum (St. Brendan's Hospital), Dublin|editor=Hugh Freeman |editor2=German E.

It was named after Charles Lennox who was the Duke of Richmond and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1807–1813). Initially, it was established as a national asylum to receive curable lunatics from throughout the island of Ireland. From 1830, however, it was incorporated into the district asylum system. Thereafter it was renamed the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum and its catchment area was defined as the city and county of Dublin, the counties of [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], [[County Louth|Louth]], [[County Meath|Meath]], and the town of [[Drogheda]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=24, 46}}</ref>
