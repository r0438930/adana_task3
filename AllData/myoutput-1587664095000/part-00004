Such trends called for a processor with both improved performance; by doubling the bus's width to 32 bits, and with flexibility; having large numbers of general-purpose registers.<ref name=\"maruzen\"/><ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/> These were common features of [[Reduced instruction set computer|''Reduced Instruction Set Computer'']].<ref name=\"Computer-Architecture-4thEd\"/> At the time, this transition from [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] to [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] seemed to bring many benefits for emerging markets.\n\nToday, [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] chips are common, although the[[x86|Intel's x86]] CISC designs have been mainstream for several decades, the[[x86]] [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]], [[Intel 80486|80486]] internally adopts [[RISC]] features.<ref name=\"i486-ICCD89\"/><ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\"/>\nAccording to [[Pat Gelsinger]], binary backward compatibility for legacy software is much important than changing the ISA.<ref name=\"CNET-2007\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|V60|D70616|\u03bcPD70616|.mu.PD70616}}Overview ==\n\n=== Instruction set ===\n\nThe V60 (\u03bcPD70616) /.mu.PD70616/ retained a [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] architecture.<ref name=\"Wade, 1996\"/> Its manual describes them as being[[Mainframe computer|mainframe-computer]]-based, with a fully [[orthogonal instruction set]], comprising; non-uniform length instructions, memory-to-memory operations including string manipulation, and fairly complex operand addressing schemes.<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/><ref name=\"maruzen\"/><ref name=\"Computer-Architecture-4thEd\"/>\n\n=== Family ===\n\nThe V60 operates as a 32 bit processor internally, whilst externally providing 16 bit data and 24 bits address buses.

By incorporating on-chip caches and a [[branch predictor]], it was declared NEC's [[Intel 486|486]] by ''[[Computer Business Review]]''.<ref name=\"CBR-1\"/><ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> The performance of V80 was two to four times than that of V70, depending on application. For example, compared with V70, the V80 had a 32-bit hardware multiplier to reduce integer multiplication cycles to 9 from 23. (For more detailed differences, see hardware architecture section below.) The V80 was manufactured in 0.8-micrometer CMOS process with a die area of {{nowrap|14.49 \u00d7 15.47 mm<sup>2</sup>}} consisting of 980,000 transistors. It was packaged in a 280-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]], and operated at 25 and 33&nbsp;MHz with claimed peak performance of 12.5 and 16.5 MIPS, respectively. V80 had separated 1&nbsp;KB on-die cache both for instructions and for data, and had 64-entry [[branch predictor]]; the performance gain, attributed to the latter, was about 5%. The launch prices of V80 were cited as equivalent to $1200 for the 33&nbsp;MHz model and $960 for the 25&nbsp;MHz model. Supposedly a 45&nbsp;MHz model was scheduled for 1990,<ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> but did not materialize.\n\nThe V80, associated with \u03bcPD72691 co-FPP and \u03bcPD71101 simple [[peripheral]] chips, was used for [[Industrial PC|industrial computer]] with the [[RX-UX832]] real-time UNIX and a [[X Window System|X11-R4]] based window system.<ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-Jul92\"/><ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-May93\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|\u03bcPD72691|.mu.PD72691|D72691|AFPP}}AFPP (co&#8209;FPP) ==\n\nThe AFPP (\u03bcPD72691) /.mu.PD72691/ is a co-processor for floating point arithmetic operations.<ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> The name stands for Advanced Floating Point Processor as is described in NEC's data sheet. The V60/V70/V80 themselves can perform floating point arithmetic, but they are very slow because of microcode operations without dedicated hardware. In 1989, to compensate V60/V70/V80 for their fairly weak floating point performance, NEC launched the 80-bit floating point co-processor; for 32-bit [[Single-precision floating-point format|single precision]], for 64-bit [[Double-precision floating-point format|double precision]], and for 80-bit [[extended precision]] [[IEEE 754]] format operations.<ref name=\"coproc\"/><ref name=\"overview\"/> This chip claimed 6.7 [[MFLOPS]] in the vector-[[matrix multiplication]], operating at 20&nbsp;MHz. It was [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] in 1.2-micrometer double-metal layer CMOS process containing 433,000 transistors on an {{nowrap|11.6 \u00d7 14.9 mm<sup>2</sup>}} die.<ref name=\"coproc\"/> It was packaged in a 68-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]]. This co-processor connected to V80 via the dedicated bus. But in case of connecting to V60 and V70, it shared their main buses, which scenario diminished their peak performance.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|arch}}Hardware Architecture ==\nV60/V70/V80 shared the basic architecture. They had thirty-two 32-bit [[general-purpose register]]s, although the last three of them were commonly used as [[stack pointer]], [[frame pointer]], and [[argument pointer]], those were well matched with [[High-level programming language|high level language]] [[compiler]]s' [[calling convention]]s.<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/><ref name=\"GCC-Internal\"/> The V60 and V70 had a 119-instruction set,<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/> slightly extended to 123 instructions for the V80. The instructions have [[Complex instruction set computing|non-uniform length]] between one and 22 bytes,<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/> and they take two operands, both of which can be memory locations.<ref name=\"overview\"/> After studying the V60's reference manual, [[Paul Vixie]] described it as \"a very [[VAX]]-ish arch, with a V20/V30 emulation mode (which, if you recall, means it can run Intel 8086/8088 software)\".<ref name=\"google-groups\"/>\n\nV60-V80 had a built-in [[Memory management unit|MMU]]<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-043\"/><ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> that divide the 4 GB [[Virtual memory|virtual address space]] into in four 1-GB sections, each section further divided in 1,024 1-MB areas, each area composed of 256 4-KB pages. On the V60/V70 four registers (ATBR0 to ATBR3) store section pointers on the processor, but the area tables entries (ATE) and [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|page tables entries (PTE)]] are stored into off-chip RAM. The V80 merged the ATE and ATBR registers, which are both on-chip with only the [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|PTE]] entries stored into external RAM, allowing for a faster execution of [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] misses by eliminating one memory read.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nThe TLBs on the V60/70 are 16-entry [[CPU cache#Associativity|fully associative]] with replacement done by [[microcode]]. The V80 in contrast has a 64-entry 2-way [[set associative]] [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] with replacement done in hardware. [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] replacement took 58 cycles in the V70 and also disrupted the pipelined execution of other instructions. On the V80 a TLB replacement took only 6/11 cycles depending if the page was in the same area or not; pipeline disruption no longer occurred in V80 because of the separate TLB replacement hardware unit which operated in parallel to the rest of the processor.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three processors used the same protection mechanism with 4 execution levels (set via a [[program status word]]), with [[ring 0]] being the privileged level that could access a special set of privileged registers on the processors.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three models supported a triple-mode redundancy configuration with three CPUs used in a [[byzantine fault tolerance]] scheme with bus freeze, instruction retry, and chip replacement signals.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"compcon1988\"/> The V80 also added parity signals to its data and address buses.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nString operations were implemented in [[microcode]] in the V60/V70, but aided by hardware Data Control Unit in the V80, running at full bus speed.

The V80 had some limited hardware assist for parts of the floating point operations, e.g. decomposition into sign, exponent and mantissa, thus its floating point unit was claimed up to 3 times as effective as the one of the V70, with 32-bit operations taking 36/44/74 cycles while 64-bit floating point operations taking 75/110/533 cycles on the V80 (again, for addition/multiplication/division).<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|PC-UX/V Rel 2.0 (V60)|Real-time UNIX RX-UX 832|RX-UX 832|RX-UX832|MUSTARD|RX616|NEC RX116|RX116|}}Operating Systems ==\n\n=== Unix (non-real-time and real-time) ===\n\nNEC ported several variants of [[Unix]] to its V60/V70/V80 processors for user-application-oriented systems, including real-time ones.

The internal execution for each instruction of the V80 needed at least 2 cycles, while that of i486 was 1. The internal pipeline of the V80 seemed [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, asynchronous pipelines|buffered A-synchronous]], but that of i486 was [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, synchronous pipelines|synchronous]]. In other words, the internal [[microarchitecture]] of V80 was [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], but that of i486 was [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]. Both of their [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] had long non-uniform [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] instructions, so i486 adopted wider 128-bit internal [[cache memory]], while that of V80 was 32-bit width. This difference can be seen on their die photos.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\"/><ref name=\"micro1990\"/><ref name=\"i486-ICCD89\"/>\nThis strategic failure was fatal from the performance point of view, but NEC did not change its design.

The [[:ja:\u30b7\u30d0\u30f3\u30e0\u30b7|#4]] seems to be skipped (see page 58<ref name=\"cat95\"/>), probably because of Japanese [[tetraphobia]].

Three operating system functions, namely, the virtual memory support functions, context-switch functions, and asynchronous trap functions are examined. A basic mechanism for high-reliability-system implementation, called FRM (functional redundancy monitoring), is discussed. FRM allows a system to be designed in which multiple V60s (or V70s) form a configuration in which one processor in the system acts as a master while the others act as monitors.

The CAD system supports three design methodologies--symbolic layout mixed with mask level layout, compaction as an optimizer, and fully automated verification. For the area optimization, the symbolic layout and compactor subsystem supports a flexible description of orthogonal layout patterns with arbitrary dimensions in a loose placement manner. The layout patterns include path data, polygonal data, and symbolic cells. For power and delay optimization, the compactor compacts layout data, decreasing both resistance and capacitance for wires and ion-implanted layers. This feature is pioneering the new generation compactor. Emphasis should be put on the fact that it can compact layout data to a format 10-15 percent smaller than that accomplished manually. The verification subsystem can detect all kinds of errors, more than 30 items. A novel feature of the electrical rule check is that it investigates complementary logic errors for CMOS circuits. The synergy of those three design methodologies has brought about several significant advantages. One is manpower reduction by more than half, in the most complicated design process for unique random logic. The other is a 1600-transistors compaction output, smaller by 365 mils/sup 2/ than that manually compacted. The circuit implementation on a chip works at more than a 15&nbsp;MHz clock rate. Another is the first silicon success. It has been accomplished in a full-custom VLSI microcomputer chip consisting of more than 100 000 transistors.}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- JOURNAL, V800 ----->\n\n<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Harigai|first1=Hisao|last2=Kusuda|first2=Masaori|last3=Kojima|first3=Shingo|last4=Moriyama|first4=Masatoshi|last5=Ienaga|first5=Takashi|last6=Yano|first6=Yoichi|title=\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u30fb\u4f4e\u96fb\u5727\u52d5\u4f5c\u306e32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5V810|journal=SIG Technical Reports, Information Processing Society of Japan|date=1992-10-22|volume=1992|issue=82 (1992-ARC-096)|pages=41\u201348|url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/170000021173|trans-title=A low power consumption and low voltage operation 32-bit RISC Microprocessor|quote=<br/>Abstract:<br/>An advanced 32-bit RISC microprocessor for embedded control; V810 is introduced in this paper.

A variety of techniques previously associated only with RISC (reduced-instruction-set computer) processors are used to execute the average instruction in 1.8 clocks. This represents a 2.5* reduction from its predecessor, the 386 microprocessor. The pipeline and clock count comparisons are described in detail. In addition, an onchip floating-point unit is included which yields a 4* clock count reduction from the 387 numeric coprocessor. The microarchitecture enhancements and optimizations used to achieve this goal, most of which are non-silicon-intensive, are discussed. All instructions of the 386 microprocessor and the 387 numeric coprocessor are implemented in a completely compatible fashion.}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=J.H.|title=The i486 CPU: executing instructions in one clock cycle|journal=IEEE Micro|date=February 1990|volume=10|issue=1|pages=27\u201336|doi=10.1109/40.46766|issn=0272-1732|citeseerx=10.1.1.126.4216}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"pj\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Hardenbergh |first1=Hal W | title=RISCs CISCs and Fabs|journal=Programmer's Journal|year=1988|publisher=Avant-Garde Creations|volume=6|issue=2|page=15|quote=<br/>So far we haven't mentioned two 32-bit CISC chips, the NEC V60/70 and the AT&T WE32 family.

By incorporating on-chip caches and a [[branch predictor]], it was declared NEC's [[Intel 486|486]] by ''[[Computer Business Review]]''.<ref name=\"CBR-1\"/><ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> The performance of V80 was two to four times than that of V70, depending on application. For example, compared with V70, the V80 had a 32-bit hardware multiplier to reduce integer multiplication cycles to 9 from 23. (For more detailed differences, see hardware architecture section below.) The V80 was manufactured in 0.8-micrometer CMOS process with a die area of {{nowrap|14.49 \u00d7 15.47 mm<sup>2</sup>}} consisting of 980,000 transistors. It was packaged in a 280-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]], and operated at 25 and 33&nbsp;MHz with claimed peak performance of 12.5 and 16.5 MIPS, respectively. V80 had separated 1&nbsp;KB on-die cache both for instructions and for data, and had 64-entry [[branch predictor]]; the performance gain, attributed to the latter, was about 5%. The launch prices of V80 were cited as equivalent to $1200 for the 33&nbsp;MHz model and $960 for the 25&nbsp;MHz model. Supposedly a 45&nbsp;MHz model was scheduled for 1990,<ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> but did not materialize.\n\nThe V80, associated with \u03bcPD72691 co-FPP and \u03bcPD71101 simple [[peripheral]] chips, was used for [[Industrial PC|industrial computer]] with the [[RX-UX832]] real-time UNIX and a [[X Window System|X11-R4]] based window system.<ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-Jul92\"/><ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-May93\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|\u03bcPD72691|.mu.PD72691|D72691|AFPP}}AFPP (co&#8209;FPP) ==\n\nThe AFPP (\u03bcPD72691) /.mu.PD72691/ is a co-processor for floating point arithmetic operations.<ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> The name stands for Advanced Floating Point Processor as is described in NEC's data sheet. The V60/V70/V80 themselves can perform floating point arithmetic, but they are very slow because of microcode operations without dedicated hardware. In 1989, to compensate V60/V70/V80 for their fairly weak floating point performance, NEC launched the 80-bit floating point co-processor; for 32-bit [[Single-precision floating-point format|single precision]], for 64-bit [[Double-precision floating-point format|double precision]], and for 80-bit [[extended precision]] [[IEEE 754]] format operations.<ref name=\"coproc\"/><ref name=\"overview\"/> This chip claimed 6.7 [[MFLOPS]] in the vector-[[matrix multiplication]], operating at 20&nbsp;MHz. It was [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] in 1.2-micrometer double-metal layer CMOS process containing 433,000 transistors on an {{nowrap|11.6 \u00d7 14.9 mm<sup>2</sup>}} die.<ref name=\"coproc\"/> It was packaged in a 68-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]]. This co-processor connected to V80 via the dedicated bus. But in case of connecting to V60 and V70, it shared their main buses, which scenario diminished their peak performance.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|arch}}Hardware Architecture ==\nV60/V70/V80 shared the basic architecture. They had thirty-two 32-bit [[general-purpose register]]s, although the last three of them were commonly used as [[stack pointer]], [[frame pointer]], and [[argument pointer]], those were well matched with [[High-level programming language|high level language]] [[compiler]]s' [[calling convention]]s.<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/><ref name=\"GCC-Internal\"/> The V60 and V70 had a 119-instruction set,<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/> slightly extended to 123 instructions for the V80. The instructions have [[Complex instruction set computing|non-uniform length]] between one and 22 bytes,<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/> and they take two operands, both of which can be memory locations.<ref name=\"overview\"/> After studying the V60's reference manual, [[Paul Vixie]] described it as \"a very [[VAX]]-ish arch, with a V20/V30 emulation mode (which, if you recall, means it can run Intel 8086/8088 software)\".<ref name=\"google-groups\"/>\n\nV60-V80 had a built-in [[Memory management unit|MMU]]<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-043\"/><ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> that divide the 4 GB [[Virtual memory|virtual address space]] into in four 1-GB sections, each section further divided in 1,024 1-MB areas, each area composed of 256 4-KB pages. On the V60/V70 four registers (ATBR0 to ATBR3) store section pointers on the processor, but the area tables entries (ATE) and [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|page tables entries (PTE)]] are stored into off-chip RAM. The V80 merged the ATE and ATBR registers, which are both on-chip with only the [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|PTE]] entries stored into external RAM, allowing for a faster execution of [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] misses by eliminating one memory read.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nThe TLBs on the V60/70 are 16-entry [[CPU cache#Associativity|fully associative]] with replacement done by [[microcode]]. The V80 in contrast has a 64-entry 2-way [[set associative]] [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] with replacement done in hardware. [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] replacement took 58 cycles in the V70 and also disrupted the pipelined execution of other instructions. On the V80 a TLB replacement took only 6/11 cycles depending if the page was in the same area or not; pipeline disruption no longer occurred in V80 because of the separate TLB replacement hardware unit which operated in parallel to the rest of the processor.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three processors used the same protection mechanism with 4 execution levels (set via a [[program status word]]), with [[ring 0]] being the privileged level that could access a special set of privileged registers on the processors.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three models supported a triple-mode redundancy configuration with three CPUs used in a [[byzantine fault tolerance]] scheme with bus freeze, instruction retry, and chip replacement signals.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"compcon1988\"/> The V80 also added parity signals to its data and address buses.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nString operations were implemented in [[microcode]] in the V60/V70, but aided by hardware Data Control Unit in the V80, running at full bus speed. This made string operations about five times faster in the V80.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll floating point operations are largely implemented in microcode across the family and thus and are fairly slow. On the V60/V70 the 32-bit floating point operations took 120/116/137 cycles for addition/multiplication/division, while the corresponding 64-bit floating point operations took 178/270/590 cycles. The V80 had some limited hardware assist for parts of the floating point operations, e.g. decomposition into sign, exponent and mantissa, thus its floating point unit was claimed up to 3 times as effective as the one of the V70, with 32-bit operations taking 36/44/74 cycles while 64-bit floating point operations taking 75/110/533 cycles on the V80 (again, for addition/multiplication/division).<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|PC-UX/V Rel 2.0 (V60)|Real-time UNIX RX-UX 832|RX-UX 832|RX-UX832|MUSTARD|RX616|NEC RX116|RX116|}}Operating Systems ==\n\n=== Unix (non-real-time and real-time) ===\n\nNEC ported several variants of [[Unix]] to its V60/V70/V80 processors for user-application-oriented systems, including real-time ones.

The internal execution for each instruction of the V80 needed at least 2 cycles, while that of i486 was 1. The internal pipeline of the V80 seemed [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, asynchronous pipelines|buffered A-synchronous]], but that of i486 was [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, synchronous pipelines|synchronous]]. In other words, the internal [[microarchitecture]] of V80 was [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], but that of i486 was [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]. Both of their [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] had long non-uniform [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] instructions, so i486 adopted wider 128-bit internal [[cache memory]], while that of V80 was 32-bit width.

The CAD system supports three design methodologies--symbolic layout mixed with mask level layout, compaction as an optimizer, and fully automated verification. For the area optimization, the symbolic layout and compactor subsystem supports a flexible description of orthogonal layout patterns with arbitrary dimensions in a loose placement manner. The layout patterns include path data, polygonal data, and symbolic cells. For power and delay optimization, the compactor compacts layout data, decreasing both resistance and capacitance for wires and ion-implanted layers. This feature is pioneering the new generation compactor. Emphasis should be put on the fact that it can compact layout data to a format 10-15 percent smaller than that accomplished manually. The verification subsystem can detect all kinds of errors, more than 30 items. A novel feature of the electrical rule check is that it investigates complementary logic errors for CMOS circuits. The synergy of those three design methodologies has brought about several significant advantages. One is manpower reduction by more than half, in the most complicated design process for unique random logic. The other is a 1600-transistors compaction output, smaller by 365 mils/sup 2/ than that manually compacted. The circuit implementation on a chip works at more than a 15&nbsp;MHz clock rate. Another is the first silicon success.

A variety of techniques previously associated only with RISC (reduced-instruction-set computer) processors are used to execute the average instruction in 1.8 clocks. This represents a 2.5* reduction from its predecessor, the 386 microprocessor. The pipeline and clock count comparisons are described in detail. In addition, an onchip floating-point unit is included which yields a 4* clock count reduction from the 387 numeric coprocessor. The microarchitecture enhancements and optimizations used to achieve this goal, most of which are non-silicon-intensive, are discussed. All instructions of the 386 microprocessor and the 387 numeric coprocessor are implemented in a completely compatible fashion.}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=J.H.|title=The i486 CPU: executing instructions in one clock cycle|journal=IEEE Micro|date=February 1990|volume=10|issue=1|pages=27\u201336|doi=10.1109/40.46766|issn=0272-1732|citeseerx=10.1.1.126.4216}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"pj\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Hardenbergh |first1=Hal W | title=RISCs CISCs and Fabs|journal=Programmer's Journal|year=1988|publisher=Avant-Garde Creations|volume=6|issue=2|page=15|quote=<br/>So far we haven't mentioned two 32-bit CISC chips, the NEC V60/70 and the AT&T WE32 family.

An effort was made to compensate by adding another CPU for dual operation; however, this solution made the system so hard to develop for that, according to Yu Suzuki himself, \u201conly 1 out of 100 programmers could use the Saturn to its full potential.\u201d\"}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, NEC ----->\n\n<ref name=\"ps98-145-hmw\">\n{{Cite web|url=http://121ware.com/support/product/data/spec/sft/sw225d-1.html |title=Model Number: PS98-145-HMW, Item Name: PC-UX/V(Rel2.0)(V60) |publisher=NEC product sheet}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, GHS ----->\n\n<ref name=\"GHS-V850\">\n{{cite web|title=V850 and RH850 Embedded Software Solutions|url=https://www.ghs.com/products/v850_development.html|website=www.ghs.com|publisher=Green Hills Software}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, MIPS ----->\n\n<ref name=\"HIREC-HR5000\">\n{{cite web|last1=Voica|first1=Alex|title=Back to the future: 64-bit MIPS CPU explores the origins of the solar system \u2013 MIPS|url=https://www.mips.com/blog/back-to-the-future-64-bit-mips-cpu-explores-rare-asteroid/|website=www.mips.com|publisher=MIPS|language=en|date=2015-07-29}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MIPS64-5Kf-DS\">\n{{cite book|title=MIPS64 5Kf Processor Core Datasheet|date=2005-01-31|publisher=MIPS Technologies Inc.|edition=01.04|url=http://wiki.prplfoundation.org/w/images/f/f1/MD00111-2B-4KEC-DTS-02.03.pdf|language=en}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, MAME DEV ----->\n\n<ref name=\"v60-cemu\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/cpu/v60/v60.c.html |title=MAME:/src/emu/cpu/v60/v60.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222070653/http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/cpu/v60/v60.c.html |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev1\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/segas32.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/segas32.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403190647/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/segas32.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev-model1\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/model1.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/model1.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403180645/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/model1.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev-ssv\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ssv.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/ssv.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403215238/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ssv.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev-mc32\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ms32.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/ms32.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403182226/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ms32.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, PLANET VIRTUAL BOY ----->\n\n<ref name=\"V810-GCC\">\n{{cite web|title=A newer GCC compiler. \u00ab Virtual Boy Development Board \u00ab Forum \u00ab Planet Virtual Boy|url=http://www.planetvb.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=6456|website=www.planetvb.com|language=en}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, DATAQUEST ----->\n\n<ref name=\"dataquest-1986\">\n[[Dataquest]], \"Japanese Semiconductor Industry Service\", 1st Quarter 1986, p. 18 (pdf p. 44 in [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/04/102723432-05-01-acc.pdf this multi-volume archive])\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dataquest-1987\">\n[[Dataquest]], \"Japanese Semiconductor Industry Service\", 1st Quarter 1987, p. 18 (pdf p. 182 in [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/04/102723432-05-01-acc.pdf this multi-volume archive])</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dataquest-1987-2\">\n[[Dataquest]], \"Japanese Semiconductor Industry Service\", 2nd Quarter 1987, p. 21 (pdf p. 223 in [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/04/102723432-05-01-acc.pdf this multi-volume archive])</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, COMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW ----->\n\n<ref name=\"CBR-1\">\nNEC LAUNCHES V80 ANSWER TO INTEL's 80486 -
