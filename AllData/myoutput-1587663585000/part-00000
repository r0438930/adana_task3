In January 1962 they reported an increased number of lysosomes in rat liver cells after the addition of [[glucagon]], and that some displaced lysosomes towards the centre of the cell contained other cell organelles such as [[mitochondria]]. They called this [[autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] after [[Christian de Duve]] and [[Alex B. Novikoff]]. However Porter and Ashford wrongly interpreted their data as lysosome formation (ignoring the pre-existing organelles). Lysosomes could not be cell organelles, but part of [[cytoplasm]] such as [[mitochondria]], and that [[hydrolytic enzymes]] were produced by microbodies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashford TP, Porter KR | title = Cytoplasmic components in hepatic cell lysosomes | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 198\u2013202 | date = January 1962 | pmid = 13862833 | pmc = 2106008 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.12.1.198 }}</ref> In 1963 Hruban, Spargo and colleagues published a detailed ultrastructural description of \"focal cytoplasmic degradation,\" which referenced a 1955 German study of injury-induced sequestration.

One question that constantly arises, however, is whether autophagic activity in dying cells is the cause of death or is actually an attempt to prevent it. Morphological and histochemical studies so far did not prove a causative relationship between the autophagic process and cell death. In fact, there have recently been strong arguments that autophagic activity in dying cells might actually be a survival mechanism.<ref name=tavassoly>{{cite book|last1=Tavassoly|first1=Iman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Dynamics of Cell Fate Decision Mediated by the Interplay of Autophagy and Apoptosis in Cancer Cells|date=2015|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-14962-2|pages=|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-14962-2 |series=Springer Theses }}</ref><ref name=Shimizu2005>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsujimoto Y, Shimizu S | title = Another way to die: autophagic programmed cell death | journal = Cell Death and Differentiation | volume = 12 Suppl 2 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 1528\u201334 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16247500 | doi = 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401777 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Studies of the metamorphosis of insects have shown cells undergoing a form of PCD that appears distinct from other forms; these have been proposed as examples of autophagic cell death.<ref name=Osborne1993>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz LM, Smith SW, Jones ME, Osborne BA | title = Do all programmed cell deaths occur via apoptosis? | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 980\u20134 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 8430112 | pmc = 45794 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.3.980 | bibcode = 1993PNAS...90..980S }}</ref> Recent pharmacological and biochemical studies have proposed that survival and lethal autophagy can be distinguished by the type and degree of regulatory signaling during stress particularly after viral infection.<ref name=Datan>{{cite journal | vauthors = Datan E, Shirazian A, Benjamin S, Matassov D, Tinari A, Malorni W, Lockshin RA, Garcia-Sastre A, Zakeri Z | title = mTOR/p70S6K signaling distinguishes routine, maintenance-level autophagy from autophagic cell death during influenza A infection | journal = Virology | volume = 452\u2013453 | issue = March 2014 | pages = 175\u2013190 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24606695 | pmc = 4005847 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2014.01.008 }}</ref> Although promising, these findings have not been examined in non-viral systems.\n\n==Exercise==\nAutophagy is essential for basal [[homeostasis]]; it is also extremely important in maintaining [[muscle]] homeostasis during physical exercise.<ref name=He2012>{{cite journal | vauthors = He C, Bassik MC, Moresi V, Sun K, Wei Y, Zou Z, An Z, Loh J, Fisher J, Sun Q, Korsmeyer S, Packer M, May HI, Hill JA, Virgin HW, Gilpin C, Xiao G, Bassel-Duby R, Scherer PE, Levine B | title = Exercise-induced BCL2-regulated autophagy is required for muscle glucose homeostasis | journal = Nature | volume = 481 | issue = 7382 | pages = 511\u20135 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22258505 | pmc = 3518436 | doi = 10.1038/nature10758 | displayauthors = etal | bibcode = 2012Natur.481..511H }}</ref><ref name=Klionsky2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nair U, Klionsky DJ | title = Activation of autophagy is required for muscle homeostasis during physical exercise | journal = Autophagy | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = 1405\u20136 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22082869 | pmc = 3288013 | doi = 10.4161/auto.7.12.18315 }}</ref> Autophagy at the molecular level is only partially understood.

In support of the possibility that Beclin1 affects cancer development through an autophagy-independent pathway is the fact that core autophagy factors which are not known to affect other cellular processes and are definitely not known to affect cell proliferation and cell death, such as Atg7 or Atg5, show a much different phenotype when the respective gene is knocked out, which does not include tumor formation.

The second strategy is to inhibit autophagy and thus induce apoptosis.<ref name=\"Jin\" />\n\nThe first strategy has been tested by looking at dose-response anti-tumor effects during autophagy-induced therapies.

They called this [[autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] after [[Christian de Duve]] and [[Alex B. Novikoff]]. However Porter and Ashford wrongly interpreted their data as lysosome formation (ignoring the pre-existing organelles).

Secondly, inhibiting the protein pathways directly known to induce autophagy may also serve as an anticancer therapy.<ref name=\"Jin\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second strategy is based on the idea that autophagy is a protein degradation system used to maintain homeostasis and the findings that inhibition of autophagy often leads to apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagy is riskier as it may lead to cell survival instead of the desired cell death.<ref name=Paglin />\n\n=== Negative regulators of autophagy ===\nNegative regulators of autophagy, such as [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin|mTOR]], [[CFLAR|cFLIP]], and [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]] are orchestrated to function within different stages of the autophagy cascade.

Parkinson's disease is characterized by inclusions of a protein called alpha-synuclien (Lewy bodies) in affected neurons that cells cannot break down. Deregulation of the autophagy pathway and mutation of alleles regulating autophagy are believed to cause neurodegenerative diseases.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Autophagy is essential for neuronal survival.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Without efficient autophagy, neurons gather ubiquitinated protein aggregates and degrade.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Ubiquitinated proteins are proteins that have been tagged with ubiquitin to get degraded. Mutations of synuclien alleles lead to lysosome pH increase and hydrolase inhibition. As a result, lysosomes degradative capacity is decreased. There are several genetic mutations implicated in the disease, including loss of function [[PINK1]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Valente EM, Abou-Sleiman PM, Caputo V, Muqit MM, Harvey K, Gispert S, Ali Z, Del Turco D, Bentivoglio AR, Healy DG, Albanese A, Nussbaum R, Gonz\u00e1lez-Maldonado R, Deller T, Salvi S, Cortelli P, Gilks WP, Latchman DS, Harvey RJ, Dallapiccola B, Auburger G, Wood NW | title = Hereditary early-onset Parkinson's disease caused by mutations in PINK1 | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5674 | pages = 1158\u201360 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15087508 | doi = 10.1126/science.1096284 | bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1158V }}</ref> and [[Parkin (ligase)|Parkin]].<ref name = \"Kitada_1998\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kitada T, Asakawa S, Hattori N, Matsumine H, Yamamura Y, Minoshima S, Yokochi M, Mizuno Y, Shimizu N | title = Mutations in the parkin gene cause autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = 6676 | pages = 605\u20138 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9560156 | doi = 10.1038/33416 | bibcode = 1998Natur.392..605K }}</ref> Loss of function in these genes can lead to damaged mitochondrial accumulation and protein aggregates than can lead to cellular degeneration.
