He obtained a degree at Cambridge and immediately started his first job in Derby.  He married Mary, the daughter of Henry Franceys on 7 December 1684; by 1702 they had thirteen children, of whom eight then survived.<ref>K. R.

For these he developed a boring machine, which he later patented. This waterworks lasted nearly a hundred years, and he constructed others around the country, at [[Alloa]] (1712),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Margaret |title=John Erskine, 6th and 11th Earl of Mar (1675\u20131732): Architecture, Landscape and Industry |journal=Architecture Heritage |date=November 2012 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=101-107 |doi=10.3366/arch.2012.0035 |url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/arch.2012.0035 |accessdate=14 February 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref> [[Bridgnorth]], [[Bristol]], [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], [[King's Lynn]], [[Leeds]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Norwich]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Sheffield]], and [[Great Yarmouth]]. In [[London]] he built Marchants Water Works, rebuilt London Bridge Water Works and carried out improvements to the [[New River (London)|New River]]. Among his many innovations were pumps worked by water\u2011wheels which rose and fell in accordance with the level of the stream. A patent was granted to his colleague, John Hadley, in 1693.\n\nIn 1695 and 1699, he produced plans for improving navigation of both the [[River Derwent, Yorkshire|Yorkshire]]\nand \n[[River Derwent, Derbyshire|Derbyshire]]\nRiver Derwents. He was also involved in improvements to the Rivers [[River Lea|Lea]], [[River Aire|Aire]] and [[River Cam|Cam]].\n\nHe built the first silk mill in Derby to the instruction of  Thomas Cotchett, who had worked with the silk weavers of [[Spitalfields]] in London, and realised the benefit of applying power to the spinning process. He copied machines that were already in use by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] spinners.

For Sorocold, who had previously been engaged with pumps and water wheels, this was something of a challenge. The machinery when finished contained 10,000 spindles, with 25,000 spinning reel bobbins, nearly 5000 star wheels, over 9000 twist bobbins and 46,000 winding bobbins, all to be driven by a single water wheel. Lombe's Mill, extensively reconstructed after a fire in 1910, is now the [[Derby Industrial Museum]].\n\nIt was very nearly the death of him. One day, while escorting a group of visitors to the mill, Sorocold missed his footing on the walkway and fell into the sluice. The force of the water carried him into the wheel between two of the paddles, one of which gave way, ejecting him into the mill-tail.\n\nHe also improved the drainage systems for mines, built iron forges and atmospheric engines. He also advised on dock engineering, possibly Howlands Dock in [[Surrey]] and certainly the [[Old Dock]] built by [[Thomas Steers]] in [[Liverpool]].\n\nSorocold achieved national fame, and could be considered Britain's first civil engineer.<ref name=\"ice perceptions ii\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ice.org.uk/getattachment/92ebda10-21d1-4e09-adcd-7830a6742ed2/Biography-of-early-engineers.aspx |title=PERCEPTIONS OF GREAT ENGINEERS II John Rogers?
