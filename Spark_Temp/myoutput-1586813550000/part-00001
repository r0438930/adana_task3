Ten ships were built in total, of a type roughly comparable to British [[frigate]]s or American [[destroyer escort]]s. They were the only such type of ship built by the ''Kriegsmarine''. The ten ships were not given names, but were designated ''F1'' through ''F10''.\n\n==Construction==\nThe ships were built by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] (F&nbsp;1 \u2013 F&nbsp;6), [[Kiel]], [[Blohm & Voss]] (F&nbsp;7, F&nbsp;8) and Wilhelmshaven dockyard (F&nbsp;9, F&nbsp;10). They entered service between 1936 and 1939. The ships were originally conceived as fast fleet or convoy escort ships that could also perform [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] and [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeping]] work. They were also used as a testbed class for a new high-pressure steam power plant intended for use in future [[destroyer]]s.\n\nAs a class, they were overloaded and over-engined, which contributed to severe hull stress and very poor sea-keeping characteristics; these flaws were partially remedied by extensive rebuilds between 1938 and 1940. The power plants likewise proved to be prone to frequent breakdowns, and most of the ships were removed from operational service during the later years of the war after machinery failures meant the ships spent more time in repair than in use.\n\n==Use and administration==\nWith the exception of fleet service and convoy duties between 1939 and 1941, they spent most of the war in use as tenders or [[U-boat]] [[training ship]]s.  Between 1943 and 1945, the escort ships were grouped into five [[Surface flotillas of the Kriegsmarine#Escort flotillas|escort flotillas]] augmented by converted civilian craft as well as [[torpedo boat]]s of the ''[[Torpedoboot Ausland]]'' program.\n\n==Ships==\n[[File:Lot-2275-29 (26251121633).jpg|thumb|F-class ship in heavy weather]]\nOne ship, ''F&nbsp;9'', was sunk in December 1939 after being torpedoed by {{HMS|Ursula|N59|6}}. F 5 was damaged by a mine in the Baltic Sea and sank under tow 29 January 1945. F 3 was sunk by British aircraft 3 May 1945 and F 6 was sunk by US aircraft 30 March 1945. The others survived the war and were scrapped or sunk as target ships. One 'F' Class craft was blown up and sunk in Tobruk Harbour by a Black South African POW from the 2nd Division with a home -made explosive and a long wick that he hid in the hold and lit it. His name was Job Maseko. He was awarded the Military Medal for bravery.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|title=Naval Weapons of World War II|year=1985|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=0-87021-459-4}}\n*{{cite book|editor1-last=Gardiner|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Chesneau|editor2-first=Roger|title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922\u20131946|year=1980|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=London|isbn=0-85177-146-7|lastauthoramp=y}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Gr\u00f6ner|first=Erich|title=German Warships: 1815&ndash;1945|year=1990|location=Annapolis, Maryland|volume=Volume 1: Major Surface Warships|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-87021-790-9}}\n* {{cite book|last=Rohwer|first=J\u00fcrgen|title=Chronology of the War at Sea 1939\u20131945: The Naval History of World War Two|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|year=2005|edition=Third Revised|isbn=1-59114-119-2|author-link=J\u00fcrgen Rohwer}}\n* {{cite book|editor-last1=Grant|editor-first1=Ian|title=Warship 45|year=1988|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=London|isbn=0-85177-472-5|chapter=F Boote of the Kriegsmarine|last=Whitley|first=Mike|pages=16\u201322}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Flottenbegleiter}}\n* [http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/ships/escorts/flottenbegleiter/index.html page from german-navy.de]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140808124846/http://www.warshipsww2.eu/lode.php?language=E&period=&idtrida=1218 German Escort Ship class F Warshipsww2.Eu]\n\n{{WWIIGermanShips}}\n{{Kriegsmarine}}\n\n[[Category:World War II naval ships of Germany]]\n[[Category:1930s ships]]\n", "text_old": "{|{{Infobox ship begin |sclass=2}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=Lot-2275-31 (26582519310).jpg\n|Ship caption=''F9'', 1939\n}}\n{{Infobox ship class overview\n|Builders=\n|Operators={{navy|Nazi Germany}}\n|Class before=\n|Class after=\n|Subclasses=\n|Built range=1936\u20131939\n|In commission range=\n|Total ships planned=\n|Total ships completed=10\n|Total ships cancelled=\n|Total ships lost=4\n|Total ships retired=6\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship type=\n|Ship displacement=712 Tons standard, 1028 tons full load\n|Ship length={{convert|75.94|m|abbr=on}} (80.20 meters after rebuild)\n|Ship beam={{convert|8.80|m|abbr=on}}\n|Ship draught={{convert|3.24|m|abbr=on}}\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship propulsion=2 shaft, Brown-Boveri geared steam turbines, 2 boilers 14,000 shp\n|Ship speed={{convert|28|kn|km/h|1}}\n|Ship range=\n|Ship complement=121\n|Ship sensors=\n|Ship EW=\n|Ship armament=*2 \u00d7 single [[10.5 cm SK C/32 naval gun|{{cvt|10.5|cm|in}} guns]]\n*2 \u00d7 twin [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{cvt|3.7|cm|in}}]] [[AA gun]]s\n*2 \u00d7 single [[2 cm FlaK 30/38/Flakvierling|{{cvt|2|cm|in}}]] AA guns\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\nThe '''F-class escort ships''' were a class of fleet escorts ({{lang|de|Flottenbegleiter}}) used by the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during the [[Second World War]].
