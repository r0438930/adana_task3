The episode aired on April 6, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|The Cousins]] arrive at a cartel site in Mexico to pick up Lalo's bail money. As they depart, an informant inside the building makes a telephone call to report their presence.<ref name=\"variety gilligan\" />\n\nLalo gives Jimmy directions to a remote desert pickup site. Jimmy reluctantly agrees to go, but asks for $100,000, which Lalo promises to pay. Kim begs Jimmy not to go, saying he is an attorney and not a \"[[bagman]]\" for drug dealers, but he says he will do it because it will be an easy job and no one will suspect him of being the courier.\n\nThe next morning, the Cousins deliver two duffel bags of cash to Jimmy at the pickup site and immediately depart. Jimmy starts his return trip but several trucks soon cut him off. Numerous gunmen exit the vehicles, take the money, and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked by an unknown shooter. All but one are killed and their vehicles are disabled. The surviving gunman escapes in the only truck that is still drivable.\n\nThe unseen shooter was Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. He finds his truck was also disabled in the shootout, so he places a still-shaken Jimmy and the money in Jimmy's car and begins driving back to Albuquerque. Jimmy's car soon breaks down. With no cell phone coverage and no vehicle, they push the car over the edge of the road and walk cross-country with the money in order to avoid the surviving gunman. As they camp overnight, Jimmy tells Mike that Kim knows of his work for Lalo, and Mike warns Jimmy that if she knows details about the Salamancas, Kim is now \"in the game\". Jimmy and Mike resume their trek the following morning.\n\nWhen Jimmy fails to return, Kim pretends to be Lalo's attorney and asks him for Jimmy's location. Lalo refuses and tells her Jimmy will be fine because he is a survivor.\n\nA dehydrated and sunburned Jimmy reaches his limit, and Mike fails to inspire him. Mike spots the surviving gunman, who is still searching. Rather than hide as Mike intends, Jimmy regains his motivation, and runs to the road to attract the gunman's attention. When the gunman is close enough, Mike shoots, killing him and causing his vehicle to flip. Mike and Jimmy resume walking, this time on the road.\n\n== Production ==\n\"Bagman\" was directed by series co-creator [[Vince Gilligan]], who considered the episode one of the most challenging episodes he had to direct in his career.<ref name=\"variety gilligan\">{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-vince-gilligan-recap-episode-8-1234572360/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Co-Creator Vince Gilligan on Directing the Most Challenging Episode of His Career |last=Schneider |first=Michael |date=April 6, 2020 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407032114/https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-vince-gilligan-recap-episode-8-1234572360/ |archive-date=April 7, 2020 |access-date=April 6, 2020}}</ref> Gilligan had been able to make arrangements to direct one episode in the fifth season after completing filming of ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]''.
