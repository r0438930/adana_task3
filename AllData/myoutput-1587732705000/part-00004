Chinnaiah / Chinna (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) an orphan, a trusted servant, raised along with Babu in their house. They share a bond beyond a casual friendship, one of the brothers and it is acknowledged by Babu's mother Jagadamba (Santha Kumari) who treats both of equally. Once Chinna and Babu tease Parvathi (Savitri), a school teacher in their harbor school when she slaps Chinna thereafter they fall in love.  Diwanji (Gummadi) look after business affairs, is a crooked & cruel person who wants to grab the entire property. In many ways, he tries to cheat and manipulate Babu but at every step, Chinna stands as a barrier between them and protects his sovereign. Diwanji gets fed up with Chinna's behavior, insults him and remembers that he is, after all, a servant. Angered Babu, immediately gives Chinna entire authority on his property. Diwanji could not tolerate it, he uses innocence and pretends to resign the job. Here Jagadamba feels that it's good for everyone to separate Chinna & Babu. She offers a huge amount to Chinna and asks him to go away from Babu, so that, Babu could take up his responsibilities. But Chinna throws away the money and replies, he cannot live without Babu. Then Jagadamba pleads him, so, he gives her a word to do it. Knowing that Chinna is leaving Babu prays him to not do so but Chinna does not stand, therefore, Babu keeps the oath on him not to move which makes Chinna as a statue. At that moment, Jagadamba's diplomacy fails to bring them together. Time being, Babu marries a zamindar's daughter Padma (Kanchana).\n\nMeanwhile, Gopalakrishna humors and teases Chinna about Parvathi, and in a bid to force him to accept love for Parvathi, asks him to bring her to him for pleasure. He obliges and asks Parvathi the same. Heartbroken, she confronts and gives herself to Gopalakrishna who refuses her and explains the situation. She refuses to ever go back to Chinna and remains heartbroken and angry against him. In a bid to clean his image and push Chinna to senses, Gopalakrishna marries Padmavathi (Kanchana). With Chinna's help, she understands the complex character of Gopalakrishna and they form a good marital bond. Meanwhile, Parvathi continues to wither away. Labor problems persist in the factory with no one having a clue about how to handle them. Chinna is sent as a trojan horse into the labor camp by Babu to prey upon the belief and vulnerabilities of the workforce. With some acting and help from Gopalakrishna, Chinna establishes himself as a labor leader but his true intentions are only to serve his master. Parvathi sees through the drama and desperately tries to educate the labor masses against the plot to no avail. The blind belief of the laborers and their plights changes Chinna's heart. He confronts Gopalakrishna and stands up as their leader in a true light. Parvathi continues to not believe him and accuses him at will.\n\nBabu finds it impossible to bear the growing separation between him and Chinna and tries to lure him back to his camp. With each refusal of Chinna, Gopalakrishna's ego flares and it leads to violent behavior from him. In one instance, he snaps off at Simhalu (Relangi), a laborer, physically assaulting him. Babu is saved by Chinna from the mob. Chinna then tries to prove himself by asking Babu to apologize, who refuses. In uncontrollable fury, Gopalakrishna half-sanctions Chinna's murder. Diwan contrives to take these loose words into action. Knowing full well from Padmavathi's help that his life is under threat, Chinna continues on to a peaceful march for self-respect to Babu's house. This earns him back Parvathi's respect. Ignoring her pleas of life being more important, he marches on. The mob is controlled at the house by Chinna. Babu, despite carrying his gun to the mob, fails to point it to Chinna, but a counterplan by the Diwan backfires as Appalu (Chadalawada), who is the Diwan's henchman, times wrong and fires at Chinna who meets a heroic death. Babu realizes his mistakes but it is too late. Sensing ominous signs, Parvathi too falls at the feet of the local deity and dies. The culprits are all arrested by the police. A statue of Chinna rises in front of the Zamindar Babu's building with all the laborers, paying tearful tribute to Chinna.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Akkineni Nageswara Rao]] as Chinnaiah\n*[[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]] as Parvathi\n*[[Jaggayya (actor)|Jaggayya]] as Chinna Babu Gopala Krishna  \n*[[Gummadi Venkateswara Rao|Gummadi]] as Diwanji \n*[[Relangi Venkata Ramaiah|Relangi]] as Simhalu\n*[[Allu Ramalingaiah]] as Seshayya\n*[[Chadalavada Kutumba Rao|Chadalavada]] as Appalu\n*Dr. Sivaramakrishnaiah as Nandesam Seth\n*A.
