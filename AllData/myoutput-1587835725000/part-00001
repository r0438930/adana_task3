The contract stipulated that Tottenham would receive 40% of any future transfer profit, in addition to the payments already made. His move was proved to be one of the bargains of the season as Taarabt scored 19 goals in 44 league appearances that season for the West London club. With his unpredictable skill and reputation for never giving the opposition defence an easy 90 minutes, Taarabt went on to win the Championship Player of the Year award and gained a place in the Championship's best XI, which also featured teammate [[Paddy Kenny]].\n\nIn March 2011, Taarabt missed two matches when he returned to France for family matters as one of his cousins had been killed by Algerians. In the international Morocco\u2013Algeria match, Taarabt picked up a booking and was lucky not to be sent off. In the return fixture Morocco manager [[Erik Gerets]] opted to drop Taarabt to the substitutes' bench. Taarabt decided to not turn up to the international fixture and vowed to never play for his country again. However, several months later, Taarabt wanted to play for Morocco again, which Gerets reluctantly allowed, but said that if Taarabt acted irrationally again, he would not play for his country while he was in charge.\n\nSome notable moments during the season were against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (an away 2\u20132 draw), where Taarabt picked up a brace, scoring a wonder goal in the process. During the home match against the same opposition, Taarabt scored the winner which took QPR back to the top of the Championship.\n\n====2011\u201312 season====\n[[File:Adel Taarabt.jpg|thumb|upright|Taarabt playing for [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 2011]]\n\nThe [[2011\u201312 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|2011\u201312 season]] marked Taarabt's first real foray into the Premier League, for although having been featured in English football's highest tier as a Tottenham player, he had never made a breakthrough into the Spurs' starting XI. The start of the season held much optimism for both QPR and Taarabt, yet this soon gave way to speculation that he would move away, and his name was associated with the likes of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[S.S.C.

The contract stipulated that Tottenham would receive 40% of any future transfer profit, in addition to the payments already made. His move was proved to be one of the bargains of the season as Taarabt scored 19 goals in 44 league appearances that season for the West London club. With his unpredictable skill and reputation for never giving the opposition defence an easy 90 minutes, Taarabt went on to win the Championship Player of the Year award and gained a place in the Championship's best XI, which also featured teammate [[Paddy Kenny]].\n\nIn March 2011, Taarabt missed two matches when he returned to France for family matters as one of his cousins had been killed by Algerians. In the international Morocco\u2013Algeria match, Taarabt picked up a booking and was lucky not to be sent off. In the return fixture Morocco manager [[Erik Gerets]] opted to drop Taarabt to the substitutes' bench. Taarabt decided to not turn up to the international fixture and vowed to never play for his country again. However, several months later, Taarabt wanted to play for Morocco again, which Gerets reluctantly allowed, but said that if Taarabt acted irrationally again, he would not play for his country while he was in charge.\n\nSome notable moments during the season were against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (an away 2\u20132 draw), where Taarabt picked up a brace, scoring a wonder goal in the process. During the home match against the same opposition, Taarabt scored the winner which took QPR back to the top of the Championship.\n\n====2011\u201312 season====\n[[File:Adel Taarabt.jpg|thumb|upright|Taarabt playing for [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 2011]]\n\nThe [[2011\u201312 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|2011\u201312 season]] marked Taarabt's first real foray into the Premier League, for although having been featured in English football's highest tier as a Tottenham player, he had never made a breakthrough into the Spurs' starting XI. The start of the season held much optimism for both QPR and Taarabt, yet this soon gave way to speculation that he would move away, and his name was associated with the likes of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[S.S.C.
