[[Halle Berry]]'s character Jinx drove one in the movie. The mainly superficial design changes for the 007 edition Thunderbird were designed by [[Sid Ramnarace]], including the coral paint color which would become the basis for the Jinx character's wardrobe.

It is a fully functional full-sized six-wheeled prototype. [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]] was originally approached to build and design the prototype since the original FAB 1 was a Rolls-Royce, but [[BMW]] (current owner of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars) declined due to their development of the [[Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Phantom]]. Ford then replaced Rolls-Royce and designed and built the car based on the film's namesake vehicle. The car was featured in a segment of [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] in which presenter [[James May]] test drove the vehicle on public roads.\n\n==Sales and production==\nOfficial production of the 2002 Thunderbird began June 5, 2001. Ford expected sales of 25,000 units per year, but despite strong sales during its initial launch which had dealers charging well over the [[manufacturer's suggested retail price]], this goal could not be met after the introductory year. The 2002 Thunderbird sold 31,368 units and sales declined each subsequent year until its cancellation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.portholeauthority.com/thenewtbird/2002/colors02.html|title=The Porthole Authority 2002\u20132005 Thunderbird Production and Specs|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref>\n\nFord's tinkering with the exterior/interior packages did not yield a sales boost. Just 11,998 were sold in 2004. The Ford Motor Company announced in March 2005 that the Thunderbird would again be discontinued in July of that year, with 9,548 sold for 2005. Unlike previous T-birds, a second row of seats was not added which might have widened its appeal, though Lincoln had the LS rather than an upscale Mark based on a Thunderbird platform.  The last Ford Thunderbird rolled off the assembly line on July 1, 2005.\n\n''[[Forbes]]'' magazine writer Jerry Flint attributed significant blame of the latest generation Thunderbird's demise to a lack of proper sales and marketing, writing: \"Ford dealers have been successful selling $35,000-45,000 trucks, but have little experience selling automobiles in the near-luxury price range. If there was a marketing effort by Ford Motor, I wasn't aware of it. Naturally, sales didn't meet expectations.\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

[[Halle Berry]]'s character Jinx drove one in the movie. The mainly superficial design changes for the 007 edition Thunderbird were designed by [[Sid Ramnarace]], including the coral paint color which would become the basis for the Jinx character's wardrobe.  Ford issued a limited edition to commemorate the movie.\n\n{{main|FAB1}}\n{{Infobox fictional vehicle\n| name           = FAB 1 (''[[Thunderbirds (2004 film)|Thunderbirds]]'')\n| image          = FAB 1 front-left2 Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.jpg\n| caption        = FAB 1 on display at the [[Heritage Motor Centre]]\n| class          = Customised [[List of Ford vehicles|Ford]]\n| max_speed      = {{Convert|199|mph}}<br>{{Nowrap|{{Convert|100|kn}} (on water)}}<br>{{Convert|5,664|mph}} (in air)\n| armaments      = [[Mini-gun]]s, [[heat-seeking missile]] launchers, [[torpedo]] tubes\n| power          = [[Nuclear fusion]] reactor\n| propulsion     = Gas turbine jet engine, hover engines\n| mass           = {{Convert|3.3|LT|MT}}\n| length         = {{Convert|26|ft}}\n| width          = {{Convert|7|ft}}\n| height         = {{Convert|5.5|ft}}\n}}\n\nThe 2004 live-action film ''[[Thunderbirds (2004 film)|Thunderbirds]]'' (an adaptation of the [[Thunderbirds (TV series)|famed British \"Supermarionation\" series]]) featured a heavily modified 11th generation Ford Thunderbird called FAB 1. It is a fully functional full-sized six-wheeled prototype. [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]] was originally approached to build and design the prototype since the original FAB 1 was a Rolls-Royce, but [[BMW]] (current owner of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars) declined due to their development of the [[Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Phantom]]. Ford then replaced Rolls-Royce and designed and built the car based on the film's namesake vehicle. The car was featured in a segment of [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] in which presenter [[James May]] test drove the vehicle on public roads.\n\n==Sales and production==\nOfficial production of the 2002 Thunderbird began June 5, 2001. Ford expected sales of 25,000 units per year, but despite strong sales during its initial launch which had dealers charging well over the [[manufacturer's suggested retail price]], this goal could not be met after the introductory year. The 2002 Thunderbird sold 31,368 units and sales declined each subsequent year until its cancellation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.portholeauthority.com/thenewtbird/2002/colors02.html|title=The Porthole Authority 2002\u20132005 Thunderbird Production and Specs|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref>\n\nFord's tinkering with the exterior/interior packages did not yield a sales boost. Just 11,998 were sold in 2004. The Ford Motor Company announced in March 2005 that the Thunderbird would again be discontinued in July of that year, with 9,548 sold for 2005. Unlike previous T-birds, a second row of seats was not added which might have widened its appeal, though Lincoln had the LS rather than an upscale Mark based on a Thunderbird platform.  The last Ford Thunderbird rolled off the assembly line on July 1, 2005.\n\n''[[Forbes]]'' magazine writer Jerry Flint attributed significant blame of the latest generation Thunderbird's demise to a lack of proper sales and marketing, writing: \"Ford dealers have been successful selling $35,000-45,000 trucks, but have little experience selling automobiles in the near-luxury price range. If there was a marketing effort by Ford Motor, I wasn't aware of it. Naturally, sales didn't meet expectations.\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! Year\n!
