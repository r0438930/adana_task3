This hairbrush is like a fiber bundle in which the base space is a cylinder and the fibers ([[bristle]]s) are line segments. The mapping <math>\\pi\\colon E \\to B</math> would take a point on any bristle and map it to its root on the cylinder.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], and particularly [[topology]], a '''fiber bundle''' (or, in [[British English]], '''fibre bundle''') is a [[Space (mathematics)|space]] that is ''locally'' a [[product space]], but ''globally'' may have a different [[topological structure]]. Specifically, the similarity between a space <math>E</math> and a product space <math>B \\times F</math> is defined using a [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[Surjective function|surjective]] [[Map (mathematics)|map]]\n\n:<math>\\pi\\colon E \\to B</math>\n\nthat in small regions of ''E'' behaves just like a projection from corresponding regions of <math>B \\times F</math> to <math>B</math>.  The map <math>\\pi</math>, called the '''projection''' or [[submersion (mathematics)|'''submersion''']] of the bundle, is regarded as part of the structure of the bundle.  The space <math>E</math> is known as the '''total space''' of the fiber bundle, <math>B</math> as the '''base space''', and <math>F</math> the '''fiber'''.\n\nIn the ''trivial'' case, <math>E</math> is just <math>B \\times F</math>, and the map \u03c0 is just the projection from the product space to the first factor.  This is called a '''trivial bundle'''. Examples of non-trivial fiber bundles include the [[M\u00f6bius strip]] and [[Klein bottle]], as well as nontrivial [[covering space]]s.  Fiber bundles such as the [[tangent bundle]] of a [[manifold]] and more general [[vector bundle]]s play an important role in [[differential geometry]] and [[differential topology]], as do [[principal bundle]]s.\n\nMappings between total spaces of fiber bundles that \"commute\" with the projection maps are known as [[bundle map]]s, and the class of fiber bundles forms a [[category theory|category]] with respect to such mappings.  A bundle map from the base space itself (with the identity mapping as projection) to <math>E</math> is called a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of <math>E</math>.  Fiber bundles can be specialized in a number of ways, the most common of which is requiring that the transitions between the local trivial patches lie in a certain [[topological group]], known as the '''structure group''', acting on the fiber <math>F</math>.\n\n== History ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn [[topology]], the terms '''''fiber''''' (German: '''''Faser''''') and '''''fiber space''''' ('''''gefaserter Raum''''') appeared for the first time in a paper by [[Herbert Seifert]] in 1933,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Topologie dreidimensionaler gefaserter R\u00e4ume|first=Herbert|last= Seifert|authorlink=Herbert Seifert| journal=[[Acta Mathematica]]| volume=60|year=1933|pages=147\u2013238|doi=10.1007/bf02398271|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>[https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.acta/1485887992 \"Topologie Dreidimensionaler Gefaserter R\u00e4ume\"] on [[Project Euclid]].</ref> but his definitions are limited to a very special case. The main difference from the present day conception of a fiber space, however, was that for Seifert what is now called the '''base space''' (topological space) of a fiber (topological) space ''E'' was not part of the structure, but derived from it as a quotient space of ''E''.

The space <math>B</math> is called the '''base space''' of the bundle, <math>E</math> the '''total space''', and <math>F</math> the '''fiber'''. The map ''\u03c0'' is called the '''projection map''' (or bundle projection). We shall assume in what follows that the base space <math>B</math> is [[connected space|connected]].\n\nWe require that for every <math>x \\in B</math>, there is an open [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] <math>U \\subset B</math> of <math>x</math> (which will be called a trivializing neighborhood) such that there is a [[homeomorphism]] <math>\\varphi:\\pi^{-1}(U) \\rightarrow U \\times F</math> (where <math>U \\times F</math> is the product space) in such a way that ''\u03c0'' agrees with the projection onto the first factor. That is, the following diagram should [[commutative diagram|commute]]:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|[[image:Fibre bundle local trivial.svg|Local triviality condition|230px|center]]|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere <math>\\text{proj}_1: U \\times F \\rightarrow U</math> is the natural projection and <math>\\varphi:\\pi^{-1}(U) \\rightarrow U \\times F</math> is a homeomorphism. The set of all <math>\\left\\{\\left(U_i,\\, \\varphi_i\\right)\\right\\}</math> is called a '''local trivialization''' of the bundle.\n\nThus for any <math>p \\in B</math>, the [[preimage]] <math>\\pi^{-1}(\\{p\\})</math> is homeomorphic to <math>F</math> (since proj<sub>1</sub><sup>\u22121</sup>({''p''}) clearly is) and is called the '''fiber over ''p'''''. Every fiber bundle <math>\\pi: E \\rightarrow B</math> is an [[open map]], since projections of products are open maps. Therefore <math>B</math> carries the [[quotient topology]] determined by the map ''\u03c0''.\n\nA fiber bundle <math>(E,\\, B,\\, \\pi,\\, F)</math> is often denoted\n{{NumBlk\n|:| <math>\\begin{matrix}\n  {} \\\\\n  F \\longrightarrow E\\ \\xrightarrow{\\,\\ \\pi\\ }\\ B \\\\\n  {}\n\\end{matrix}</math>\n | {{EquationRef|2}}\n}} that, in analogy with a [[short exact sequence]], indicates which space is the fiber, total space and base space, as well as the map from total to base space.\n\nA '''smooth fiber bundle''' is a fiber bundle in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[smooth manifold]]s. That is, <math>E</math>, <math>B</math>, and <math>F</math> are required to be smooth manifolds and all the functions above are required to be [[smooth map]]s.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Trivial bundle ===\n\nLet <math>E = B \\times F</math> and let <math>\\pi: E \\rightarrow B</math> be the projection onto the first factor. Then <math>E</math> is a fiber bundle (of <math>F</math>) over <math>B</math>. Here <math>E</math> is not just locally a product but ''globally'' one. Any such fiber bundle is called a '''trivial bundle'''. Any fiber bundle over a contractible [[CW-complex]] is trivial.\n\n=== Nontrivial bundles ===\n\n==== M\u00f6bius strip ====\n\n[[File:Moebius Surface 1 Display Small.png|thumb|right|The M\u00f6bius strip is a nontrivial bundle over the circle.]]\nPerhaps the simplest example of a nontrivial bundle <math>E</math> is the [[M\u00f6bius strip]]. It has the [[circle]] that runs lengthwise along the center of the strip as a base <math>B</math> and a line segment for the fiber <math>F</math>, so the M\u00f6bius strip is a bundle of the line segment over the circle. A neighborhood <math>U</math> of <math>\\pi(x) \\in B</math> ( where <math>x \\in E</math>) is an arc; in the picture, this is the length of one of the squares. The preimage <math>\\pi^{-1}(U)</math> in the picture is a (somewhat twisted) slice of the strip four squares wide and one long.\n\nA homeomorphism (<math>\\varphi</math> in the Formal Definition section) exists that maps the preimage of <math>U</math> (the trivializing neighborhood) to a slice of a cylinder: curved, but not twisted. This pair locally trivializes the strip. The corresponding trivial bundle <math>B\\times F</math> would be a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], but the M\u00f6bius strip has an overall \"twist\". This twist is visible only globally; locally the M\u00f6bius strip and the cylinder are identical (making a single vertical cut in either gives the same space).\n\n==== Klein bottle ====\n\nA similar nontrivial bundle is the [[Klein bottle]], which can be viewed as a \"twisted\" circle bundle over another circle. The corresponding non-twisted (trivial) bundle is the 2-[[torus]], <math>S^1 \\times S^1</math>.\n\n{|\n|[[File:KleinBottle-01.png|thumb|120px|The Klein bottle [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersed]] in three-dimensional space.]]\n|[[File:Torus.png|thumb|160px|A torus.]]\n|}\n\n=== Covering map ===\n\nA '''[[covering map|covering space]]''' is a fiber bundle such that the bundle projection is a [[local homeomorphism]]. It follows that the fiber is a [[discrete space]].\n\n=== Vector and principal bundles ===\n\nA special class of fiber bundles, called '''[[vector bundle]]s''', are those whose fibers are [[vector space]]s (to qualify as a vector bundle the structure group of the bundle \u2014 see below \u2014 must be a [[general linear group|linear group]]). Important examples of vector bundles include the [[tangent bundle]] and [[cotangent bundle]] of a smooth manifold. From any vector bundle, one can construct the [[frame bundle]] of [[basis (mathematics)|bases]], which is a principal bundle (see below).\n\nAnother special class of fiber bundles, called '''[[principal bundle]]s''', are bundles on whose fibers a free and transitive [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] by a group <math>G</math> is given, so that each fiber is a [[principal homogeneous space]]. The bundle is often specified along with the group by referring to it as a principal <math>G</math>-bundle. The group <math>G</math> is also the structure group of the bundle. Given a [[group representation|representation]] <math>\\rho</math> of <math>G</math> on a vector space <math>V</math>, a vector bundle with <math>\\rho(G) \\subseteq \\text{Aut}(V)</math> as a structure group may be constructed, known as the [[associated bundle]].\n\n=== Sphere bundles ===\n{{main|sphere bundle}}\nA '''sphere bundle''' is a fiber bundle whose fiber is an [[hypersphere|''n''-sphere]]. Given a vector bundle <math>E</math> with a [[metric tensor|metric]] (such as the tangent bundle to a [[Riemannian manifold]]) one can construct the associated '''unit sphere bundle''', for which the fiber over a point <math>x</math> is the set of all unit vectors in <math>E_x</math>. When the vector bundle in question is the tangent bundle <math>TM</math>, the unit sphere bundle is known as the '''[[unit tangent bundle]]'''. {{clear}}\n\nA sphere bundle is partially characterized by its [[Euler class]], which is a degree <math>n + 1</math> [[cohomology]] class in the total space of the bundle. In the case <math>n = 1</math> the sphere bundle is called a [[circle bundle]] and the Euler class is equal to the first [[Chern class]], which characterizes the topology of the bundle completely. For any <math>n</math>, given the Euler class of a bundle, one can calculate its cohomology using a [[long exact sequence]] called the [[Gysin sequence]].\n\n{{See also|Wang sequence}}\n\n=== Mapping tori ===\nIf ''X'' is a [[topological space]] and <math>f:X \\rightarrow X</math> is a [[homeomorphism]] then the [[mapping torus]] <math>M_f</math> has a natural structure of a fiber bundle over the [[circle]] with fiber <math>X</math>. Mapping tori of homeomorphisms of surfaces are of particular importance in  [[3-manifold|3-manifold topology]].\n\n=== Quotient spaces ===\nIf <math>G</math> is a [[topological group]] and <math>H</math> is a [[closed subgroup]], then under some circumstances, the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] <math>G/H</math> together with the quotient map <math>\\pi\\colon G \\to G/H</math> is a fiber bundle, whose fiber is the topological space <math>H</math>. A necessary and sufficient condition for (<math>G,\\, G/H,\\, \\pi,\\, H</math>) to form a fiber bundle is that the mapping <math>\\pi</math> admit [[#Sections|local cross-sections]] {{harv|Steenrod|1951|loc=\u00a77}}.\n\nThe most general conditions under which the quotient map will admit local cross-sections are not known, although if <math>G</math> is a [[Lie group]] and <math>H</math> a closed subgroup (and thus a Lie subgroup by [[Closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]]), then the quotient map is a fiber bundle. One example of this is the [[Hopf fibration]], <math>S^3 \\to S^2</math>, which is a fiber bundle over the sphere <math>S^2</math> whose total space is <math>S^3</math>. From the perspective of Lie groups, <math>S^3</math> can be identified with the [[special unitary group]] <math>SU(2)</math>. The abelian subgroup of diagonal matrices is isomorphic to the [[circle group]] <math>U(1)</math>, and the quotient <math>SU(2)/U(1)</math> is diffeomorphic to the sphere.\n\nMore generally, if <math>G</math> is any topological group and <math>H</math> a closed subgroup that also happens to be a Lie group, then <math>G \\to G/H</math> is a fiber bundle.\n\n== Sections ==\n{{main article|Section (fiber bundle)}}\n\nA '''section''' (or '''cross section''') of a fiber bundle <math>\\pi</math> is a continuous map <math>f\\colon B \\to E</math> such that <math>\\pi(f(x)) = x</math> for all ''x'' in ''B''. Since bundles do not in general have globally defined sections, one of the purposes of the theory is to account for their existence. The [[obstruction theory|obstruction]] to the existence of a section can often be measured by a cohomology class, which leads to the theory of [[characteristic class]]es in [[algebraic topology]].\n\nThe most well-known example is the [[hairy ball theorem]], where the [[Euler class]] is the obstruction to the [[tangent bundle]] of the 2-sphere having a nowhere vanishing section.\n\nOften one would like to define sections only locally (especially when global sections do not exist). A '''local section''' of a fiber bundle is a continuous map <math>f\\colon U \\to E</math> where ''U'' is an [[open set]] in ''B'' and <math>\\pi(f(x)) = x</math> for all ''x'' in ''U''. If <math>(U,\\, \\varphi)</math> is a local trivialization chart then local sections always exist over ''U''. Such sections are in 1-1 correspondence with continuous maps <math>U \\to F</math>. Sections form a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]].\n\n== Structure groups and transition functions ==\nFiber bundles often come with a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of symmetries that describe the matching conditions between overlapping local trivialization charts. Specifically, let ''G'' be a [[topological group]] that [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] continuously on the fiber space ''F'' on the left. We lose nothing if we require ''G'' to act [[faithful action|faithfully]] on ''F'' so that it may be thought of as a group of [[homeomorphism]]s of ''F''. A '''''G''-[[atlas (topology)|atlas]]''' for the bundle (''E'', ''B'', ''\u03c0'', ''F'') is a set of local trivialization charts <math>\\{(U_k,\\, \\varphi_k)\\}</math> such that for any <math>\\varphi_i,\\varphi_j</math> for the overlapping charts <math>(U_i,\\, \\varphi_i)</math> and <math>(U_j,\\, \\varphi_j)</math> the function\n: <math>\\varphi_i\\varphi_j^{-1}\\colon \\left(U_i \\cap U_j\\right) \\times F \\to \\left(U_i \\cap U_j\\right) \\times F</math>\n\nis given by\n: <math>\\varphi_i\\varphi_j^{-1}(x,\\, \\xi) = \\left(x,\\, t_{ij}(x)\\xi\\right)</math>\n\nwhere ''t''<sub>''ij''</sub> : ''U''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2229 ''U''<sub>''j''</sub> \u2192 ''G'' is a continuous map called a '''transition function'''. Two ''G''-atlases are equivalent if their union is also a ''G''-atlas. A '''''G''-bundle''' is a fiber bundle with an equivalence class of ''G''-atlases. The group ''G'' is called the '''structure group''' of the bundle; the analogous term in physics is [[gauge group]].\n\nIn the smooth category, a ''G''-bundle is a smooth fiber bundle where ''G'' is a [[Lie group]] and the corresponding action on ''F'' is smooth and the transition functions are all smooth maps.\n\nThe transition functions ''t''<sub>''ij''</sub> satisfy the following conditions\n# <math>t_{ii}(x) = 1\\,</math>\n# <math>t_{ij}(x) = t_{ji}(x)^{-1}\\,</math>\n# <math>t_{ik}(x) = t_{ij}(x)t_{jk}(x).\\,</math>\n\nThe third condition applies on triple overlaps ''U<sub>i</sub>'' \u2229 ''U<sub>j</sub>'' \u2229 ''U<sub>k</sub>'' and is called the '''cocycle condition''' (see [[\u010cech cohomology]]). The importance of this is that the transition functions determine the fiber bundle (if one assumes the \u010cech cocycle condition).\n\nA [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundle]] is a ''G''-bundle where the fiber ''F'' is a [[principal homogeneous space]] for the left action of ''G'' itself (equivalently, one can specify that the action of ''G'' on the fiber ''F'' is free and transitive, i.e. [[Group action (mathematics)#Regular|regular]]). In this case, it is often a matter of convenience to identify ''F'' with ''G'' and so obtain a (right) action of ''G'' on the principal bundle.\n\n== Bundle maps ==\n{{Main article|Bundle map}}\nIt is useful to have notions of a mapping between two fiber bundles.  Suppose that ''M'' and ''N'' are base spaces, and <math>\\pi_E\\colon E \\to M</math> and <math>\\pi_F\\colon F \\to N</math> are fiber bundles over ''M'' and ''N'', respectively.  A bundle map (or '''bundle morphism''') consists of a pair of continuous<ref>Depending on the category of spaces involved, the functions may be assumed to have properties other than continuity.  For instance, in the category of differentiable manifolds, the functions are assumed to be smooth.  In the category of algebraic varieties, they are regular morphisms.</ref> functions\n:<math>\\varphi\\colon E \\to F,\\quad f\\colon M \\to N</math>\n\nsuch that <math>\\pi_F\\circ \\varphi = f\\circ\\pi_E</math>.  That is, the following [[commutative diagram|diagram commutes]]:\n[[File:BundleMorphism-04.svg|150px|center]]\n\nFor fiber bundles with structure group ''G'' and whose total spaces are (right) ''G''-spaces (such as a principal bundle), bundle morphisms are also required to be ''G''-[[equivariant]] on the fibers. This means that <math>\\varphi\\colon E \\to F</math> is also ''G''-morphism from one ''G''-space to another, i.e., <math>\\varphi(xs) = \\varphi(x)s</math> for all <math>x\\in E</math> and <math>s\\in G</math>.\n\nIn case the base spaces ''M'' and ''N'' coincide, then a bundle morphism over ''M'' from the fiber bundle <math>\\pi_E\\colon E \\to M</math> to <math>\\pi_F\\colon F \\to M</math> is a map <math>\\varphi \\colon E \\to F</math> such that <math>\\pi_E = \\pi_F\\circ\\varphi</math>. This means that the bundle map <math>\\varphi \\colon E \\to F</math> covers the identity of ''M''. That is, <math>f \\equiv \\mathrm{id}_{M}</math> and the diagram commutes\n[[File:BundleMorphism-03.svg|120px|center]]\n\nAssume that both <math>\\pi_E\\colon E \\to M</math> and <math>\\pi_F\\colon F \\to M</math> are defined over the same base space ''M''. A bundle isomorphism is a bundle map <math>(\\varphi,\\, f)</math> between ''\u03c0''<sub>''E''</sub> : ''E'' \u2192 ''M'' and ''\u03c0''<sub>''F''</sub> : ''F'' \u2192 ''M'' such that <math>f \\equiv \\mathrm{id}_{M}</math> and such that \u03c6 is also a homeomorphism.<ref>Or is, at least, invertible in the appropriate category; e.g., a diffeomorphism.</ref>\n\n== Differentiable fiber bundles ==\nIn the category of [[differentiable manifold]]s, fiber bundles arise naturally as [[submersion (mathematics)|submersions]] of one manifold to another. Not every (differentiable) submersion \u0192&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''N'' from a differentiable manifold ''M'' to another differentiable manifold ''N'' gives rise to a differentiable fiber bundle. For one thing, the map must be surjective, and (''M'', ''N'', \u0192) is called a [[fibered manifold]]. However, this necessary condition is not quite sufficient, and there are a variety of sufficient conditions in common use.\n\nIf ''M'' and ''N'' are compact and connected, then any submersion ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''N'' gives rise to a fiber bundle in the sense that there is a fiber space ''F'' diffeomorphic to each of the fibers such that (''E'', ''B'', ''\u03c0'', ''F'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''M'', ''N'', \u0192, ''F'') is a fiber bundle.  (Surjectivity of \u0192 follows by the assumptions already given in this case.) More generally, the assumption of compactness can be relaxed if the submersion \u0192&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''N'' is assumed to be a surjective [[proper map]], meaning that \u0192<sup>\u22121</sup>(''K'') is compact for every compact subset ''K'' of ''N''. Another sufficient condition, due to {{harvtxt|Ehresmann|1951}}, is that if \u0192&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''N'' is a surjective [[submersion (mathematics)|submersion]] with ''M'' and ''N'' [[differentiable manifold]]s such that the preimage \u0192<sup>\u22121</sup>{''x''} is [[compact set|compact]] and [[Connection (mathematics)|connected]] for all ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''N'', then \u0192 admits a compatible fiber bundle structure {{harv|Michor|2008|loc=\u00a717}}.\n\n== Generalizations ==\n* The notion of a [[bundle (mathematics)|bundle]] applies to many more categories in mathematics, at the expense of appropriately modifying the local triviality condition; cf. [[principal homogeneous space]] and [[torsor (algebraic geometry)]].\n* In topology, a [[fibration]] is a mapping ''\u03c0'' : ''E'' \u2192 ''B'' that has certain [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] properties in common with fiber bundles.  Specifically, under mild technical assumptions a fiber bundle always has the [[homotopy lifting property]] or homotopy covering property (see {{harvtxt|Steenrod|1951|loc=11.7}} for details).  This is the defining property of a fibration.\n* A section of a fiber bundle is a \"function whose output range is continuously dependent on the input.\" This property is formally captured in the notion of [[dependent type]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Covering map]]\n* [[Fibration]]\n* [[Gauge theory]]\n* [[Hopf bundle]]\n* [[I-bundle]]\n* [[Principal bundle]]\n* [[Projective bundle]]\n* [[Pullback bundle]]\n* [[Universal bundle]]\n* [[Fibered manifold]]\n* [[Vector bundle]]\n* [[Affine bundle]]\n* [[Equivariant bundle]]\n* [[Natural bundle]]\n* [[Quasifibration]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation|first=Norman|last=Steenrod|authorlink=Norman Steenrod|title=The Topology of Fibre Bundles|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1951|isbn=978-0-691-08055-0}}\n* {{citation|first=David|last=Bleecker|title=Gauge Theory and Variational Principles|publisher=Addison-Wesley publishing|location=Reading, Mass|year=1981|isbn=978-0-201-10096-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gaugetheoryvaria00blee_0}}\n* {{cite conference | first = Charles | last = Ehresmann | authorlink=Charles Ehresmann|title = Les connexions infinit\u00e9simales dans un espace fibr\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentiable | booktitle = Colloque de Topologie (Espaces fibr\u00e9s), Bruxelles, 1950 |publisher = Georges Thone, Li\u00e8ge; Masson et Cie., Paris, 1951 | pages = 29\u201355}}\n* {{citation|first=Dale|last=Husemoller|authorlink=Dale Husemoller| title=Fibre Bundles|publisher=Springer Verlag|year=1994|isbn=978-0-387-94087-8}}\n* {{citation|first=Peter W.|last=Michor|title=Topics in Differential Geometry|series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]]|volume=Vol. 93|publisher=American Mathematical Society|location=Providence|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8218-2003-2}}\n* {{springer|first=M.I.|last=Voitsekhovskii|id=F/f040060|title=Fibre space|year=2001}}\n\n{{tensors}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040808115056/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/FiberBundle.html Fiber Bundle], PlanetMath\n* {{MathWorld|urlname=FiberBundle|title=Fiber Bundle|author=Rowland, Todd}}\n* [http://www.popmath.org.uk/sculpmath/pagesm/fibundle.html Making John Robinson's Symbolic Sculpture `Eternity']\n* [[Gennadi Sardanashvily|Sardanashvily, Gennadi]], Fibre bundles, jet manifolds and Lagrangian theory.

The mapping <math>\\pi\\colon E \\to B</math> would take a point on any bristle and map it to its root on the cylinder.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], and particularly [[topology]], a '''fiber bundle''' (or, in [[British English]], '''fibre bundle''') is a [[Space (mathematics)|space]] that is ''locally'' a [[product space]], but ''globally'' may have a different [[topological structure]]. Specifically, the similarity between a space <math>E</math> and a product space <math>B \\times F</math> is defined using a [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[Surjective function|surjective]] [[Map (mathematics)|map]]\n\n:<math>\\pi\\colon E \\to B</math>\n\nthat in small regions of ''E'' behaves just like a projection from corresponding regions of <math>B \\times F</math> to <math>B</math>.  The map <math>\\pi</math>, called the '''projection''' or [[submersion (mathematics)|'''submersion''']] of the bundle, is regarded as part of the structure of the bundle.  The space <math>E</math> is known as the '''total space''' of the fiber bundle, <math>B</math> as the '''base space''', and <math>F</math> the '''fiber'''.\n\nIn the ''trivial'' case, <math>E</math> is just <math>B \\times F</math>, and the map \u03c0 is just the projection from the product space to the first factor.  This is called a '''trivial bundle'''. Examples of non-trivial fiber bundles include the [[M\u00f6bius strip]] and [[Klein bottle]], as well as nontrivial [[covering space]]s.  Fiber bundles such as the [[tangent bundle]] of a [[manifold]] and more general [[vector bundle]]s play an important role in [[differential geometry]] and [[differential topology]], as do [[principal bundle]]s.\n\nMappings between total spaces of fiber bundles that \"commute\" with the projection maps are known as [[bundle map]]s, and the class of fiber bundles forms a [[category theory|category]] with respect to such mappings.  A bundle map from the base space itself (with the identity mapping as projection) to <math>E</math> is called a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of <math>E</math>.  Fiber bundles can be specialized in a number of ways, the most common of which is requiring that the transitions between the local trivial patches lie in a certain [[topological group]], known as the '''structure group''', acting on the fiber <math>F</math>.\n\n== History ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn [[topology]], the terms '''''fiber''''' (German: '''''Faser''''') and '''''fiber space''''' ('''''gefaserter Raum''''') appeared for the first time in a paper by [[Herbert Seifert]] in 1933,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Topologie dreidimensionaler gefaserter R\u00e4ume|first=Herbert|last= Seifert|authorlink=Herbert Seifert| journal=[[Acta Mathematica]]| volume=60|year=1933|pages=147\u2013238|doi=10.1007/bf02398271|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>[https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.acta/1485887992 \"Topologie Dreidimensionaler Gefaserter R\u00e4ume\"] on [[Project Euclid]].</ref> but his definitions are limited to a very special case.

The space <math>B</math> is called the '''base space''' of the bundle, <math>E</math> the '''total space''', and <math>F</math> the '''fiber'''. The map ''\u03c0'' is called the '''projection map''' (or bundle projection). We shall assume in what follows that the base space <math>B</math> is [[connected space|connected]].\n\nWe require that for every <math>x \\in B</math>, there is an open [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] <math>U \\subset B</math> of <math>x</math> (which will be called a trivializing neighborhood) such that there is a [[homeomorphism]] <math>\\varphi:\\pi^{-1}(U) \\rightarrow U \\times F</math> (where <math>U \\times F</math> is the product space) in such a way that ''\u03c0'' agrees with the projection onto the first factor. That is, the following diagram should [[commutative diagram|commute]]:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|[[image:Fibre bundle local trivial.svg|Local triviality condition|230px|center]]|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere <math>\\text{proj}_1: U \\times F \\rightarrow U</math> is the natural projection and <math>\\varphi:\\pi^{-1}(U) \\rightarrow U \\times F</math> is a homeomorphism. The set of all <math>\\left\\{\\left(U_i,\\, \\varphi_i\\right)\\right\\}</math> is called a '''local trivialization''' of the bundle.\n\nThus for any <math>p \\in B</math>, the [[preimage]] <math>\\pi^{-1}(\\{p\\})</math> is homeomorphic to <math>F</math> (since proj<sub>1</sub><sup>\u22121</sup>({''p''}) clearly is) and is called the '''fiber over ''p'''''. Every fiber bundle <math>\\pi: E \\rightarrow B</math> is an [[open map]], since projections of products are open maps. Therefore <math>B</math> carries the [[quotient topology]] determined by the map ''\u03c0''.\n\nA fiber bundle <math>(E,\\, B,\\, \\pi,\\, F)</math> is often denoted\n{{NumBlk\n|:| <math>\\begin{matrix}\n  {} \\\\\n  F \\longrightarrow E\\ \\xrightarrow{\\,\\ \\pi\\ }\\ B \\\\\n  {}\n\\end{matrix}</math>\n | {{EquationRef|2}}\n}} that, in analogy with a [[short exact sequence]], indicates which space is the fiber, total space and base space, as well as the map from total to base space.\n\nA '''smooth fiber bundle''' is a fiber bundle in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[smooth manifold]]s. That is, <math>E</math>, <math>B</math>, and <math>F</math> are required to be smooth manifolds and all the functions above are required to be [[smooth map]]s.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Trivial bundle ===\n\nLet <math>E = B \\times F</math> and let <math>\\pi: E \\rightarrow B</math> be the projection onto the first factor. Then <math>E</math> is a fiber bundle (of <math>F</math>) over <math>B</math>. Here <math>E</math> is not just locally a product but ''globally'' one. Any such fiber bundle is called a '''trivial bundle'''. Any fiber bundle over a contractible [[CW-complex]] is trivial.\n\n=== Nontrivial bundles ===\n\n==== M\u00f6bius strip ====\n\n[[File:Moebius Surface 1 Display Small.png|thumb|right|The M\u00f6bius strip is a nontrivial bundle over the circle.]]\nPerhaps the simplest example of a nontrivial bundle <math>E</math> is the [[M\u00f6bius strip]]. It has the [[circle]] that runs lengthwise along the center of the strip as a base <math>B</math> and a line segment for the fiber <math>F</math>, so the M\u00f6bius strip is a bundle of the line segment over the circle. A neighborhood <math>U</math> of <math>\\pi(x) \\in B</math> ( where <math>x \\in E</math>) is an arc; in the picture, this is the length of one of the squares. The preimage <math>\\pi^{-1}(U)</math> in the picture is a (somewhat twisted) slice of the strip four squares wide and one long.\n\nA homeomorphism (<math>\\varphi</math> in the Formal Definition section) exists that maps the preimage of <math>U</math> (the trivializing neighborhood) to a slice of a cylinder: curved, but not twisted. This pair locally trivializes the strip. The corresponding trivial bundle <math>B\\times F</math> would be a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], but the M\u00f6bius strip has an overall \"twist\". This twist is visible only globally; locally the M\u00f6bius strip and the cylinder are identical (making a single vertical cut in either gives the same space).\n\n==== Klein bottle ====\n\nA similar nontrivial bundle is the [[Klein bottle]], which can be viewed as a \"twisted\" circle bundle over another circle. The corresponding non-twisted (trivial) bundle is the 2-[[torus]], <math>S^1 \\times S^1</math>.\n\n{|\n|[[File:KleinBottle-01.png|thumb|120px|The Klein bottle [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersed]] in three-dimensional space.]]\n|[[File:Torus.png|thumb|160px|A torus.]]\n|}\n\n=== Covering map ===\n\nA '''[[covering map|covering space]]''' is a fiber bundle such that the bundle projection is a [[local homeomorphism]]. It follows that the fiber is a [[discrete space]].\n\n=== Vector and principal bundles ===\n\nA special class of fiber bundles, called '''[[vector bundle]]s''', are those whose fibers are [[vector space]]s (to qualify as a vector bundle the structure group of the bundle \u2014 see below \u2014 must be a [[general linear group|linear group]]). Important examples of vector bundles include the [[tangent bundle]] and [[cotangent bundle]] of a smooth manifold. From any vector bundle, one can construct the [[frame bundle]] of [[basis (mathematics)|bases]], which is a principal bundle (see below).\n\nAnother special class of fiber bundles, called '''[[principal bundle]]s''', are bundles on whose fibers a free and transitive [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] by a group <math>G</math> is given, so that each fiber is a [[principal homogeneous space]]. The bundle is often specified along with the group by referring to it as a principal <math>G</math>-bundle. The group <math>G</math> is also the structure group of the bundle. Given a [[group representation|representation]] <math>\\rho</math> of <math>G</math> on a vector space <math>V</math>, a vector bundle with <math>\\rho(G) \\subseteq \\text{Aut}(V)</math> as a structure group may be constructed, known as the [[associated bundle]].\n\n=== Sphere bundles ===\n{{main|sphere bundle}}\nA '''sphere bundle''' is a fiber bundle whose fiber is an [[hypersphere|''n''-sphere]]. Given a vector bundle <math>E</math> with a [[metric tensor|metric]] (such as the tangent bundle to a [[Riemannian manifold]]) one can construct the associated '''unit sphere bundle''', for which the fiber over a point <math>x</math> is the set of all unit vectors in <math>E_x</math>. When the vector bundle in question is the tangent bundle <math>TM</math>, the unit sphere bundle is known as the '''[[unit tangent bundle]]'''. {{clear}}\n\nA sphere bundle is partially characterized by its [[Euler class]], which is a degree <math>n + 1</math> [[cohomology]] class in the total space of the bundle. In the case <math>n = 1</math> the sphere bundle is called a [[circle bundle]] and the Euler class is equal to the first [[Chern class]], which characterizes the topology of the bundle completely. For any <math>n</math>, given the Euler class of a bundle, one can calculate its cohomology using a [[long exact sequence]] called the [[Gysin sequence]].\n\n{{See also|Wang sequence}}\n\n=== Mapping tori ===\nIf ''X'' is a [[topological space]] and <math>f:X \\rightarrow X</math> is a [[homeomorphism]] then the [[mapping torus]] <math>M_f</math> has a natural structure of a fiber bundle over the [[circle]] with fiber <math>X</math>. Mapping tori of homeomorphisms of surfaces are of particular importance in  [[3-manifold|3-manifold topology]].\n\n=== Quotient spaces ===\nIf <math>G</math> is a [[topological group]] and <math>H</math> is a [[closed subgroup]], then under some circumstances, the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] <math>G/H</math> together with the quotient map <math>\\pi\\colon G \\to G/H</math> is a fiber bundle, whose fiber is the topological space <math>H</math>. A necessary and sufficient condition for (<math>G,\\, G/H,\\, \\pi,\\, H</math>) to form a fiber bundle is that the mapping <math>\\pi</math> admit [[#Sections|local cross-sections]] {{harv|Steenrod|1951|loc=\u00a77}}.\n\nThe most general conditions under which the quotient map will admit local cross-sections are not known, although if <math>G</math> is a [[Lie group]] and <math>H</math> a closed subgroup (and thus a Lie subgroup by [[Closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]]), then the quotient map is a fiber bundle. One example of this is the [[Hopf fibration]], <math>S^3 \\to S^2</math>, which is a fiber bundle over the sphere <math>S^2</math> whose total space is <math>S^3</math>. From the perspective of Lie groups, <math>S^3</math> can be identified with the [[special unitary group]] <math>SU(2)</math>. The abelian subgroup of diagonal matrices is isomorphic to the [[circle group]] <math>U(1)</math>, and the quotient <math>SU(2)/U(1)</math> is diffeomorphic to the sphere.\n\nMore generally, if <math>G</math> is any topological group and <math>H</math> a closed subgroup that also happens to be a Lie group, then <math>G \\to G/H</math> is a fiber bundle.\n\n== Sections ==\n{{main article|Section (fiber bundle)}}\n\nA '''section''' (or '''cross section''') of a fiber bundle <math>\\pi</math> is a continuous map <math>f\\colon B \\to E</math> such that <math>\\pi(f(x)) = x</math> for all ''x'' in ''B''. Since bundles do not in general have globally defined sections, one of the purposes of the theory is to account for their existence. The [[obstruction theory|obstruction]] to the existence of a section can often be measured by a cohomology class, which leads to the theory of [[characteristic class]]es in [[algebraic topology]].\n\nThe most well-known example is the [[hairy ball theorem]], where the [[Euler class]] is the obstruction to the [[tangent bundle]] of the 2-sphere having a nowhere vanishing section.\n\nOften one would like to define sections only locally (especially when global sections do not exist). A '''local section''' of a fiber bundle is a continuous map <math>f\\colon U \\to E</math> where ''U'' is an [[open set]] in ''B'' and <math>\\pi(f(x)) = x</math> for all ''x'' in ''U''. If <math>(U,\\, \\varphi)</math> is a local trivialization chart then local sections always exist over ''U''. Such sections are in 1-1 correspondence with continuous maps <math>U \\to F</math>. Sections form a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]].\n\n== Structure groups and transition functions ==\nFiber bundles often come with a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of symmetries that describe the matching conditions between overlapping local trivialization charts. Specifically, let ''G'' be a [[topological group]] that [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] continuously on the fiber space ''F'' on the left. We lose nothing if we require ''G'' to act [[faithful action|faithfully]] on ''F'' so that it may be thought of as a group of [[homeomorphism]]s of ''F''. A '''''G''-[[atlas (topology)|atlas]]''' for the bundle (''E'', ''B'', ''\u03c0'', ''F'') is a set of local trivializations <math>\\{(\\varphi_k,\\, U_k)\\}</math> such that for any <math>\\varphi_i,\\varphi_j</math> for the overlapping charts <math>(U_i,\\, \\varphi_i)</math> and <math>(U_j,\\, \\varphi_j)</math> the function\n: <math>\\varphi_i\\varphi_j^{-1}\\colon \\left(U_i \\cap U_j\\right) \\times F \\to \\left(U_i \\cap U_j\\right) \\times F</math>\n\nis given by\n: <math>\\varphi_i\\varphi_j^{-1}(x,\\, \\xi) = \\left(x,\\, t_{ij}(x)\\xi\\right)</math>\n\nwhere ''t''<sub>''ij''</sub> : ''U''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2229 ''U''<sub>''j''</sub> \u2192 ''G'' is a continuous map called a '''transition function'''. Two ''G''-atlases are equivalent if their union is also a ''G''-atlas. A '''''G''-bundle''' is a fiber bundle with an equivalence class of ''G''-atlases. The group ''G'' is called the '''structure group''' of the bundle; the analogous term in physics is [[gauge group]].\n\nIn the smooth category, a ''G''-bundle is a smooth fiber bundle where ''G'' is a [[Lie group]] and the corresponding action on ''F'' is smooth and the transition functions are all smooth maps.\n\nThe transition functions ''t''<sub>''ij''</sub> satisfy the following conditions\n# <math>t_{ii}(x) = 1\\,</math>\n# <math>t_{ij}(x) = t_{ji}(x)^{-1}\\,</math>\n# <math>t_{ik}(x) = t_{ij}(x)t_{jk}(x).\\,</math>\n\nThe third condition applies on triple overlaps ''U<sub>i</sub>'' \u2229 ''U<sub>j</sub>'' \u2229 ''U<sub>k</sub>'' and is called the '''cocycle condition''' (see [[\u010cech cohomology]]). The importance of this is that the transition functions determine the fiber bundle (if one assumes the \u010cech cocycle condition).\n\nA [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundle]] is a ''G''-bundle where the fiber ''F'' is a [[principal homogeneous space]] for the left action of ''G'' itself (equivalently, one can specify that the action of ''G'' on the fiber ''F'' is free and transitive, i.e. [[Group action (mathematics)#Regular|regular]]). In this case, it is often a matter of convenience to identify ''F'' with ''G'' and so obtain a (right) action of ''G'' on the principal bundle.\n\n== Bundle maps ==\n{{Main article|Bundle map}}\nIt is useful to have notions of a mapping between two fiber bundles.  Suppose that ''M'' and ''N'' are base spaces, and <math>\\pi_E\\colon E \\to M</math> and <math>\\pi_F\\colon F \\to N</math> are fiber bundles over ''M'' and ''N'', respectively.  A bundle map (or '''bundle morphism''') consists of a pair of continuous<ref>Depending on the category of spaces involved, the functions may be assumed to have properties other than continuity.  For instance, in the category of differentiable manifolds, the functions are assumed to be smooth.  In the category of algebraic varieties, they are regular morphisms.</ref> functions\n:<math>\\varphi\\colon E \\to F,\\quad f\\colon M \\to N</math>\n\nsuch that <math>\\pi_F\\circ \\varphi = f\\circ\\pi_E</math>.  That is, the following [[commutative diagram|diagram commutes]]:\n[[File:BundleMorphism-04.svg|150px|center]]\n\nFor fiber bundles with structure group ''G'' and whose total spaces are (right) ''G''-spaces (such as a principal bundle), bundle morphisms are also required to be ''G''-[[equivariant]] on the fibers. This means that <math>\\varphi\\colon E \\to F</math> is also ''G''-morphism from one ''G''-space to another, i.e., <math>\\varphi(xs) = \\varphi(x)s</math> for all <math>x\\in E</math> and <math>s\\in G</math>.\n\nIn case the base spaces ''M'' and ''N'' coincide, then a bundle morphism over ''M'' from the fiber bundle <math>\\pi_E\\colon E \\to M</math> to <math>\\pi_F\\colon F \\to M</math> is a map <math>\\varphi \\colon E \\to F</math> such that <math>\\pi_E = \\pi_F\\circ\\varphi</math>. This means that the bundle map <math>\\varphi \\colon E \\to F</math> covers the identity of ''M''. That is, <math>f \\equiv \\mathrm{id}_{M}</math> and the diagram commutes\n[[File:BundleMorphism-03.svg|120px|center]]\n\nAssume that both <math>\\pi_E\\colon E \\to M</math> and <math>\\pi_F\\colon F \\to M</math> are defined over the same base space ''M''. A bundle isomorphism is a bundle map <math>(\\varphi,\\, f)</math> between ''\u03c0''<sub>''E''</sub> : ''E'' \u2192 ''M'' and ''\u03c0''<sub>''F''</sub> : ''F'' \u2192 ''M'' such that <math>f \\equiv \\mathrm{id}_{M}</math> and such that \u03c6 is also a homeomorphism.<ref>Or is, at least, invertible in the appropriate category; e.g., a diffeomorphism.</ref>\n\n== Differentiable fiber bundles ==\nIn the category of [[differentiable manifold]]s, fiber bundles arise naturally as [[submersion (mathematics)|submersions]] of one manifold to another. Not every (differentiable) submersion \u0192&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''N'' from a differentiable manifold ''M'' to another differentiable manifold ''N'' gives rise to a differentiable fiber bundle. For one thing, the map must be surjective, and (''M'', ''N'', \u0192) is called a [[fibered manifold]]. However, this necessary condition is not quite sufficient, and there are a variety of sufficient conditions in common use.\n\nIf ''M'' and ''N'' are compact and connected, then any submersion ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''N'' gives rise to a fiber bundle in the sense that there is a fiber space ''F'' diffeomorphic to each of the fibers such that (''E'', ''B'', ''\u03c0'', ''F'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''M'', ''N'', \u0192, ''F'') is a fiber bundle.  (Surjectivity of \u0192 follows by the assumptions already given in this case.) More generally, the assumption of compactness can be relaxed if the submersion \u0192&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''N'' is assumed to be a surjective [[proper map]], meaning that \u0192<sup>\u22121</sup>(''K'') is compact for every compact subset ''K'' of ''N''. Another sufficient condition, due to {{harvtxt|Ehresmann|1951}}, is that if \u0192&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''N'' is a surjective [[submersion (mathematics)|submersion]] with ''M'' and ''N'' [[differentiable manifold]]s such that the preimage \u0192<sup>\u22121</sup>{''x''} is [[compact set|compact]] and [[Connection (mathematics)|connected]] for all ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''N'', then \u0192 admits a compatible fiber bundle structure {{harv|Michor|2008|loc=\u00a717}}.\n\n== Generalizations ==\n* The notion of a [[bundle (mathematics)|bundle]] applies to many more categories in mathematics, at the expense of appropriately modifying the local triviality condition; cf. [[principal homogeneous space]] and [[torsor (algebraic geometry)]].\n* In topology, a [[fibration]] is a mapping ''\u03c0'' : ''E'' \u2192 ''B'' that has certain [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] properties in common with fiber bundles.  Specifically, under mild technical assumptions a fiber bundle always has the [[homotopy lifting property]] or homotopy covering property (see {{harvtxt|Steenrod|1951|loc=11.7}} for details).  This is the defining property of a fibration.\n* A section of a fiber bundle is a \"function whose output range is continuously dependent on the input.\" This property is formally captured in the notion of [[dependent type]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Covering map]]\n* [[Fibration]]\n* [[Gauge theory]]\n* [[Hopf bundle]]\n* [[I-bundle]]\n* [[Principal bundle]]\n* [[Projective bundle]]\n* [[Pullback bundle]]\n* [[Universal bundle]]\n* [[Fibered manifold]]\n* [[Vector bundle]]\n* [[Affine bundle]]\n* [[Equivariant bundle]]\n* [[Natural bundle]]\n* [[Quasifibration]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation|first=Norman|last=Steenrod|authorlink=Norman Steenrod|title=The Topology of Fibre Bundles|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1951|isbn=978-0-691-08055-0}}\n* {{citation|first=David|last=Bleecker|title=Gauge Theory and Variational Principles|publisher=Addison-Wesley publishing|location=Reading, Mass|year=1981|isbn=978-0-201-10096-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gaugetheoryvaria00blee_0}}\n* {{cite conference | first = Charles | last = Ehresmann | authorlink=Charles Ehresmann|title = Les connexions infinit\u00e9simales dans un espace fibr\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentiable | booktitle = Colloque de Topologie (Espaces fibr\u00e9s), Bruxelles, 1950 |publisher = Georges Thone, Li\u00e8ge; Masson et Cie., Paris, 1951 | pages = 29\u201355}}\n* {{citation|first=Dale|last=Husemoller|authorlink=Dale Husemoller| title=Fibre Bundles|publisher=Springer Verlag|year=1994|isbn=978-0-387-94087-8}}\n* {{citation|first=Peter W.|last=Michor|title=Topics in Differential Geometry|series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]]|volume=Vol. 93|publisher=American Mathematical Society|location=Providence|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8218-2003-2}}\n* {{springer|first=M.I.|last=Voitsekhovskii|id=F/f040060|title=Fibre space|year=2001}}\n\n{{tensors}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040808115056/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/FiberBundle.html Fiber Bundle], PlanetMath\n* {{MathWorld|urlname=FiberBundle|title=Fiber Bundle|author=Rowland, Todd}}\n* [http://www.popmath.org.uk/sculpmath/pagesm/fibundle.html Making John Robinson's Symbolic Sculpture `Eternity']\n* [[Gennadi Sardanashvily|Sardanashvily, Gennadi]], Fibre bundles, jet manifolds and Lagrangian theory.
