Feeling depressed, Jeffrey Jey took a vacation to [[Turin]] in November 1992. He entered a music store and showed the shopkeeper an audio cassette of himself singing at the nightclub. The shopkeeper directed Jey to the sampling aisle of the store and called Massimo Gabutti, producer of the newly founded Bliss Corporation. Soon after, Jey was introduced to Gabutti and Roberto Molinaro at the Bliss Corporation. Gabutti was impressed with Jey's demo tape, and immediately offered him a position at the Bliss Corporation with Molinaro.\n\nJey accepted and moved into a friend's house about 7 to 8 kilometres away from the studio. He began work at Bliss Corporation in January 1993, alongside Gabutti, Molinaro, sound engineer Angelica Villella, and 18 year old Maurizio Lobina. Two months later, Gabutti told him about a demo that he had been working on, with the other members, and asked him to do the vocals for it. Jey agreed to do it. That track was a cover of Patti Smith's 1988 song \"People Have the Power\". Gabutti went to Milan to mix Jey's voice with the demo, and when he came back, he told him that it would be a part of the final mix. \"People Have the Power\" was a big hit in Italy in the summer of 1993, peaking number 7 on the charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/hp_yends/hpe1993.htm|title=Hit Parade Italia - Top Annuali Single: 1993|website=www.hitparadeitalia.it|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref>\n\nThe following year Domenico Capuano, Jeffrey Jey and Molinaro formed the band: Bliss Team.

By the end of 1997, BlissCo wanted the band to split and have them start other projects.
