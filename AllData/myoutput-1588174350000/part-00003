The First Evil first appeared in the third season episode \"[[Amends (Buffy episode)|Amends]]\", and became the main antagonist of the seventh and final season.\n\nA being manifested from all [[evil]] in existence, the First is an incorporeal entity that can assume the form of any person who has died, including [[vampire]]s and dead persons who have been resurrected. Because of this it appears in various forms over the course of the series depending on who it is appearing to as a method of manipulation. For this reason, the First usually appears as [[Buffy Summers]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) to the Slayer and her allies, but it also assumes the forms of [[Warren Mears]], [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]], [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] and [[Jonathan Levinson]] on multiple occasions, among a variety of other forms taken less frequently.\n\nIts only real weakness is that it is non-corporeal, and can therefore not do real physical damage. It is, however, expert at [[psychological manipulation]], and can act through its servants, such as the [[Bringers of the First Evil|Bringers]], [[Turok-Han]], [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]] or whatever person it can manage to influence.\n\n==Biography==\n===Character history===\nThe First Evil claims to be the source and embodiment of all that is evil. For technical purposes, the First Evil is neither male, female, demon, nor god; it is a \"power\". The First is older than demons, even the [[Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Old Ones]], who themselves existed long before the first humans; it is older than the written word, the Big Bang and transcends all realities and dimensions; it is older than any other evil being and may even be the very first entity ever to have existed. It is said that the First lurked in the darkness long before the [[universe]] was even created and shall remain long after the universe ends. Few have heard of it and even fewer believe in its existence. The entity cannot affect the world on a physical level. Its power lies in its ability to deceive, torment and manipulate others. It can take the form of anyone who has died (or as an enormous, [[Apparitional experience|phantasmic]] demon with large horns and long, talon-shaped fingers), and it can choose to be seen and heard by just one person or by multiple people. The First has a deep understanding of human nature and it uses this knowledge to drive others to madness, murder and/or suicide.\n\nThe First makes its initial appearance in the series as a [[monster of the week]] that [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] must face in the episode \"[[Amends (Buffy episode)|Amends]]\". It tries to drive the vampire to kill [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] by reminding him of his \"true\" nature (Angelus) and it sets about accomplishing this by appearing to him as some of his victims: Daniel, Margaret, Travis and [[Jenny Calendar]]. It claims that it is responsible for Angel's return from [[Hell]], and suggests that Angel can end his sufferings by turning evil again and killing Buffy, but instead he chooses to kill himself using the sunrise. His suicide is only averted by a freak snowstorm unheard of in Southern California. Episodes of the spin-off series ''Angel'' later suggest that Angel was returned from hell and his life saved by [[Miracle|divine intervention]] from the heavenly [[Powers That Be (Angel)|Powers That Be]].\n\nLater, the First makes its presence known again in the seventh season by tormenting the vampire [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]], who like Angel has come into possession of a soul; tricking the former villain [[Andrew Wells]] into awakening the Hellmouth beneath Sunnydale High; and dispatching its agents, the Bringers, to kill young women around the world with the potential to succeed [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] as the current [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]. When Buffy's allies [[Rupert Giles|Giles]] and [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] query the First's sudden rise in activity with a mystical third party, they learn that the First is able to act in this way because of an anomaly in the Slayer line caused by Buffy's recent resurrection, providing an outlet for the First to wipe out all the Slayers. Though incorporeal, the First is effective in prompting suicides, deceiving various members of the [[Scooby Gang|Buffy's gang]], and releasing evil monsters from the Hellmouth. Later in season seven, the audience is introduced to the First's right-hand-man, the supernaturally strong misogynistic ex-priest [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]], as well as its army of primordial [[Turok-Han]] vampires living beneath the Hellmouth. In the series finale, Buffy and her allies take the fight to the First by opening the Hellmouth and using magic to activate every potential Slayer in Buffy's army. With additional help from a magical amulet, the gang destroy the First's army, the Sunnydale Hellmouth, and the surrounding town.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nNeither male or female, living or dead, the First is pure power. It is the darkness inside the hearts and souls of all living creatures. While the First has no physical body and is therefore extremely difficult to kill, it also cannot truly interact with the physical world. Certain people are able to interact and even become one with the First, such as Caleb.\n\nThe First appears in the physical world as dead people, including vampires, humans who have died, and dead people who have been resurrected. This allows the First to impersonate people for the purpose of manipulating others. For instance, the First appears as Warren to get Andrew to kill Jonathan during \"[[Lessons (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Lessons]],\" as Eve to more easily attack the Potentials during \"[[Showtime (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Showtime]],\" and as Buffy to amplify Spike's torture throughout [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|Season 7]]. The First seems also to know mannerisms, information and details of the life of whoever it imitates. This is best shown in \"[[Conversations with Dead People]]\" as the First appears to Dawn as her mother Joyce, appears to Andrew as Warren and appears to Willow as Cassie Newton, in an attempt to manipulate them all into serving its purpose.\n\nAs essentially the source of all evil, the First has knowledge of every monster and dark ritual in existence. This was exemplified by the runes the Bringers carved into Spike's chest to summon the Turok-Han.\n\nAs the First is said to be eternal, existing before time and believed to be the only thing remaining after the end of time, it is infinitely patient. A defeat it suffers is nothing more than a minor setback.\n\nIn ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds|Chaos Bleeds]]'', the First displayed the ability to possess people, open portals, teleport beings across dimensions and, according to [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Sid the Dummy|Sid]], conjure a duplicate dummy body for him and trap his soul inside.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe First Evil has appeared in 16 canonical [[Buffyverse]] episodes:\n\n'''''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''''''\n\n*Season 3 (1998)\n**\"[[Amends]]\" (as Daniel, Margaret, [[Jenny Calendar]], and Travis\u2013name revealed in the shooting scripts).\n*Season 7 (2002\u20132003)\n**\"[[Lessons (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Lessons]]\" (as [[Warren Mears]], [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Mayor]], [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]], [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], and [[Buffy Summers]])\n**\"[[Selfless (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Selfless]]\" (as Buffy Summers)\n**\"[[Conversations with Dead People]]\" (as Warren Mears, [[Cassie Newton]], and [[Joyce Summers]])\n**\"[[Sleeper (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Sleeper]]\" (as Buffy Summers and Spike)\n**\"[[Never Leave Me]]\" (as Buffy Summers, Spike, Warren Mears, and [[Jonathan Levinson]])\n**\"[[Bring on the Night (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Bring on the Night]]\" (as Spike and Drusilla)\n**\"[[Showtime (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Showtime]]\" (as Buffy Summers and Eve)\n**\"[[First Date (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|First Date]]\" (as Jonathan Levinson and [[Nikki Wood]])\n**\"[[Get It Done]]\" (as Chloe)\n**\"[[Storyteller (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Storyteller]]\" (as Warren Mears)\n**\"[[Dirty Girls]]\" (as Buffy Summers and Betty)\n**\"[[Empty Places]]\" (as Buffy Summers)\n**\"[[Touched (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Touched]]\" (as Richard Wilkins and Buffy Summers)\n**\"[[End of Days (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|End of Days]]\" (as Buffy Summers)\n**\"[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]\" (as Buffy Summers and [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]]).\n\nThe First appears in the [[canon (fiction)|non-canonical]] video game ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds]]'' as the main antagonist, having helped occultist magician [[Ethan Rayne]] escape military confinement to enact a plan for world domination. Buffy and her friends pursue the First over multiple realities and across the centuries, eventually \"dispersing it across dimensions\" to stop its plans to consume the universe with evil.\n\n==Bringers of the First Evil==\nThe Bringers of the First Evil, or Harbingers of Death, are the acolytes of the First Evil. They are humans who have been corrupted by the First and undergone rituals that include self-mutilation: their eyes and tongues are removed, and their eyelids covered by rune-like scars; yet they are perfectly aware of their surroundings.\n\nIt is implied that the First's high priest, [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]], has played an important role in indoctrinating the Bringers. He possesses extensive knowledge of their habits (such as knowing that they pant instead of sweating) and refers to them as \"my boys\". Indeed, The Harbingers of Death themselves refer to him as their \"teacher\".\n\nThe Bringers also have a poisonous aura which is capable of rendering earth and living beings sterile:\n\n: ''For they are the harbingers of death, nothing shall grow above or below them, no seed shall flower, neither in Man nor...''\n\nDespite their apparent disabilities, Bringers are swift assassins capable of highly organized attacks thanks to their collective consciousness, which is under the control of the First. Besides their deadly fighting skills, Bringers are also capable of summoning manifestations of the First to haunt people, and create psychic links between dreamers through their dark rituals.\n\nIn season 7, The First declared war on the [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)#The Slayer line|Slayer line]]. The Bringers became assassins of Potential Slayers around the world. When the First set up camp in Sunnydale, Bringers begin to swarm the town to hunt down arriving Potentials and to unearth the [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)#Scythe|Scythe]], a mystic weapon created by Guardians: ancient, powerful women who cared for the Slayer.\n\n== Analysis ==\n\nCaroline Joan S.
