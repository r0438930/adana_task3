It is the second film in the [[View Askewniverse]] after 1994's ''[[Clerks]]'', although, chronologically, ''Mallrats'' takes place a day before.\n\nAs in the other Askewniverse films, the characters [[Jay and Silent Bob]] feature prominently, and characters and events from other films are discussed. Several cast members, including [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Joey Lauren Adams]], have gone on to work in several other Smith films. Comic-book icon [[Stan Lee]] appeared, as did [[Brian O'Halloran]], the star of Smith's breakout feature ''Clerks''.\n\nDespite failing at the box office and receiving a lukewarm critical reception, ''Mallrats'' has since become a [[Cult film|cult classic]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Vasconcellos |first=Eduardo |authorlink= |coauthors= |title='Mallrats' cult phenomenon |work= |publisher=[[The Daily Titan]] |date=2005-10-13 |url=http://www.dailytitan.com/news/2005/10/13/TheBuzzflashbackFavorites/mallrats.Cult.Phenomenon-1539806.shtml |doi= |accessdate=2008-08-28 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Plans for a [[sequel]] film titled ''MallBrats'' were announced in March 2015. By the following year, the project had morphed into a proposed television miniseries, but by February 2017, Smith announced that he had not been able to sell the series to any network. In January 2020, Smith revealed that development on a sequel film has started again, this time under the title ''Twilight of the Mallrats''.\n\n==Plot==\nCollege student T.S. Quint is preparing for a trip to [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] with Brandi Svenning, during which he plans to propose to her; however, Brandi tells him she cannot go due to having volunteered to fill in as a contestant on ''Truth or Date'', her father's [[dating game show]], because the original contestant had died from an embolism bursting in her brain while swimming 700 laps at the local Y.M.C.A following T.S.'s comment regarding her weight. T.S. dismisses the blame, and they argue over this and break up. T.S. turns to his best friend [[Brodie Bruce]], who has been dumped by his girlfriend Rene, and Brodie suggests the two might find comfort at the local mall.\n\nBrodie and T.S. discover ''Truth or Date'' is being filmed at the same mall, through their friend Willam, who throughout the film tries to see a sailboat in a [[Magic Eye]] poster. The two ask local [[slacker]]s [[Jay and Silent Bob]] to destroy the show's stage, a task for which they devise elaborate, but ultimately unsuccessful plans. Brodie and T.S. run into Tricia Jones, a 15-year-old senior who is writing a book on the sex drive of men ages 14-30, for which she has sex with various men as research and films every encounter. She then reveals that the previous night she had sex with Shannon Hamilton, a 25-year-old clothing-store manager who hates Brodie because of his \"lack of a shopping agenda.\"\n\nBrodie then learns that Rene has begun a relationship with Shannon. Brodie confronts Rene to find out more about the relationship, and the two have sex in an elevator. Brodie is later abducted and attacked by Shannon, who intends to have sex with Rene in [[Anal sex|a \"very uncomfortable place\".]] As a result of this incident, Jay and Silent Bob assault the mall's [[Easter Bunny]], under the incorrect assumption that he attacked Brodie.\n\nBrandi's father Jared has Brodie and T.S. arrested on false charges of drug possession at the mall. Jay and Silent Bob are able to rescue Brodie and T.S., and they hide out at a local [[flea market]], where they meet topless fortune teller Ivannah, who gives them both advice on their relationship problems. T.S. decides to win Brandi back and the two return to the mall.\n\nBefore the show begins, Brodie meets famed [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] legend [[Stan Lee]], who gives him advice on romance. After this, Brodie requests that his friend Tricia Jones retrieve footage of her having sex with Shannon. Meanwhile, T.S. also persuades Jay to get two of the game show contestants stoned, which allows him and Brodie to replace them on ''Truth or Date''.\n\nDuring the show, Brandi recognizes the voices of Brodie and T.S., and an on-air argument between them ensues. Brodie ultimately gets the two to stop arguing, explaining that T.S. has been pining for Brandi all day. Then T.S. proposes to Brandi, and she accepts. As the police arrive to arrest T.S. and Brodie after the show is over, Silent Bob plays a sex tape of Shannon and Tricia, resulting in his arrest for [[statutory rape]]. Brodie and Rene renew their relationship as a result.\n\nThe conclusion reveals that T.S. marries Brandi at Universal Studios while on a [[Jaws (ride)|Jaws attraction]], Tricia's book is a bestseller, Shannon is imprisoned (and subsequently raped), Willam eventually does see the sailboat, Brodie becomes the host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' (with Rene as his bandleader), and that Jay and Silent Bob gets a [[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back|chimpanzee named Suzanne]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Shannen Doherty]] as Rene Mosier\n* [[Jeremy London]] as T.S.

After a screening of ''Clerks'', producer [[James Jacks]] approached them to do another film for [[Universal Studios]]. Smith soon finished the script for this new film, and casting began.\n\n[[Jeremy London]], an actor with a TV series and a few films to his credit, was cast as T.S.; [[Henry Thomas]] was the finalist of the role. Shannen Doherty was the most famous cast member after her appearances in several films and the hit TV show ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]''. [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] was cast with no prior acting experience; before the film, Lee was a professional skateboarder, and [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Steve Zahn]] were the finalists for the role of Brodie Bruce. [[Ben Affleck]], who was a relative unknown at the time, was cast as Shannon Hamilton. [[Joey Lauren Adams]] was cast as Gwen Turner; she later dated Smith, and during that time, he wrote the main character in ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' for her. Ethan Suplee was cast as Willam Black. [[Scott Mosier]] was supposed to reprise the role, but Smith and the film's producers were so impressed with Suplee that they cast him, instead. The most troublesome role to cast was Jay, as Universal did not want [[Jason Mewes]] to have the role, despite the fact that he played it in  ''Clerks'' and the character of Jay is based on him.  Mewes had to audition for the part against actors such as [[Seth Green]] and [[Breckin Meyer]].\n\n===Ties to New Jersey===\n{{trivia section|date=July 2019}}\n* [[East Jersey State Prison|Rahway State Prison]] is mentioned at the end of the film\n* Brodie wears a [[Henry Hudson Regional High School]] shirt at the beginning of the film.

Bonus features include:<ref>Mallrats Collector's Edition DVD</ref>\n* [[Audio commentary]] with director [[Kevin Smith]], cast members [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], and [[Jason Mewes]], and producers [[Scott Mosier]] & Vincent Pereira\n* [[Deleted scene]]s\n* Featurette-''View Askew's Look Back At Mallrats''\n* Music Video-''[[Build Me Up Buttercup]]'' by The Goops (Directed by Kevin Smith)\n* Theatrical trailer\n\n===Extended Cut===\nIn 2005, a 10th anniversary DVD was released, containing the original version of the film, features from the previous DVD release, and an all new extended cut of the movie with over 30 minutes of additional footage and subplots.<ref>Mallrats 10th Anniversary DVD</ref>\n* An alternate opening scene, in which Mr. Svenning hosts a Ball for the Governor of New Jersey (played by [[Elizabeth Ashley]]). In this scene, T.S. (dressed as a colonial musketman), accidentally gets his musket tangled up in Brandi's hair, then accidentally shoots at the Governor on the roof of a school, which ends up costing Mr. Svenning his reputation as well as a big pay raise. This explains the reason why Svenning shows an intense dislike for T.S. and why Brandi is so intent on breaking up with him. This scene also makes no mention of Julie Dwyer's death, as the theatrical cut did. (That cut subplot was referenced in the final cut of the movie, where the TV execs mention to Svenning that they do not want a repeat of the Governor's Ball.)\n* An extended sequence at Brodie's house, where T.S. is hounded by the media as a result of his actions at the Governor's Ball, including several TV movie offers.\n* Included scenes where T.S. also makes it known to Brandi that he proposed to marry her.\n* A scene in which Brodie and T.S. arrive outside of Mr. Svenning's home, so T.S. can try and reconcile, and during the confusion, thanks to a news crew chasing T.S., then interviewing Brodie (who then implies that Mr. Svenning and Brandi take part in [[Black Mass|Satanic rituals]]), the news crew records footage of Svenning doing martial arts in a bath-towel. (Some of the footage of Mr. Svenning was re-edited in the theatrical release into the new intro.)\n* A shot that shows the Quick Stop from ''Clerks''.\n* A new subplot of Brodie showing intentions of wanting to be on television, which explains his surprised look during his appearance on ''Truth or Date''.\n* An extended arrest scene in which LaFours wants to put Brodie and T.S. into jail for an extended period of time, rather than \"overnight\" when the pair were initially arrested.\n* An extended fight scene between Brodie and Shannon Hamilton, in which Hamilton tells Brodie to forget Rene.\n* An extended rant from Mr. Svenning, a result of T.S. letting it slip that he intended to propose to Brandi.\n* A scene after ''Truth or Date'' in which the Mr. Svenning demands to have T.S. and Brodie arrested, but instead he is the one who is arrested. It turns out that since Svenning was the producer of the show, he faces multiple FCC fines for Brodie's antics.\n* An extended \"Where are they now?\" ending sequence, in which Mr. Svenning is shown at his job at the network as a janitor, and Shannon Hamilton is shown screaming after his rape in prison.\n* A scene that showed Tricia flirting and having sex with LaFours in order to distract him from catching Jay and Silent Bob. This explains the final segment in the 'where are they now' ending sequence, showing LaFours kissing Tricia during the book signing.\n\nAs explained by Kevin Smith in the introduction, most of the scenes were reworked because of the test audience's negative reaction. Some of the dialogue had been re-dubbed in the theatrical release, but is restored in this version. (For example, the man who runs up to and is subsequently punched by T.S. outside the mall near the end originally asked if he had seen T.S. on [[CNN]], whereas in the theatrical cut, he asks T.S. if he was the one who broke up with Brandi Svenning.) Other extended scenes have notable jump cuts.\n\nThe original DVD's deleted scenes reel also featured the first draft opening sequence (in script form); here, T.S. is competing on a collegiate game show produced by Mr. Svenning; he accidentally mispronounces an answer (\"Bay of Bisquake\" instead of [[Bay of Biscay]]); his team loses, and in the confusion, T.S. accidentally damages a camera, and he must now pay Mr. Svenning for the damages. Brandi then breaks up with him, and a man on a bus mistakenly thinks that T.S. will kill him after seeing him in a news report. Several alternate openings, with different voiceover spiels from Brodie (including one which has him recounting the events up to him nearly getting assaulted by Hamilton on the ''Truth or Date'' stage) were also seen in that reel.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray in 2014 and it used digital noise reduction and edge enhancement (as part of Universal's 1990's Best of the Decade collection); the menus were replaced with Universal-mandated menus, the [[Focus Features]] logo replaced the Universal logo at the start of the film, and some copies also included a code for a digital streaming version to be redeemed at Universal's online [[UltraViolet (system)|UltraViolet]] service, and [[iTunes]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Mallrats\n| type       = soundtrack\n| longtype   = to the film ''Mallrats''\n| artist     =\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|1995|10|17}}\n| recorded   = Various\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Various\n| length     = 47:18\n| label      = [[MCA Records]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[View Askewniverse]] soundtrack\n| prev_title = [[Clerks (soundtrack)|Clerks]]\n| prev_year  = 1994\n| next_title = [[Chasing Amy#Soundtrack|Chasing Amy]]\n| next_year  = 1997\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack album was released in October 1995. It features mainly [[alternative rock]] from the 90s along with dialogue from the film. The ordering of the songs on the soundtrack album is not the order they appear as in the film. For example, [[Squirtgun]]'s \"Social\" opens the film, while [[Weezer]]'s \"Susanne\" ends the film, with [[Wax (rock band)|Wax]]'s \"Mallrats\" playing over the end credits. The song \"[[Boogie Shoes]]\" by [[KC and the Sunshine Band]] makes an appearance, when Brodie and T.S. drive to the flea market. However, it was excluded from the soundtrack album. A music video for [[The Goops]]' version of \"Build Me Up Buttercup\" was directed by Smith and featured both Smith and Mewes.\n\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column    = Contributing artist\n| title1   =

American [[Romantic comedy|romantic]] [[buddy comedy]] film written and directed by [[Kevin Smith]] and starring [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], [[Jeremy London]], [[Shannen Doherty]], [[Claire Forlani]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jason Mewes]], [[Joey Lauren Adams]], [[Michael Rooker]], and Smith himself. It is the second film in the [[View Askewniverse]] after 1994's ''[[Clerks]]'', although, chronologically, ''Mallrats'' takes place a day before.\n\nAs in the other Askewniverse films, the characters [[Jay and Silent Bob]] feature prominently, and characters and events from other films are discussed. Several cast members, including [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Joey Lauren Adams]], have gone on to work in several other Smith films. Comic-book icon [[Stan Lee]] appeared, as did [[Brian O'Halloran]], the star of Smith's breakout feature ''Clerks''.\n\nDespite failing at the box office and receiving a lukewarm critical reception, ''Mallrats'' has since become a [[Cult film|cult classic]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Vasconcellos |first=Eduardo |authorlink= |coauthors= |title='Mallrats' cult phenomenon |work= |publisher=[[The Daily Titan]] |date=2005-10-13 |url=http://www.dailytitan.com/news/2005/10/13/TheBuzzflashbackFavorites/mallrats.Cult.Phenomenon-1539806.shtml |doi= |accessdate=2008-08-28 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Plans for a [[sequel]] film titled ''MallBrats'' were announced in March 2015. By the following year, the project had morphed into a proposed television miniseries, but by February 2017, Smith announced that he had not been able to sell the series to any network. In January 2020, Smith revealed that development on a sequel film has started again, this time under the title ''Twilight of the Mallrats''.\n\n==Plot==\nCollege student T.S. Quint is preparing for a trip to [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] with Brandi Svenning, during which he plans to propose to her; however, Brandi tells him she cannot go due to having volunteered to fill in as a contestant on ''Truth or Date'', her father's [[dating game show]], because the original contestant had died from an embolism bursting in her brain while swimming 700 laps at the local Y.M.C.A following T.S.'s comment regarding her weight. T.S. dismisses the blame, and they argue over this and break up. T.S. turns to his best friend [[Brodie Bruce]], who has been dumped by his girlfriend Rene, and Brodie suggests the two might find comfort at the local mall.\n\nBrodie and T.S. discover ''Truth or Date'' is being filmed at the same mall, through their friend Willam, who throughout the film tries to see a sailboat in a [[Magic Eye]] poster. The two ask local [[slacker]]s [[Jay and Silent Bob]] to destroy the show's stage, a task for which they devise elaborate, but ultimately unsuccessful plans. Brodie and T.S. run into Tricia Jones, a 15-year-old senior who is writing a book on the sex drive of men ages 14-30, for which she has sex with various men as research and films every encounter. She then reveals that the previous night she had sex with Shannon Hamilton, a 25-year-old clothing-store manager who hates Brodie because of his \"lack of a shopping agenda.\"\n\nBrodie then learns that Rene has begun a relationship with Shannon. Brodie confronts Rene to find out more about the relationship, and the two have sex in an elevator. Brodie is later abducted and attacked by Shannon, who intends to have sex with Rene in [[Anal sex|a \"very uncomfortable place\".]] As a result of this incident, Jay and Silent Bob assault the mall's [[Easter Bunny]], under the incorrect assumption that he attacked Brodie.\n\nBrandi's father Jared has Brodie and T.S. arrested on false charges of drug possession at the mall. Jay and Silent Bob are able to rescue Brodie and T.S., and they hide out at a local [[flea market]], where they meet topless fortune teller Ivannah, who gives them both advice on their relationship problems. T.S. decides to win Brandi back and the two return to the mall.\n\nBefore the show begins, Brodie meets famed [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] legend [[Stan Lee]], who gives him advice on romance. After this, Brodie requests that his friend Tricia Jones retrieve footage of her having sex with Shannon. Meanwhile, T.S. also persuades Jay to get two of the game show contestants stoned, which allows him and Brodie to replace them on ''Truth or Date''.\n\nDuring the show, Brandi recognizes the voices of Brodie and T.S., and an on-air argument between them ensues. Brodie ultimately gets the two to stop arguing, explaining that T.S. has been pining for Brandi all day. Then T.S. proposes to Brandi, and she accepts. As the police arrive to arrest T.S. and Brodie after the show is over, Silent Bob plays a sex tape of Shannon and Tricia, resulting in his arrest for [[statutory rape]]. Brodie and Rene renew their relationship as a result.\n\nThe conclusion reveals that T.S. marries Brandi at Universal Studios while on a [[Jaws (ride)|Jaws attraction]], Tricia's book is a bestseller, Shannon is imprisoned (and subsequently raped), Willam eventually does see the sailboat, Brodie becomes the host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' (with Rene as his bandleader), and that Jay and Silent Bob gets a [[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back|chimpanzee named Suzanne]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Shannen Doherty]] as Rene Mosier\n* [[Jeremy London]] as T.S.

After a screening of ''Clerks'', producer [[James Jacks]] approached them to do another film for [[Universal Studios]]. Smith soon finished the script for this new film, and casting began.\n\n[[Jeremy London]], an actor with a TV series and a few films to his credit, was cast as T.S.; [[Henry Thomas]] was the finalist of the role. Shannen Doherty was the most famous cast member after her appearances in several films and the hit TV show ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]''. [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] was cast with no prior acting experience; before the film, Lee was a professional skateboarder, and [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Steve Zahn]] were the finalists for the role of Brodie Bruce. [[Ben Affleck]], who was a relative unknown at the time, was cast as Shannon Hamilton. [[Joey Lauren Adams]] was cast as Gwen Turner; she later dated Smith, and during that time, he wrote the main character in ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' for her. Ethan Suplee was cast as Willam Black. [[Scott Mosier]] was supposed to reprise the role, but Smith and the film's producers were so impressed with Suplee that they cast him, instead. The most troublesome role to cast was Jay, as Universal did not want [[Jason Mewes]] to have the role, despite the fact that he played it in  ''Clerks'' and the character of Jay is based on him.  Mewes had to audition for the part against actors such as [[Seth Green]] and [[Breckin Meyer]].\n\n===Ties to New Jersey===\n{{trivia section|date=July 2019}}\n* [[East Jersey State Prison|Rahway State Prison]] is mentioned at the end of the film\n* Brodie wears a [[Henry Hudson Regional High School]] shirt at the beginning of the film.

Bonus features include:<ref>Mallrats Collector's Edition DVD</ref>\n* [[Audio commentary]] with director [[Kevin Smith]], cast members [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], and [[Jason Mewes]], and producers [[Scott Mosier]] & Vincent Pereira\n* [[Deleted scene]]s\n* Featurette-''View Askew's Look Back At Mallrats''\n* Music Video-''[[Build Me Up Buttercup]]'' by The Goops (Directed by Kevin Smith)\n* Theatrical trailer\n\n===Extended Cut===\nIn 2005, a 10th anniversary DVD was released, containing the original version of the film, features from the previous DVD release, and an all new extended cut of the movie with over 30 minutes of additional footage and subplots.<ref>Mallrats 10th Anniversary DVD</ref>\n* An alternate opening scene, in which Mr. Svenning hosts a Ball for the Governor of New Jersey (played by [[Elizabeth Ashley]]). In this scene, T.S. (dressed as a colonial musketman), accidentally gets his musket tangled up in Brandi's hair, then accidentally shoots at the Governor on the roof of a school, which ends up costing Mr. Svenning his reputation as well as a big pay raise. This explains the reason why Svenning shows an intense dislike for T.S. and why Brandi is so intent on breaking up with him. This scene also makes no mention of Julie Dwyer's death, as the theatrical cut did. (That cut subplot was referenced in the final cut of the movie, where the TV execs mention to Svenning that they do not want a repeat of the Governor's Ball.)\n* An extended sequence at Brodie's house, where T.S. is hounded by the media as a result of his actions at the Governor's Ball, including several TV movie offers.\n* Included scenes where T.S. also makes it known to Brandi that he proposed to marry her.\n* A scene in which Brodie and T.S. arrive outside of Mr. Svenning's home, so T.S. can try and reconcile, and during the confusion, thanks to a news crew chasing T.S., then interviewing Brodie (who then implies that Mr. Svenning and Brandi take part in [[Black Mass|Satanic rituals]]), the news crew records footage of Svenning doing martial arts in a bath-towel. (Some of the footage of Mr. Svenning was re-edited in the theatrical release into the new intro.)\n* A shot that shows the Quick Stop from ''Clerks''.\n* A new subplot of Brodie showing intentions of wanting to be on television, which explains his surprised look during his appearance on ''Truth or Date''.\n* An extended arrest scene in which LaFours wants to put Brodie and T.S. into jail for an extended period of time, rather than \"overnight\" when the pair were initially arrested.\n* An extended fight scene between Brodie and Shannon Hamilton, in which Hamilton tells Brodie to forget Rene.\n* An extended rant from Mr. Svenning, a result of T.S. letting it slip that he intended to propose to Brandi.\n* A scene after ''Truth or Date'' in which the Mr. Svenning demands to have T.S. and Brodie arrested, but instead he is the one who is arrested. It turns out that since Svenning was the producer of the show, he faces multiple FCC fines for Brodie's antics.\n* An extended \"Where are they now?\" ending sequence, in which Mr. Svenning is shown at his job at the network as a janitor, and Shannon Hamilton is shown screaming after his rape in prison.\n* A scene that showed Tricia flirting and having sex with LaFours in order to distract him from catching Jay and Silent Bob. This explains the final segment in the 'where are they now' ending sequence, showing LaFours kissing Tricia during the book signing.\n\nAs explained by Kevin Smith in the introduction, most of the scenes were reworked because of the test audience's negative reaction. Some of the dialogue had been re-dubbed in the theatrical release, but is restored in this version. (For example, the man who runs up to and is subsequently punched by T.S. outside the mall near the end originally asked if he had seen T.S. on [[CNN]], whereas in the theatrical cut, he asks T.S. if he was the one who broke up with Brandi Svenning.) Other extended scenes have notable jump cuts.\n\nThe original DVD's deleted scenes reel also featured the first draft opening sequence (in script form); here, T.S. is competing on a collegiate game show produced by Mr. Svenning; he accidentally mispronounces an answer (\"Bay of Bisquake\" instead of [[Bay of Biscay]]); his team loses, and in the confusion, T.S. accidentally damages a camera, and he must now pay Mr. Svenning for the damages. Brandi then breaks up with him, and a man on a bus mistakenly thinks that T.S. will kill him after seeing him in a news report. Several alternate openings, with different voiceover spiels from Brodie (including one which has him recounting the events up to him nearly getting assaulted by Hamilton on the ''Truth or Date'' stage) were also seen in that reel.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray in 2014 and it used digital noise reduction and edge enhancement (as part of Universal's 1990's Best of the Decade collection); the menus were replaced with Universal-mandated menus, the [[Focus Features]] logo replaced the Universal logo at the start of the film, and some copies also included a code for a digital streaming version to be redeemed at Universal's online [[UltraViolet (system)|UltraViolet]] service, and [[iTunes]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Mallrats\n| type       = soundtrack\n| longtype   = to the film ''Mallrats''\n| artist     =\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|1995|10|17}}\n| recorded   = Various\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Various\n| length     = 47:18\n| label      = [[MCA Records]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[View Askewniverse]] soundtrack\n| prev_title = [[Clerks (soundtrack)|Clerks]]\n| prev_year  = 1994\n| next_title = [[Chasing Amy#Soundtrack|Chasing Amy]]\n| next_year  = 1997\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack album was released in October 1995. It features mainly [[alternative rock]] from the 90s along with dialogue from the film. The ordering of the songs on the soundtrack album is not the order they appear as in the film. For example, [[Squirtgun]]'s \"Social\" opens the film, while [[Weezer]]'s \"Susanne\" ends the film, with [[Wax (rock band)|Wax]]'s \"Mallrats\" playing over the end credits. The song \"[[Boogie Shoes]]\" by [[KC and the Sunshine Band]] makes an appearance, when Brodie and T.S. drive to the flea market. However, it was excluded from the soundtrack album. A music video for [[The Goops]]' version of \"Build Me Up Buttercup\" was directed by Smith and featured both Smith and Mewes.\n\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column    = Contributing artist\n| title1   =
