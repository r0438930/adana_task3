For example, the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC), originally developed in 1949, was updated in 1974, 1991, 2003 and again in 2014. The revised versions are [[standardized]] based on the performance of test-takers in standardization samples. A standard score of IQ 100 is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample. Thus one way to see changes in norms over time is to conduct a study in which the same test-takers take both an old and new version of the same test. Doing so confirms IQ gains over time. Some IQ tests, for example tests used for military draftees in [[NATO]] countries in Europe, report raw scores, and those also confirm a trend of rising scores over time. The average rate of increase seems to be about three IQ points per decade in the United States, as scaled by the Wechsler tests. The increasing test performance over time appears on every major test, in every age range, at every ability level, and in every modern industrialized country, although not necessarily at the same rate as in the United States.

Because children attend school longer now and have become much more familiar with the testing of school-related material, one might expect the greatest gains to occur on such school content-related tests as [[vocabulary]], [[arithmetic]] or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional decreases over the years. Meta-analytic findings indicate that Flynn effects occur for tests assessing both fluid and crystallized abilities. For example, Dutch conscripts gained 21 points during only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/> But this rise in IQ test scores is not wholly explained by an increase in general intelligence.

One problem with this explanation is that if in the US comparing older and more recent subjects with similar educational levels, then the IQ gains appear almost undiminished in each such group considered individually.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nMany studies find that children who do not attend school score drastically lower on the tests than their regularly attending peers. During the 1960s, when some [[Virginia]] counties [[Massive resistance|closed their public schools to avoid racial integration]], compensatory private schooling was available only for Caucasian children. On average, the scores of African-American children who received no formal education during that period decreased at a rate of about six IQ points per year.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nAnother explanation is an increased familiarity of the general population with tests and testing. For example, children who take the very same IQ test a second time usually gain five or six points. However, this seems to set an upper limit on the effects of test sophistication. One problem with this explanation and others related to schooling is that in the US, the groups with greater test familiarity show smaller IQ increases.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\n[[Early intervention]] programs have shown mixed results. Some preschool (ages 3\u20134) intervention programs like \"[[Head Start Program|Head Start]]\" do not produce lasting changes of IQ, although they may confer other benefits.{{which|date=July 2014}} The \"[[Abecedarian Early Intervention Project]]\", an all-day program that provided various forms of [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|environmental enrichment]] to children from infancy onward, showed IQ gains that did not diminish over time. The IQ difference between the groups, although only five points, was still present at age 12.

One of the most striking 20th-century changes of the human intellectual environment has come from the increase of exposure to many types of [[visual media]]. From pictures on the wall to movies to television to video games to computers, each successive generation has been exposed to richer optical displays than the one before and may have become more adept at visual analysis. This would explain why visual tests like the Raven's have shown the greatest increases. An increase only of particular forms of intelligence would explain why the Flynn effect has not caused a \"cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked.\"<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Dickens and Flynn presented a model for resolving several contradictory findings regarding IQ. They argue that the measure \"[[heritability]]\" includes both a direct effect of the [[genotype]] on IQ and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], thereby affecting IQ. That is, those with a greater IQ tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase IQ. These reciprocal effects result in [[gene environment correlation]]. The direct effect could initially have been very small, but [[feedback]] can create large differences of IQ. In their model, an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on IQ, even for adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition during early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that any program designed to increase IQ may produce long-term IQ gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains outside the program. To maximize lifetime IQ, the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for cognitively demanding experiences after they have left the program.<ref name=Dickens01>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346 |vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346\u2013369 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/u81/Dickens_and_Flynn__2001_.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.139.2436 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.4.764 |pages=764\u201371 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319031706/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2007  }}</ref>\n\nFlynn in his 2007 book ''[[What Is Intelligence?]]'' further expanded on this theory. Environmental changes resulting from modernization\u2014such as more intellectually demanding work, greater use of technology and smaller families\u2014have meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago. Substantial portions of IQ tests deal with these abilities. Flynn gives, as an example, the question 'What do a dog and a rabbit have in common?' A modern respondent might say they are both mammals (an abstract, or ''a priori'' answer, which depends only on the meanings of the words ''dog'' and ''rabbit''), whereas someone a century ago might have said that humans catch rabbits with dogs (a concrete, or ''a posteriori'' answer, which depended on what happened to be the case at that time).\n\n===Nutrition===\nImproved nutrition is another possible explanation. Today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult of a century ago. That increase of stature, likely the result of general improvements of nutrition and health, has been at a rate of more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Jantz |first=R. |last2=Meadows Jantz |first2=L. |year=2000 |title=Secular change in craniofacial morphology |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=327\u201338 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200005/06)12:3<327::AID-AJHB3>3.0.CO;2-1 |pmid=11534023}}</ref> This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs.<ref name=TO1987/> [[Richard Lynn]], however, claims that while people of East Asian origin may often have smaller bodies, they tend to have larger brains and higher IQs than average whites.<ref name=Lynn>Lynn, Richard (2006).

For example, the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC), originally developed in 1949, was updated in 1974, 1991, 2003 and again in 2014. The revised versions are [[standardized]] based on the performance of test-takers in standardization samples. A standard score of IQ 100 is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample. Thus one way to see changes in norms over time is to conduct a study in which the same test-takers take both an old and new version of the same test. Doing so confirms IQ gains over time. Some IQ tests, for example tests used for military draftees in [[NATO]] countries in Europe, report raw scores, and those also confirm a trend of rising scores over time. The average rate of increase seems to be about three IQ points per decade in the United States, as scaled by the Wechsler tests. The increasing test performance over time appears on every major test, in every age range, at every ability level, and in every modern industrialized country, although not necessarily at the same rate as in the United States.

Because children attend school longer now and have become much more familiar with the testing of school-related material, one might expect the greatest gains to occur on such school content-related tests as [[vocabulary]], [[arithmetic]] or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional decreases over the years. Meta-analytic findings indicate that Flynn effects occur for tests assessing both fluid and crystallized abilities. For example, Dutch conscripts gained 21 points during only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/> But this rise in IQ test scores is not wholly explained by an increase in general intelligence.

Genetic changes were seen as not important.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2016.10.061 Rindermann, et al., 2017]</ref> The experts' views agreed with an independently performed<ref>According to Rinderman et al., chapter 4</ref> meta-analysis on published Flynn effect data, except that the latter found [[life history theory|life history speed]] to be the most important factor.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691615577701 Pietschnig and Voracek, 2015.]</ref>\n\nThe expert survey explained the possible end or decline in the Flynn effect by asymmetric fertility by means of genetic effects, migration, asymmetric fertility by means of socialization effects, declines in education, and the influence of media.\n\n===Schooling and test familiarity===\nDuration of average schooling has increased steadily. One problem with this explanation is that if in the US comparing older and more recent subjects with similar educational levels, then the IQ gains appear almost undiminished in each such group considered individually.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nMany studies find that children who do not attend school score drastically lower on the tests than their regularly attending peers. During the 1960s, when some [[Virginia]] counties [[Massive resistance|closed their public schools to avoid racial integration]], compensatory private schooling was available only for Caucasian children. On average, the scores of African-American children who received no formal education during that period decreased at a rate of about six IQ points per year.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nAnother explanation is an increased familiarity of the general population with tests and testing. For example, children who take the very same IQ test a second time usually gain five or six points. However, this seems to set an upper limit on the effects of test sophistication. One problem with this explanation and others related to schooling is that in the US, the groups with greater test familiarity show smaller IQ increases.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\n[[Early intervention]] programs have shown mixed results. Some preschool (ages 3\u20134) intervention programs like \"[[Head Start Program|Head Start]]\" do not produce lasting changes of IQ, although they may confer other benefits.{{which|date=July 2014}} The \"[[Abecedarian Early Intervention Project]]\", an all-day program that provided various forms of [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|environmental enrichment]] to children from infancy onward, showed IQ gains that did not diminish over time. The IQ difference between the groups, although only five points, was still present at age 12. Not all such projects have been successful.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/> Also, such IQ gains can diminish until age 18.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Plomin R. |author2=DeFries J.C. |author3=Craig I.W. |author4=McGuffin P. |title=Behavioral genetics in the postgenomic era |year=2003 |edition=4th }}</ref>\n\nCiting a high correlation between rising literacy rates and gains in IQ, [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] has argued that the Flynn effect is caused by changes in literacy rates.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2466/pr0.106.3.643-664 |author=David F Marks|title=IQ variations across time, race, and nationality:an artifact of differences in literacy skills|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=106 |issue=3|pages=643\u201364|year=2010 |pmid=20712152|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/888e97997b7e08afe236abc8d60eecc1b1fa24df}}</ref>\n\n===Generally more stimulating environment===\nStill another theory is that the general environment today is much more complex and stimulating. One of the most striking 20th-century changes of the human intellectual environment has come from the increase of exposure to many types of [[visual media]]. From pictures on the wall to movies to television to video games to computers, each successive generation has been exposed to richer optical displays than the one before and may have become more adept at visual analysis. This would explain why visual tests like the Raven's have shown the greatest increases. An increase only of particular forms of intelligence would explain why the Flynn effect has not caused a \"cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked.\"<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Dickens and Flynn presented a model for resolving several contradictory findings regarding IQ. They argue that the measure \"[[heritability]]\" includes both a direct effect of the [[genotype]] on IQ and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], thereby affecting IQ. That is, those with a greater IQ tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase IQ. These reciprocal effects result in [[gene environment correlation]]. The direct effect could initially have been very small, but [[feedback]] can create large differences of IQ. In their model, an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on IQ, even for adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition during early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that any program designed to increase IQ may produce long-term IQ gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains outside the program. To maximize lifetime IQ, the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for cognitively demanding experiences after they have left the program.<ref name=Dickens01>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346 |vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346\u2013369 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/u81/Dickens_and_Flynn__2001_.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.139.2436 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.4.764 |pages=764\u201371 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319031706/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2007  }}</ref>\n\nFlynn in his 2007 book ''[[What Is Intelligence?]]'' further expanded on this theory. Environmental changes resulting from modernization\u2014such as more intellectually demanding work, greater use of technology and smaller families\u2014have meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago. Substantial portions of IQ tests deal with these abilities. Flynn gives, as an example, the question 'What do a dog and a rabbit have in common?' A modern respondent might say they are both mammals (an abstract, or ''a priori'' answer, which depends only on the meanings of the words ''dog'' and ''rabbit''), whereas someone a century ago might have said that humans catch rabbits with dogs (a concrete, or ''a posteriori'' answer, which depended on what happened to be the case at that time).\n\n===Nutrition===\nImproved nutrition is another possible explanation. Today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult of a century ago. That increase of stature, likely the result of general improvements of nutrition and health, has been at a rate of more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Jantz |first=R. |last2=Meadows Jantz |first2=L. |year=2000 |title=Secular change in craniofacial morphology |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=327\u201338 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200005/06)12:3<327::AID-AJHB3>3.0.CO;2-1 |pmid=11534023}}</ref> This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs.<ref name=TO1987/> [[Richard Lynn]], however, claims that while people of East Asian origin may often have smaller bodies, they tend to have larger brains and higher IQs than average whites.<ref name=Lynn>Lynn, Richard (2006).

Lynn states that \"This rules out improvements in education, greater test sophistication, etc. and most of the other factors that have been proposed to explain the Flynn effect.

This is supported by data on Danish draftees where first or second generation immigrants with Danish nationality score below average.<ref name = \"reversal\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.01.007 |vauthors=Teasdale TW, Owen DR |title=Secular declines in cognitive test scores: A reversal of the Flynn Effect |journal=Intelligence |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=121\u201326 |year=2008 |url=http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/teasdale2008.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn Australia, the IQ of 6\u201312 year olds as measured by the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Colored Progressive Matrices]] has shown no increase from 1975\u20132003.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Cotton | first1= S.M.| last2= Kiely| first2= P.M.|last3= Crewther|first3= D.P.|last4= Thomson|first4= B.|last5= Laycock|first5= R.|last6= Crewther|first6= S.G. |year=2005|title= A normative and reliability study for the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices for primary school aged children in Australia|journal= Personality and Individual Differences|volume= 39| issue= 3|pages= 647\u201360| doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.02.015 }}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a study by Flynn (2009) found that tests carried out in 1980 and again in 2008 show that the IQ score of an average 14-year-old dropped by more than two points over the period. For the upper half of the results the performance was even worse. Average IQ scores declined by six points. However, children aged between five and 10 saw their IQs increase by up to half a point a year over the three decades. Flynn argues that the abnormal drop in British teenage IQ could be due to youth culture having \"stagnated\" or even dumbed down. He also states that the youth culture is more oriented towards computer games than towards reading and holding conversations. Researcher Richard Gray, commenting on the study, also mentions the computer culture diminishing reading books as well as a tendency towards [[teaching to the test]].<ref>{{cite news |title=British teenagers have lower IQs than their counterparts did 30 years ago |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/4548943/British-teenagers-have-lower-IQs-than-their-counterparts-did-30-years-ago.html |journal=The Telegraph |date=February 7, 2009 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Gray}}</ref><ref name=\"requiem\">{{Cite journal| pmc = | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2009.01.009 | pmid =   19251490| last1 = Flynn | first1 = J.R. | title = Requiem for nutrition as the cause of IQ gains: Raven's gains in Britain 1938\u20132008 | journal = Economics & Human Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 18\u201327 | year = 2009 }}</ref>\n\nLynn and Harvey argued in 2008 that the causes of the above are difficult to interpret since these countries had had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as there is a limit to how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between [[fertility and intelligence]] although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two. They estimate that there has been a [[dysgenic]] decline in the world's [[genotypic]] IQ (masked by the Flynn effect for the [[phenotype]]) of 0.86 IQ points per decade for the years 1950\u20132000.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lynn |first=Richard |last2=Harvey |first2=John |date=March 2008 |title=The decline of the world's IQ |journal=Intelligence |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=112\u201320 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.03.004 |issn=0160-2896}}</ref>\n\nBratsberg & Rogeberg (2018) present evidence that the Flynn effect in Norway has reversed, and that both the original rise in mean IQ scores and their subsequent decline were caused by environmental factors. They conclude that environmental factors explain all or almost all of the decline, and any effects from immigration or hypothesised declines in genotypic IQ are negligible.<ref name=pnas2018/>\n\nOne possible explanation of a worldwide decline in intelligence, suggested by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Forum of International Respiratory Societies]]' Environmental Committee, is an increase in air pollution, which now affects over 90% of the world's population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/may/17/air-pollution-may-be-damaging-every-organ-and-cell-in-the-body-finds-global-review|title=Revealed: air pollution may be damaging 'every organ in the body'|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=17 May 2019|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=17 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wuebbles|first=Donald J.|last2=Vanker|first2=Anessa|last3=To|first3=Teresa|last4=Thurston|first4=George D.|last5=Sood|first5=Akshay|last6=Riojas-Rodriguez|first6=Horacio|last7=Rice|first7=Mary B.|last8=Perez-Padilla|first8=Rogelio|last9=Mortimer|first9=Kevin|date=February 2019|title=Air Pollution and Noncommunicable Diseases: A Review by the Forum of International Respiratory Societies' Environmental Committee, Part 2: Air Pollution and Organ Systems|url=https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(18)32722-3/abstract|journal= Chest|language=English|volume=155|issue=2|pages=417\u2013426|doi=10.1016/j.chest.2018.10.041|issn=0012-3692|pmid=30419237|via=American College of Chest Physicians|pmc=6904854}}</ref>\n\n==IQ group differences==\n{{see also|Nations and intelligence|Race and intelligence|Sex differences in intelligence}}\nIf the Flynn effect has ended in developed nations, then this may possibly allow [[Nations and intelligence|national differences in IQ scores]] to diminish if the Flynn effect continues in nations with lower average national IQs.<ref name = \"reversal\" />\n\nAlso, if the Flynn effect has ended for the majority in developed nations, it may still continue for minorities, especially for groups like immigrants where many may have received poor nutrition during early childhood or have had other disadvantages. A study in the [[Netherlands]] found that children of non-Western immigrants had improvements for ''g'', educational achievements, and work proficiency compared to their parents, although there were still remaining differences compared to ethnic Dutch.<ref name=Nijenhuis04/>\n\nThere is a controversy as to whether the [[Race and intelligence|US racial gap in IQ scores]] is diminishing. If that is the case then this may or may not be related to the Flynn effect. Flynn has commented that he never claimed that the Flynn effect has the same causes as the black-white gap, but that it shows that environmental factors can create IQ differences of a magnitude similar to the gap.<ref>{{Cite journal| pmc = | pmid =   | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2010.05.001 | last1 = Flynn | first1 = J.R. | title = The spectacles through which I see the race and IQ debate| journal = Intelligence | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 363\u201366 | year = 2010 }}</ref> Research that has examined whether [[G factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] and IQ gains from the Flynn effect are related have found there is a negative correlation between the two, which may indicate that group differences and the Flynn effect are possibly due to differing causes.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2013.03.001| title = Is the Flynn effect on g?: A meta-analysis| year = 2013| last1 = Nijenhuis | first1 = J.|last2 = van der Flierb | first2 = H.| journal = Intelligence| volume = 41| issue = 6| pages = 802\u201307 }}</ref>\n\nThe Flynn effect has also been part of the discussions regarding [[Spearman's hypothesis]], which states that differences in the [[G factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] are the major source of differences between blacks and whites observed in many studies of race and intelligence.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.1.5| title = Searching for justice: the discovery of IQ gains over time| year = 1999| last1 = Flynn | first1 = J.R.| journal = American Psychologist| volume = 54| pages = 5\u20139 | url = http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/flynn.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Biology}}\n* [[Environment and intelligence]]\n* [[Euthenics]]\n* [[Gene\u2013environment correlation]]\n* [[Impact of health on intelligence]]\n* [[Intelligence (trait)|Intelligence]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.95.1.29 |author=Flynn, James R. |title=The Mean IQ of Americans: Massive Gains 1932 to 1978 |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=95  |issue= |pages=29\u201351 |year=1984 |url=http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/flynn1984b.pdf |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite journal |author=Flynn, James R. |title=Massive IQ Gains in 14 Nations: What IQ Tests Really Measure |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=171\u201391 |date= March 1987 |url=http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/flynn1987.pdf |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.101.2.171 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite book |author=Flynn, James R. |chapter=IQ Gains over Time: Toward Finding the Causes |title=The Rising Curve: Long-Term Gains in IQ and Related Measures |editor=Neisser, Ulric |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |year=1998 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/risingcurvelongt00neis/page/25 25\u201366] |isbn=978-1-55798-503-3 |ref=harv |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/risingcurvelongt00neis |url=https://archive.org/details/risingcurvelongt00neis/page/25 }}\n* {{Cite book |author=Flynn, James R. |title=What Is Intelligence: Beyond the Flynn Effect |edition=expanded paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-74147-7 |year=2009 |lay-url=http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/flynn-beyond/ |laydate=July 18, 2010 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite book |author=Flynn, James R. |title=Are We Getting Smarter?
