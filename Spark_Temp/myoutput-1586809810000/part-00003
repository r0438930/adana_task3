The program airs from 9-10 p.m. ET on weeknights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Introducing 'The National Conversation With All Things Considered' |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/819186570/introducing-the-national-conversation-with-all-things-considered |website=NPR.org |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe format is less rigid than that of ''Morning Edition'', with a wider array of type and length of stories. The length of stories tends to be greater than ''Morning Edition'', with some stories lasting for almost 23 minutes. Certain types of personal interest stories are almost always covered within this limit; those relating to hard news or entertainment tend to last the standard three-and-a-half to four minutes.\n\nThe program begins with the familiar [[Don Voegeli]] theme song<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/asc/features/atc_theme/ |title=ATC Theme: The Story |website=[[All Songs Considered]] |accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref> under a one-minute billboard of the stories to be covered during the hour. Then the standard five-minute NPR newscast is delivered from one minute to six minutes past the hour. The newscast offers a cutaway after three minutes (at four minutes past the hour), allowing stations to cover the last 2.5 minutes with evening rush-hour news and traffic reports. For those stations that run the newscast untouched, a 30-second music bed follows instead.\n\nThe first, or \"A\" segment, begins at :06:30 after the hour. It features important news stories, although not necessarily the most important news stories of the day. Often it is here that the most significant interviews or developing stories are placed. Segment A runs 11:29 in duration, and closes out at :18 after with a two-minute station break.\n\nAt :20:35 past the hour, ''ATC'' picks back up with Segment B. This segment, which runs 8:24, features more news and analysis, and often contains lighter stories and commentary. Segment B breaks for the half-hour at :29 past. The program goes into a one-minute local break.\n\nAt the bottom of the hour, ''ATC'' resumes with a \"host return\". In the 30-second return, the host or hosts discuss what's coming up in the remaining half-hour and intro the news. This is immediately followed by a 3:30 newscast which ends at :34 after the hour, followed by a one-minute local break.\n\nSegment C kicks off at :35:35 past the hour, and runs 8:24. Long feature stories are heard here, or as many as three shorter stories or commentaries may be heard as well. Segment D occurs immediately after Segment C at :44 past the hour, and runs for four minutes. Segment D is a designated cutaway for stations to run local commentary or features in lieu of the national segment. Segment D ends at :48 after the hour, and another two-minute break ensues. Occasionally, the show will \"break format\" and place a long, 12-minute story in Segments C and D without a local cutaway.\n\nSegment E starts at :50 after, and concludes the hour. The segment runs 8:09. Unlike ''Morning Edition'', there is no set format for this segment, although usually the second hour will contain an arts, culture, or lighter news story in this segment. Other times, hard news otherwise not fitting in the program may be placed here.\n\nStations receive a preliminary rundown before each broadcast (usually a few minutes before 4:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern) denoting the timing and placement of stories so they can schedule local content as appropriate. This rundown is updated as stories change until the feed ends at 10 p.m. ET. As with ''Morning Edition'', two hours of content are scheduled for each program. After 6 p.m. Eastern, the feed repeats the earlier hours for the Midwest and West Coast, although information is updated through the evening as appropriate.\n\n==Awards==\nMajor awards won by the show include the Ohio State Award, the [[Peabody Award]], the Overseas Press Club Award, the [[DuPont Awards|DuPont Award]], the American Women in Radio and Television Award, and the [[Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award|Robert F. Kennedy Award]].

The program airs from 9-10 p.m. ET on weeknights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Introducing 'The National Conversation With All Things Considered' |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/819186570/introducing-the-national-conversation-with-all-things-considered |website=NPR.org |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe format is less rigid than that of ''Morning Edition'', with a wider array of type and length of stories. The length of stories tends to be greater than ''Morning Edition'', with some stories lasting for almost 23 minutes. Certain types of personal interest stories are almost always covered within this limit; those relating to hard news or entertainment tend to last the standard three-and-a-half to four minutes.\n\nThe program begins with the familiar [[Don Voegeli]] theme song<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/asc/features/atc_theme/ |title=ATC Theme: The Story |website=[[All Songs Considered]] |accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref> under a one-minute billboard of the stories to be covered during the hour. Then the standard five-minute NPR newscast is delivered from one minute to six minutes past the hour. The newscast offers a cutaway after three minutes (at four minutes past the hour), allowing stations to cover the last 2.5 minutes with evening rush-hour news and traffic reports. For those stations that run the newscast untouched, a 30-second music bed follows instead.\n\nThe first, or \"A\" segment, begins at :06:30 after the hour. It features important news stories, although not necessarily the most important news stories of the day. Often it is here that the most significant interviews or developing stories are placed. Segment A runs 11:29 in duration, and closes out at :18 after with a two-minute station break.\n\nAt :20:35 past the hour, ''ATC'' picks back up with Segment B. This segment, which runs 8:24, features more news and analysis, and often contains lighter stories and commentary. Segment B breaks for the half-hour at :29 past. The program goes into a one-minute local break.\n\nAt the bottom of the hour, ''ATC'' resumes with a \"host return\". In the 30-second return, the host or hosts discuss what's coming up in the remaining half-hour and intro the news. This is immediately followed by a 3:30 newscast which ends at :34 after the hour, followed by a one-minute local break.\n\nSegment C kicks off at :35:35 past the hour, and runs 8:24. Long feature stories are heard here, or as many as three shorter stories or commentaries may be heard as well. Segment D occurs immediately after Segment C at :44 past the hour, and runs for four minutes. Segment D is a designated cutaway for stations to run local commentary or features in lieu of the national segment. Segment D ends at :48 after the hour, and another two-minute break ensues. Occasionally, the show will \"break format\" and place a long, 12-minute story in Segments C and D without a local cutaway.\n\nSegment E starts at :50 after, and concludes the hour. The segment runs 8:09. Unlike ''Morning Edition'', there is no set format for this segment, although usually the second hour will contain an arts, culture, or lighter news story in this segment. Other times, hard news otherwise not fitting in the program may be placed here.\n\nStations receive a preliminary rundown before each broadcast (usually a few minutes before 4:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern) denoting the timing and placement of stories so they can schedule local content as appropriate. This rundown is updated as stories change until the feed ends at 10 p.m. ET. As with ''Morning Edition'', two hours of content are scheduled for each program. After 6 p.m. Eastern, the feed repeats the earlier hours for the Midwest and West Coast, although information is updated through the evening as appropriate.\n\n==Awards==\nMajor awards won by the show include the Ohio State Award, the [[Peabody Award]], the Overseas Press Club Award, the [[DuPont Awards|DuPont Award]], the American Women in Radio and Television Award, and the [[Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award|Robert F. Kennedy Award]]. In 1993, the show was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]], the first<ref>{{cite web |title=30th Anniversary Celebration of All Things Considered |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/atc30/timeline/1993.html |website=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2001 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref> public radio program to be given that honor.\n\nIn 2017, the first broadcast episode (from 1971) of ''All Things Considered'' was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].
