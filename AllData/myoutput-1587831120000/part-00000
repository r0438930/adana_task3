Peel's [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]] established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the greater London area known as the [[Metropolitan Police]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Police|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/laworder/policeprisons/overview/metropolitanpolice/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> Legislation in the 1830s introduced policing in boroughs and many counties and, in the 1850s, policing was established nationally.\n\nThe [[Peelian Principles]] describe the philosophy that Sir Robert Peel developed to define an ethical police force. The principles traditionally ascribed to Peel state that:\n* Every police officer should be issued an [[Warrant card|identification number]], to assure accountability for his actions.\n* Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests, but on the lack of crime.\n* Above all else, an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount.  Hence, Peel's most often quoted principle that \"The police are the public and the public are the police.\"\n\n[[Peelian Principles#The Nine Principles of Policing|Nine principles of policing]] were set out in the \u2018General Instructions\u2019 issued to every new police officer in the Metropolitan Police from 1829. However, the Home Office has suggested this list was more likely authored by Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, the first and joint Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police.<ref name=UKP>{{cite web|title=Policing by consent|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/policing-by-consent|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=29 December 2013|date=10 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=CIVITAS>{{cite web|title=Principles of Good Policing|url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/research/crime/facts-comments/principles-of-good-policing/|publisher=The Institute for the Study of Civil Society|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe police historian Charles Reith explained in his ''New Study of Police History'' (1956)<ref name=UKP /> that these principles constituted a philosophy of policing \"unique in history and throughout the world because it derived not from fear but almost exclusively from public co-operation with the police, induced by them designedly by behaviour which secures and maintains for them the approval, respect and affection of the public\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Reith|first=Charles|title=A New Study of Police History|year=1956|publisher=London: Oliver & Boyd|page=140}}</ref> This approach to policing became known as \"policing by consent\".<ref name=CIVITAS />\n\nThe first women police officers were employed during the First World War.

A [[Police Complaints Board]] was set up to handle allegations of malpractice in response.\n\nChanges took place to tighten police procedures in the 1980s, in response to the [[Scarman Report]], to ensure that evidence and interviews were robust, in the introduction of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. In 1989, the [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] was disbanded as a series of around 100 criminal cases failed or were subsequently overturned in the West Midlands, after new forensic techniques showed police officers had been tampering with statement evidence to secure convictions, including those of the [[Birmingham Six]].\n\nThe Police Complaints Board was replaced by the [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]] in 1985, which itself was superseded by the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] in 2004. On 8 January 2018, the IPCC was replaced by the [[Independent Office for Police Conduct]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/page/becoming-the-iopc \n|title=Becoming the IOPC\n|newspaper=IPCC.gov.uk\n|date=16 December 2017\n}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdictions and territories==\n[[File:CrimeinUK.png|thumb|300px|Crime in England and Wales from the [[Crime Survey for England and Wales|Crime Survey]] (in 000s of crimes).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingdec2016 |title=Crime in England and Wales: year ending Dec 2016}}</ref>]]\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], every person has limited powers of [[arrest]] if they see a crime being committed: at [[Scots law#Common law|common law]] in Scotland, and in England and Wales if the crime is [[indictable]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=police+and+criminal&Year=1984&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=1871554&ActiveTextDocId=1871587&filesize=15596 |title=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (c. 60) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 these are called \"every person powers\", commonly referred to as a \"[[citizen's arrest]]\". In England and Wales, the vast majority of [[Police Oath#United Kingdom|attested]] [[constables]] enjoy full powers of arrest and search as granted by the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. For the purposes of this legislation, \"constables\" is defined to mean all police officers, irrespective of [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|rank]]. Although police officers have wide-ranging powers, they are still subject to the same laws as members of the public (aside from specific exemptions such as the carrying of firearms and certain road traffic legislation).  There are additional legal restrictions placed on police officers such as the prohibitions on industrial action and on taking part in active politics.\n\n===Types of law enforcement agency===\n{{Main|List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom}}\nThere are three general types of law enforcement agency in the United Kingdom. The first is mostly concerned with policing the general public and their activities and the others are concerned with policing of more specific matters:\n\n* '''Territorial police services''', which carry out the majority of policing. There are 45 [[Territorial police force#United Kingdom|territorial police services]] {{As of|2013|lc=on}} that cover a [[police area]] (a particular region) and have an independent [[police authority]] (England and Wales) or local authority or joint [[police board]] (Scotland). The [[Police Act 1996]], the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]] and the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000]], prescribe a number of issues such as appointment of a [[chief constable]], and jurisdiction and responsibilities for police forces in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively. Since the introduction of [[Police and Crime Commissioner]]s in November 2012, the police services in England and Wales no longer have a police authority and this work is done by the police and crime prevention commissioners who are elected every four years. Certain territorial police services have units within them which have a national role, such the Specialist Operations directorate of the Metropolitan Police.\n* '''National law enforcement agencies''', including the [[National Crime Agency]] and [[British Transport Police]] (the latter only operates in Great Britain). The [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] refers to these as \"[[Special police force#United Kingdom|special police forces]]\". The National Crime Agency operates across the United Kingdom (but in Scotland or Northern Ireland requires the agreement of the domestic prosecuting authority to do so) against organised crime and acts as the UK point of contact for foreign agencies. There are also non-police law enforcement agencies whose officers, while not police constables, enforce laws such as the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] and [[HM Revenue and Customs]].\n* '''Miscellaneous police services''', mostly having their foundations in older legislation or [[common law]]. These have a responsibility to police specific local areas or activities, such as ports and parks, and before the passing of recent legislation such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 were often referred to as \"special police services\"; care must therefore be taken in interpreting historical use of that phrase. These constabularies are not within the scope of the legislation applicable to the previously mentioned organisations but can still be the subject of statutes applicable to, for example, docks, harbours or railways. Until the passing of [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]], the British Transport Police was such a force.\n\nThe [[list of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom]] details the various services.\n\n===Cross-jurisdiction powers===\nTerritorial police constables have certain powers of arrest in another one of the [[Legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom|UK's three legal jurisdictions]] than they were attested in. There are four main provisions for them to do so&nbsp;\u2013 arrest with a warrant, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in their home jurisdiction whilst in another jurisdiction, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in another jurisdiction whilst in that jurisdiction, and mutual aid.  A fifth power of cross jurisdictional arrest was introduced by section 116 of the [[Policing and Crime Act 2017]] which fills a loop hole in arrest powers in certain situations.  This power came into force in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/227/regulation/2/made/data.htm|title=The Policing and Crime Act 2017 (Commencement No. 7) Regulations 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>  This new power allows a constable from one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  This power is in relation to more serious offences as listed in the act.  The Act sets out how long the person can be detained in custody by the 'arresting force' in one jurisdiction until constables from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction can travel to re-arrest the person and deal accordingly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>  Below is a summary of these five powers with a practical example due to the complicated nature of this area of law.  Note: this section applies to territorial police constables only, and not to others&nbsp;\u2013 except the British Transport Police, who also have [[British Transport Police#Cross-border powers|certain cross-border powers]] in addition to their natural powers.\n\n====Arrest with warrant====\nCertain warrants can be executed by constables even though they are outside their jurisdiction: [[arrest warrant]]s and [[Warrant of committal|warrants of committal]] (all); and a warrant to arrest a witness (England, Wales or Northern Ireland); a warrant for committal, a warrant to imprison (or to apprehend and imprison), and a warrant to arrest a witness (Scotland).<ref name=\"S136\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=2156203&activetextdocid=2156396 |title=section 136, Criminal Justice & Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-16}}</ref> A warrant issued in one legal jurisdiction may be executed in either of the other two jurisdictions by a constable from either the jurisdiction where it was issued, or the jurisdiction where it is executed.<ref name=\"S136\"/>\n\nWhen executing a warrant issued in Scotland, the constable executing it shall have the same powers and duties, and the person arrested the same rights, as they would have had if execution had been in Scotland by a constable of a police force in Scotland.

As a practical example, if constables from [[Police Scotland]] are over the border in Cumbria on enquiries and come across a burglary in progress they can arrest the suspect on suspicion of burglary

This new power allows a constable of one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  The Act sets out which offences this power of arrest will apply to in each jurisdiction (generally serious offences), and how long the person arrested can be kept in custody, with relevant authorities, by the 'arresting force' to allow sufficient time for officers from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction to travel and re-arrest the detained person for the purposes of their investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>\n\nAs a practical example of this power, a murder is committed in Aberdeen, Scotland.

A person must make a declaration before taking up office as a constable and having any powers; although this is sometimes still known as the [[police oath]], and the process sometimes referred to as \"swearing in\", it now takes the form of an \"attestation\" (in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]) or a \"declaration\" (in [[Scotland]]). The process is carried out in the presence of a magistrate, and is usually followed by the issue of a warrant card. This grants the officer all the powers and privileges, duties and responsibilities of a constable in one of the three distinct legal systems - either England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, and the territorial waters of that country.

As a result, they have the full powers of a constable on land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land. There are also forces created by specific legislation, such as the [[Port of Tilbury Police]] ([[Port of London Act 1968]]), [[Mersey Tunnels Police]] (County of Merseyside Act 1989) and the [[Epping Forest Keepers]] (Epping Forest Act 1878).\n\n====Parks Constables====\nUnder Article 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation (Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967, [[London Borough Council]]s are allowed to swear in council officers as constables for \"securing the observance of the provisions of all enactments relating to open spaces under their control or management and of bye-laws and regulations made thereunder\". Local Authority Parks Constables have all the powers of a constable in relation byelaws regulations and all enactments relating to open spaces, Article 19 of the Act was repealed by section 26(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Local Acts) and the power of arrest for Parks Constables is now contained in Section 24 of P.A.C.E 1984, further amendments to Article 19 covering coming to the aid and assistance of such a constable or officer were repealed by SOCPA 2005, as this provision is already covered in P.A.C.E 1984 (Legal Counsel 2007,2012).\nNo enforcement agency with a power of arrest or detention can operate outside of the provisions of P.A.C.E 1984; therefore all local powers of arrest and detention were brought into line under section 26(1) P.A.C.E 1984.\n\n===Police staff===\nPolice forces employ staff who perform many functions to assist officers and support the smooth running of their police force. They do not hold the office of constable.\nIn England & Wales, the [[chief police officer]] of a territorial police force may designate any person who is employed by the police authority maintaining that force, and is under the direction and control of that chief police officer, as one or more of the following:\n*[[Police Community Support Officer]]\n*Investigating Officer,\n*[[Custody assistant|detention officer]], or\n*Escort Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112693&filesize=53565 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\nThey have a range of powers given by the [[Police Reform Act 2002]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112842&filesize=2720 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> and their chief police officer decides which of these powers they may use. Unlike a police constable, a PCSO only has powers when on duty and in uniform, and within the area policed by their respective force.\n\nUntil 1991, parking enforcement was primarily conducted by police-employed [[traffic warden]]s. Since the passage of the Road Traffic Act 1991, [[decriminalised parking enforcement]] has enabled local authorities to take on this role and now very few forces still employ Police Traffic Wardens, these include the Metropolitan Police Service however they have combined the role with PCSOs as ''Traffic Police Community Support Officers''.\n\nIn Scotland, [[Police Custody and Security Officer]]s have powers similar to those of detention officers and escort officers in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oqps.gov.uk/legislation/acts/acts2003/asp_20030007_en_13#pt12-pb1-l1g76 |title=Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 (asp 7) |publisher=Oqps.gov.uk |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Similar powers are available in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(UK+Public+General)&title=Northern+Ireland&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=814668&ActiveTextDocId=814749&filesize=1903 |title=Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003 (c. 6) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n\n===Accredited Persons===\n[[Chief police officer]]s of territorial police forces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112697&filesize=4936 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> (and the British Transport Police<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112699&filesize=6329 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>) can also give limited powers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112884&filesize=641 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> to people not employed by the police authority, under [[Community Safety Accreditation Scheme]]s.

These forces operate across the United Kingdom and their responsibility is to the specific activities they were established to police.\n\n[[File:police.boat.at.poole.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Police harbour patrol boat in [[Poole Harbour]], [[Dorset]]]]\n\n===Her Majesty's Inspectorates of Constabulary ===\n[[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary|Her Majesty's Inspectorates of Constabulary]] (HMIC) are the official bodies responsible for the examination and assessment of police forces to ensure their requirements are met as intended.\n\nThere are two similarly named organisations:\n*'''Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services''' (HMICFRS) - this organisation is responsible to the [[Home Office]] for police forces in England and Wales. It also inspects, by invitation, various UK [[special police force]]s and elements of the Service (Military) Police. Since 2004, HMIC has also had responsibility for examining [[HM Revenue and Customs]] and the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]]. Inspection services have been provided on a non-statutory basis for the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]].  Since July 2017 it has also become responsible for inspecting Fire & Rescue Services in England.\n*'''Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland''' (commonly known as HMICS) - this organisation is responsible to the [[Scottish Government]] and examines the [[Police Service of Scotland]] and the [[Scottish Police Authority]].\n\n===Crown dependencies and overseas territories===\nThe [[Crown dependencies]] and [[British overseas territories]] have their own police forces, the majority of which use the British model. Because they are not part of the United Kingdom, they are not answerable to the British Government; instead they are organised by and are responsible to their own governments (an exception to this is the [[Sovereign Base Areas Police]]; as the SBAs' existence is solely for the benefit of the British armed forces and do not have full overseas territory status, the SBA Police are responsible to the Ministry of Defence). Because they are based on the British model of policing, these police forces conform to the standards set out by the British government, which includes voluntarily submitting themselves to inspection by the HMIC. Their vehicles share similarities with the vehicles owned by forces based in the UK, such as the use of [[Battenburg markings]].\n\n'''List of British Overseas Territories Police Services/Forces:'''\n\nThe fourteen British Overseas Territories are:<ref name=\"collections.europarchive.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front%3fpagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1013618138295 |title=Overseas Territories |publisher=UK Overseas Territories Foreign & Commonwealth Office |accessdate=8 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68e5D4Buo?url=http://collections.europarchive.org/tna/20080205132101/www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket%2FXcelerate%2FShowPage&c=Page&cid=1013618138295 |archivedate=23 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Flag\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Arms\n!

These officers are generally the most visible and will invariably be the first interface a member of the public has with police. In general terms these officers will normally patrol by vehicle (though also on foot or bicycle in urban areas). They will generally patrol a sub-division or whole division of a police force area or in the case of the Metropolitan Police Service, a borough. Nearly all police officers begin their careers in this area of policing, with some moving on to more specialist roles. The Metropolitan Police Service calls this area of policing 'Response Teams', whilst other forces use terms such as 'patrol', 'section' and other variations.\n* Most local areas or wards in the country have at least one police officer who is involved in trying to build links with the local community and resolve long-term problems. In London, the Metropolitan Police Service addresses this area of policing with Safer Neighbourhood Teams. This entails each political ward in London having a Police Sergeant, two police constables and a few PCSOs who are ring fenced to address problems and build community links in their respective wards. Other police forces have similar systems but can be named 'Area officers', 'Neighbourhood officers', 'Beat Constables' and a number of other variations.\n* Criminal Investigation Departments (CID) can be found in all police forces. Generally these officers deal with investigations of a more complex, serious nature, however this again can differ from force to force.  Most officers within this area are detectives. Depending on the force in question this area of policing can be further divided into a myriad of other specialist areas such as fraud.  Smaller forces tend to have detectives who deal with a wide range of varied investigations whereas detectives in larger forces can have a very specialist remit.\n* All police forces have specialist departments that deal with certain aspects of policing. Larger forces such as Greater Manchester Police, Strathclyde Police and West Midlands Police have many and varied departments and units such as traffic, firearms, marine, horse, tactical support all named differently depending on the force.  Smaller forces such Dyfed Powys Police and Warwickshire Police will have fewer specialists and will rely on cross training, such as firearms officers also being traffic trained officers. The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the country, has a large number of specialist departments, some of which are unique to the Metropolitan Police due to policing the capital and its national responsibilities. For example, the [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] and [[Counter Terrorism Command]].\n\n====Fixated Threat Assessment Centre====\n{{main|Fixated Threat Assessment Centre}}\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Fixated Threat Assessment Centre]] is a joint police/mental health unit set up in October 2006 by the [[Home Office]], the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and [[Metropolitan Police Service]] to identify and address those individuals considered to pose a threat to VIPs or the Royal Family.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1847697.ece|publisher=The Times|title=VIP 'stalker' squad set up by government|author=Joanna Bale|date=May 27, 2007 | location=London}}</ref> They may then be referred to local health services for further assessment and potential [[involuntary commitment]]. In some cases, they may be detained by police under the [[Mental Health Act 1983#Civil sections|section 136 powers]] of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] prior to referral.\n\n====Border Force====\n:''See also: [[UK Visas and Immigration]], previously [[UK Border Agency]]''\nAs part of the wide-ranging review of the Home Office, the then Home Secretary, [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]], announced in July 2006 that all British immigration officers would be uniformed. On 1 April 2007 the [[Border and Immigration Agency]] (BIA) was created and commenced operation. However, there were no police officers in the Agency, a matter that attracted considerable criticism when the Agency was established - agency officers have limited powers of arrest.

In 2015 a public inquiry under a senior judge was announced. In November 2015 the Metropolitan Police published an unreserved apology in which it exonerated and apologized to those women who had been deceived and stated the methodology had constituted abuse and a \"gross violation\" with severely harmful effects, as part of a settlement of their cases.

Neighbourhood policing is important in dealing with terrorism and gang crime, especially in communities where the police are distrusted.  [[Yvette Cooper]] said the police were, \"performing a remarkable public service in increasingly difficult circumstances\" though they were, \"badly overstretched\" and responding with difficulty to increasing challenges like online fraud and online child abuse. Only a very small proportion of online fraud cases are investigated and the police are, \"woefully under-resourced\" for the number of online child sexual abuse investigations they must undertake.  Che Donald of the Police Federation of England and Wales said the government should acknowledge the, \"true cost of policing\" or officers would be unable to keep the public safe.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45970761 Overstretched police risk becoming 'irrelevant', MPs warn] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\n===Police sex abuse allegations===\nIn 2016, allegations of serious [[sexual abuse]] were made against hundreds of police officers in England and Wales, with several forces in England and Wales receiving 436 allegations of abuse of power for sexual gain against 436 police officers, including 20 [[police community support officer]]s and eight staff in the two years to March 2016.<ref name=hundreds>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/08/hundreds-police-reprieved-sex-abuse-claims-forces-fail-take/|title=Hundreds of police officers 'getting away with sexual abuse of crime victims'|work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/08/hundreds-police-officers-accused-sex-abuse-inquiry-finds|title=Hundreds of police in England and Wales accused of sexual abuse|first=Jamie|last=Grierson|date=8 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref> Mike Cunningham, inspector of constabulary and former chief constable of Staffordshire police said: \u201cIt's the most serious form of corruption.

Peel's [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]] established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the greater London area known as the [[Metropolitan Police]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Police|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/laworder/policeprisons/overview/metropolitanpolice/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> Legislation in the 1830s introduced policing in boroughs and many counties and, in the 1850s, policing was established nationally.\n\nThe [[Peelian Principles]] describe the philosophy that Sir Robert Peel developed to define an ethical police force. The principles traditionally ascribed to Peel state that:\n* Every police officer should be issued an [[Warrant card|identification number]], to assure accountability for his actions.\n* Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests, but on the lack of crime.\n* Above all else, an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount.  Hence, Peel's most often quoted principle that \"The police are the public and the public are the police.\"\n\n[[Peelian Principles#The Nine Principles of Policing|Nine principles of policing]] were set out in the \u2018General Instructions\u2019 issued to every new police officer in the Metropolitan Police from 1829.

A [[Police Complaints Board]] was set up to handle allegations of malpractice in response.\n\nChanges took place to tighten police procedures in the 1980s, in response to the [[Scarman Report]], to ensure that evidence and interviews were robust, in the introduction of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. In 1989, the [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] was disbanded as a series of around 100 criminal cases failed or were subsequently overturned in the West Midlands, after new forensic techniques showed police officers had been tampering with statement evidence to secure convictions, including those of the [[Birmingham Six]].\n\nThe Police Complaints Board was replaced by the [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]] in 1985, which itself was superseded by the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] in 2004.

In England and Wales, the vast majority of [[Police Oath#United Kingdom|attested]] [[constables]] enjoy full powers of arrest and search as granted by the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. For the purposes of this legislation, \"constables\" is defined to mean all police officers, irrespective of [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|rank]]. Although police officers have wide-ranging powers, they are still subject to the same laws as members of the public (aside from specific exemptions such as the carrying of firearms and certain road traffic legislation).  There are additional legal restrictions placed on police officers such as the prohibitions on industrial action and on taking part in active politics.\n\n===Types of law enforcement agency===\n{{Main|List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom}}\nThere are three general types of law enforcement agency in the United Kingdom. The first is mostly concerned with policing the general public and their activities and the others are concerned with policing of more specific matters:\n\n* '''Territorial police services''', which carry out the majority of policing. There are 45 [[Territorial police force#United Kingdom|territorial police services]] {{As of|2013|lc=on}} that cover a [[police area]] (a particular region) and have an independent [[police authority]] (England and Wales) or local authority or joint [[police board]] (Scotland). The [[Police Act 1996]], the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]] and the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000]], prescribe a number of issues such as appointment of a [[chief constable]], and jurisdiction and responsibilities for police forces in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively. Since the introduction of [[Police and Crime Commissioner]]s in November 2012, the police services in England and Wales no longer have a police authority and this work is done by the police and crime prevention commissioners who are elected every four years. Certain territorial police services have units within them which have a national role, such the Specialist Operations directorate of the Metropolitan Police.\n* '''National law enforcement agencies''', including the [[National Crime Agency]] and [[British Transport Police]] (the latter only operates in Great Britain). The [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] refers to these as \"[[Special police force#United Kingdom|special police forces]]\". The National Crime Agency operates across the United Kingdom (but in Scotland or Northern Ireland requires the agreement of the domestic prosecuting authority to do so) against organised crime and acts as the UK point of contact for foreign agencies. There are also non-police law enforcement agencies whose officers, while not police constables, enforce laws such as the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] and [[HM Revenue and Customs]].\n* '''Miscellaneous police services''', mostly having their foundations in older legislation or [[common law]]. These have a responsibility to police specific local areas or activities, such as ports and parks, and before the passing of recent legislation such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 were often referred to as \"special police services\"; care must therefore be taken in interpreting historical use of that phrase. These constabularies are not within the scope of the legislation applicable to the previously mentioned organisations but can still be the subject of statutes applicable to, for example, docks, harbours or railways. Until the passing of [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]], the British Transport Police was such a force.\n\nThe [[list of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom]] details the various services.\n\n===Cross-jurisdiction powers===\nTerritorial police constables have certain powers of arrest in another one of the [[Legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom|UK's three legal jurisdictions]] than they were attested in. There are four main provisions for them to do so&nbsp;\u2013 arrest with a warrant, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in their home jurisdiction whilst in another jurisdiction, arrest without a warrant for an offence committed in another jurisdiction whilst in that jurisdiction, and mutual aid.  A fifth power of cross jurisdictional arrest was introduced by section 116 of the [[Policing and Crime Act 2017]] which fills a loop hole in arrest powers in certain situations.  This power came into force in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/227/regulation/2/made/data.htm|title=The Policing and Crime Act 2017 (Commencement No. 7) Regulations 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>  This new power allows a constable from one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  This power is in relation to more serious offences as listed in the act.  The Act sets out how long the person can be detained in custody by the 'arresting force' in one jurisdiction until constables from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction can travel to re-arrest the person and deal accordingly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>  Below is a summary of these five powers with a practical example due to the complicated nature of this area of law.  Note: this section applies to territorial police constables only, and not to others&nbsp;\u2013 except the British Transport Police, who also have [[British Transport Police#Cross-border powers|certain cross-border powers]] in addition to their natural powers.\n\n====Arrest with warrant====\nCertain warrants can be executed by constables even though they are outside their jurisdiction: [[arrest warrant]]s and [[Warrant of committal|warrants of committal]] (all); and a warrant to arrest a witness (England, Wales or Northern Ireland); a warrant for committal, a warrant to imprison (or to apprehend and imprison), and a warrant to arrest a witness (Scotland).<ref name=\"S136\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=2156203&activetextdocid=2156396 |title=section 136, Criminal Justice & Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-16}}</ref> A warrant issued in one legal jurisdiction may be executed in either of the other two jurisdictions by a constable from either the jurisdiction where it was issued, or the jurisdiction where it is executed.<ref name=\"S136\"/>\n\nWhen executing a warrant issued in Scotland, the constable executing it shall have the same powers and duties, and the person arrested the same rights, as they would have had if execution had been in Scotland by a constable of a police force in Scotland.

relatively new power was introduced by the Policing and Crime Act 2017 and came into force in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite

2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>  Until  the introduction of this power, there was an issue whereby a constable in his home jurisdiction could not arrest a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction without a warrant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/537277/Factsheet_14b_-_Cross-border_powers.pdf|title=Factsheet 14b - Policing and Crime Bill|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=}}</ref>  Practically this meant that either a warrant had to be applied for, or constables from the investigating force have to travel to the jurisdiction where the person suspected was believed to be, to arrest under the cross border powers set out above.  In urgent and serious cases this caused several issues around delay and suspects evading capture.  This new power allows a constable of one jurisdiction to arrest without warrant a person suspected of an offence in another jurisdiction whilst in their home jurisdiction.  The Act sets out which offences this power of arrest will apply to in each jurisdiction (generally serious offences), and how long the person arrested can be kept in custody, with relevant authorities, by the 'arresting force' to allow sufficient time for officers from the 'investigating force' in another jurisdiction to travel and re-arrest the detained person for the purposes of their investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/section/116?timeline=true|title=Policing and Crime Act 2017|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>\n\nAs a practical example of this power, a murder is committed in Aberdeen, Scotland.  The suspect immediately travels south over the border into England and is found by constables of [[Cumbria Police]] in Carlisle.  These constables would have a power of arrest in relation to the homicide that occurred in Scotland without the need to have a warrant.\n\n====Other situations (including Mutual Aid)====\nPolice forces often support each other with large-scale operations, such as those that require specialist skills or expertise and those that require policing levels that the host-forces cannot provide. Referred to as mutual aid, constables loaned from one force to another have the powers and privileges of a constable of the host force.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960016_en_6#pt5-pb3-l1g98 |title=section 98, Police Act 1996 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Constables from the [[Metropolitan Police]] who are on protection duties in Scotland or Northern Ireland have all the powers and privileges of a constable of the host police force.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960016_en_6#pt5-pb3-l1g99 |title=section 99, Police Act 1996 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> A constable who is taking a person to or from a [[prison]] retains all the powers, authority, protection and privileges of his office regardless of his location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=553765&ActiveTextDocId=553798 |title=section 23, Prison Act 1952 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> Regardless of where they are in the United Kingdom, a constable may arrest under section 41<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1851852&ActiveTextDocId=1851913 |title=Terrorism Act 2000 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> and may stop and search under section 43<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1851852&ActiveTextDocId=1851915 |title=Terrorism Act 2000 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2003-01-04 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] on suspicion of terrorism (defined by section 40<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1851852&ActiveTextDocId=1851912|title=Terrorism Act 2000|work=statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref>).\n\n==Powers of officers==\n\n===Territorial police constables===\n[[File:Merseyside and Metropolitan Police officers.JPG|thumb|An officer of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] with an officer of [[Merseyside Police]] during a Football match between [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] at [[Goodison Park]]]]\n[[File:Greater Manchester Police officers in Piccadilly Gardens (Manchester, England) 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Police Constables and an Inspector of [[Greater Manchester Police]] on the beat in [[Manchester city centre]] after the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final Riots]]]]\nMost police officers are members of [[territorial police forces]]. A person must make a declaration before taking up office as a constable and having any powers; although this is sometimes still known as the [[police oath]], and the process sometimes referred to as \"swearing in\", it now takes the form of an \"attestation\" (in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]) or a \"declaration\" (in [[Scotland]]). The process is carried out in the presence of a magistrate, and is usually followed by the issue of a warrant card. This grants the officer all the powers and privileges, duties and responsibilities of a constable in one of the three distinct legal systems - either England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, and the territorial waters of that country. The limited circumstances where their powers extend across the border are described in the section above.\n\n===Other constables===\nThere are many constables who are not members of territorial police forces. The most notable are members of the three forces referred to as [[special police forces]]: the [[British Transport Police]], [[Ministry of Defence Police]] and [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]]. Such officers have the \"powers and privileges of a constable\" in matters relating to their work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030020_en_3#pt3-pb3-l1g31 |title=Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 (c. 20) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Energy+Act+2004&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=913408&ActiveTextDocId=913486&filesize=6709 |title=Energy Act 2004 (c. 20) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=ministry+police+act&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=602920&ActiveTextDocId=602920&filesize=86516 |title=Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987 (c. 4) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=1987-03-05 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> BTP and MDP officers have additional jurisdiction where requested by a constable of another force, in which case they take on that constable's jurisdiction.<ref name=\"statutelaw.gov.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Anti-terrorism%2c+Crime+and+Security+Act+2001&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=267726&ActiveTextDocId=267854&filesize=5059 |title=Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c.24) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=ministry+police+act&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=602920&ActiveTextDocId=602925&filesize=3566 |title=Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987 (c. 4) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Upon request from the [[chief police officer]] of a police force, members of one of the above three forces can be given the full powers of constables in the police area of the requesting force.<ref name=\"statutelaw.gov.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Anti-terrorism%2c+Crime+and+Security+Act+2001&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=267726&ActiveTextDocId=267853&filesize=8435 |title=Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c.24) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> This was used to supplement police numbers in the areas surrounding the [[2005 G8 summit]] at Gleneagles.\n\nMany acts allow companies or councils to employ constables for a specific purpose.

As a result, they have the full powers of a constable on land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land. There are also forces created by specific legislation, such as the [[Port of Tilbury Police]] ([[Port of London Act 1968]]), [[Mersey Tunnels Police]] (County of Merseyside Act 1989) and the [[Epping Forest Keepers]] (Epping Forest Act 1878).\n\n====Parks Constables====\nUnder Article 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation (Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967, [[London Borough Council]]s are allowed to swear in council officers as constables for \"securing the observance of the provisions of all enactments relating to open spaces under their control or management and of bye-laws and regulations made thereunder\". Local Authority Parks Constables have all the powers of a constable in relation byelaws regulations and all enactments relating to open spaces, Article 19 of the Act was repealed by section 26(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Local Acts) and the power of arrest for Parks Constables is now contained in Section 24 of P.A.C.E 1984, further amendments to Article 19 covering coming to the aid and assistance of such a constable or officer were repealed by SOCPA 2005, as this provision is already covered in P.A.C.E 1984 (Legal Counsel 2007,2012).\nNo enforcement agency with a power of arrest or detention can operate outside of the provisions of P.A.C.E 1984; therefore all local powers of arrest and detention were brought into line under section 26(1) P.A.C.E 1984.\n\n===Police staff===\nPolice forces employ staff who perform many functions to assist officers and support the smooth running of their police force. They do not hold the office of constable.\nIn England & Wales, the [[chief police officer]] of a territorial police force may designate any person who is employed by the police authority maintaining that force, and is under the direction and control of that chief police officer, as one or more of the following:\n*[[Police Community Support Officer]]\n*Investigating Officer,\n*[[Custody assistant|detention officer]], or\n*Escort Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112693&filesize=53565 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\nThey have a range of powers given by the [[Police Reform Act 2002]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112842&filesize=2720 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> and their chief police officer decides which of these powers they may use. Unlike a police constable, a PCSO only has powers when on duty and in uniform, and within the area policed by their respective force.\n\nUntil 1991, parking enforcement was primarily conducted by police-employed [[traffic warden]]s. Since the passage of the Road Traffic Act 1991, [[decriminalised parking enforcement]] has enabled local authorities to take on this role and now very few forces still employ Police Traffic Wardens, these include the Metropolitan Police Service however they have combined the role with PCSOs as ''Traffic Police Community Support Officers''.\n\nIn Scotland, [[Police Custody and Security Officer]]s have powers similar to those of detention officers and escort officers in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oqps.gov.uk/legislation/acts/acts2003/asp_20030007_en_13#pt12-pb1-l1g76 |title=Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 (asp 7) |publisher=Oqps.gov.uk |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Similar powers are available in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(UK+Public+General)&title=Northern+Ireland&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=814668&ActiveTextDocId=814749&filesize=1903 |title=Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003 (c. 6) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n\n===Accredited Persons===\n[[Chief police officer]]s of territorial police forces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112697&filesize=4936 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> (and the British Transport Police<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112699&filesize=6329 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>) can also give limited powers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112884&filesize=641 |title=Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> to people not employed by the police authority, under [[Community Safety Accreditation Scheme]]s.

Because they are based on the British model of policing, these police forces conform to the standards set out by the British government, which includes voluntarily submitting themselves to inspection by the HMIC.

These officers are generally the most visible and will invariably be the first interface a member of the public has with police. In general terms these officers will normally patrol by vehicle (though also on foot or bicycle in urban areas). They will generally patrol a sub-division or whole division of a police force area or in the case of the Metropolitan Police Service, a borough. Nearly all police officers begin their careers in this area of policing, with some moving on to more specialist roles. The Metropolitan Police Service calls this area of policing 'Response Teams', whilst other forces use terms such as 'patrol', 'section' and other variations.\n* Most local areas or wards in the country have at least one police officer who is involved in trying to build links with the local community and resolve long-term problems. In London, the Metropolitan Police Service addresses this area of policing with Safer Neighbourhood Teams. This entails each political ward in London having a Police Sergeant, two police constables and a few PCSOs who are ring fenced to address problems and build community links in their respective wards. Other police forces have similar systems but can be named 'Area officers', 'Neighbourhood officers', 'Beat Constables' and a number of other variations.\n* Criminal Investigation Departments (CID) can be found in all police forces. Generally these officers deal with investigations of a more complex, serious nature, however this again can differ from force to force.  Most officers within this area are detectives. Depending on the force in question this area of policing can be further divided into a myriad of other specialist areas such as fraud.  Smaller forces tend to have detectives who deal with a wide range of varied investigations whereas detectives in larger forces can have a very specialist remit.\n* All police forces have specialist departments that deal with certain aspects of policing. Larger forces such as Greater Manchester Police, Strathclyde Police and West Midlands Police have many and varied departments and units such as traffic, firearms, marine, horse, tactical support all named differently depending on the force.  Smaller forces such Dyfed Powys Police and Warwickshire Police will have fewer specialists and will rely on cross training, such as firearms officers also being traffic trained officers. The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the country, has a large number of specialist departments, some of which are unique to the Metropolitan Police due to policing the capital and its national responsibilities. For example, the [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] and [[Counter Terrorism Command]].\n\n====Fixated Threat Assessment Centre====\n{{main|Fixated Threat Assessment Centre}}\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Fixated Threat Assessment Centre]] is a joint police/mental health unit set up in October 2006 by the [[Home Office]], the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and [[Metropolitan Police Service]] to identify and address those individuals considered to pose a threat to VIPs or the Royal Family.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1847697.ece|publisher=The Times|title=VIP 'stalker' squad set up by government|author=Joanna Bale|date=May 27, 2007 | location=London}}</ref> They may then be referred to local health services for further assessment and potential [[involuntary commitment]].

On 1 April 2007 the [[Border and Immigration Agency]] (BIA) was created and commenced operation. However, there were no police officers in the Agency, a matter that attracted considerable criticism when the Agency was established - agency officers have limited powers of arrest.  Further powers for designated officers within the Agency, including powers of detention pending the arrival of a police officer, were introduced by the UK Borders Act 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=uk+borders&parentActiveTextDocId=3419168&ActiveTextDocId=3419168&filesize=198579 |title=UK Borders Act 2007 (c. 30) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Government has effectively admitted the shortcomings of the Agency by making a number of fundamental changes within a year of its commencement.
