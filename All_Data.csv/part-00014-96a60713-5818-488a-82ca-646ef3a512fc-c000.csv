'''USS ''San Francisco'' (CA-38)''', a {{sclass-|New Orleans|cruiser}}, was the second ship of three of the [[United States Navy]] named after the city of [[San Francisco, California]]. Commissioned in 1934, she was one of the most decorated ships of [[World War II]], [[Most decorated US ships of World War II|earning 17 battle stars]].

Like most of her [[sister ship]]s, she saw extensive action during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]], including the [[Battle of Cape Esperance]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], during which she was heavily damaged and her captain and admiral killed. Earlier in the battle she mistakenly fired on the light cruiser {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|2}}, causing serious damage and inflicting numerous casualties.

Decommissioned immediately after the end of the war, she was sold for scrap in 1959.

Her [[bridge wing]]s, damaged during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and removed during repairs, are now mounted on a promontory in [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]. They are set on the [[great circle]] course from [[San Francisco]] to [[Guadalcanal]].

==Construction and commissioning==
''San Francisco'' was [[laid down]] on 9 September 1931 at the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]], [[Vallejo, California]] under the supervision of Naval constructor [[Charles W. Fisher Jr.]]; [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 9 March 1933; sponsored by Miss Barbara M. Bailly; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 10 February 1934, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Royal E. Ingersoll]] in command.

The ''New Orleans''-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.  Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch caliber main guns may be referred to as \"treaty cruisers.\" Originally classified as a [[light cruiser]] before she was laid down due to her thin armor, she was reclassified as a [[heavy cruiser]] because of her 8-inch guns. The term \"heavy cruiser\" was not defined until the [[London Naval Treaty]] in 1930.

==Inter-war period==
After an extensive shakedown cruise – which included operations off [[Mexico]], in Hawaiian waters, off [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[British Columbia]], and a voyage to the [[Panama Canal Zone]] — the cruiser returned to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Gunnery installation and conversion to a flagship took her into 1935. In February, she joined Cruiser Division 6 (Crudiv 6) at [[San Diego]]. In May, she moved north and participated in [[Fleet Problem XVI]], then returned to southern [[California]]. A few weeks later, she was back off the northwest coast for fleet tactics, and in July, she steamed farther north to [[Alaska]]. In August, she returned to California and, through the end of 1938, San Francisco continued to range the eastern Pacific, cruising from the state of Washington to [[Peru]] and from California to [[Hawaii]].

In January 1939, she departed the west coast to participate in [[Fleet Problem XX]], conducted in the Atlantic east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. In March, she became flagship of CruDiv 7 and commenced a goodwill tour of South American ports. Departing [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in early April, she called at ports on the east coast of that continent, moved through the [[Strait of Magellan]] and visited west coast ports, then in early June, transited the [[Panama Canal]] to complete her voyage around the continent.

==World War II==
On 1 September 1939, [[World War II]] started, and on 14 September, ''San Francisco'' moved south from [[Naval Station Norfolk]] to join the [[Neutrality Patrol]]. The cruiser carried freight and passengers to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], thence sailed for a patrol of the [[West Indies]] as far south as [[Trinidad]]. On 14 October, she completed her patrol back at San Juan and headed for Norfolk, where she remained into January 1940. On 11 January, she headed for Guantanamo Bay, where she was relieved as flagship by {{USS|Wichita|CA-45|2}}, where she returned to the Pacific.

Transiting the Panama Canal in late February, she called at San Pedro and, in March, continued on to her new home port, [[Pearl Harbor]], where she rejoined CruDiv 6. In May 1940, she steamed northwest to the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] for an overhaul, during which she also received four {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns. On 29 September, she returned to Pearl Harbor. In early May 1941, she became flagship of CruDiv 6; and, at the end of July, she moved east for a cruise to [[Long Beach, California]], returning to Hawaii on 27 August. In September, the flag of CruDiv 6 was hauled down; and on 11 October, ''San Francisco'' entered the [[Pearl Harbor Navy Yard]] for an overhaul which was scheduled for completion on 25 December.

===Pearl Harbor attack===
On 7 December 1941, ''San Francisco'' was in Pearl Harbor awaiting docking and the cleaning of her heavily fouled bottom. Her engineering plant was largely broken down for overhaul. Ammunition for her {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns had been placed in storage. Her {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns had been removed to permit installation of four {{convert|1.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} quadruple mounts, although the mounts had not yet been installed. Her {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]]s were being overhauled. Only small arms and two {{convert|.30|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} machine guns were available. Moreover, a number of ''San Francisco's'' officers and men were absent.

At 0755, Japanese planes began bombing dives on Battleship Row anchored near Ford Island. Off-duty signalman Ed Ifkin was relaxing on the signal bridge.  

\"I was reading the newspaper I'd just bought at the kiosk on the wharf, when an airplane buzzed over my head with that big red meatball on its side.  I was trained to recognize foreign insignia and knew right away it was Japanese.  I telephoned down to the bridge and told the duty officer.  He said, 'Ifkin you'll go on report for horsing around,' when BOOM!  The first torpedo hit (USS) ''Oklahoma''.  Our guns were down, so a bunch of us climbed over to \"New Orleans.\"  It was berthed right next us.  We spent the next two hours feeding ammunition to the gunners.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kruth |first1=Gerald |title=Remembering San Francisco |journal=personal interview with veteran |date=February 7, 2011 |volume=i |issue=i.i |page=x}}</ref>
  
Ifkin is now recognized as the first U.S.sailor to report the Japanese attack that completely shocked the American Navy and burst the nation into the World War.{cite: Kruth interview}

By 0800, the attack on Pearl Harbor was well underway. The men of San Francisco secured the ship for watertightness and began looking for opportunities to fight back. Some crossed to {{USS|New Orleans|CA-32|2}} to help man anti-aircraft batteries on that ship. Others began using available rifles and machine guns. Ammunition for {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} machine guns was transferred to {{USS|Tracy|DD-214|2}} for use.

“When the Japanese left the entire harbor was a shambles,” Iftkin recalled. “The fires; the oil in the water from the torpedoed ships .  .  . the “Arizona” burned for two days.”

''San Francisco'' was not bombed or damaged during the Japanese air raid. After the attack was over, work resumed to make ''San Francisco'' seaworthy and combat-ready.

On 14 December, the cruiser left the yard; the scaling of her keel had been postponed in favor of more necessary repairs on other ships. On 16 December, she sortied with Task Force 14 (TF 14) to relieve [[Wake Island]]. The force moved west with a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] squadron onboard {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and a Marine [[battalion]] embarked in {{USS|Tangier|AV-8|2}}. However, when Wake Island fell to the Japanese on 23 December, TF 14 was diverted to [[Midway Atoll]] which it reinforced. On 29 December, the force returned to Pearl Harbor.

===1942===
On 8 January 1942, ''San Francisco'' again moved west. In TF 8, she steamed toward [[Samoa]] to rendezvous with, and cover the off-loading of, transports carrying reinforcements to [[Tutuila]], Samoa. There, she joined [[Task Force 17]] for raids on Japanese installations in the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert]] and [[Marshall Islands]]. ''San Francisco'' arrived in the Samoan area on 18 January, and on the 24th was detached to continue coverage for the transports while the remainder of the task force and TF 17 conducted offensive operations to the northwest.

On 8 February, ''San Francisco'' departed from Tutuila. On the 10th, she rejoined CruDiv 6, then in TF 11, and she set a course for an area northeast of the [[Solomon Islands]] to strike [[Rabaul]]. However, the American force was sighted and attacked by two waves of [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" [[medium bomber]]s. Sixteen of the planes were destroyed, but since the element of surprise had been lost, TF 11 retired eastward.

During the next few days, TF 11 – centered around {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} — conducted operations in the [[South Pacific Area]], then headed for [[New Guinea]] to participate with TF 17 in a raid against Japanese shipping and installations.

On 7 March, one of ''San Francisco''{{'}}s scout planes was reported missing and could not be found.

On the night of 9–10 March, TFs 11 and 17 entered the [[Gulf of Papua]], whence, at dawn, ''Lexington'' and {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} launched their aircraft to cross the [[Owen Stanley Range]] and attack the Japanese at [[Salamaua]] and [[Lae]].

The next day, the missing plane was sighted by {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}} and recovered by ''San Francisco''. It had landed on the water, but had been unable to communicate. The pilot, [[Lieutenant]] J. A. Thomas, and the radioman, O. J. Gannan, had headed for [[Australia]], sailing the plane backwards as it tended to head into the prevailing east wind. In five days and 21 hours, they had covered approximately 385 miles (715&nbsp;km) on a course within 5 degrees of that intended.

''San Francisco'' returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 March. On 22 April, the cruiser departed [[Oahu]] for San Francisco in the escort of convoy 4093. At the end of May, she headed west, escorting convoy PW 2076, made up of transports carrying the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Army Division]], destined for [[Suva]], and special troops bound for Australia. The cruiser remained in the escort force as far as [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. There she steamed for Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 29 June.

''San Francisco'' steamed west with {{USS|Laffey|DD-459|2}} and {{USS|Ballard|DD-267|2}} to escort convoy 4120 to the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. From there, she got underway to rendezvous with the Solomon Islands Expeditionary Force.

[[Operation Watchtower]] — the [[Guadalcanal]]-[[Tulagi]] offensive – opened on the morning of 7 August. Through that day and the remainder of the month, ''San Francisco'' helped to cover the American forces in the area. The flag of [[Rear admiral#United States|Rear Admiral]] [[Norman Scott (admiral)|Norman Scott]], commanding the cruisers attached to TF 18, was shifted to ''San Francisco''.

On 3 September, ''San Francisco''{{'}}s force put into [[Nouméa]], [[New Caledonia]], for fuel and provisions. On 8 September, the ships departed that island to cover reinforcements moving up to Guadalcanal. On the 11th, ''San Francisco''{{'}}s force, TF 18, rendezvoused with TF 17, the {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} group, and the next day, both groups refueled at sea. On 14 September, the reinforcement convoy departed the [[New Hebrides]]. TF 61 commenced covering operations with TF 17, operating east of TF 18 and conforming to their movements.

At about 1450 on 15 September, {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}} was torpedoed on the starboard side. Fires broke out on the carrier. Explosions multiplied the fires. Admiral Scott took command of TF 18. ''San Francisco'' and {{USS|Salt Lake City|CA-25|2}} prepared to take the carrier in tow, but by 1520, the fires were out of control and destroyers began taking on survivors. {{USS|Lansdowne|DD-486|2}} torpedoed the burning hulk. TF 18 then headed for [[Espiritu Santo]].

On the morning of 17 September, ''San Francisco'', {{USS|Juneau|CL-52|2}}, and five destroyers put back to sea to rendezvous with TF 17 and resume coverage of reinforcement convoys. Other units of TF 18 had headed for Nouméa with ''Wasp'' survivors.

On 23 September, ''San Francisco'', ''Salt Lake City'', ''Minneapolis'', {{USS|Chester|CA-27|2}}, {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}}, and {{USS|Helena|CL-50|2}}, and Destroyer Squadron 12 (DesRon 12) became TF 64, a surface screening and attack force under the command of Admiral Scott in ''San Francisco''. The next day, the force headed to the New Hebrides.

====Battle of Cape Esperance====
{{main|Battle of Cape Esperance}}
On 7 October 1942, TF 64 (minus ''Chester'' and ''Minneapolis'') departed from Espiritu Santo, the New Hebrides, and moved back into the Solomons to cover Allied reinforcements and to intercept similar operations by the Japanese. On 11 October, at about 1615, the ships commenced a run northward from Rennel Island, to intercept an enemy force of two cruisers and six destroyers reported heading for Guadalcanal from the Buin-Faisi, [[Bougainville Island]] area. The force continued north to approach [[Savo Island]] in [[The Slot]] from the southwest.

By 2330, when the warships were approximately {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Savo Island, they turned to make a further search of the area. A few minutes after setting the new course, radar indicated unidentified ships to the west, several thousand yards distant. At about 2345, the Battle of Cape Esperance began.

Initial confusion caused both sides to momentarily check their fire in fear of hitting their own ships. Then, the battle was reopened and continued until 0020 on 12 October, when surviving Japanese ships retired toward the [[Shortland Islands]]. ''Salt Lake City'', ''Boise'', {{USS|Duncan|DD-485|2}} and {{USS|Farenholt|DD-491|2}}, had been damaged. Later, ''Duncan'' went down. {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Furutaka||2}} and a destroyer had been sunk during the surface action. Two more enemy destroyers were sunk on 12 October by Marine planes from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. After the engagement, TF 64 retired to Espiritu Santo.

On 15 October, ''San Francisco'' resumed operations in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. On the evening of 20 October, her group was ordered back to Espiritu Santo. At 2119, submarine's torpedoes were reported. ''Chester'' was hit amidships on the starboard side but continued under her own power. Three other torpedoes exploded: one off ''Helena''{{'}}s starboard quarter; a second between ''Helena'' and ''San Francisco''; and the third about {{convert|1200|yd|m|abbr=on}} off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s port beam. Two others were sighted running on the surface.

''San Francisco'' reached Espiritu Santo on the night of 21 October, but departed again on 22 October to intercept any enemy surface units approaching Guadalcanal from the north and to cover friendly reinforcements. On 28 October, Admiral Scott transferred to ''Atlanta''. The next day, ''San Francisco'' returned to Espiritu Santo, and on 30 October, Rear Admiral [[Daniel J. Callaghan]], the commanding officer of ''San Francisco'' when the United States entered the war, returned to the ship and raised his flag as Commander, Task Group 64.4 (TG 64.4) and prospective TF 65.

====Naval Battle of Guadalcanal====
{{main|Naval Battle of Guadalcanal}}
On 31 October 1942, the newly designated TF 65 departed from Espiritu Santo, the ships again headed into the Solomon Islands to cover troop landings on Guadalcanal. Bombardment missions in the [[Kokumbona]] and [[Koli Point]] areas followed. On 6 November, the transport group completed unloading, and the force retired, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 8 November. On 10 November, ''San Francisco'', now flagship for TG 67.4, got underway again toward Guadalcanal.

Just before noon, a Japanese twin-float reconnaissance plane began shadowing the formation.

The force arrived off [[Lunga Point]] on 12 November, and the transports commenced unloading. By mid-afternoon, an approaching Japanese air group was reported. At 1318, the ships got underway. At 1408, 21 enemy planes attacked.

[[File:Japanes air attack on shipping off Guadalcanal, 12 November 1942.jpg|thumb|''San Francisco'' (center) after being hit by a Japanese plane in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 12 November 1942. Ship at left is {{USS|President Jackson|AP-37|2}}.]]

At 1416, an already-damaged [[torpedo bomber]] dropped its torpedo off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s starboard quarter. The torpedo passed alongside, but the plane crashed into ''San Francisco''{{'}}s control aft, swung around that structure, and plunged over the port side into the sea. 15 men were killed, 29 wounded, and one missing. Control aft was demolished. The ship's secondary command post, Battle Two, was burned out but was reestablished by dark. The after anti-aircraft director and radar were put out of commission. Three 20&nbsp;mm mounts were destroyed.

The wounded were transferred to {{USS|President Jackson|AP-37|2}}, just before the approach of an enemy surface force was reported. The covering force escorted the transports out of the area, then reassembled and returned. At about midnight, ''San Francisco'', in company with heavy cruiser USS ''Portland'', the light cruisers ''Atlanta'', ''Helena'', and ''Juneau'', and eight destroyers, entered [[Lengo Channel]].

At 0125 on 13 November, a Japanese naval force was discovered about {{convert|27000|yd|m|abbr=on}} to the northwest. Rear Admiral Callaghan's task group maneuvered to intercept in what became the first engagement in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. At 0148, in almost pitch darkness, ''San Francisco'' opened fire on an enemy cruiser {{convert|3700|yd|m|abbr=on}} off her starboard beam. At 0151, she trained her guns on a small cruiser or large destroyer {{convert|3300|yd|m|abbr=on}} off her starboard bow. Then in an attempt to locate other targets, ''San Francisco'' accidentally targeted {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|2}}. ''San Francisco''{{'}}s gunfire caused extensive damage to ''Atlanta'', killing Admiral Scott and most of ''Atlanta''{{'}}s bridge crew. Belatedly, ''San Francisco'' realized she was firing on a \"friendly\" ship and ceased fire. The green dye that ''San Francisco'' used to distinguish her shells from those of other ships, was later found stained on ''Atlanta''{{'}}s superstructure before she sank. Shortly thereafter, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} was sighted and taken under fire, at an initial range of only {{convert|2200|yd|m|abbr=on}}.

At about 0200, ''San Francisco'' trained her guns on {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}. At the same time, she became the target of {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nagara||2}} off her starboard bow and of a destroyer which had crossed her bow and was passing down her port side. The enemy battleship joined the cruiser and the destroyer in firing on ''San Francisco'' whose port {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} battery engaged the destroyer but was put out of action except for one mount. The battleship put the starboard {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} battery out of commission. ''San Francisco'' swung left while her main battery continued to fire on the battleships which, with the cruiser and the destroyer, continued to pound ''San Francisco''. A direct hit on the navigation bridge killed or badly wounded all officers, except for the communications officer, [[Lieutenant Commander#United States|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Bruce McCandless]].<ref>{{cite video

}}</ref> Command fell to the damage control officer, Lieutenant Commander [[Herbert E. Schonland]], but he thought his own efforts were needed to keep the ship \"afloat and right-side up\", so he ordered McCandless to stay at the [[conn (nautical)|conn]]. Steering and engine control were lost and shifted to Battle Two. Battle Two was out of commission by a direct hit from the port side. Control was again lost.

Control was reestablished in the [[conning tower]], which soon received a hit from the [[starboard]] side. Steering and engine control were temporarily lost, then regained. All communications were now dead.

Soon thereafter, the enemy ceased firing. ''San Francisco'' followed suit and withdrew eastward along the north coast of Guadalcanal.

Seventy-seven sailors, including Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan and Captain [[Cassin Young]], had been killed. Captain Young, like the ''San Francisco'', was a veteran of the Pearl Harbor attack. 105 had been wounded. Of seven missing, three were subsequently rescued. The ship had taken 45 hits. Structural damage was extensive, but not fatal. No hits had been received below the waterline. Twenty-two fires had been started and extinguished.

At about 0400, ''San Francisco'', all her compasses out of commission, joined ''Helena'' and ''Juneau'' and followed them through [[Sealark Channel]] to sail to Espiritu Santo for initial repairs.

At about 1000, ''Juneau''{{'}}s medical personnel transferred to ''San Francisco'' to assist in treating the numerous wounded. An hour later, ''Juneau'' took a torpedo on her port side from {{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-26||2}}, striking in the vicinity of the bridge. \"The entire ship seemed to explode in one mighty column of brown and white smoke and flame which rose easily a thousand feet in the air. The ''Juneau'' literally disintegrated.\" ''San Francisco'' was hit by several large fragments from ''Juneau''. One man was hit, both his legs were broken. Nothing was seen in the water after the smoke lifted. The surviving ships were ordered to keep going without stopping to look for survivors. Unfortunately, the 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 697) of ''Juneau'' were forced to wait eight days for rescue while floating in the ocean, undergoing intense [[shark]] attacks. Only ten survived.

On the afternoon of 14 November, ''San Francisco'' returned towards Espiritu Santo. For her participation in the action of the morning of the 13th, and for that of the night of 11–12 October, she received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]]. On 18 November, the cruiser sailed for Nouméa, and, on 23 November, she got underway toward the United States. She reached San Francisco on 11 December. Three days later, repairs were begun at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]].

===1943–1944===
During the yard period to repair battle damage, ''San Francisco'' received a general modernization similar to other US cruisers.  Her forward superstructure was remodeled, with the bridge wings cut back, and most of the bridge windows either plated over or replaced by portholes.  A large open bridge was built out at the 02 level, and modern SG surface search radar and air search radars added.  In addition many 20mm and 40mm anti-aircraft cannons were installed.  On 26 February 1943, she got underway to return to the South Pacific. After escorting convoy PW 2211 ''en route'', ''San Francisco'' arrived at Nouméa on 20 March. Five days later, she continued on to [[Efate]]. She arrived back in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in mid-April. She then headed north to the [[Aleutian Islands]] to join the [[North Pacific Force]], TF 16, and reached Alaska toward the end of the month. Based at [[Kuluk Bay]], [[Adak Island]], she operated in the Aleutians for the next 4½ months. She patrolled the western approaches to the area; participated in the [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands|assault and occupation of Attu]] in May and of [[Kiska]] in July; and performed escort duties.
[[File:USS San Francisco (CA-38) in Kuluk Bay, Adak Island, April 1943.jpg|thumb|left|''San Francisco'' off Adak Island in April 1943]]

In mid-September, she was ordered back to Pearl Harbor for repairs and reassignment to TF 14. On 29 September, ''San Francisco'' departed Pearl Harbor in Task Unit 14.2.1 (TU 14.2.1) for a raid against Wake Island. On 5 October, the group arrived off the target area and conducted two runs by the enemy positions. On 11 October, her task unit returned to Pearl Harbor.

On 20 November, the force arrived off [[Butaritari|Makin]]. ''San Francisco'' participated in the pre-invasion bombardment of [[Betio]], then patrolled outside the transport area to the west of Makin. On the 26th, she was detached and assigned to TG 50.1, joining {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}}, {{USS|Cowpens|CVL-25|2}}, five cruisers, and six destroyers. With that force, she steamed toward the Marshall Islands to strike Japanese shipping and installations in the [[Kwajalein]] area. On 4 December, the carriers launched their planes against the targets. Shortly after noon, enemy aerial activity increased, and at 1250, ''San Francisco'' came under attack. Three torpedo bombers closed her on the port bow. Her guns \"splashed\" two. The third was shot down by ''Yorktown''. But during the attack, the cruiser had been strafed several times. One man had been killed, and 22 were wounded. After dark, the Japanese returned, and on that night, ''Lexington'' was torpedoed. The force moved north and west. Shortly after 0130 on 5 December, enemy planes faded from the radar screens. The next day, the ships headed back to Pearl Harbor.

On 22 January 1944, ''San Francisco'' sortied with TF 52 and again headed for the Marshalls. On 29 January, the division, screened by destroyers, left the formation and moved against Japanese installations on [[Maloelap]] to neutralize them during the [[Battle of Kwajalein|conquest of Kwajalein]]. Following the bombardment, the ships proceeded on to Kwajalein. ''San Francisco'' arrived off the atoll at about 0630 on 31 January. At 0730, she opened fire on targets of opportunity, initially a small ship inside Kwajalein lagoon. At 0849, she ceased firing. At 0900, she resumed firing at targets on Berlin and Beverly islands. Through the day, she continued to shell those islands, and, in late afternoon, added Bennett Island to her targets. During the next week, she provided pre-landing barrages and support fire for operations against Burton, Berlin, and Beverly islands. On 8 February, the cruiser sailed for [[Majuro]], whence she would operate as a unit of TF 58, the [[fast carrier task force]].

On 12 February, ''San Francisco'', in TG 58.2, cleared Majuro lagoon. Four days later, the carriers launched their planes as part of [[Operation Hailstone]]. On the night of 16–17 February, {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}} was torpedoed. ''San Francisco'', with others, was assigned to escort her eastward. On 19 February, the group split; ''Intrepid'', with two destroyers, continued toward Pearl Harbor, while ''San Francisco'' and the remaining ships headed for Majuro. On 25 February, ''San Francisco'' sailed for Hawaii with TG 58.2. On 20 March, the group returned to Majuro, refueled, and departed again on 22 March to move against the Western [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]]. From 30 March to 1 April, carrier planes hit the [[Palaus]] and [[Woleai]]. ''San Francisco''{{'}}s planes flew rescue missions.

On 6 April, the force was back in Majuro lagoon. A week later, the ships set a course for New Guinea. From 21–28 April, TG 58.2 supported the assault landings in the [[Jayapura|Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)]] area. On 29 April, the ships moved back into the Carolines for another raid against [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]]. On 30 April, ''San Francisco'' was detached and, with eight other cruisers, moved against [[Satawan]]. On completion of that bombardment mission, the cruisers rejoined TG 58.2 and headed back to the Marshalls.

Initially at Majuro, ''San Francisco'' shifted to Kwajalein in early June, and on 10 June, departed that atoll in TG 53.15, the bombardment group of the [[Saipan]] invasion force. On 14 June, she commenced two days of shelling [[Tinian]], and after the [[Battle of Saipan|landings on Saipan]] shifted to fire support duties. On 16 June, she temporarily joined CruDiv 9 to bombard [[Guam]]. Word of a Japanese force en route to Saipan, however, interrupted the cannonade, and the ships returned to Saipan.

On 17 June, ''San Francisco'' refueled and took up station between the approaching enemy force and the amphibious force at Saipan. On the morning of 19 June, the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] opened for ''San Francisco''. At about 1046, she was straddled fore and aft by bombs. \"... a mass of enemy planes on the screen at {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}}.\" At 1126, the cruiser opened fire. A 40&nbsp;mm shell from ''Indianapolis'' set off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s smoke screen generators. By noon, quiet had returned. At 1424, dive bombers made the last Japanese attack. By 20 June, ''San Francisco'' steamed westward in pursuit of the Japanese force. The next day, she returned to the Saipan area and resumed operations with the covering force for the transports. On 8 July, ''San Francisco'' again steamed to Guam to bombard enemy positions. During the next four days, she shelled targets in the [[Agat, Guam|Agat]] and [[Agana]] areas. On 12 July, she returned to Saipan to replenish and refuel, and on 18 July, again took station off Guam.

From 18–20 July, she shelled enemy positions, supported [[underwater demolition team|beach demolition units]], and provided night harassing and defense repair interdiction in the Agat and Faci Point areas. On 21 July, she began to support Marines assaulting the Agat beaches. On 24 July, the cruiser shifted her fire to [[Orote Point]].

On 30 July, she headed, via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, for San Francisco. The cruiser arrived back on the west coast on 16 August for overhaul.

On 31 October, she steamed west again, and on 21 November arrived at [[Ulithi]], where she resumed flagship duties for CruDiv 6. On 10 December, she cleared the anchorage and moved toward the [[Philippines]] in TG 38.1. On 14–15 December, during carrier strikes against [[Luzon]], ''San Francisco''{{'}}s planes were employed on antisubmarine patrol and in rescue work. On 16 December, the force headed for a rendezvous with TG 30.17, the replenishment force. A [[typhoon]] interrupted the refueling operations; and the ships rode out the storm for the next two days. On 19 December, she participated in a search for survivors from three destroyers which had gone down during the typhoon.

On 20 December, TF 38 turned westward again to resume operations against Luzon; but high seas precluded strikes. On 24 December, the force returned to Ulithi.

===1945===
Six days later, the force again sortied from Ulithi. On 2–3 January 1945, strikes were conducted against [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. From 5–7 January, Luzon was hit. On 9 January, fighter sweeps against Formosa were resumed. The force then headed for the [[Bashi Channel]] and a [[South China Sea raid|five-day, high-speed strike]] against enemy surface units in the [[South China Sea]] and against installations along the coast of [[Indochina]]. On 15–16 January, the [[Hong Kong]]-[[Amoy]]-[[Shantou|Swatow]] area was hit, and on 20 January, the force passed through [[Luzon Strait]] to resume operations against Formosa. On 21 January, aerial opposition was constant. Bogies appeared on the screen throughout the day. {{USS|Langley|CVL-27|2}} and {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|2}} were hit. On 22 January, strikes were launched against the [[Ryukyu Islands]], and the next day, the force headed for the Western Carolines.

Arriving on 26 January, the ships sailed again on 10 February. On 16–17 February, strikes were conducted against air facilities in central [[Honshū]]. On 18 February, the force moved toward the [[Volcano Islands|Volcano]] and [[Bonin Islands]], and on 19 February, covering operations for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima assault]] began. The next day, ''San Francisco'' closed on [[Iwo Jima]] with other cruisers and assumed fire support duties, which she continued until 23 February. Then she headed back toward [[Japan]]. On 25 February, [[Tokyo]] was the target. Poor weather prohibited operations against [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya]] on the following day, and on 27 February, the force headed back to Ulithi.

On 21 March, ''San Francisco'', now attached to [[Okinawa naval order of battle#Gunfire and Covering Force (Task Force 54)|Task Force 54]] (TF 54) for [[Battle of Okinawa|the invasion of Okinawa]], departed Ulithi for the Ryukyus. On 25 March, she approached [[Kerama Retto]], west of [[Okinawa]], and furnished fire support for [[Naval mine|mine]]sweeping and underwater demolition operations. That night, she retired and the next morning moved back in to support the landings and supply counter battery fire on [[Aka Island|Aka]], [[Geruma Island|Keruma]], [[Zamami Island|Zamami]], and [[Yakabi Shima|Yakabi Island]]s.

By the morning of 27 March, aerial resistance had begun. The next day, ''San Francisco'' shifted to Okinawa for shore bombardment in preparation for the assault landings scheduled for 1 April. On that day, she took up station in fire support sector 5, west of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]], and, for the next five days, shelled enemy emplacements, caves, [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillbox]]es, road junctions, and tanks, truck, and troop concentrations. At night, she provided harassing fire near the beachhead.

On 6 April, the cruiser retired to Kerama Retto, refueled and took on ammunition, assisted in splashing a [[Nakajima B6N]] \"Jill\" torpedo bomber, then rejoined TF 54 off Okinawa as that force underwent another air raid. ''San Francisco'' downed a [[Nakajima B5N]] \"Kate\" torpedo bomber. Dawn of 7 April brought another air raid, during which a ''[[kamikaze]]'' attempted to crash the cruiser. It was splashed {{convert|50|yd|m|abbr=on}} off the starboard bow. After the raid, ''San Francisco'' shifted to TF 51 for fire support missions on the east coast of Okinawa, rejoining TF 54 on the west coast in late afternoon. On 11 April, air attacks increased, and the next day, ''San Francisco'' set an [[Aichi D3A]] \"Val\" [[dive bomber]] on fire. The plane then glanced off a merchant ship and hit the water, enveloped in flames.

On 13–14 April, the cruiser again operated with TF 51 off the east coast of the embattled island. The next day, she returned to Kerama Retto, there proceeding to Okinawa and operations with TF 54 in the transport area. There she provided night illumination to detect swimmers and [[Shinyo (suicide boat)|''Shinyo'' suicide boat]]s, and just before midnight assisted in sinking one of the latter. During the night, two further attempts by ''Shinyo''s to close the transports were thwarted.

With dawn, ''San Francisco'' returned to the Naha area to shell the airfield there. On 17 April, she moved up the coast and fired on the [[Machinate air field]]. The next day, she again shifted to the eastern side of the island and, that night, anchored in [[Nakagusuku Wan]]. The next day, ''San Francisco'' supported troops in the southern part of the island. From 21–24 April, she shelled targets in the Naha airstrip area; and got underway for Ulithi.

On 13 May, ''San Francisco'' returned to Okinawa, arriving in Nakagusuku Wan and resuming support activities against targets in southern Okinawa. For the next few days, ''San Francisco'' supported the [[96th Infantry Division (United States)|96th Infantry Division]] in an area to the southeast of [[Yonabaru, Okinawa|Yonabaru]]. On 20 May, she shifted to [[Kutaka Shima]], and by the night of 22 May, she had depleted her supply of ammunition for her main batteries. On 25 May, the Japanese launched a large air attack against Allied shipping in Nakagusuku Wan. On 27 May, ''San Francisco'' provided fire support for the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]], and retired to Kerama Retto the next day. On 30 May, the cruiser returned to the western side of Okinawa and, for the next two weeks, supported operations of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st]] and [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Divisions]].

On 21 June, ''San Francisco'' was ordered to join TG 32.15, {{convert|120|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Okinawa. A week later, she put into Kerama Retto for a brief stay, then rejoined that group. In early July, she provided cover for the eastern anchorage. On 3 July, she sailed toward the Philippines to prepare for an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese home islands]]. The cessation of hostilities in mid-August, however, obviated that operation, and ''San Francisco'' prepared for occupation duty.

Between 7 December 1941 and 7 October 1945, ''San Francisco'' travelled 480,000 km and burned 114,478,423 litres of fuel oil. On her voyages, she crossed the equator 24 times and the international date line 33 times. Her guns fired 11,022 203mm shells, 24,191 127mm shells, 70,243 40mm shells and 73,904 20mm shells and her crew suffered 267 combat casualties. Her planes flew for 3,714 hours. The crew consumed 3,983,712 kg of edible provisions, ate 332,937 kg of beef, ate 925,328 kg of potatoes, ate 5,760,000 slices of bread and smoked 1,838,780 packs of cigarettes.<ref>U.S. Navy statistics [https://www.navysite.de/cruisebooks/ca38-45/078.htm] from the [https://www.navysite.de/cruisebooks/ca38-45/index_003.htm USS ''San Francisco'' (CA-38) World War II cruise book] available at [http://navysite.de/cruisebooks/index.html Navysite.de]</ref>

==Post-war==
On 28 August 1945, the cruiser departed [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] for the [[China]] coast. After a show of force in the [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Bohai Sea|Gulf of Pohai]] areas, she covered minesweeping operations, and on 8 October anchored at [[Inchon, Korea]]. From 13–16 October, she participated in another show of force operation in the Gulf of Pohai area, then returned to Inchon, where Rear Admiral [[Jerauld Wright]], Commander, CruDiv 6, acted as senior member of the committee for the surrender of Japanese naval forces in [[Korea]].

On 27 November, ''San Francisco'' headed home. Arriving at San Francisco in mid-December, she continued on to the east coast on 5 January 1946, and arrived at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] for inactivation on 19 January. Decommissioned on 10 February, she was berthed with the Philadelphia Group of the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] until 1 March 1959, when her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. On 9 September, she was sold to the Union Mineral and Alloys Corp., New York, and scrapped at [[Panama City, Florida]] in 1961.

==War memorials==
{{Main|USS San Francisco Memorial}}
[[File:3852 Bridge (33734921503).jpg|thumb|right|Removed bridge wings at Lands End]]
During the December 1942 repair at Mare Island, it was necessary to extensively rebuild the bridge. The bridge wings were removed as part of that repair, and are now part of a memorial to the ship on a promontory in [[Lands End, San Francisco]] at [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] overlooking the Pacific Ocean. One wing has extensive battle damage from the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. They are set on the [[great circle]] course from [[San Francisco]] to Guadalcanal. The old [[ship's bell]] is housed at the [[Marines Memorial Club]] in San Francisco.

'''USS ''San Francisco'' (CA-38)''', a {{sclass-|New Orleans|cruiser}}, was the second ship of three of the [[United States Navy]] named after the city of [[San Francisco, California]]. Commissioned in 1934, she was one of the most decorated ships of [[World War II]], [[Most decorated US ships of World War II|earning 17 battle stars]].

Like most of her [[sister ship]]s, she saw extensive action during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]], including the [[Battle of Cape Esperance]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], during which she was heavily damaged and her captain and admiral killed. Earlier in the battle she mistakenly fired on the light cruiser {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|2}}, causing serious damage and inflicting numerous casualties.

Decommissioned immediately after the end of the war, she was sold for scrap in 1959.

Her [[bridge wing]]s, damaged during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and removed during repairs, are now mounted on a promontory in [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]. They are set on the [[great circle]] course from [[San Francisco]] to [[Guadalcanal]].

==Construction and commissioning==
''San Francisco'' was [[laid down]] on 9 September 1931 at the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]], [[Vallejo, California]] under the supervision of Naval constructor [[Charles W. Fisher Jr.]]; [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 9 March 1933; sponsored by Miss Barbara M. Bailly; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 10 February 1934, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Royal E. Ingersoll]] in command.

The ''New Orleans''-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.  Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch caliber main guns may be referred to as \"treaty cruisers.\" Originally classified as a [[light cruiser]] before she was laid down due to her thin armor, she was reclassified as a [[heavy cruiser]] because of her 8-inch guns. The term \"heavy cruiser\" was not defined until the [[London Naval Treaty]] in 1930.

==Inter-war period==
After an extensive shakedown cruise – which included operations off [[Mexico]], in Hawaiian waters, off [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[British Columbia]], and a voyage to the [[Panama Canal Zone]] — the cruiser returned to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Gunnery installation and conversion to a flagship took her into 1935. In February, she joined Cruiser Division 6 (Crudiv 6) at [[San Diego]]. In May, she moved north and participated in [[Fleet Problem XVI]], then returned to southern [[California]]. A few weeks later, she was back off the northwest coast for fleet tactics, and in July, she steamed farther north to [[Alaska]]. In August, she returned to California and, through the end of 1938, San Francisco continued to range the eastern Pacific, cruising from the state of Washington to [[Peru]] and from California to [[Hawaii]].

In January 1939, she departed the west coast to participate in [[Fleet Problem XX]], conducted in the Atlantic east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. In March, she became flagship of CruDiv 7 and commenced a goodwill tour of South American ports. Departing [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in early April, she called at ports on the east coast of that continent, moved through the [[Strait of Magellan]] and visited west coast ports, then in early June, transited the [[Panama Canal]] to complete her voyage around the continent.

==World War II==
On 1 September 1939, [[World War II]] started, and on 14 September, ''San Francisco'' moved south from [[Naval Station Norfolk]] to join the [[Neutrality Patrol]]. The cruiser carried freight and passengers to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], thence sailed for a patrol of the [[West Indies]] as far south as [[Trinidad]]. On 14 October, she completed her patrol back at San Juan and headed for Norfolk, where she remained into January 1940. On 11 January, she headed for Guantanamo Bay, where she was relieved as flagship by {{USS|Wichita|CA-45|2}}, where she returned to the Pacific.

Transiting the Panama Canal in late February, she called at San Pedro and, in March, continued on to her new home port, [[Pearl Harbor]], where she rejoined CruDiv 6. In May 1940, she steamed northwest to the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] for an overhaul, during which she also received four {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns. On 29 September, she returned to Pearl Harbor. In early May 1941, she became flagship of CruDiv 6; and, at the end of July, she moved east for a cruise to [[Long Beach, California]], returning to Hawaii on 27 August. In September, the flag of CruDiv 6 was hauled down; and on 11 October, ''San Francisco'' entered the [[Pearl Harbor Navy Yard]] for an overhaul which was scheduled for completion on 25 December.

===Pearl Harbor attack===
On 7 December 1941, ''San Francisco'' was in Pearl Harbor and was awaiting docking and the cleaning of her heavily fouled bottom. Her engineering plant was largely broken down for overhaul. Ammunition for her {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns had been placed in storage. Her {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns had been removed to permit installation of four {{convert|1.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} quadruple mounts, although the mounts had not yet been installed. Her {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]]s were being overhauled. Only small arms and two {{convert|.30|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} machine guns were available. Moreover, a number of ''San Francisco''{{'}}s officers and men were absent.

At 0755, Japanese planes began bombing dives on [[Ford Island]], and by 0800, the surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was well underway. The men in ''San Francisco'' secured the ship for watertightness and began looking for opportunities to fight back. Some crossed to {{USS|New Orleans|CA-32|2}} to help man anti-aircraft batteries on that ship. Others began using available rifles and machine guns. Ammunition for {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} machine guns was transferred to {{USS|Tracy|DD-214|2}} for use.

''San Francisco'' was not bombed or damaged during the Japanese air raid. After the attack was over, work resumed to make ''San Francisco'' seaworthy and combat-ready.

On 14 December, the cruiser left the yard; the scaling of her keel had been postponed in favor of more necessary repairs on other ships. On 16 December, she sortied with Task Force 14 (TF 14) to relieve [[Wake Island]]. The force moved west with a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] squadron onboard {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and a Marine [[battalion]] embarked in {{USS|Tangier|AV-8|2}}. However, when Wake Island fell to the Japanese on 23 December, TF 14 was diverted to [[Midway Atoll]] which it reinforced. On 29 December, the force returned to Pearl Harbor.

===1942===
On 8 January 1942, ''San Francisco'' again moved west. In TF 8, she steamed toward [[Samoa]] to rendezvous with, and cover the off-loading of, transports carrying reinforcements to [[Tutuila]], Samoa. There, she joined [[Task Force 17]] for raids on Japanese installations in the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert]] and [[Marshall Islands]]. ''San Francisco'' arrived in the Samoan area on 18 January, and on the 24th was detached to continue coverage for the transports while the remainder of the task force and TF 17 conducted offensive operations to the northwest.

On 8 February, ''San Francisco'' departed from Tutuila. On the 10th, she rejoined CruDiv 6, then in TF 11, and she set a course for an area northeast of the [[Solomon Islands]] to strike [[Rabaul]]. However, the American force was sighted and attacked by two waves of [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" [[medium bomber]]s. Sixteen of the planes were destroyed, but since the element of surprise had been lost, TF 11 retired eastward.

During the next few days, TF 11 – centered around {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} — conducted operations in the [[South Pacific Area]], then headed for [[New Guinea]] to participate with TF 17 in a raid against Japanese shipping and installations.

On 7 March, one of ''San Francisco''{{'}}s scout planes was reported missing and could not be found.

On the night of 9–10 March, TFs 11 and 17 entered the [[Gulf of Papua]], whence, at dawn, ''Lexington'' and {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} launched their aircraft to cross the [[Owen Stanley Range]] and attack the Japanese at [[Salamaua]] and [[Lae]].

The next day, the missing plane was sighted by {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}} and recovered by ''San Francisco''. It had landed on the water, but had been unable to communicate. The pilot, [[Lieutenant]] J. A. Thomas, and the radioman, O. J. Gannan, had headed for [[Australia]], sailing the plane backwards as it tended to head into the prevailing east wind. In five days and 21 hours, they had covered approximately 385 miles (715&nbsp;km) on a course within 5 degrees of that intended.

''San Francisco'' returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 March. On 22 April, the cruiser departed [[Oahu]] for San Francisco in the escort of convoy 4093. At the end of May, she headed west, escorting convoy PW 2076, made up of transports carrying the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Army Division]], destined for [[Suva]], and special troops bound for Australia. The cruiser remained in the escort force as far as [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. There she steamed for Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 29 June.

''San Francisco'' steamed west with {{USS|Laffey|DD-459|2}} and {{USS|Ballard|DD-267|2}} to escort convoy 4120 to the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. From there, she got underway to rendezvous with the Solomon Islands Expeditionary Force.

[[Operation Watchtower]] — the [[Guadalcanal]]-[[Tulagi]] offensive – opened on the morning of 7 August. Through that day and the remainder of the month, ''San Francisco'' helped to cover the American forces in the area. The flag of [[Rear admiral#United States|Rear Admiral]] [[Norman Scott (admiral)|Norman Scott]], commanding the cruisers attached to TF 18, was shifted to ''San Francisco''.

On 3 September, ''San Francisco''{{'}}s force put into [[Nouméa]], [[New Caledonia]], for fuel and provisions. On 8 September, the ships departed that island to cover reinforcements moving up to Guadalcanal. On the 11th, ''San Francisco''{{'}}s force, TF 18, rendezvoused with TF 17, the {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} group, and the next day, both groups refueled at sea. On 14 September, the reinforcement convoy departed the [[New Hebrides]]. TF 61 commenced covering operations with TF 17, operating east of TF 18 and conforming to their movements.

At about 1450 on 15 September, {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}} was torpedoed on the starboard side. Fires broke out on the carrier. Explosions multiplied the fires. Admiral Scott took command of TF 18. ''San Francisco'' and {{USS|Salt Lake City|CA-25|2}} prepared to take the carrier in tow, but by 1520, the fires were out of control and destroyers began taking on survivors. {{USS|Lansdowne|DD-486|2}} torpedoed the burning hulk. TF 18 then headed for [[Espiritu Santo]].

On the morning of 17 September, ''San Francisco'', {{USS|Juneau|CL-52|2}}, and five destroyers put back to sea to rendezvous with TF 17 and resume coverage of reinforcement convoys. Other units of TF 18 had headed for Nouméa with ''Wasp'' survivors.

On 23 September, ''San Francisco'', ''Salt Lake City'', ''Minneapolis'', {{USS|Chester|CA-27|2}}, {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}}, and {{USS|Helena|CL-50|2}}, and Destroyer Squadron 12 (DesRon 12) became TF 64, a surface screening and attack force under the command of Admiral Scott in ''San Francisco''. The next day, the force headed to the New Hebrides.

====Battle of Cape Esperance====
{{main|Battle of Cape Esperance}}
On 7 October 1942, TF 64 (minus ''Chester'' and ''Minneapolis'') departed from Espiritu Santo, the New Hebrides, and moved back into the Solomons to cover Allied reinforcements and to intercept similar operations by the Japanese. On 11 October, at about 1615, the ships commenced a run northward from Rennel Island, to intercept an enemy force of two cruisers and six destroyers reported heading for Guadalcanal from the Buin-Faisi, [[Bougainville Island]] area. The force continued north to approach [[Savo Island]] in [[The Slot]] from the southwest.

By 2330, when the warships were approximately {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Savo Island, they turned to make a further search of the area. A few minutes after setting the new course, radar indicated unidentified ships to the west, several thousand yards distant. At about 2345, the Battle of Cape Esperance began.

Initial confusion caused both sides to momentarily check their fire in fear of hitting their own ships. Then, the battle was reopened and continued until 0020 on 12 October, when surviving Japanese ships retired toward the [[Shortland Islands]]. ''Salt Lake City'', ''Boise'', {{USS|Duncan|DD-485|2}} and {{USS|Farenholt|DD-491|2}}, had been damaged. Later, ''Duncan'' went down. {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Furutaka||2}} and a destroyer had been sunk during the surface action. Two more enemy destroyers were sunk on 12 October by Marine planes from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. After the engagement, TF 64 retired to Espiritu Santo.

On 15 October, ''San Francisco'' resumed operations in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. On the evening of 20 October, her group was ordered back to Espiritu Santo. At 2119, submarine's torpedoes were reported. ''Chester'' was hit amidships on the starboard side but continued under her own power. Three other torpedoes exploded: one off ''Helena''{{'}}s starboard quarter; a second between ''Helena'' and ''San Francisco''; and the third about {{convert|1200|yd|m|abbr=on}} off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s port beam. Two others were sighted running on the surface.

''San Francisco'' reached Espiritu Santo on the night of 21 October, but departed again on 22 October to intercept any enemy surface units approaching Guadalcanal from the north and to cover friendly reinforcements. On 28 October, Admiral Scott transferred to ''Atlanta''. The next day, ''San Francisco'' returned to Espiritu Santo, and on 30 October, Rear Admiral [[Daniel J. Callaghan]], the commanding officer of ''San Francisco'' when the United States entered the war, returned to the ship and raised his flag as Commander, Task Group 64.4 (TG 64.4) and prospective TF 65.

====Naval Battle of Guadalcanal====
{{main|Naval Battle of Guadalcanal}}
On 31 October 1942, the newly designated TF 65 departed from Espiritu Santo, the ships again headed into the Solomon Islands to cover troop landings on Guadalcanal. Bombardment missions in the [[Kokumbona]] and [[Koli Point]] areas followed. On 6 November, the transport group completed unloading, and the force retired, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 8 November. On 10 November, ''San Francisco'', now flagship for TG 67.4, got underway again toward Guadalcanal.

Just before noon, a Japanese twin-float reconnaissance plane began shadowing the formation.

The force arrived off [[Lunga Point]] on 12 November, and the transports commenced unloading. By mid-afternoon, an approaching Japanese air group was reported. At 1318, the ships got underway. At 1408, 21 enemy planes attacked.

[[File:Japanes air attack on shipping off Guadalcanal, 12 November 1942.jpg|thumb|''San Francisco'' (center) after being hit by a Japanese plane in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 12 November 1942. Ship at left is {{USS|President Jackson|AP-37|2}}.]]

At 1416, an already-damaged [[torpedo bomber]] dropped its torpedo off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s starboard quarter. The torpedo passed alongside, but the plane crashed into ''San Francisco''{{'}}s control aft, swung around that structure, and plunged over the port side into the sea. 15 men were killed, 29 wounded, and one missing. Control aft was demolished. The ship's secondary command post, Battle Two, was burned out but was reestablished by dark. The after anti-aircraft director and radar were put out of commission. Three 20&nbsp;mm mounts were destroyed.

The wounded were transferred to {{USS|President Jackson|AP-37|2}}, just before the approach of an enemy surface force was reported. The covering force escorted the transports out of the area, then reassembled and returned. At about midnight, ''San Francisco'', in company with heavy cruiser USS ''Portland'', the light cruisers ''Atlanta'', ''Helena'', and ''Juneau'', and eight destroyers, entered [[Lengo Channel]].

At 0125 on 13 November, a Japanese naval force was discovered about {{convert|27000|yd|m|abbr=on}} to the northwest. Rear Admiral Callaghan's task group maneuvered to intercept in what became the first engagement in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. At 0148, in almost pitch darkness, ''San Francisco'' opened fire on an enemy cruiser {{convert|3700|yd|m|abbr=on}} off her starboard beam. At 0151, she trained her guns on a small cruiser or large destroyer {{convert|3300|yd|m|abbr=on}} off her starboard bow. Then in an attempt to locate other targets, ''San Francisco'' accidentally targeted {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|2}}. ''San Francisco''{{'}}s gunfire caused extensive damage to ''Atlanta'', killing Admiral Scott and most of ''Atlanta''{{'}}s bridge crew. Belatedly, ''San Francisco'' realized she was firing on a \"friendly\" ship and ceased fire. The green dye that ''San Francisco'' used to distinguish her shells from those of other ships, was later found stained on ''Atlanta''{{'}}s superstructure before she sank. Shortly thereafter, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} was sighted and taken under fire, at an initial range of only {{convert|2200|yd|m|abbr=on}}.

At about 0200, ''San Francisco'' trained her guns on {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}. At the same time, she became the target of {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nagara||2}} off her starboard bow and of a destroyer which had crossed her bow and was passing down her port side. The enemy battleship joined the cruiser and the destroyer in firing on ''San Francisco'' whose port {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} battery engaged the destroyer but was put out of action except for one mount. The battleship put the starboard {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} battery out of commission. ''San Francisco'' swung left while her main battery continued to fire on the battleships which, with the cruiser and the destroyer, continued to pound ''San Francisco''. A direct hit on the navigation bridge killed or badly wounded all officers, except for the communications officer, [[Lieutenant Commander#United States|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Bruce McCandless]].<ref>{{cite video

}}</ref> Command fell to the damage control officer, Lieutenant Commander [[Herbert E. Schonland]], but he thought his own efforts were needed to keep the ship \"afloat and right-side up\", so he ordered McCandless to stay at the [[conn (nautical)|conn]]. Steering and engine control were lost and shifted to Battle Two. Battle Two was out of commission by a direct hit from the port side. Control was again lost.

Control was reestablished in the [[conning tower]], which soon received a hit from the [[starboard]] side. Steering and engine control were temporarily lost, then regained. All communications were now dead.

Soon thereafter, the enemy ceased firing. ''San Francisco'' followed suit and withdrew eastward along the north coast of Guadalcanal.

Seventy-seven sailors, including Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan and Captain [[Cassin Young]], had been killed. Captain Young, like the ''San Francisco'', was a veteran of the Pearl Harbor attack. 105 had been wounded. Of seven missing, three were subsequently rescued. The ship had taken 45 hits. Structural damage was extensive, but not fatal. No hits had been received below the waterline. Twenty-two fires had been started and extinguished.

At about 0400, ''San Francisco'', all her compasses out of commission, joined ''Helena'' and ''Juneau'' and followed them through [[Sealark Channel]] to sail to Espiritu Santo for initial repairs.

At about 1000, ''Juneau''{{'}}s medical personnel transferred to ''San Francisco'' to assist in treating the numerous wounded. An hour later, ''Juneau'' took a torpedo on her port side from {{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-26||2}}, striking in the vicinity of the bridge. \"The entire ship seemed to explode in one mighty column of brown and white smoke and flame which rose easily a thousand feet in the air. The ''Juneau'' literally disintegrated.\" ''San Francisco'' was hit by several large fragments from ''Juneau''. One man was hit, both his legs were broken. Nothing was seen in the water after the smoke lifted. The surviving ships were ordered to keep going without stopping to look for survivors. Unfortunately, the 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 697) of ''Juneau'' were forced to wait eight days for rescue while floating in the ocean, undergoing intense [[shark]] attacks. Only ten survived.

On the afternoon of 14 November, ''San Francisco'' returned towards Espiritu Santo. For her participation in the action of the morning of the 13th, and for that of the night of 11–12 October, she received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]]. On 18 November, the cruiser sailed for Nouméa, and, on 23 November, she got underway toward the United States. She reached San Francisco on 11 December. Three days later, repairs were begun at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]].

===1943–1944===
During the yard period to repair battle damage, ''San Francisco'' received a general modernization similar to other US cruisers.  Her forward superstructure was remodeled, with the bridge wings cut back, and most of the bridge windows either plated over or replaced by portholes.  A large open bridge was built out at the 02 level, and modern SG surface search radar and air search radars added.  In addition many 20mm and 40mm anti-aircraft cannons were installed.  On 26 February 1943, she got underway to return to the South Pacific. After escorting convoy PW 2211 ''en route'', ''San Francisco'' arrived at Nouméa on 20 March. Five days later, she continued on to [[Efate]]. She arrived back in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in mid-April. She then headed north to the [[Aleutian Islands]] to join the [[North Pacific Force]], TF 16, and reached Alaska toward the end of the month. Based at [[Kuluk Bay]], [[Adak Island]], she operated in the Aleutians for the next 4½ months. She patrolled the western approaches to the area; participated in the [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands|assault and occupation of Attu]] in May and of [[Kiska]] in July; and performed escort duties.
[[File:USS San Francisco (CA-38) in Kuluk Bay, Adak Island, April 1943.jpg|thumb|left|''San Francisco'' off Adak Island in April 1943]]

In mid-September, she was ordered back to Pearl Harbor for repairs and reassignment to TF 14. On 29 September, ''San Francisco'' departed Pearl Harbor in Task Unit 14.2.1 (TU 14.2.1) for a raid against Wake Island. On 5 October, the group arrived off the target area and conducted two runs by the enemy positions. On 11 October, her task unit returned to Pearl Harbor.

On 20 November, the force arrived off [[Butaritari|Makin]]. ''San Francisco'' participated in the pre-invasion bombardment of [[Betio]], then patrolled outside the transport area to the west of Makin. On the 26th, she was detached and assigned to TG 50.1, joining {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}}, {{USS|Cowpens|CVL-25|2}}, five cruisers, and six destroyers. With that force, she steamed toward the Marshall Islands to strike Japanese shipping and installations in the [[Kwajalein]] area. On 4 December, the carriers launched their planes against the targets. Shortly after noon, enemy aerial activity increased, and at 1250, ''San Francisco'' came under attack. Three torpedo bombers closed her on the port bow. Her guns \"splashed\" two. The third was shot down by ''Yorktown''. But during the attack, the cruiser had been strafed several times. One man had been killed, and 22 were wounded. After dark, the Japanese returned, and on that night, ''Lexington'' was torpedoed. The force moved north and west. Shortly after 0130 on 5 December, enemy planes faded from the radar screens. The next day, the ships headed back to Pearl Harbor.

On 22 January 1944, ''San Francisco'' sortied with TF 52 and again headed for the Marshalls. On 29 January, the division, screened by destroyers, left the formation and moved against Japanese installations on [[Maloelap]] to neutralize them during the [[Battle of Kwajalein|conquest of Kwajalein]]. Following the bombardment, the ships proceeded on to Kwajalein. ''San Francisco'' arrived off the atoll at about 0630 on 31 January. At 0730, she opened fire on targets of opportunity, initially a small ship inside Kwajalein lagoon. At 0849, she ceased firing. At 0900, she resumed firing at targets on Berlin and Beverly islands. Through the day, she continued to shell those islands, and, in late afternoon, added Bennett Island to her targets. During the next week, she provided pre-landing barrages and support fire for operations against Burton, Berlin, and Beverly islands. On 8 February, the cruiser sailed for [[Majuro]], whence she would operate as a unit of TF 58, the [[fast carrier task force]].

On 12 February, ''San Francisco'', in TG 58.2, cleared Majuro lagoon. Four days later, the carriers launched their planes as part of [[Operation Hailstone]]. On the night of 16–17 February, {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}} was torpedoed. ''San Francisco'', with others, was assigned to escort her eastward. On 19 February, the group split; ''Intrepid'', with two destroyers, continued toward Pearl Harbor, while ''San Francisco'' and the remaining ships headed for Majuro. On 25 February, ''San Francisco'' sailed for Hawaii with TG 58.2. On 20 March, the group returned to Majuro, refueled, and departed again on 22 March to move against the Western [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]]. From 30 March to 1 April, carrier planes hit the [[Palaus]] and [[Woleai]]. ''San Francisco''{{'}}s planes flew rescue missions.

On 6 April, the force was back in Majuro lagoon. A week later, the ships set a course for New Guinea. From 21–28 April, TG 58.2 supported the assault landings in the [[Jayapura|Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)]] area. On 29 April, the ships moved back into the Carolines for another raid against [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]]. On 30 April, ''San Francisco'' was detached and, with eight other cruisers, moved against [[Satawan]]. On completion of that bombardment mission, the cruisers rejoined TG 58.2 and headed back to the Marshalls.

Initially at Majuro, ''San Francisco'' shifted to Kwajalein in early June, and on 10 June, departed that atoll in TG 53.15, the bombardment group of the [[Saipan]] invasion force. On 14 June, she commenced two days of shelling [[Tinian]], and after the [[Battle of Saipan|landings on Saipan]] shifted to fire support duties. On 16 June, she temporarily joined CruDiv 9 to bombard [[Guam]]. Word of a Japanese force en route to Saipan, however, interrupted the cannonade, and the ships returned to Saipan.

On 17 June, ''San Francisco'' refueled and took up station between the approaching enemy force and the amphibious force at Saipan. On the morning of 19 June, the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] opened for ''San Francisco''. At about 1046, she was straddled fore and aft by bombs. \"... a mass of enemy planes on the screen at {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}}.\" At 1126, the cruiser opened fire. A 40&nbsp;mm shell from ''Indianapolis'' set off ''San Francisco''{{'}}s smoke screen generators. By noon, quiet had returned. At 1424, dive bombers made the last Japanese attack. By 20 June, ''San Francisco'' steamed westward in pursuit of the Japanese force. The next day, she returned to the Saipan area and resumed operations with the covering force for the transports. On 8 July, ''San Francisco'' again steamed to Guam to bombard enemy positions. During the next four days, she shelled targets in the [[Agat, Guam|Agat]] and [[Agana]] areas. On 12 July, she returned to Saipan to replenish and refuel, and on 18 July, again took station off Guam.

From 18–20 July, she shelled enemy positions, supported [[underwater demolition team|beach demolition units]], and provided night harassing and defense repair interdiction in the Agat and Faci Point areas. On 21 July, she began to support Marines assaulting the Agat beaches. On 24 July, the cruiser shifted her fire to [[Orote Point]].

On 30 July, she headed, via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, for San Francisco. The cruiser arrived back on the west coast on 16 August for overhaul.

On 31 October, she steamed west again, and on 21 November arrived at [[Ulithi]], where she resumed flagship duties for CruDiv 6. On 10 December, she cleared the anchorage and moved toward the [[Philippines]] in TG 38.1. On 14–15 December, during carrier strikes against [[Luzon]], ''San Francisco''{{'}}s planes were employed on antisubmarine patrol and in rescue work. On 16 December, the force headed for a rendezvous with TG 30.17, the replenishment force. A [[typhoon]] interrupted the refueling operations; and the ships rode out the storm for the next two days. On 19 December, she participated in a search for survivors from three destroyers which had gone down during the typhoon.

On 20 December, TF 38 turned westward again to resume operations against Luzon; but high seas precluded strikes. On 24 December, the force returned to Ulithi.

===1945===
Six days later, the force again sortied from Ulithi. On 2–3 January 1945, strikes were conducted against [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. From 5–7 January, Luzon was hit. On 9 January, fighter sweeps against Formosa were resumed. The force then headed for the [[Bashi Channel]] and a [[South China Sea raid|five-day, high-speed strike]] against enemy surface units in the [[South China Sea]] and against installations along the coast of [[Indochina]]. On 15–16 January, the [[Hong Kong]]-[[Amoy]]-[[Shantou|Swatow]] area was hit, and on 20 January, the force passed through [[Luzon Strait]] to resume operations against Formosa. On 21 January, aerial opposition was constant. Bogies appeared on the screen throughout the day. {{USS|Langley|CVL-27|2}} and {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|2}} were hit. On 22 January, strikes were launched against the [[Ryukyu Islands]], and the next day, the force headed for the Western Carolines.

Arriving on 26 January, the ships sailed again on 10 February. On 16–17 February, strikes were conducted against air facilities in central [[Honshū]]. On 18 February, the force moved toward the [[Volcano Islands|Volcano]] and [[Bonin Islands]], and on 19 February, covering operations for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima assault]] began. The next day, ''San Francisco'' closed on [[Iwo Jima]] with other cruisers and assumed fire support duties, which she continued until 23 February. Then she headed back toward [[Japan]]. On 25 February, [[Tokyo]] was the target. Poor weather prohibited operations against [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya]] on the following day, and on 27 February, the force headed back to Ulithi.

On 21 March, ''San Francisco'', now attached to [[Okinawa naval order of battle#Gunfire and Covering Force (Task Force 54)|Task Force 54]] (TF 54) for [[Battle of Okinawa|the invasion of Okinawa]], departed Ulithi for the Ryukyus. On 25 March, she approached [[Kerama Retto]], west of [[Okinawa]], and furnished fire support for [[Naval mine|mine]]sweeping and underwater demolition operations. That night, she retired and the next morning moved back in to support the landings and supply counter battery fire on [[Aka Island|Aka]], [[Geruma Island|Keruma]], [[Zamami Island|Zamami]], and [[Yakabi Shima|Yakabi Island]]s.

By the morning of 27 March, aerial resistance had begun. The next day, ''San Francisco'' shifted to Okinawa for shore bombardment in preparation for the assault landings scheduled for 1 April. On that day, she took up station in fire support sector 5, west of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]], and, for the next five days, shelled enemy emplacements, caves, [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillbox]]es, road junctions, and tanks, truck, and troop concentrations. At night, she provided harassing fire near the beachhead.

On 6 April, the cruiser retired to Kerama Retto, refueled and took on ammunition, assisted in splashing a [[Nakajima B6N]] \"Jill\" torpedo bomber, then rejoined TF 54 off Okinawa as that force underwent another air raid. ''San Francisco'' downed a [[Nakajima B5N]] \"Kate\" torpedo bomber. Dawn of 7 April brought another air raid, during which a ''[[kamikaze]]'' attempted to crash the cruiser. It was splashed {{convert|50|yd|m|abbr=on}} off the starboard bow. After the raid, ''San Francisco'' shifted to TF 51 for fire support missions on the east coast of Okinawa, rejoining TF 54 on the west coast in late afternoon. On 11 April, air attacks increased, and the next day, ''San Francisco'' set an [[Aichi D3A]] \"Val\" [[dive bomber]] on fire. The plane then glanced off a merchant ship and hit the water, enveloped in flames.

On 13–14 April, the cruiser again operated with TF 51 off the east coast of the embattled island. The next day, she returned to Kerama Retto, there proceeding to Okinawa and operations with TF 54 in the transport area. There she provided night illumination to detect swimmers and [[Shinyo (suicide boat)|''Shinyo'' suicide boat]]s, and just before midnight assisted in sinking one of the latter. During the night, two further attempts by ''Shinyo''s to close the transports were thwarted.

With dawn, ''San Francisco'' returned to the Naha area to shell the airfield there. On 17 April, she moved up the coast and fired on the [[Machinate air field]]. The next day, she again shifted to the eastern side of the island and, that night, anchored in [[Nakagusuku Wan]]. The next day, ''San Francisco'' supported troops in the southern part of the island. From 21–24 April, she shelled targets in the Naha airstrip area; and got underway for Ulithi.

On 13 May, ''San Francisco'' returned to Okinawa, arriving in Nakagusuku Wan and resuming support activities against targets in southern Okinawa. For the next few days, ''San Francisco'' supported the [[96th Infantry Division (United States)|96th Infantry Division]] in an area to the southeast of [[Yonabaru, Okinawa|Yonabaru]]. On 20 May, she shifted to [[Kutaka Shima]], and by the night of 22 May, she had depleted her supply of ammunition for her main batteries. On 25 May, the Japanese launched a large air attack against Allied shipping in Nakagusuku Wan. On 27 May, ''San Francisco'' provided fire support for the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]], and retired to Kerama Retto the next day. On 30 May, the cruiser returned to the western side of Okinawa and, for the next two weeks, supported operations of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st]] and [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Divisions]].

On 21 June, ''San Francisco'' was ordered to join TG 32.15, {{convert|120|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Okinawa. A week later, she put into Kerama Retto for a brief stay, then rejoined that group. In early July, she provided cover for the eastern anchorage. On 3 July, she sailed toward the Philippines to prepare for an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese home islands]]. The cessation of hostilities in mid-August, however, obviated that operation, and ''San Francisco'' prepared for occupation duty.

Between 7 December 1941 and 7 October 1945, ''San Francisco'' travelled 480,000 km and burned 114,478,423 litres of fuel oil. On her voyages, she crossed the equator 24 times and the international date line 33 times. Her guns fired 11,022 203mm shells, 24,191 127mm shells, 70,243 40mm shells and 73,904 20mm shells and her crew suffered 267 combat casualties. Her planes flew for 3,714 hours. The crew consumed 3,983,712 kg of edible provisions, ate 332,937 kg of beef, ate 925,328 kg of potatoes, ate 5,760,000 slices of bread and smoked 1,838,780 packs of cigarettes.<ref>U.S. Navy statistics [https://www.navysite.de/cruisebooks/ca38-45/078.htm] from the [https://www.navysite.de/cruisebooks/ca38-45/index_003.htm USS ''San Francisco'' (CA-38) World War II cruise book] available at [http://navysite.de/cruisebooks/index.html Navysite.de]</ref>

==Post-war==
On 28 August 1945, the cruiser departed [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] for the [[China]] coast. After a show of force in the [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Bohai Sea|Gulf of Pohai]] areas, she covered minesweeping operations, and on 8 October anchored at [[Inchon, Korea]]. From 13–16 October, she participated in another show of force operation in the Gulf of Pohai area, then returned to Inchon, where Rear Admiral [[Jerauld Wright]], Commander, CruDiv 6, acted as senior member of the committee for the surrender of Japanese naval forces in [[Korea]].

On 27 November, ''San Francisco'' headed home. Arriving at San Francisco in mid-December, she continued on to the east coast on 5 January 1946, and arrived at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] for inactivation on 19 January. Decommissioned on 10 February, she was berthed with the Philadelphia Group of the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] until 1 March 1959, when her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. On 9 September, she was sold to the Union Mineral and Alloys Corp., New York, and scrapped at [[Panama City, Florida]] in 1961.

[[File:3852 Bridge (33734921503).jpg|thumb|right|Removed bridge wings at Lands End]]
During the December 1942 repair at Mare Island, it was necessary to extensively rebuild the bridge. The bridge wings were removed as part of that repair, and are now part of a memorial to the ship on a promontory in [[Lands End, San Francisco]] at [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] overlooking the Pacific Ocean. One wing has extensive battle damage from the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. They are set on the [[great circle]] course from [[San Francisco]] to Guadalcanal. The old [[ship's bell]] is housed at the [[Marines Memorial Club]] in San Francisco.

}}'''''Faith''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by the English singer [[George Michael]], released on 30 October 1987 by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Epic Records]]. In addition to playing various instruments on the album, Michael wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"[[Look at Your Hands]]\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A \"[[Black music|black]]\" inspired [[Pop music|pop]]-[[R&B]] album, ''Faith''<nowiki/>'s songs include introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kr0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=I+was+much+happier+when+faith+black+george+michael#v=onepage&q=I%20was%20much%20happier%20when%20faith%20black%20george%20michael&f=false|title=Jet – Google Books|date=26 September 1988|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>

By 1986, Michael had spent five years as the lead singer of the popular duo [[Wham!]] and had grown tired of accusations that the group, which featured his best friend [[Andrew Ridgeley]], was nothing more than a [[teenybopper]] group. After the success of ''[[Make It Big]]'', Michael had grown weary of continuing the duo, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up which eventually happened. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that would make his first solo album, which would be titled ''Faith''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-14/entertainment/ca-36257_1_george-michael|title=George Michael's Got 'Faith' and Lots More|last1=GREIN|first1=PAUL|date=14 January 1988|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

''Faith'' peaked at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It stayed for 51 non-consecutive weeks inside the ''Billboard'' 200 top 10, including 12 weeks at number one. It was also the first album by a white solo artist to hit number one on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|''Billboard'' Top Black Albums]] chart. ''Faith'' spawned [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles from one album|four number one singles]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", \"[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]\", \"[[One More Try (George Michael song)|One More Try]]\", and \"[[Monkey (song)|Monkey]]\", making Michael the only British male solo artist to have four number one hits from one album on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Michael embarked on [[The Faith Tour]] to promote ''Faith'' in February 1988, opening at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] arena, before going on to dates in Australia, Europe and North America.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZYzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT155|title=Careless Whispers: The Life & Career of George Michael: Revised & Updated|last=Steele|first=Robert|date=2017|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-78323-968-9|page=155}}</ref>

''Faith'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]] having sold over 20 million copies worldwide and was certified [[RIAA certification#RIAA Diamond certifications|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 1996.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-11302224|title=George Michael: A colourful life|date=14 September 2010|access-date=2020-01-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> The album won several awards, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[31st Annual Grammy Awards|31st Grammy Awards]]. Michael won three awards at the [[American Music Awards of 1989|1989 American Music Awards]]: [[American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist|Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist]], [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist|Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist]] and [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album|Favorite Soul/R&B Album]] for ''Faith''. He was also honoured with the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award|MTV Video Vanguard Award]]. Often ranked as one of the best albums of the 1980s, ''Faith'' was ranked number 472 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].

==Background==
By 1986, Michael had spent five years as the lead singer of the popular duo [[Wham!]] and had grown tired of accusations that the group, which featured his best friend [[Andrew Ridgeley]], was nothing more than a [[teenybopper]] group despite the serious subject matter that was included on albums such as ''[[Fantastic (Wham! album)|Fantastic]]'' and ''[[Make It Big]]''. After the success of ''Make It Big''  Michael had grown weary of continuing the group, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up. A decision was made that the group would dissolve following the end of a tenure at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley Stadiu]]<nowiki/>m for what was titled ''Wham: The Final''. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that eventually would make his first solo album, which would be titled ''Faith''.<ref name=\":0\" />

==Recording==
Michael spent the greater part of 1987 writing and recording the songs for the ''Faith'' album. In addition to playing various instruments on the album, he wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"[[Look at Your Hands]]\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A contemporary \"[[Black music|black]]\" pop-R&B album, ''Faith'' showcases the vocals of Michael in a new style mode. Its songs are littered with introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time. Most of the material was recorded at Puk Recording Studios in Denmark and Sarm West Studios in London. The album covered many styles of which included [[soul music|soul]] (\"[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]\", \"[[One More Try (George Michael song)|One More Try]]\"), [[Rock music|rock]] (\"Look at Your Hands\", \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", \"[[Hand to Mouth (song)|Hand to Mouth]]\"), [[funk]] (\"[[Monkey (song)|Monkey]]\", \"[[Hard Day]]\") and [[jazz]] (\"[[Kissing a Fool (song)|Kissing a Fool]]\").

Some of the material was more graphic than Michael's previous efforts with Wham! One such song was \"[[I Want Your Sex]]\", which had three parts: the first part was titled \"Rhythm 1: Lust\", which was the version that would eventually be released as a single and featured [[Electro music|electro funk]] influences; the second part was titled \"Rhythm 2: Brass in Love\", which mixed a more instrumentally-based funk live instrumentation with a smoother R&B arrangement during the verses; the third part, which was edited to be the final song on the album, was titled \"Rhythm 3: A Last Request\", featuring a jazz-influenced quiet storm and R&B sound combined with lyrics telling of Michael drunkenly trying to bring his lover to his bed.{{Quote box

The [[Faith (George Michael song)|title track]] began with an organ fanfare that was actually the music to Wham!'s \"[[Freedom (Wham! song)|Freedom]]\" played as if in a cathedral. After this, the song featured a [[rockabilly]] sound similar to [[Bo Diddley]] while Michael added his own style with his vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/george-michael-faith/|title=George Michael: Faith|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> \"Father Figure\" originally was a dance-styled production until Michael removed the snare drums from it and kept it that way because he loved what he heard, making the song a mid-tempo R&B ballad. \"One More Try\" was a soul song in the tradition of songs by [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]; its lyrics tell of a man who pushes his lover away out of fear of repeating past relationships, only to accept the invitation in the end.

\"Hard Day\", much like the first two parts of \"I Want Your Sex\", was inspired by funk. The social commentary song \"Hand to Mouth\" had a slight pop and [[Folk music|folk]] approach while a similar social commentary song, \"Look at Your Hands\", co-written by Michael and David Austin, produced a pop song with rock elements featuring a piano and saxophone. \"Monkey\" returns to the funk influences of some of the other songs. A remix of the song by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] brings a [[new jack swing]] approach to the original. \"Kissing a Fool\" is a jazz-influenced ballad with lyrics solemnly describing a breakup.

[[File:George Michael.jpeg|thumb|Michael during a [[The Faith Tour|Faith Tour]] concert in 1988. The album propelled him to solo stardom and one of the most successful English acts of the 1980s.]]
25-weeks after its release, ''Faith'' reached number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7639982/george-michael-history-billboard-rb-charts|title=George Michael's History on Billboard's R&B Charts|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> Its early, and successive, success on the chart was said to be partly sustained—with help from plenty of press appearances and promotions—by its strong single releases. After \"I Want Your Sex\" helped propel ''Faith'' to its debut atop the chart, the second single \"Faith\" aided the album's continuing sales dominance. It also reached number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]], although it stayed at the top spot for only one week. ''Faith'' stayed for 51 non-consecutive weeks inside the ''Billboard'' 200 top 10, including 12 weeks at number one.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/26/why-george-michael-turned-his-back-on-america|title=Why George Michael turned his back on America|last=Helmore|first=Edward|date=26 December 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> It was also the first album by a white solo artist to hit number one on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|''Billboard'' Top Black Albums]] chart.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/>

In a 1988 interview with [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'']] magazine, Michael was quoted as saying: \"I was much happier with [''Faith''] being the No. 1 Black [chart] album than I was when it became the No. 1 Pop album. There was much more of a sense of achievement. I knew this album would be a shock or a surprise to people in this country. The uptempo side of the new music is more overtly sexual, more black.\"<ref name=\":2\" />

During 1987 and 1988, ''Faith'' produced a string of hit singles for Michael, including six top-five [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hits, four of which (\"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", \"[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]\", \"[[One More Try (George Michael song)|One More Try]]\", and \"[[Monkey (song)|Monkey]]\") reached number one, making him the only British male solo artist to have four number one hits from one album on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"Faith\" was 1988's best-selling single in the United States; with \"[[Careless Whisper]]\" having been the best-selling single in 1985, Michael became the first musician to achieve two [[Billboard Year-End#Billboard year-end number ones|''Billboard'' Year-End number one singles]] chart since [[the Beatles]]' \"Hey Jude\" topped the Year-End singles chart in 1968 after \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\" had done so in 1964. Michael also had both the year's number one album and the number one single, which hadn't happened since 1970, when [[Simon & Garfunkel]] grabbed both positions with ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' and its [[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|title track]].

===The Faith Tour===
{{Main|The Faith Tour}}
Michael embarked on a world tour to promote the album in February 1988, opening at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] arena, before going on to dates in Australia, Europe and North America. In Los Angeles, Michael was joined on stage by [[Aretha Franklin]] for a duet on \"[[I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)]]\". While on tour, new singles from the album continued to be released. In June, Michael interrupted the tour to sing three songs at Wembley Stadium's [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gmforever.com/nelson-mandela-tribute-concert-1988/|title=George Michael at the Nelson Mandela Tribute Concert (1988)|website=gmforever.com|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>

== Critical reception ==
Mark Coleman of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised Michael for emerging as \"one of pop music’s leading artisans, a painstaking craftsman who combines a graceful knack for vocal hooks with an uncanny ability to ransack the past for musical ideas and still sound fresh\" and dubbed Michael the \"[[Elton John]] of the 1980s\". Coleman also claimed that ''Faith'' is \"a concept album of sorts\" incorporating \"disco groove [varying] from urban thump to slow tropical heat wave\", praising it for being \"grounded in a passion and personal commitment\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/faith-105014/|title=Faith|last=Coleman|first=Mark|last2=Coleman|first2=Mark|date=14 January 1988|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>

''Faith'' earned Michael numerous accolades, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[31st Annual Grammy Awards|31st Grammy Awards]]. Michael was awarded three awards at the [[American Music Awards of 1989|1989 American Music Awards]]: [[American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist|Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist]], [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist|Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist]] and [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album|Favorite Soul/R&B Album]] for ''Faith''. He was also honoured with the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award|MTV Video Vanguard Award]]. ''Faith'' was the best-selling album of 1988 in the United States, and eventually reached [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], current sales of the album stand at 11&nbsp;million copies, making it the 52nd-bestselling album in the United States. ''Faith'' has sold around over 20&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref name=\":1\" />

}}In a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' review, ''Faith'' was considered to have \"cemented [Michael] as an [[MTV]] icon and a global superstar\" and shaping the sound of \"late-'80s pop as much as any LP of its time.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/p/george-michael-faith-30-years|title=Keeping the 'Faith': Six Writers Remember the Six Classic Hit Singles From George Michael's 30-Year-Old Debut|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> Writing for [[BBC Music]], Ian Wade praised ''Faith'' for being a \"classic of its era\" and \"one of the more listenable major releases of the 80s.\" He also regarded the album being responsible for turning Michael into a \"proper international superstar, confirming his rightful place at pop’s top table.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/3w5c/|title=BBC - Music - Review of George Michael - Faith|last=Wade|first=Ian|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>

Reviewing the reissue of ''Faith'' for the ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'' in 2011, Arwa Haider claimed: \"''Faith'' still bursts with self-belief, designer vanity, classic songs and imagery, right from the opening title track which begins with a funeral church organ rendition of Wham!'s hit, \"Freedom\", before clicking into jaunty rock 'n' roll. It's easy to hear why ''Faith'' achieved multi-million status, although the masterful ballads (\"Father Figure\", \"One More Try\") have stood the test of time better than Michael's funk-pop.\"<ref>Arwa Haider ''Metro'', 14 January 2011.</ref> Following the 30th anniversary of the release of the single \"Faith\", Nate Hertweck wrote in a [[Grammy Award]]s review that the song \"change[d] everything\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/remember-when-george-michaels-faith-changed-everything|title=Remember When?

In 1989, ''Faith'' was ranked at number 84 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of the Greatest Albums of the 80s.<ref>\"The Top 100 Albums of 1989\" by Jancee Dunn, Rolling Stone Magazine, 14–28 December 1989, page 239</ref> In 2003, the album was ranked at number 480 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of [[the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] while in 2012, the album ranked eight places higher at number 472 on an updated list by the magazine.<ref name=\"500-greatest\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/george-michael-faith-43886/|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone’s definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time|year=2012|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref> ''Faith'' was ranked 79th in a 2005 survey held by British television's [[Channel 4]] to determine the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time.

=== 2011 remastered release ===
A remastered edition of ''Faith'' was released on 31 January 2011 in the UK and on 1 February 2011 in the US. It is available in several formats: ''Limited Edition Collectors Box Set'', ''Two-CD and DVD Special Edition'', ''Two-CD Edition'' and ''[[iTunes LP]]''. The box set release features: the remastered album on CD, an additional CD of remastered 12\" versions and B-sides; a DVD featuring a TV special from 1987, a hardbound book that includes an exclusive interview with George Michael, sleeve notes, rare photos and memorabilia; a vinyl album replica of the original LP; and a memorabilia envelope that includes five art prints, reproduction poster, tickets and tour pass from the ''Faith'' tour sourced from Michael's personal archive. All this is housed in a 12 x 12 numbered, black and gold-foiled slipcase with original artwork overlay. The first 2,000 copies were also provided with a hand-numbered lithograph attached (taped) outside the box set. The 2011 re-release received universal acclaim from music critics according to [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/faith-special-edition/george-michael/critic-reviews|title=Critic Reviews for Faith:Special Edition|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>

'''Note'''
*In the liner notes, \"I Want Your Sex\" is listed as \"I Want Your Sex (Monogamy Mix)\", with the parts titled \"Rhythm One: Lust\" and \"Rhythm Two: Brass in Love\", respectively. However, on the album, the start of \"Rhythm One\" is slightly different from how the corresponding section starts on the actual \"Monogamy Mix\" as featured on the [[I Want Your Sex|previous single release]]: on the album, the song starts with a synthesized bass and electronic effects, while the drums and programmed [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] come in some seconds later; on the single, the song starts only with drums and percussion.

}}'''''Faith''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by the English singer [[George Michael]], released on 30 October 1987 by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Epic Records]]. In addition to playing various instruments on the album, Michael wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"[[Look at Your Hands]]\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A \"[[Black music|black]]\" inspired [[Pop music|pop]]-[[R&B]] album, ''Faith''<nowiki/>'s songs include introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kr0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=I+was+much+happier+when+faith+black+george+michael#v=onepage&q=I%20was%20much%20happier%20when%20faith%20black%20george%20michael&f=false|title=Jet – Google Books|date=26 September 1988|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>

By 1986, Michael had spent five years as the lead singer of the popular duo [[Wham!]] and had grown tired of accusations that the group, which featured his best friend [[Andrew Ridgeley]], was nothing more than a [[teenybopper]] group. After the success of ''[[Make It Big]]'', Michael had grown weary of continuing the duo, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up which eventually happened. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that would make his first solo album, which would be titled ''Faith''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-14/entertainment/ca-36257_1_george-michael|title=George Michael's Got 'Faith' and Lots More|last1=GREIN|first1=PAUL|date=14 January 1988|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

''Faith'' peaked at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It stayed for 51 non-consecutive weeks inside the ''Billboard'' 200 top 10, including 12 weeks at number one. It was also the first album by a white solo artist to hit number one on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|''Billboard'' Top Black Albums]] chart. ''Faith'' spawned [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles from one album|four number one singles]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", \"[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]\", \"[[One More Try (George Michael song)|One More Try]]\", and \"[[Monkey (song)|Monkey]]\", making Michael the only British male solo artist to have four number one hits from one album on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Michael embarked on the [[The Faith Tour]] to promote ''Faith'' in February 1988, opening at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] arena, before going on to dates in Australia, Europe and North America.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZYzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT155|title=Careless Whispers: The Life & Career of George Michael: Revised & Updated|last=Steele|first=Robert|date=2017|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-78323-968-9|page=155}}</ref>

''Faith'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]] having sold over 20 million copies worldwide and was certified [[RIAA certification#RIAA Diamond certifications|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 1996.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-11302224|title=George Michael: A colourful life|date=14 September 2010|access-date=2020-01-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> The album won several awards, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[31st Annual Grammy Awards|31st Grammy Awards]]. Michael won three awards at the [[American Music Awards of 1989|1989 American Music Awards]]: [[American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist|Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist]], [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist|Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist]] and [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album|Favorite Soul/R&B Album]] for ''Faith''. He was also honoured with the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award|MTV Video Vanguard Award]]. Often ranked as one of the best albums of the 1980s, ''Faith'' was ranked number 472 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].

==Background==
By 1986, Michael had spent five years as the lead singer of the popular duo [[Wham!]] and had grown tired of accusations that the group, which featured his best friend [[Andrew Ridgeley]], was nothing more than a [[teenybopper]] group despite the serious subject matter that was included on albums such as ''[[Fantastic (Wham! album)|Fantastic]]'' and ''[[Make It Big]]''. After the success of ''Make It Big''  Michael had grown weary of continuing the group, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up. A decision was made that the group would dissolve following the end of a tenure at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley Stadiu]]<nowiki/>m for what was titled ''Wham: The Final''. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that eventually would make his first solo album, which would be titled ''Faith''.<ref name=\":0\" />

==Recording==
Michael spent the greater part of 1987 writing and recording the songs for the ''Faith'' album. In addition to playing various instruments on the album, he wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"[[Look at Your Hands]]\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A contemporary \"[[Black music|black]]\" pop-R&B album, ''Faith'' showcases the vocals of Michael in a new style mode. Its songs are littered with introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time. Most of the material was recorded at Puk Recording Studios in Denmark and Sarm West Studios in London. The album covered many styles of which included [[soul music|soul]] (\"[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]\", \"[[One More Try (George Michael song)|One More Try]]\"), [[Rock music|rock]] (\"Look at Your Hands\", \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", \"[[Hand to Mouth (song)|Hand to Mouth]]\"), [[funk]] (\"[[Monkey (song)|Monkey]]\", \"[[Hard Day]]\") and [[jazz]] (\"[[Kissing a Fool (song)|Kissing a Fool]]\").

Some of the material was more graphic than Michael's previous efforts with Wham! One such song was \"[[I Want Your Sex]]\", which had three parts: the first part was titled \"Rhythm 1: Lust\", which was the version that would eventually be released as a single and featured [[Electro music|electro funk]] influences; the second part was titled \"Rhythm 2: Brass in Love\", which mixed a more instrumentally-based funk live instrumentation with a smoother R&B arrangement during the verses; the third part, which was edited to be the final song on the album, was titled \"Rhythm 3: A Last Request\", featuring a jazz-influenced quiet storm and R&B sound combined with lyrics telling of Michael drunkenly trying to bring his lover to his bed.{{Quote box

The [[Faith (George Michael song)|title track]] began with an organ fanfare that was actually the music to Wham!'s \"[[Freedom (Wham! song)|Freedom]]\" played as if in a cathedral. After this, the song featured a [[rockabilly]] sound similar to [[Bo Diddley]] while Michael added his own style with his vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/george-michael-faith/|title=George Michael: Faith|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> \"Father Figure\" originally was a dance-styled production until Michael removed the snare drums from it and kept it that way because he loved what he heard, making the song a mid-tempo R&B ballad. \"One More Try\" was a soul song in the tradition of songs by [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]; its lyrics tell of a man who pushes his lover away out of fear of repeating past relationships, only to accept the invitation in the end.

\"Hard Day\", much like the first two parts of \"I Want Your Sex\", was inspired by funk. The social commentary song \"Hand to Mouth\" had a slight pop and [[Folk music|folk]] approach while a similar social commentary song, \"Look at Your Hands\", co-written by Michael and David Austin, produced a pop song with rock elements featuring a piano and saxophone. \"Monkey\" returns to the funk influences of some of the other songs. A remix of the song by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] brings a [[new jack swing]] approach to the original. \"Kissing a Fool\" is a jazz-influenced ballad with lyrics solemnly describing a breakup.

[[File:George Michael.jpeg|thumb|Michael during a [[The Faith Tour|Faith Tour]] concert in 1988. The album propelled him to solo stardom and one of the most successful English acts of the 1980s.]]
25-weeks after its release, ''Faith'' reached number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7639982/george-michael-history-billboard-rb-charts|title=George Michael's History on Billboard's R&B Charts|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> Its early, and successive, success on the chart was said to be partly sustained—with help from plenty of press appearances and promotions—by its strong single releases. After \"I Want Your Sex\" helped propel ''Faith'' to its debut atop the chart, the second single \"Faith\" aided the album's continuing sales dominance. It also reached number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]], although it stayed at the top spot for only one week. ''Faith'' stayed for 51 non-consecutive weeks inside the ''Billboard'' 200 top 10, including 12 weeks at number one.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/26/why-george-michael-turned-his-back-on-america|title=Why George Michael turned his back on America|last=Helmore|first=Edward|date=26 December 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> It was also the first album by a white solo artist to hit number one on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|''Billboard'' Top Black Albums]] chart.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/>

In a 1988 interview with [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'']] magazine, Michael was quoted as saying: \"I was much happier with [''Faith''] being the No. 1 Black [chart] album than I was when it became the No. 1 Pop album. There was much more of a sense of achievement. I knew this album would be a shock or a surprise to people in this country. The uptempo side of the new music is more overtly sexual, more black.\"<ref name=\":2\" />

During 1987 and 1988, ''Faith'' produced a string of hit singles for Michael, including six top-five [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hits, four of which (\"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", \"[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]\", \"[[One More Try (George Michael song)|One More Try]]\", and \"[[Monkey (song)|Monkey]]\") reached number one, making him the only British male solo artist to have four number one hits from one album on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"Faith\" was 1988's best-selling single in the United States; with \"[[Careless Whisper]]\" having been the best-selling single in 1985, Michael became the first musician to achieve two [[Billboard Year-End#Billboard year-end number ones|''Billboard'' Year-End number one singles]] chart since [[the Beatles]]' \"Hey Jude\" topped the Year-End singles chart in 1968 after \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\" had done so in 1964. Michael also had both the year's number one album and the number one single, which hadn't happened since 1970, when [[Simon & Garfunkel]] grabbed both positions with ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' and its [[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|title track]].

===The Faith Tour===
{{Main|The Faith Tour}}
Michael embarked on a world tour to promote the album in February 1988, opening at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] arena, before going on to dates in Australia, Europe and North America. In Los Angeles, Michael was joined on stage by [[Aretha Franklin]] for a duet on \"[[I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)]]\". While on tour, new singles from the album continued to be released. In June, Michael interrupted the tour to sing three songs at Wembley Stadium's [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gmforever.com/nelson-mandela-tribute-concert-1988/|title=George Michael at the Nelson Mandela Tribute Concert (1988)|website=gmforever.com|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>

== Critical reception ==
Mark Coleman of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised Michael for emerging as \"one of pop music’s leading artisans, a painstaking craftsman who combines a graceful knack for vocal hooks with an uncanny ability to ransack the past for musical ideas and still sound fresh\" and dubbed Michael the \"[[Elton John]] of the 1980s\". Coleman also claimed that ''Faith'' is \"a concept album of sorts\" incorporating \"disco groove [varying] from urban thump to slow tropical heat wave\", praising it for being \"grounded in a passion and personal commitment\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/faith-105014/|title=Faith|last=Coleman|first=Mark|last2=Coleman|first2=Mark|date=14 January 1988|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>

}}In a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' review, ''Faith'' was considered to have \"cemented [Michael] as an [[MTV]] icon and a global superstar\" and shaping the sound of \"late-'80s pop as much as any LP of its time.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/p/george-michael-faith-30-years|title=Keeping the 'Faith': Six Writers Remember the Six Classic Hit Singles From George Michael's 30-Year-Old Debut|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> Writing for [[BBC Music]], Ian Wade praised ''Faith'' for being a \"classic of its era\" and \"one of the more listenable major releases of the 80s.\" He also regarded the album being responsible for turning Michael into a \"proper international superstar, confirming his rightful place at pop’s top table.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/3w5c/|title=BBC - Music - Review of George Michael - Faith|last=Wade|first=Ian|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>

Reviewing the reissue of ''Faith'' for the ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'' in 2011, Arwa Haider claimed: \"''Faith'' still bursts with self-belief, designer vanity, classic songs and imagery, right from the opening title track which begins with a funeral church organ rendition of Wham!'s hit, \"Freedom\", before clicking into jaunty rock 'n' roll. It's easy to hear why ''Faith'' achieved multi-million status, although the masterful ballads (\"Father Figure\", \"One More Try\") have stood the test of time better than Michael's funk-pop.\"<ref>Arwa Haider ''Metro'', 14 January 2011.</ref> Following the 30th anniversary of the release of the single \"Faith\", Nate Hertweck wrote in a [[Grammy Award]]s review that the song \"change[d] everything\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/remember-when-george-michaels-faith-changed-everything|title=Remember When?

'''Note'''
*In the liner notes, \"I Want Your Sex\" is listed as \"I Want Your Sex (Monogamy Mix)\", with the parts titled \"Rhythm One: Lust\" and \"Rhythm Two: Brass in Love\", respectively. However, on the album, the start of \"Rhythm One\" is slightly different from how the corresponding section starts on the actual \"Monogamy Mix\" as featured on the [[I Want Your Sex|previous single release]]: on the album, the song starts with a synthesized bass and electronic effects, while the drums and programmed [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] come in some seconds later; on the single, the song starts only with drums and percussion.

'''Tarvaris Jackson''' (April 21, 1983 – April 12, 2020) was an American professional [[American football|football]] player who was a [[quarterback]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). Jackson played [[college football]] for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas Razorbacks]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State Hornets]]. He played professionally for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].

The Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008-09 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game.  Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] over the [[Denver Broncos]].

==Early life and college career==

Vikings scouts and personnel had reportedly been watching him closely in secret over his senior season, particularly liking his performance in the [[East-West Shrine Game]]. They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected. On July 26, 2006, Jackson signed a four-year deal with Minnesota, including a $1 million signing bonus.<ref>\"[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/football/060726/f072680.html Vikings sign quarterback Tarvaris Jackson to four-year contract]\". Originally published on July 26, 2006. Retrieved on April 16, 2007.</ref>

Vikings coach [[Brad Childress]] was quoted days before the draft as saying he was interested in finding a \"developmental guy\", a \"diamond in the rough\" quarterback of the future, raw talent he could teach a system.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070318124007/http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&pk=FBN-VIKINGS-04-26-06 Childress Quotes before draft]. Childress quotes before the draft.</ref> Both new coach Childress and Vikings former quarterback [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] had had success developing quarterbacks in the past, including [[A. J. Feeley]] and [[Donovan McNabb]].

The day after the draft, Childress was quoted by the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' as saying: \"I think you judge quarterbacks a little bit differently...When you see what you want at the quarterback position, you need to go get it. And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic.  He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach. So what can he do with coaching?\"<ref>\"That's a good question,\" many people reply, noting that Jackson is Seattle's only Black Mormon.

===Minnesota Vikings===

====2006 season====
Jackson's 2006 pre-season [[passer rating]] was 106.1, 15th in the league out of 110 quarterbacks who performed. Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.

On September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that. So it's obvious that Brad is still our quarterback so we can stay on that.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Staring at a Quarterback Controversy|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=/nfl/news/ABN4052702.htm|author=Benoit, Andy|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In Week 15, Johnson started the game but was benched in the fourth quarter when the Vikings had been underperforming the entire game losing by a score of 26-7 at the time Jackson went in late in the third quarter against the [[2006 New York Jets|New York Jets]]. Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead. He also threw an interception in the red zone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612170min.htm |title=New York Jets at Minnesota Vikings - December 17th, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Jackson was named the starting quarterback for Minnesota towards the end of his rookie season.  Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].  Game conditions were very poor.  A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9-7 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass). Jackson had a passer rating of 36.5, had a 50% completion rate (10-20 for 50 yards), one interception, and one fumble.  Packers quarterback Brett Favre only managed a slightly better 52% completion rate (26-50) and threw two interceptions. He threw for 285 yards with no touchdowns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612210gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - December 21st, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

====2007 season====
Jackson did not live up to the Vikings' expectations in 2007 despite finishing 8-4 as a starter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JackTa00/gamelog/2007/ |title=Tarvaris Jackson 2007 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson had nine touchdowns and 12 interceptions, along with a 159 yards per game, causing the Vikings to have the second-worst passing offense in the NFL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/index.htm |title=2007 NFL Standings & Team Stats |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> His 70.8 passer rating was 28th among NFL quarterbacks.  Jackson missed three games because of injuries, which included a strained groin, a concussion and a fractured index finger. The Vikings failed to make the playoffs.  Analysts put the Vikings' 8-8 record on the successful running of [[Chester Taylor]] and rookie [[Adrian Peterson]], which took the pressure off of Jackson and the defense.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min/2007.htm |title=2007 Minnesota Vikings Statistics & Players |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Later in the season, opponents decided to focus all their defensive efforts on stopping Peterson and the Vikings running game, while daring Jackson to beat them in the passing game.  The [[2007 Washington Redskins|Washington Redskins]] successfully utilized five [[defensive lineman]] or four [[linebackers]] against the Vikings, leaving only two or three defensive backs in pass coverage.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225070431/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12791702.html Washington D focuses all its attention on Peterson]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/27/AR2007122702318.html|title=Wrinkles Changed Playoff Complexion|first=Jason|last=Reid|date=December 28, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>  And the 49ers blitzed their [[cornerback]]s 20 percent of the time instead of covering receivers with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12522941.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiU9PmP:QiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU|title=Patrick Reusse: Fans shouldn't go overboard on Jackson yet|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723221658/http://www.wtov9.com/sports/14824511/detail.html Vikings Enjoying Quite A Turnaround]</ref>  On the season's last game against the [[2007 Denver Broncos|Denver Broncos]], Jackson led the Vikings to two fourth quarter drives to tie the game and send it into overtime. In overtime, however, Jackson fumbled on the second play and the Vikings lost the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200712300den.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Denver Broncos - December 30th, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson showed slow improvement over the season: he played a large role when the Vikings went on a five-game winning streak in November, but also showed his inexperience in several ill-judged interceptions, jump passes, and turnovers.  After the season, Childress would not say if Tarvaris Jackson would be the starter in 2008, explaining that he wanted to \"evaluate the total body of work\" first.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071226171506/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12806557.html Childress noncommittal over quarterback's long-term future]</ref>

====2008 season====
There was a lot of media coverage on Jackson the summer of 2008. The Vikings returned seven players that were in the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] (only three teams had more), and spent $60 million in guaranteed contract money upgrading their team with [[Jared Allen]], traded from the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and free agents [[Bernard Berrian]] and [[Madieu Williams]]. Several analysts believed better quarterback play was all that was needed to make the Vikings one of the top contending teams in the NFL, and with the [[Green Bay Packers]] losing [[Brett Favre]] the [[NFC North Division]] was up for grabs.  [[Sport's Illustrated]]'s [[Paul Lionel Zimmerman|Paul Zimmerman]] predicted the Vikings would win the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/dr_z/06/20/vikings/index.html|title=Dare I pick Minnesota to win it all?|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Head coach Brad Childress decided to stay with Jackson as the starting quarterback and brought in [[Gus Frerotte]] to be his backup. It was widely reported in the off-season that Jackson had a new swagger, handled situations in practice well where he looked lost in the previous years, and had an improved grasp of the Vikings offensive system.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526142945/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/19160244.html?location_refer=Vikings |title=QB Jackson acting the part| date=2008-05-22 url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/19160244.html?location_refer=Vikings |website=startribune.com |archive-date=2008-05-26 |first1=Kevin |last1=Seifert}}</ref>  Childress threw a \"Coaching 101\" clinic for media reporters in which he played a tape of Jackson showing the progress he made in 2007 through a series of missed passes or poor decisions that he made in early games but executed properly in later contests and concluded with some tape of him hitting a target net with every 15-yard pass he threw during an offseason drill.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014115851/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/coaching_101_clinic.html Coaching 101 clinic]</ref>  Offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] repeatedly told the press that although it was Jackson's third year with the Vikings it was really his second year playing, and NFL quarterbacks improve the most between their first and second years.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080727125711/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/bevell_on_tjack.html Bevell on T-Jack]</ref>  Jackson had another good preseason, until he injured his knee again in the second preseason game which kept him from playing the last two preseason games.

In the first game of the regular season against the [[2008 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]], Jackson threw a game-ending interception and in the second game the Vikings made five field goal attempts and no touchdowns against the [[2008 Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis Colts]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809080gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - September 8th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809140min.htm |title=Indianapolis Colts at Minnesota Vikings - September 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings lost both games by close margins, and Jackson's 64.8 passer rating ranked him 26th in the NFL. Childress said in the second post-game press conference that Jackson would still definitely be the starter next week, but on Monday after a coaches' meeting he changed his mind and benched Jackson for the remainder of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/|title=Official Blog of the National Football League|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>
[[File:20090104 Chester Taylor.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Jackson (7) with the Vikings.]]
After being relegated to backup after the loss to the Colts, Jackson saw his next significant action in Week 14 against [[2008 Detroit Lions|Detroit]], where he played the entire second half in place of an injured [[Gus Frerotte]]. With the Vikings trailing 6-3 at halftime to the winless Lions, Jackson completed eight of ten passes for 105 yards and a touchdown, an 11-yard strike to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]] that would be the game-winning score for the Vikings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2008/12/07/tarvaris-jackson-steps-in-for-gus-frerotte-leads-minnesota-vikings-to-comeback-victory/|title=Tarvaris Jackson steps in for Gus Frerotte, leads Minnesota Vikings to comeback victory – Twin Cities|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>  The following week, with Frerotte still injured, Jackson was the starting quarterback against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals|Arizona Cardinals]] and he played arguably the best game of his career.  Jackson completed 11 of 17 passes for 163 yards and, most impressively, threw four touchdown passes and no interceptions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812140crd.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Arizona Cardinals - December 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance as well as the [[FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week|FedEx Air Player of the Week]] award.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2008/week_15.htm |title=2008 NFL Week 15 Leaders & Scores |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

The Vikings lost 24-17 to the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta Falcons]] in Week 16 despite Jackson's performance.  He completed 22 of 36 passes for 233 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions.  He also rushed for 76 yards (which matched the total of Pro-Bowl running back [[Adrian Peterson]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812210min.htm |title=Atlanta Falcons at Minnesota Vikings - December 21st, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>  With the Vikings in a win-and-in situation against the [[2008 New York Giants|New York Giants]] in Week 17, Jackson overcame an interception in the end zone by leading the Vikings on a touchdown drive (a 54-yard strike to [[Bernard Berrian]]) and the game-winning field goal drive on the following possessions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812280min.htm |title=New York Giants at Minnesota Vikings - December 28th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings defeated the Giants 20-19 and earned the NFC North title.

Next up: Philadelphia Eagles – Twin Cities|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

The Vikings season ended in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs with a loss to the [[2008 Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia Eagles]]. Jackson went 15-for-35 for 164 yards in the game with one interception.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200901040min.htm |title=Wild Card - Philadelphia Eagles at Minnesota Vikings - January 4th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

====2009 season====
Jackson went into the 2009 season in competition for a starting job with [[Sage Rosenfels]], who the Vikings had acquired from the [[Houston Texans]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3939155 |title=Vikings acquire Rosenfels, give QB new contract |date=February 27, 2009 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings also pursued former [[New York Jets]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]], who had retired after the end of the 2008 season. Favre announced that he would not join the Vikings prior to [[training camp]], however, and Jackson and Rosenfels split duties in the early part of camp.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090731104335/http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/The_Trenches/entry/view/28956/vikings_favre_will_stay_retired The Sporting News]</ref> Jackson was the second quarterback to play in the opening preseason game, and was expected to start the second preseason game against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballhype.com/article/minnesota_vikings_qb_tarvaris_jackson_gets_chance_to/|title=Home - Future PLC|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

That changed, however, when Favre announced that he would play for the Vikings after all, signing with the team on August 19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4406963|title=Purple reign: Indecisive Favre signs with Vikings|date=August 19, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Jackson, Rosenfels, and 2008 third-stringer [[John David Booty]] were believed to be competing for two roster spots, and for the primary backup job. Many observers believed the Vikings would attempt to trade Jackson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/240097-with-favre-on-board-who-will-be-the-odd-man-out|title=With Favre on Board, Who Will Be the Odd Man Out?|first=Brett|last=Stott|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Jackson helped his case with a strong performance in Favre's debut game against the [[2009 Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City Chiefs]], throwing for 202 yards and two touchdowns in backup work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290821016|title=Chiefs vs. Vikings - Game Recap - August 21, 2009 - ESPN|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Ultimately, the Vikings elected to keep Jackson and Rosenfels on the active roster, with Jackson as the primary backup to Favre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|title=Fantasy Football Forum|accessdate=July 1, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310113848/http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|archivedate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

Jackson entered the Vikings' first two games of the season in [[garbage time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009091304/2009/REG1/vikings@browns|title=Watch Minnesota Vikings vs. Cleveland Browns [09/13/2009] - NFL.com|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/3595/third-and-one-vikings-2|title=Third and one: Vikings|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> He also was used as a decoy in [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] coverage during week two.

====2010 season====
The Vikings re-signed Jackson on Monday, April 19 as they waited for Favre to decide whether he would return for another season, which he did.  Jackson was a restricted free agent who was given a one-year tender worth $1.176 million. Jackson backed up Favre for the 2010 season.

Jackson took over for an injured Favre in Week 8 against the [[2010 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]]. Jackson threw for one touchdown in the loss.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201010310nwe.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at New England Patriots - October 31st, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson took over for an injured Favre yet again in Week 13 against the [[2010 Buffalo Bills|Buffalo Bills]].

On March 3, 2011, the Vikings declined to tender Jackson a contract offer to play for them in the 2011 season. Under league rules, Jackson became an [[unrestricted free agent]].

===Seattle Seahawks===
Jackson officially signed a two-year contract with Seattle Seahawks on July 29, 2011<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Seahawks-Sign-Rookie-Veterans-and-Draft-Pick-to-Roster/7fe2920f-0f50-4029-a6c1-77eefde2eb0b |title=Seahawks Sign Rookie, Veterans and Draft Pick to Roster |date=July 29, 2011 |website=Seahawks.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318002841/http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Seahawks-Sign-Rookie-Veterans-and-Draft-Pick-to-Roster/7fe2920f-0f50-4029-a6c1-77eefde2eb0b |archive-date=March 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref> and was announced as the starting quarterback shortly after.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Carroll-hands-the-ball-to-T-Jack/c7e3f5c1-cbc1-412f-a859-c84c7bc00a15 |title=Carroll hands the ball to T-Jack |date=July 30, 2011 |website=Seahawks.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318002303/http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Carroll-hands-the-ball-to-T-Jack/c7e3f5c1-cbc1-412f-a859-c84c7bc00a15 |archive-date=March 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref> In Seattle, he had been reunited with offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] and wide receiver [[Sidney Rice]] both members of the Vikings during his time there. Along with [[wide receiver]] [[Mike Williams (wide receiver, born 1984)|Mike Williams]], Jackson was appointed to offensive team captain, which was previously owned by [[Matt Hasselbeck]], who signed with the [[Tennessee Titans]].

'''Tarvaris Jackson''' (April 21, 1983 – April 12, 2020) was an American professional [[American football|football]] player who was a [[quarterback]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). Jackson played [[college football]] for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas Razorbacks]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State Hornets]]. He played professionally for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].

The Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008-09 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game.  Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] over the [[Denver Broncos]].

Vikings scouts and personnel had reportedly been watching him closely in secret over his senior season, particularly liking his performance in the [[East-West Shrine Game]]. They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected. On July 26, 2006, Jackson signed a four-year deal with Minnesota, including a $1 million signing bonus.<ref>\"[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/football/060726/f072680.html Vikings sign quarterback Tarvaris Jackson to four-year contract]\". Originally published on July 26, 2006. Retrieved on April 16, 2007.</ref>

Vikings coach [[Brad Childress]] was quoted days before the draft as saying he was interested in finding a \"developmental guy\", a \"diamond in the rough\" quarterback of the future, raw talent he could teach a system.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070318124007/http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&pk=FBN-VIKINGS-04-26-06 Childress Quotes before draft]. Childress quotes before the draft.</ref> Both new coach Childress and Vikings former quarterback [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] had had success developing quarterbacks in the past, including [[A. J. Feeley]] and [[Donovan McNabb]].

The day after the draft, Childress was quoted by the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' as saying: \"I think you judge quarterbacks a little bit differently...When you see what you want at the quarterback position, you need to go get it. And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic.  He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach. So what can he do with coaching?\"<ref>\"That's a good question,\" many people reply, noting that Jackson is Seattle's only Black Mormon.

===Minnesota Vikings===

====2006 season====
Jackson's 2006 pre-season [[passer rating]] was 106.1, 15th in the league out of 110 quarterbacks who performed. Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.

On September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that. So it's obvious that Brad is still our quarterback so we can stay on that.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Staring at a Quarterback Controversy|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=/nfl/news/ABN4052702.htm|author=Benoit, Andy|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In Week 15, Johnson started the game but was benched in the fourth quarter when the Vikings had been underperforming the entire game losing by a score of 26-7 at the time Jackson went in late in the third quarter against the [[2006 New York Jets|New York Jets]]. Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead. He also threw an interception in the red zone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612170min.htm |title=New York Jets at Minnesota Vikings - December 17th, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Jackson was named the starting quarterback for Minnesota towards the end of his rookie season.  Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].  Game conditions were very poor.  A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9-7 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass). Jackson had a passer rating of 36.5, had a 50% completion rate (10-20 for 50 yards), one interception, and one fumble.  Packers quarterback Brett Favre only managed a slightly better 52% completion rate (26-50) and threw two interceptions. He threw for 285 yards with no touchdowns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612210gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - December 21st, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

====2007 season====
Jackson did not live up to the Vikings' expectations in 2007 despite finishing 8-4 as a starter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JackTa00/gamelog/2007/ |title=Tarvaris Jackson 2007 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson had nine touchdowns and 12 interceptions, along with a 159 yards per game, causing the Vikings to have the second-worst passing offense in the NFL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/index.htm |title=2007 NFL Standings & Team Stats |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> His 70.8 passer rating was 28th among NFL quarterbacks.  Jackson missed three games because of injuries, which included a strained groin, a concussion and a fractured index finger. The Vikings failed to make the playoffs.  Analysts put the Vikings' 8-8 record on the successful running of [[Chester Taylor]] and rookie [[Adrian Peterson]], which took the pressure off of Jackson and the defense.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min/2007.htm |title=2007 Minnesota Vikings Statistics & Players |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Later in the season, opponents decided to focus all their defensive efforts on stopping Peterson and the Vikings running game, while daring Jackson to beat them in the passing game.  The [[2007 Washington Redskins|Washington Redskins]] successfully utilized five [[defensive lineman]] or four [[linebackers]] against the Vikings, leaving only two or three defensive backs in pass coverage.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225070431/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12791702.html Washington D focuses all its attention on Peterson]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/27/AR2007122702318.html|title=Wrinkles Changed Playoff Complexion|first=Jason|last=Reid|date=December 28, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>  And the 49ers blitzed their [[cornerback]]s 20 percent of the time instead of covering receivers with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12522941.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiU9PmP:QiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU|title=Patrick Reusse: Fans shouldn't go overboard on Jackson yet|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723221658/http://www.wtov9.com/sports/14824511/detail.html Vikings Enjoying Quite A Turnaround]</ref>  On the season's last game against the [[2007 Denver Broncos|Denver Broncos]], Jackson led the Vikings to two fourth quarter drives to tie the game and send it into overtime. In overtime, however, Jackson fumbled on the second play and the Vikings lost the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200712300den.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Denver Broncos - December 30th, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson showed slow improvement over the season: he played a large role when the Vikings went on a five-game winning streak in November, but also showed his inexperience in several ill-judged interceptions, jump passes, and turnovers.  After the season, Childress would not say if Tarvaris Jackson would be the starter in 2008, explaining that he wanted to \"evaluate the total body of work\" first.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071226171506/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12806557.html Childress noncommittal over quarterback's long-term future]</ref>

====2008 season====
There was a lot of media coverage on Jackson the summer of 2008. The Vikings returned seven players that were in the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] (only three teams had more), and spent $60 million in guaranteed contract money upgrading their team with [[Jared Allen]], traded from the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and free agents [[Bernard Berrian]] and [[Madieu Williams]]. Several analysts believed better quarterback play was all that was needed to make the Vikings one of the top contending teams in the NFL, and with the [[Green Bay Packers]] losing [[Brett Favre]] the [[NFC North Division]] was up for grabs.  [[Sport's Illustrated]]'s [[Paul Lionel Zimmerman|Paul Zimmerman]] predicted the Vikings would win the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/dr_z/06/20/vikings/index.html|title=Dare I pick Minnesota to win it all?|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Head coach Brad Childress decided to stay with Jackson as the starting quarterback and brought in [[Gus Frerotte]] to be his backup. It was widely reported in the off-season that Jackson had a new swagger, handled situations in practice well where he looked lost in the previous years, and had an improved grasp of the Vikings offensive system.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526142945/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/19160244.html?location_refer=Vikings |title=QB Jackson acting the part| url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/19160244.html?location_refer=Vikings |website=startribune.com |archive-date=2008-05-26 |first1=Kevin |last1=Seifert}}</ref>  Childress threw a \"Coaching 101\" clinic for media reporters in which he played a tape of Jackson showing the progress he made in 2007 through a series of missed passes or poor decisions that he made in early games but executed properly in later contests and concluded with some tape of him hitting a target net with every 15-yard pass he threw during an offseason drill.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014115851/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/coaching_101_clinic.html Coaching 101 clinic]</ref>  Offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] repeatedly told the press that although it was Jackson's third year with the Vikings it was really his second year playing, and NFL quarterbacks improve the most between their first and second years.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080727125711/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/bevell_on_tjack.html Bevell on T-Jack]</ref>  Jackson had another good preseason, until he injured his knee again in the second preseason game which kept him from playing the last two preseason games.

In the first game of the regular season against the [[2008 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]], Jackson threw a game-ending interception and in the second game the Vikings made five field goal attempts and no touchdowns against the [[2008 Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis Colts]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809080gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - September 8th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809140min.htm |title=Indianapolis Colts at Minnesota Vikings - September 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings lost both games by close margins, and Jackson's 64.8 passer rating ranked him 26th in the NFL. Childress said in the second post-game press conference that Jackson would still definitely be the starter next week, but on Monday after a coaches' meeting he changed his mind and benched Jackson for the remainder of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/|title=Official Blog of the National Football League|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>
[[File:20090104 Chester Taylor.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Jackson (7) with the Vikings.]]
After being relegated to backup after the loss to the Colts, Jackson saw his next significant action in Week 14 against [[2008 Detroit Lions|Detroit]], where he played the entire second half in place of an injured [[Gus Frerotte]]. With the Vikings trailing 6-3 at halftime to the winless Lions, Jackson completed eight of ten passes for 105 yards and a touchdown, an 11-yard strike to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]] that would be the game-winning score for the Vikings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2008/12/07/tarvaris-jackson-steps-in-for-gus-frerotte-leads-minnesota-vikings-to-comeback-victory/|title=Tarvaris Jackson steps in for Gus Frerotte, leads Minnesota Vikings to comeback victory – Twin Cities|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>  The following week, with Frerotte still injured, Jackson was the starting quarterback against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals|Arizona Cardinals]] and he played arguably the best game of his career.  Jackson completed 11 of 17 passes for 163 yards and, most impressively, threw four touchdown passes and no interceptions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812140crd.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Arizona Cardinals - December 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance as well as the [[FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week|FedEx Air Player of the Week]] award.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2008/week_15.htm |title=2008 NFL Week 15 Leaders & Scores |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

The Vikings lost 24-17 to the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta Falcons]] in Week 16 despite Jackson's performance.  He completed 22 of 36 passes for 233 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions.  He also rushed for 76 yards (which matched the total of Pro-Bowl running back [[Adrian Peterson]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812210min.htm |title=Atlanta Falcons at Minnesota Vikings - December 21st, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>  With the Vikings in a win-and-in situation against the [[2008 New York Giants|New York Giants]] in Week 17, Jackson overcame an interception in the end zone by leading the Vikings on a touchdown drive (a 54-yard strike to [[Bernard Berrian]]) and the game-winning field goal drive on the following possessions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812280min.htm |title=New York Giants at Minnesota Vikings - December 28th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings defeated the Giants 20-19 and earned the NFC North title.

Next up: Philadelphia Eagles – Twin Cities|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

The Vikings season ended in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs with a loss to the [[2008 Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia Eagles]]. Jackson went 15-for-35 for 164 yards in the game with one interception.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200901040min.htm |title=Wild Card - Philadelphia Eagles at Minnesota Vikings - January 4th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

====2009 season====
Jackson went into the 2009 season in competition for a starting job with [[Sage Rosenfels]], who the Vikings had acquired from the [[Houston Texans]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3939155 |title=Vikings acquire Rosenfels, give QB new contract |date=February 27, 2009 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings also pursued former [[New York Jets]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]], who had retired after the end of the 2008 season. Favre announced that he would not join the Vikings prior to [[training camp]], however, and Jackson and Rosenfels split duties in the early part of camp.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090731104335/http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/The_Trenches/entry/view/28956/vikings_favre_will_stay_retired The Sporting News]</ref> Jackson was the second quarterback to play in the opening preseason game, and was expected to start the second preseason game against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballhype.com/article/minnesota_vikings_qb_tarvaris_jackson_gets_chance_to/|title=Home - Future PLC|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

That changed, however, when Favre announced that he would play for the Vikings after all, signing with the team on August 19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4406963|title=Purple reign: Indecisive Favre signs with Vikings|date=August 19, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Jackson, Rosenfels, and 2008 third-stringer [[John David Booty]] were believed to be competing for two roster spots, and for the primary backup job. Many observers believed the Vikings would attempt to trade Jackson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/240097-with-favre-on-board-who-will-be-the-odd-man-out|title=With Favre on Board, Who Will Be the Odd Man Out?|first=Brett|last=Stott|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Jackson helped his case with a strong performance in Favre's debut game against the [[2009 Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City Chiefs]], throwing for 202 yards and two touchdowns in backup work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290821016|title=Chiefs vs. Vikings - Game Recap - August 21, 2009 - ESPN|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Ultimately, the Vikings elected to keep Jackson and Rosenfels on the active roster, with Jackson as the primary backup to Favre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|title=Fantasy Football Forum|accessdate=July 1, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310113848/http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|archivedate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

Jackson entered the Vikings' first two games of the season in [[garbage time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009091304/2009/REG1/vikings@browns|title=Watch Minnesota Vikings vs. Cleveland Browns [09/13/2009] - NFL.com|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/3595/third-and-one-vikings-2|title=Third and one: Vikings|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> He also was used as a decoy in [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] coverage during week two.

====2010 season====
The Vikings re-signed Jackson on Monday, April 19 as they waited for Favre to decide whether he would return for another season, which he did.  Jackson was a restricted free agent who was given a one-year tender worth $1.176 million. Jackson backed up Favre for the 2010 season.

Jackson took over for an injured Favre in Week 8 against the [[2010 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]]. Jackson threw for one touchdown in the loss.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201010310nwe.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at New England Patriots - October 31st, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson took over for an injured Favre yet again in Week 13 against the [[2010 Buffalo Bills|Buffalo Bills]].

On March 3, 2011, the Vikings declined to tender Jackson a contract offer to play for them in the 2011 season. Under league rules, Jackson became an [[unrestricted free agent]].

===Seattle Seahawks===
Jackson officially signed a two-year contract with Seattle Seahawks on July 29, 2011<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Seahawks-Sign-Rookie-Veterans-and-Draft-Pick-to-Roster/7fe2920f-0f50-4029-a6c1-77eefde2eb0b |title=Seahawks Sign Rookie, Veterans and Draft Pick to Roster |date=July 29, 2011 |website=Seahawks.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318002841/http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Seahawks-Sign-Rookie-Veterans-and-Draft-Pick-to-Roster/7fe2920f-0f50-4029-a6c1-77eefde2eb0b |archive-date=March 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref> and was announced as the starting quarterback shortly after.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Carroll-hands-the-ball-to-T-Jack/c7e3f5c1-cbc1-412f-a859-c84c7bc00a15 |title=Carroll hands the ball to T-Jack |date=July 30, 2011 |website=Seahawks.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318002303/http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Carroll-hands-the-ball-to-T-Jack/c7e3f5c1-cbc1-412f-a859-c84c7bc00a15 |archive-date=March 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref> In Seattle, he had been reunited with offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] and wide receiver [[Sidney Rice]] both members of the Vikings during his time there. Along with [[wide receiver]] [[Mike Williams (wide receiver, born 1984)|Mike Williams]], Jackson was appointed to offensive team captain, which was previously owned by [[Matt Hasselbeck]], who signed with the [[Tennessee Titans]].

The '''Papal States''' ({{IPAc-en|p|eɪ|p|ə|l}}) ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}), officially the '''State of the Church''' ({{lang-it|Stato della Chiesa}}, {{IPA-it|ˈstaːto della ˈkjeːza}}; {{lang-la|Status Ecclesiasticus}};<ref>Frederik de Wit, [http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/ihd/content/titleinfo/3220872 \"Status Ecclesiasticus et Magnus Ducatus Thoscanae\" (1700)]</ref> also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}''), were a series of territories in the [[Italian Peninsula]] under the direct [[Sovereign|sovereign]] rule of the [[pope]], from the 8th century until 1870. They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.

By 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].

==Name==
The Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.

==History==
{{further|History of Rome|History of the Papacy}}

===Origins===
{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}

For its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schnürer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 July 2014</ref> Early congregations met in rooms set aside for that purpose in the homes of well-to-do individuals, and a number of [[churches of Rome|early churches]], known as [[titular church]]es and located on the outskirts of [[Ancient Rome]], were held as property by individuals, rather than by the Church itself. Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome and thus, under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>

This system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated; in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them.<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>

Other donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. However, the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from [[Ravenna]], where the Emperor's representative, or [[Exarch of Ravenna|Exarch]], was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEvedy|first1=Colin|title=The Penguin atlas of medieval history|date=1961|publisher=Penguin Books|page=32|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rjHVAAAAMAAJ&q=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlns3LrcHKAhVM1hQKHcgFBd84ChDoAQgrMAE|quote=... separated from their theoretical overlord in Pavia by the continuing Imperial control of the Rome-Ravenna corridor.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Charles|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199651924|page=661|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UtMVAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The empire retained control only of Rome, Ravenna, a fragile corridor between them, ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-752|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317678175|page=230|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=In 749 Ratchis embarked on a bid to capture Perusia, the key to the Rome-Ravenna land corridor}}</ref>), plus coastal exclaves.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|page=378}}

With effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the [[Duchy of Rome]], an area roughly equivalent to [[Lazio|modern-day Latium]], became an independent state ruled by the pope.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=1060}}

The Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; [[Pope Gregory II]] even [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] during the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through [[diplomacy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]] on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>

===Donation of Pepin===
{{main|Donation of Pepin}}
When the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards – taking control of northern Italy – and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.

In 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]], and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.

===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===
{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}
The precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] – and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] – is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.

Events in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum|''Saeculum obscurum'']] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[Émile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'église au pouvoir des laïques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'Église depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>

In practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.

Over several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.

===Avignon Papacy===
{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}

[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]

From 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings. This period was known as the \"Avignonese\" or \"Babylonian Captivity\".{{sfn|Spielvogel|2013|pages=245-246}}{{sfn|Elm|Mixson|2015|page=154}}{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=241}}{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|pages=220, 982}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Noble|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1285661537|page=304|edition=7|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Td4WAAAAQBAJ&dq=avignon+babylonian+captivity+1309-1377&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The Babylonian Captivity, 1309–1377|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Butt|first1=John J.|title=The Greenwood Dictionary of World History|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313327650|page=[https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0/page/36 36]|url=https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0|url-access=registration|quote=Term (coined by [[Petrarch]]) for the papal residence in Avignon (1309–1377), in reference to the Babylonian Captivity (...)}}</ref> During this period the city of Avignon itself was added to the Papal States; it remained a papal possession for some 400 years even after the popes returned to Rome, until it was seized and incorporated into the French state during the [[French Revolution]].

During this [[Avignon Papacy]], local [[Despotism|despots]] took advantage of the absence of the popes to establish themselves in nominally papal cities: the [[Pepoli]] in Bologna, the [[Ordelaffi]] in [[Forlì]], the [[Manfredi family|Manfredi]] in [[Faenza]], the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] in [[Rimini]] all gave nominal acknowledgement to their papal overlords and were declared vicars of the Church.

In Ferrara, the death of [[Azzo VIII d'Este]] without legitimate heirs (1308{{sfn|Menache|2003|page=142}}) encouraged Pope Clement V to bring Ferrara under his direct rule: however, it was governed by his appointed vicar, [[King Robert of Naples]], for only nine years before the citizens recalled the [[House of Este|Este]] from exile (1317); interdiction and excommunications were in vain: in 1332 John XXII was obliged to name three Este brothers as his vicars in Ferrara.{{sfn|Waley|1966|page=62}}

In Rome itself the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and the [[Colonna family|Colonna]] struggled for supremacy,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=802}} dividing the city's ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'' between them. The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of [[Cola di Rienzo]], who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=225}} and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} As Prof. [[Guido Ruggiero]] states, \"even with the support of [[Petrarch]], his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}}

The Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who was appointed papal legate, and his [[condottieri]] heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forlì, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forlì. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on 29 April 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. [[Pope Urban V]] ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=19}}

[[File:RomaPalazzoQuirinale.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Quirinal Palace]], papal residence and home to the civil offices of the Papal States from the [[Renaissance]] until their annexation]]

===Renaissance===
During [[the Renaissance]], the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.

Papal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/italy/milxpapalstate.html|title= History of the Papal States|work=World History at KDMLA|first=Alexander |last=Ganse|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> Julius II, the \"Warrior Pope\", fought on their behalf.

===Reformation===
The [[Reformation]] began in 1517. In 1527, before the Holy Roman Empire fought the Protestants, troops loyal to [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Emperor Charles V]] brutally [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Rome]] and imprisoned [[Pope Clement VII]], as a side effect of battles over the Papal States. <ref name=\"Durant1\">

This period saw a gradual revival of the pope's temporal power in the Papal States. Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}

At its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy – [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]]. It also included the small enclaves of [[Benevento]] and [[Pontecorvo]] in southern Italy and the larger [[Comtat Venaissin]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France.

===Napoleonic era===
[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumb|Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the [[Napoleonic wars]] changed the face of the peninsula.]]

The [[French Revolution]] affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the [[Comtat Venaissin]] and [[Avignon]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}) were seized and became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

Two years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] declared a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (February 1798).{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} [[Pope Pius VI]] fled to [[Siena]], and died in exile in Valence (France) in 1799.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} The [[French Consulate]] restored the Papal States in June 1800 and the newly-elected [[Pope Pius VII]] took up residency in Rome, but the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] under [[Napoleon]] invaded in 1808, and this time on 17 May 1809 the remainder of the States of the Church were annexed to France,{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}} forming the ''[[département]]s'' of ''[[Tibre]]'' and ''[[Trasimène]]''.

Following the fall of the Napoleonic system in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] officially restored the Italian territories of the Papal States (but not the Comtat Venaissin or Avignon) to Vatican control.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

From 1814 until the death of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1846, the popes followed a [[reactionary]] policy in the Papal States. For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.

===Italian unification===
{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.

The nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government.

As a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War of 1859]], Sardinia-Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|page=136}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulafia|first1=David|title=The Mediterranean in History|date=2003|publisher=Getty Publication|isbn=978-0892367252|page=268|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LrRzgSebSZMC&dq=Giuseppe+Garibaldi+overthrew+bourbon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Mediterranean as a battleground|quote=(...) under Giuseppe Garibaldi to overthrow the Neapolitan Bourbons. After defeating a Neapolitan force at Calatafirmi, Caribaldi captured Palermo after three days of street fighting.}}</ref> Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government, the Piedmont government petitioned French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the south. This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.

[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]

A unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a [[plebiscite]] the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}}

Despite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \"[[Law of Guarantees]]\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy – then under [[Pius XI]] – renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.

==Regional governors==

As the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.

==Papal military==
Historically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>
In 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]], Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.<ref>Charles A. Coulombe, ''The Pope's Legion: The Multinational Fighting Force that Defended the Vatican'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008</ref>

The Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the [[Palatine Guard]], which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]];{{sfn|Levillain|2002|page=1095}} the [[Noble Guard]], which also disbanded in 1970; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force.

A small [[Papal Navy]] was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.

The '''Papal States''' ({{IPAc-en|p|eɪ|p|ə|l}}) ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}), officially the '''State of the Church''' ({{lang-it|Stato della Chiesa}}, {{IPA-it|ˈstaːto della ˈkjeːza}}; {{lang-la|Status Ecclesiasticus}};<ref>Frederik de Wit, [http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/ihd/content/titleinfo/3220872 \"Status Ecclesiasticus et Magnus Ducatus Thoscanae\" (1700)]</ref> also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}''), were a series of territories in the [[Italian Peninsula]] under the direct [[Sovereign|sovereign]] rule of the [[pope]], from the 8th century until 1870. They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.

By 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].

==Name==
The Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.

{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}

For its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schnürer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 July 2014</ref> Early congregations met in rooms set aside for that purpose in the homes of well-to-do individuals, and a number of [[churches of Rome|early churches]], known as [[titular church]]es and located on the outskirts of [[Ancient Rome]], were held as property by individuals, rather than by the Church itself. Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome and thus, under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>

This system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated; in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them.<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>

Other donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. However, the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from [[Ravenna]], where the Emperor's representative, or [[Exarch of Ravenna|Exarch]], was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEvedy|first1=Colin|title=The Penguin atlas of medieval history|date=1961|publisher=Penguin Books|page=32|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rjHVAAAAMAAJ&q=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlns3LrcHKAhVM1hQKHcgFBd84ChDoAQgrMAE|quote=... separated from their theoretical overlord in Pavia by the continuing Imperial control of the Rome-Ravenna corridor.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Charles|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199651924|page=661|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UtMVAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The empire retained control only of Rome, Ravenna, a fragile corridor between them, ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-752|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317678175|page=230|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=In 749 Ratchis embarked on a bid to capture Perusia, the key to the Rome-Ravenna land corridor}}</ref>), plus coastal exclaves.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|page=378}}

With effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the [[Duchy of Rome]], an area roughly equivalent to [[Lazio|modern-day Latium]], became an independent state ruled by the pope.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=1060}}

The Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; [[Pope Gregory II]] even [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] during the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through [[diplomacy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]] on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>

===Donation of Pepin===
{{main|Donation of Pepin}}
When the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards – taking control of northern Italy – and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.

In 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]], and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.

===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===
{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}
The precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] – and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] – is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.

Events in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum|''Saeculum obscurum'']] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[Émile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'église au pouvoir des laïques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'Église depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>

In practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.

Over several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.

===Avignon Papacy===
{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}

[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]

From 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings. This period was known as the \"Avignonese\" or \"Babylonian Captivity\".{{sfn|Spielvogel|2013|pages=245-246}}{{sfn|Elm|Mixson|2015|page=154}}{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=241}}{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|pages=220, 982}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Noble|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1285661537|page=304|edition=7|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Td4WAAAAQBAJ&dq=avignon+babylonian+captivity+1309-1377&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The Babylonian Captivity, 1309–1377|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Butt|first1=John J.|title=The Greenwood Dictionary of World History|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313327650|page=[https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0/page/36 36]|url=https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0|url-access=registration|quote=Term (coined by [[Petrarch]]) for the papal residence in Avignon (1309–1377), in reference to the Babylonian Captivity (...)}}</ref> During this period the city of Avignon itself was added to the Papal States; it remained a papal possession for some 400 years even after the popes returned to Rome, until it was seized and incorporated into the French state during the [[French Revolution]].

During this [[Avignon Papacy]], local [[Despotism|despots]] took advantage of the absence of the popes to establish themselves in nominally papal cities: the [[Pepoli]] in Bologna, the [[Ordelaffi]] in [[Forlì]], the [[Manfredi family|Manfredi]] in [[Faenza]], the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] in [[Rimini]] all gave nominal acknowledgement to their papal overlords and were declared vicars of the Church.

In Ferrara, the death of [[Azzo VIII d'Este]] without legitimate heirs (1308{{sfn|Menache|2003|page=142}}) encouraged Pope Clement V to bring Ferrara under his direct rule: however, it was governed by his appointed vicar, [[King Robert of Naples]], for only nine years before the citizens recalled the [[House of Este|Este]] from exile (1317); interdiction and excommunications were in vain: in 1332 John XXII was obliged to name three Este brothers as his vicars in Ferrara.{{sfn|Waley|1966|page=62}}

In Rome itself the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and the [[Colonna family|Colonna]] struggled for supremacy,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=802}} dividing the city's ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'' between them. The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of [[Cola di Rienzo]], who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=225}} and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} As Prof. [[Guido Ruggiero]] states, \"even with the support of [[Petrarch]], his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}}

The Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who was appointed papal legate, and his [[condottieri]] heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forlì, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forlì. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. [[Pope Urban V]] ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=19}}

===Renaissance===
During [[the Renaissance]], the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.

Papal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/italy/milxpapalstate.html|title= History of the Papal States|work=World History at KDMLA|first=Alexander |last=Ganse|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> Julius II, the \"Warrior Pope\", fought on their behalf.

===Reformation===
The [[Reformation]] began in 1517. In 1527, before the Holy Roman Empire fought the Protestants, troops loyal to [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Emperor Charles V]] brutally [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Rome]] and imprisoned [[Pope Clement VII]], as a side effect of battles over the Papal States. <ref name=\"Durant1\">

This period saw a gradual revival of the pope's temporal power in the Papal States. Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}

At its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy — [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]]. It also included the small enclaves of [[Benevento]] and [[Pontecorvo]] in southern Italy and the larger [[Comtat Venaissin]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France.

===Napoleonic era===
[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumb|Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the [[Napoleonic wars]] changed the face of the peninsula.]]

The [[French Revolution]] affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the [[Comtat Venaissin]] and [[Avignon]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}) were seized and became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

Two years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] declared a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} (February 1798). [[Pope Pius VI]] fled to [[Siena]], and died in exile in Valence (France) in 1799.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} The [[French Consulate]] restored the Papal States in June 1800 and the newly-elected [[Pope Pius VII]] took up residency in Rome, but the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] under [[Napoleon]] invaded in 1808, and this time on 17 May 1809, the remainder of the States of the Church were annexed to France,{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}} forming the ''[[département]]s'' of ''[[Tibre]]'' and ''[[Trasimène]]''.

Following the fall of the Napoleonic system in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] officially restored the Italian territories of the Papal States (but not the Comtat Venaissin or Avignon) to Vatican control.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

From 1814 until the death of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1846, the popes followed a [[reactionary]] policy in the Papal States. For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.

===Italian unification===
{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.

The nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government.

As a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War of 1859]], Sardinia-Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|page=136}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulafia|first1=David|title=The Mediterranean in History|date=2003|publisher=Getty Publication|isbn=978-0892367252|page=268|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LrRzgSebSZMC&dq=Giuseppe+Garibaldi+overthrew+bourbon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Mediterranean as a battleground|quote=(...) under Giuseppe Garibaldi to overthrow the Neapolitan Bourbons. After defeating a Neapolitan force at Calatafirmi, Caribaldi captured Palermo after three days of street fighting.}}</ref> Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government, the Piedmont government petitioned French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the south. This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.

[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]

A unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a [[plebiscite]] the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}}

Despite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \"[[Law of Guarantees]]\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy – then under [[Pius XI]] – renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.

==Regional governors==
[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]

As the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.

==Papal military==
Historically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>
In 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]], Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.<ref>Charles A.

The Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the [[Palatine Guard]], which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]];{{sfn|Levillain|2002|page=1095}} the [[Noble Guard]], which also disbanded in 1970; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force.

A small [[Papal Navy]] was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.

The '''Papal States''' ({{IPAc-en|p|eɪ|p|ə|l}}) ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}), officially the '''State of the Church''' ({{lang-it|Stato della Chiesa}}, {{IPA-it|ˈstaːto della ˈkjeːza}}; {{lang-la|Status Ecclesiasticus}};<ref>Frederik de Wit, [http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/ihd/content/titleinfo/3220872 \"Status Ecclesiasticus et Magnus Ducatus Thoscanae\" (1700)]</ref> also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}''), were a series of territories in the [[Italian Peninsula]] under the direct [[Sovereign|sovereign]] rule of the [[pope]], from the 8th century until 1870. They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.

By 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].

==Name==
The Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.

===Origins===
{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}

For its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schnürer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 July 2014</ref> Early congregations met in rooms set aside for that purpose in the homes of well-to-do individuals, and a number of [[churches of Rome|early churches]], known as [[titular church]]es and located on the outskirts of [[Ancient Rome]], were held as property by individuals, rather than by the Church itself. Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome and thus, under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>

This system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated; in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them.<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>

Other donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. However, the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from [[Ravenna]], where the Emperor's representative, or [[Exarch of Ravenna|Exarch]], was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEvedy|first1=Colin|title=The Penguin atlas of medieval history|date=1961|publisher=Penguin Books|page=32|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rjHVAAAAMAAJ&q=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlns3LrcHKAhVM1hQKHcgFBd84ChDoAQgrMAE|quote=... separated from their theoretical overlord in Pavia by the continuing Imperial control of the Rome-Ravenna corridor.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Charles|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199651924|page=661|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UtMVAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The empire retained control only of Rome, Ravenna, a fragile corridor between them, ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-752|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317678175|page=230|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=In 749 Ratchis embarked on a bid to capture Perusia, the key to the Rome-Ravenna land corridor}}</ref>), plus coastal exclaves.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|page=378}}

With effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the [[Duchy of Rome]], an area roughly equivalent to [[Lazio|modern-day Latium]], became an independent state ruled by the pope.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=1060}}

The Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; [[Pope Gregory II]] even [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] during the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through [[diplomacy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]] on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>

===Donation of Pepin===
{{main|Donation of Pepin}}
When the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards – taking control of northern Italy – and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.

In 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]], and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.

===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===
{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}
The precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] – and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] – is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.

Events in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum]] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[Émile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'église au pouvoir des laïques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'Église depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>

In practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.

Over several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.

===Avignon Papacy===
{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}

[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]

From 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings. This period was known as the \"Avignonese\" or \"Babylonian Captivity\".{{sfn|Spielvogel|2013|pages=245-246}}{{sfn|Elm|Mixson|2015|page=154}}{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=241}}{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|pages=220, 982}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Noble|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1285661537|page=304|edition=7|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Td4WAAAAQBAJ&dq=avignon+babylonian+captivity+1309-1377&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The Babylonian Captivity, 1309–1377|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Butt|first1=John J.|title=The Greenwood Dictionary of World History|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313327650|page=[https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0/page/36 36]|url=https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0|url-access=registration|quote=Term (coined by [[Petrarch]]) for the papal residence in Avignon (1309–1377), in reference to the Babylonian Captivity (...)}}</ref> During this period the city of Avignon itself was added to the Papal States; it remained a papal possession for some 400 years even after the popes returned to Rome, until it was seized and incorporated into the French state during the [[French Revolution]].

During this [[Avignon Papacy]], local [[Despotism|despots]] took advantage of the absence of the popes to establish themselves in nominally papal cities: the [[Pepoli]] in Bologna, the [[Ordelaffi]] in [[Forlì]], the [[Manfredi family|Manfredi]] in [[Faenza]], the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] in [[Rimini]] all gave nominal acknowledgement to their papal overlords and were declared vicars of the Church.

In Ferrara, the death of [[Azzo VIII d'Este]] without legitimate heirs (1308{{sfn|Menache|2003|page=142}}) encouraged Pope Clement V to bring Ferrara under his direct rule: however, it was governed by his appointed vicar, [[King Robert of Naples]], for only nine years before the citizens recalled the [[House of Este|Este]] from exile (1317); interdiction and excommunications were in vain: in 1332 John XXII was obliged to name three Este brothers as his vicars in Ferrara.{{sfn|Waley|1966|page=62}}

In Rome itself the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and the [[Colonna family|Colonna]] struggled for supremacy,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=802}} dividing the city's ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'' between them. The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of [[Cola di Rienzo]], who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=225}} and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} As Prof. [[Guido Ruggiero]] states, \"even with the support of [[Petrarch]], his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}}

The Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who was appointed papal legate, and his [[condottieri]] heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forlì, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forlì. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. [[Pope Urban V]] ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=19}}

[[File:RomaPalazzoQuirinale.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Quirinal Palace]], papal residence and home to the civil offices of the Papal States from the [[Renaissance]] until their annexation]]

===Renaissance===
During [[the Renaissance]], the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.

Papal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/italy/milxpapalstate.html|title= History of the Papal States|work=World History at KDMLA|first=Alexander |last=Ganse|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> Julius II, the \"Warrior Pope\", fought on their behalf.

===Reformation===
The [[Reformation]] began in 1517. In 1527, before the Holy Roman Empire fought the Protestants, troops loyal to [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Emperor Charles V]] brutally [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Rome]] and imprisoned [[Pope Clement VII]], as a side effect of battles over the Papal States. <ref name=\"Durant1\">

This period saw a gradual revival of the pope's temporal power in the Papal States. Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}

At its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy — [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]]. It also included the small enclaves of [[Benevento]] and [[Pontecorvo]] in southern Italy and the larger [[Comtat Venaissin]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France.

===Napoleonic era===
[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumb|Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the [[Napoleonic wars]] changed the face of the peninsula.]]

The [[French Revolution]] affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the [[Comtat Venaissin]] and [[Avignon]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}) were seized and became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

Two years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] declared a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} (February 1798). [[Pope Pius VI]] fled to [[Siena]], and died in exile in Valence (France) in 1799.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} The [[French Consulate]] restored the Papal States in June 1800 and the newly-elected [[Pope Pius VII]] took up residency in Rome, but the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] under [[Napoleon]] invaded in 1808, and this time on 17 May 1809, the remainder of the States of the Church were annexed to France,{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}} forming the ''[[département]]s'' of ''[[Tibre]]'' and ''[[Trasimène]]''.

Following the fall of the Napoleonic system in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] officially restored the Italian territories of the Papal States (but not the Comtat Venaissin or Avignon) to Vatican control.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

From 1814 until the death of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1846, the popes followed a [[reactionary]] policy in the Papal States. For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.

===Italian unification===
{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.

The nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government.

As a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War of 1859]], Sardinia-Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|page=136}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulafia|first1=David|title=The Mediterranean in History|date=2003|publisher=Getty Publication|isbn=978-0892367252|page=268|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LrRzgSebSZMC&dq=Giuseppe+Garibaldi+overthrew+bourbon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Mediterranean as a battleground|quote=(...) under Giuseppe Garibaldi to overthrow the Neapolitan Bourbons. After defeating a Neapolitan force at Calatafirmi, Caribaldi captured Palermo after three days of street fighting.}}</ref> Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government, the Piedmont government petitioned French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the south. This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.

[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]

A unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a [[plebiscite]] the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}}

Despite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \"[[Law of Guarantees]]\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy – then under [[Pius XI]] – renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.

==Regional governors==
[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]

As the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.

==Papal military==
Historically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>
In 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]], Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.<ref>Charles A. Coulombe, ''The Pope's Legion: The Multinational Fighting Force that Defended the Vatican'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008</ref>

The Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the [[Palatine Guard]], which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]];{{sfn|Levillain|2002|page=1095}} the [[Noble Guard]], which also disbanded in 1970; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force.

A small [[Papal Navy]] was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.

The '''Papal States''' ({{IPAc-en|p|eɪ|p|ə|l}}) ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}), officially the '''State of the Church''' ({{lang-it|Stato della Chiesa}}, {{IPA-it|ˈstaːto della ˈkjeːza}}; {{lang-la|Status Ecclesiasticus}};<ref>Frederik de Wit, [http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/ihd/content/titleinfo/3220872 \"Status Ecclesiasticus et Magnus Ducatus Thoscanae\" (1700)]</ref> also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}''), were a series of territories in the [[Italian Peninsula]] under the direct [[Sovereign|sovereign]] rule of the [[pope]], from the 8th century until 1870. They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.

By 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].

==Name==
The Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.

==History==
{{further|History of Rome|History of the Papacy}}

===Origins===
{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}

For its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schnürer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 July 2014</ref> Early congregations met in rooms set aside for that purpose in the homes of well-to-do individuals, and a number of [[churches of Rome|early churches]], known as [[titular church]]es and located on the outskirts of [[Ancient Rome]], were held as property by individuals, rather than by the Church itself. Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome, and thus under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>

This system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated (in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them).<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>

Other donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. But the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from [[Ravenna]], where the Emperor's representative, or [[Exarch of Ravenna|Exarch]], was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEvedy|first1=Colin|title=The Penguin atlas of medieval history|date=1961|publisher=Penguin Books|page=32|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rjHVAAAAMAAJ&q=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlns3LrcHKAhVM1hQKHcgFBd84ChDoAQgrMAE|quote=... separated from their theoretical overlord in Pavia by the continuing Imperial control of the Rome-Ravenna corridor.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Charles|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199651924|page=661|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UtMVAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The empire retained control only of Rome, Ravenna, a fragile corridor between them, ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-752|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317678175|page=230|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=In 749 Ratchis embarked on a bid to capture Perusia, the key to the Rome-Ravenna land corridor}}</ref>), plus coastal exclaves.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|page=378}}

With effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the [[Duchy of Rome]], an area roughly equivalent to [[Lazio|modern-day Latium]], became an independent state ruled by the pope.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=1060}}

The Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; [[Pope Gregory II]] even [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] during the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through [[diplomacy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]] on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>

===Donation of Pepin===
{{main|Donation of Pepin}}
When the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless  [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards – taking control of northern Italy – and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.

In 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]] and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.

===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===
{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}
The precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] – and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] – is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.

Events in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum]] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[Émile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'église au pouvoir des laïques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'Église depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>

In practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.

Over several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.

===Avignon Papacy===
{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}

[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]

From 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings. This period was known as the \"Avignonese\" or \"Babylonian Captivity\".{{sfn|Spielvogel|2013|pages=245-246}}{{sfn|Elm|Mixson|2015|page=154}}{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=241}}{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|pages=220, 982}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Noble|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1285661537|page=304|edition=7|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Td4WAAAAQBAJ&dq=avignon+babylonian+captivity+1309-1377&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The Babylonian Captivity, 1309–1377|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Butt|first1=John J.|title=The Greenwood Dictionary of World History|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313327650|page=[https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0/page/36 36]|url=https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0|url-access=registration|quote=Term (coined by [[Petrarch]]) for the papal residence in Avignon (1309–1377), in reference to the Babylonian Captivity (...)}}</ref> During this period the city of Avignon itself was added to the Papal States; it remained a papal possession for some 400 years even after the popes returned to Rome, until it was seized and incorporated into the French state during the [[French Revolution]].

During this [[Avignon Papacy]], local [[Despotism|despots]] took advantage of the absence of the popes to establish themselves in nominally papal cities: the [[Pepoli]] in Bologna, the [[Ordelaffi]] in [[Forlì]], the [[Manfredi family|Manfredi]] in [[Faenza]], the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] in [[Rimini]] all gave nominal acknowledgement to their papal overlords and were declared vicars of the Church.

In Ferrara, the death of [[Azzo VIII d'Este]] without legitimate heirs (1308{{sfn|Menache|2003|page=142}}) encouraged Pope Clement V to bring Ferrara under his direct rule: however, it was governed by his appointed vicar, [[King Robert of Naples]], for only nine years before the citizens recalled the [[House of Este|Este]] from exile (1317); interdiction and excommunications were in vain: in 1332 John XXII was obliged to name three Este brothers as his vicars in Ferrara.{{sfn|Waley|1966|page=62}}

In Rome itself the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and the [[Colonna family|Colonna]] struggled for supremacy,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=802}} dividing the city's ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'' between them. The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of [[Cola di Rienzo]], who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=225}} and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} As Prof. [[Guido Ruggiero]] states, \"even with the support of [[Petrarch]], his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}}

The Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who was appointed papal legate, and his [[condottieri]] heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forlì, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forlì. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. [[Pope Urban V]] ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=19}}

[[File:RomaPalazzoQuirinale.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Quirinal Palace]], papal residence and home to the civil offices of the Papal States from the [[Renaissance]] until their annexation]]

===Renaissance===
During [[the Renaissance]], the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.

Papal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/italy/milxpapalstate.html|title= History of the Papal States|work=World History at KDMLA|first=Alexander |last=Ganse|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> Julius II, the \"Warrior Pope\", fought on their behalf.

===Reformation===
The [[Reformation]] began in 1517. In 1527, before the Holy Roman Empire fought the Protestants, troops loyal to [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Emperor Charles V]] brutally [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Rome]] and imprisoned [[Pope Clement VII]], as a side effect of battles over the Papal States. <ref name=\"Durant1\">

This period saw a gradual revival of the pope's temporal power in the Papal States. Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}

At its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy — [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]]. It also included the small enclaves of [[Benevento]] and [[Pontecorvo]] in southern Italy and the larger [[Comtat Venaissin]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France.

===Napoleonic era===
[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumb|Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the [[Napoleonic wars]] changed the face of the peninsula.]]

The [[French Revolution]] affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the [[Comtat Venaissin]] and [[Avignon]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}) were seized and became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

Two years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] declared a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} (February 1798). [[Pope Pius VI]] fled to [[Siena]], and died in exile in Valence (France) in 1799.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} The [[French Consulate]] restored the Papal States in June 1800 and the newly-elected [[Pope Pius VII]] took up residency in Rome, but the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] under [[Napoleon]] invaded in 1808, and this time on 17 May 1809, the remainder of the States of the Church were annexed to France,{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}} forming the ''[[département]]s'' of ''[[Tibre]]'' and ''[[Trasimène]]''.

Following the fall of the Napoleonic system in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] officially restored the Italian territories of the Papal States (but not the Comtat Venaissin or Avignon) to Vatican control.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

From 1814 until the death of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1846, the popes followed a [[reactionary]] policy in the Papal States. For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.

===Italian unification===
{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.

The nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government.

As a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War of 1859]], Sardinia-Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|page=136}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulafia|first1=David|title=The Mediterranean in History|date=2003|publisher=Getty Publication|isbn=978-0892367252|page=268|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LrRzgSebSZMC&dq=Giuseppe+Garibaldi+overthrew+bourbon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Mediterranean as a battleground|quote=(...) under Giuseppe Garibaldi to overthrow the Neapolitan Bourbons. After defeating a Neapolitan force at Calatafirmi, Caribaldi captured Palermo after three days of street fighting.}}</ref> Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government, the Piedmont government petitioned French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the south. This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.

[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]

A unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a [[plebiscite]] the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}}

Despite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \"[[Law of Guarantees]]\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy – then under [[Pius XI]] – renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.

==Regional governors==
[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]

As the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.

==Papal military==
Historically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>
In 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]], Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.<ref>Charles A. Coulombe, ''The Pope's Legion: The Multinational Fighting Force that Defended the Vatican'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008</ref>

The Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the [[Palatine Guard]], which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]];{{sfn|Levillain|2002|page=1095}} the [[Noble Guard]], which also disbanded in 1970; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force.

A small [[Papal Navy]] was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.

The '''Papal States''' ({{IPAc-en|p|eɪ|p|ə|l}}) ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}), officially the '''State of the Church''' ({{lang-it|Stato della Chiesa}}, {{IPA-it|ˈstaːto della ˈkjeːza}}; {{lang-la|Status Ecclesiasticus}};<ref>Frederik de Wit, [http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/ihd/content/titleinfo/3220872 \"Status Ecclesiasticus et Magnus Ducatus Thoscanae\" (1700)]</ref> also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}''), were a series of territories in the [[Italian Peninsula]] under the direct [[Sovereign|sovereign]] rule of the [[pope]], from the 8th century until 1870. They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.

By 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].

==Name==
The Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.

==History==
{{further|History of Rome|History of the Papacy}}

===Origins===
{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}

For its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schnürer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 July 2014</ref> Early congregations met in rooms set aside for that purpose in the homes of well-to-do individuals, and a number of [[churches of Rome|early churches]], known as [[titular church]]es and located on the outskirts of [[Ancient Rome]], were held as property by individuals, rather than by the Church itself. Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome, and thus under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>

This system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated (in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them).<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>

Other donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. But the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from [[Ravenna]], where the Emperor's representative, or [[Exarch of Ravenna|Exarch]], was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEvedy|first1=Colin|title=The Penguin atlas of medieval history|date=1961|publisher=Penguin Books|page=32|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rjHVAAAAMAAJ&q=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlns3LrcHKAhVM1hQKHcgFBd84ChDoAQgrMAE|quote=... separated from their theoretical overlord in Pavia by the continuing Imperial control of the Rome-Ravenna corridor.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Charles|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199651924|page=661|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UtMVAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The empire retained control only of Rome, Ravenna, a fragile corridor between them, ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-752|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317678175|page=230|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=In 749 Ratchis embarked on a bid to capture Perusia, the key to the Rome-Ravenna land corridor}}</ref>), plus coastal exclaves.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|page=378}}

With effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the [[Duchy of Rome]], an area roughly equivalent to [[Lazio|modern-day Latium]], became an independent state ruled by the pope.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=1060}}

The Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; [[Pope Gregory II]] even [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] during the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through [[diplomacy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]] on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>

===Donation of Pepin===
{{main|Donation of Pepin}}
When the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless  [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards – taking control of northern Italy – and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.

In 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]] and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.

===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===
{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}
The precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] – and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] – is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.

Events in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum]] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[Émile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'église au pouvoir des laïques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'Église depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>

In practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.

Over several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.

===Avignon Papacy===
{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}

[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]

From 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings. This period was known as the \"Avignonese\" or \"Babylonian Captivity\".{{sfn|Spielvogel|2013|pages=245-246}}{{sfn|Elm|Mixson|2015|page=154}}{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=241}}{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|pages=220, 982}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Noble|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1285661537|page=304|edition=7|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Td4WAAAAQBAJ&dq=avignon+babylonian+captivity+1309-1377&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The Babylonian Captivity, 1309–1377|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Butt|first1=John J.|title=The Greenwood Dictionary of World History|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313327650|page=[https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0/page/36 36]|url=https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0|url-access=registration|quote=Term (coined by [[Petrarch]]) for the papal residence in Avignon (1309–1377), in reference to the Babylonian Captivity (...)}}</ref> During this period the city of Avignon itself was added to the Papal States; it remained a papal possession for some 400 years even after the popes returned to Rome, until it was seized and incorporated into the French state during the [[French Revolution]].

During this [[Avignon Papacy]], local [[Despotism|despots]] took advantage of the absence of the popes to establish themselves in nominally papal cities: the [[Pepoli]] in Bologna, the [[Ordelaffi]] in [[Forlì]], the [[Manfredi family|Manfredi]] in [[Faenza]], the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] in [[Rimini]] all gave nominal acknowledgement to their papal overlords and were declared vicars of the Church.

In Ferrara, the death of [[Azzo VIII d'Este]] without legitimate heirs (1308{{sfn|Menache|2003|page=142}}) encouraged Pope Clement V to bring Ferrara under his direct rule: however, it was governed by his appointed vicar, [[King Robert of Naples]], for only nine years before the citizens recalled the [[House of Este|Este]] from exile (1317); interdiction and excommunications were in vain: in 1332 John XXII was obliged to name three Este brothers as his vicars in Ferrara.{{sfn|Waley|1966|page=62}}

In Rome itself the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and the [[Colonna family|Colonna]] struggled for supremacy,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=802}} dividing the city's ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'' between them. The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of [[Cola di Rienzo]], who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=225}} and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} As Prof. [[Guido Ruggiero]] states, \"even with the support of [[Petrarch]], his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}}

The Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who was appointed papal legate, and his [[condottieri]] heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forlì, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forlì. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. [[Pope Urban V]] ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=19}}

[[File:RomaPalazzoQuirinale.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Quirinal Palace]], papal residence and home to the civil offices of the Papal States from the [[Renaissance]] until their annexation]]

===Renaissance===
During [[the Renaissance]], the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.

Papal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/italy/milxpapalstate.html|title= History of the Papal States|work=World History at KDMLA|first=Alexander |last=Ganse|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> Julius II, the \"Warrior Pope\", fought on their behalf.

===Reformation===
The [[Reformation]] began in 1517. In 1527, before the Holy Roman Empire fought the Protestants, troops loyal to [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Emperor Charles V]] brutally [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Rome]] and imprisoned [[Pope Clement VII]], as a side effect of battles over the Papal States. <ref name=\"Durant1\">

This period saw a gradual revival of the pope's temporal power in the Papal States. Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}

At its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy — [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]]. It also included the small enclaves of [[Benevento]] and [[Pontecorvo]] in southern Italy and the larger [[Comtat Venaissin]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France.

===Napoleonic era===
[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumb|Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the [[Napoleonic wars]] changed the face of the peninsula.]]

The [[French Revolution]] affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the [[Comtat Venaissin]] and [[Avignon]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}) were seized and became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

Two years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] declared a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} (February 1798). [[Pope Pius VI]] fled to [[Siena]], and died in exile in Valence (France) in 1799.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} The [[French Consulate]] restored the Papal States in June 1800 and the newly-elected [[Pope Pius VII]] took up residency in Rome, but the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] under [[Napoleon]] invaded in 1808, and this time on 17 May 1809, the remainder of the States of the Church were annexed to France,{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}} forming the ''[[département]]s'' of ''[[Tibre]]'' and ''[[Trasimène]]''.

Following the fall of the Napoleonic system in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] officially restored the Italian territories of the Papal States (but not the Comtat Venaissin or Avignon) to Vatican control.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

From 1814 until the death of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1846, the popes followed a [[reactionary]] policy in the Papal States. For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.

===Italian unification===
{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.

The nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government.

As a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War of 1859]], Sardinia-Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|page=136}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulafia|first1=David|title=The Mediterranean in History|date=2003|publisher=Getty Publication|isbn=978-0892367252|page=268|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LrRzgSebSZMC&dq=Giuseppe+Garibaldi+overthrew+bourbon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Mediterranean as a battleground|quote=(...) under Giuseppe Garibaldi to overthrow the Neapolitan Bourbons. After defeating a Neapolitan force at Calatafirmi, Caribaldi captured Palermo after three days of street fighting.}}</ref> Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government, the Piedmont government petitioned French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the south. This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.

[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]

A unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a [[plebiscite]] the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}}

Despite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \"[[Law of Guarantees]]\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy – then under [[Pius XI]] – renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.

==Regional governors==
[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]

As the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.

==Papal military==
Historically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>
In 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]], Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.<ref>Charles A. Coulombe, ''The Pope's Legion: The Multinational Fighting Force that Defended the Vatican'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008</ref>

The Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the [[Palatine Guard]], which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]];{{sfn|Levillain|2002|page=1095}} the [[Noble Guard]], which also disbanded in 1970; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force.

A small [[Papal Navy]] was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.

The '''Papal States''' ({{IPAc-en|p|eɪ|p|ə|l}}) ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}), officially the '''State of the Church''' ({{lang-it|Stato della Chiesa}}, {{IPA-it|ˈstaːto della ˈkjeːza}}; {{lang-la|Status Ecclesiasticus}};<ref>Frederik de Wit, [http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/ihd/content/titleinfo/3220872 \"Status Ecclesiasticus et Magnus Ducatus Thoscanae\" (1700)]</ref> also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'') were a series of territories in the [[Italian Peninsula]] under the direct [[Sovereign|sovereign]] rule of the [[pope]], from the 8th century until 1870. They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.

By 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].

==Name==
The Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.

==History==
{{further|History of Rome|History of the Papacy}}

===Origins===
{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}

For its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schnürer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 July 2014</ref> Early congregations met in rooms set aside for that purpose in the homes of well-to-do individuals, and a number of [[churches of Rome|early churches]], known as [[titular church]]es and located on the outskirts of [[Ancient Rome]], were held as property by individuals, rather than by the Church itself. Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome, and thus under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>

This system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated (in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them).<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>

Other donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. But the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from [[Ravenna]], where the Emperor's representative, or [[Exarch of Ravenna|Exarch]], was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEvedy|first1=Colin|title=The Penguin atlas of medieval history|date=1961|publisher=Penguin Books|page=32|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rjHVAAAAMAAJ&q=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlns3LrcHKAhVM1hQKHcgFBd84ChDoAQgrMAE|quote=... separated from their theoretical overlord in Pavia by the continuing Imperial control of the Rome-Ravenna corridor.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Charles|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199651924|page=661|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UtMVAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The empire retained control only of Rome, Ravenna, a fragile corridor between them, ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-752|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317678175|page=230|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=In 749 Ratchis embarked on a bid to capture Perusia, the key to the Rome-Ravenna land corridor}}</ref>), plus coastal exclaves.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|page=378}}

With effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the [[Duchy of Rome]], an area roughly equivalent to [[Lazio|modern-day Latium]], became an independent state ruled by the pope.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=1060}}

The Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; [[Pope Gregory II]] even [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] during the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through [[diplomacy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]] on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>

===Donation of Pepin===
{{main|Donation of Pepin}}
When the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless  [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards – taking control of northern Italy – and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.

In 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]] and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.

===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===
{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}
The precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] – and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] – is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.

Events in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum]] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[Émile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'église au pouvoir des laïques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'Église depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>

In practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.

Over several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.

===Avignon Papacy===
{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}

[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]

From 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings. This period was known as the \"Avignonese\" or \"Babylonian Captivity\".{{sfn|Spielvogel|2013|pages=245-246}}{{sfn|Elm|Mixson|2015|page=154}}{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=241}}{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|pages=220, 982}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Noble|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1285661537|page=304|edition=7|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Td4WAAAAQBAJ&dq=avignon+babylonian+captivity+1309-1377&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The Babylonian Captivity, 1309–1377|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Butt|first1=John J.|title=The Greenwood Dictionary of World History|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313327650|page=[https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0/page/36 36]|url=https://archive.org/details/greenwooddiction00butt_0|url-access=registration|quote=Term (coined by [[Petrarch]]) for the papal residence in Avignon (1309–1377), in reference to the Babylonian Captivity (...)}}</ref> During this period the city of Avignon itself was added to the Papal States; it remained a papal possession for some 400 years even after the popes returned to Rome, until it was seized and incorporated into the French state during the [[French Revolution]].

During this [[Avignon Papacy]], local [[Despotism|despots]] took advantage of the absence of the popes to establish themselves in nominally papal cities: the [[Pepoli]] in Bologna, the [[Ordelaffi]] in [[Forlì]], the [[Manfredi family|Manfredi]] in [[Faenza]], the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] in [[Rimini]] all gave nominal acknowledgement to their papal overlords and were declared vicars of the Church.

In Ferrara, the death of [[Azzo VIII d'Este]] without legitimate heirs (1308{{sfn|Menache|2003|page=142}}) encouraged Pope Clement V to bring Ferrara under his direct rule: however, it was governed by his appointed vicar, [[King Robert of Naples]], for only nine years before the citizens recalled the [[House of Este|Este]] from exile (1317); interdiction and excommunications were in vain: in 1332 John XXII was obliged to name three Este brothers as his vicars in Ferrara.{{sfn|Waley|1966|page=62}}

In Rome itself the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and the [[Colonna family|Colonna]] struggled for supremacy,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=802}} dividing the city's ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'' between them. The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of [[Cola di Rienzo]], who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=225}} and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} As Prof. [[Guido Ruggiero]] states, \"even with the support of [[Petrarch]], his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}}

The Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who was appointed papal legate, and his [[condottieri]] heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forlì, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forlì. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. [[Pope Urban V]] ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=19}}

[[File:RomaPalazzoQuirinale.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Quirinal Palace]], papal residence and home to the civil offices of the Papal States from the [[Renaissance]] until their annexation]]

===Renaissance===
During [[the Renaissance]], the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.

Papal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/italy/milxpapalstate.html|title= History of the Papal States|work=World History at KDMLA|first=Alexander |last=Ganse|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> Julius II, the \"Warrior Pope\", fought on their behalf.

===Reformation===
The [[Reformation]] began in 1517. In 1527, before the Holy Roman Empire fought the Protestants, troops loyal to [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Emperor Charles V]] brutally [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Rome]] and imprisoned [[Pope Clement VII]], as a side effect of battles over the Papal States. <ref name=\"Durant1\">

This period saw a gradual revival of the pope's temporal power in the Papal States. Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}

At its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy — [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]]. It also included the small enclaves of [[Benevento]] and [[Pontecorvo]] in southern Italy and the larger [[Comtat Venaissin]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France.

===Napoleonic era===
[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumb|Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the [[Napoleonic wars]] changed the face of the peninsula.]]

The [[French Revolution]] affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the [[Comtat Venaissin]] and [[Avignon]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}) were seized and became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

Two years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] declared a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} (February 1798). [[Pope Pius VI]] fled to [[Siena]], and died in exile in Valence (France) in 1799.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} The [[French Consulate]] restored the Papal States in June 1800 and the newly-elected [[Pope Pius VII]] took up residency in Rome, but the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] under [[Napoleon]] invaded in 1808, and this time on 17 May 1809, the remainder of the States of the Church were annexed to France,{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}} forming the ''[[département]]s'' of ''[[Tibre]]'' and ''[[Trasimène]]''.

Following the fall of the Napoleonic system in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] officially restored the Italian territories of the Papal States (but not the Comtat Venaissin or Avignon) to Vatican control.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}

From 1814 until the death of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1846, the popes followed a [[reactionary]] policy in the Papal States. For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.

===Italian unification===
{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.

The nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government.

As a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War of 1859]], Sardinia-Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|page=136}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulafia|first1=David|title=The Mediterranean in History|date=2003|publisher=Getty Publication|isbn=978-0892367252|page=268|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LrRzgSebSZMC&dq=Giuseppe+Garibaldi+overthrew+bourbon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Mediterranean as a battleground|quote=(...) under Giuseppe Garibaldi to overthrow the Neapolitan Bourbons. After defeating a Neapolitan force at Calatafirmi, Caribaldi captured Palermo after three days of street fighting.}}</ref> Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government, the Piedmont government petitioned French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the south. This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.

[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]

A unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a [[plebiscite]] the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}}

Despite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \"[[Law of Guarantees]]\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy – then under [[Pius XI]] – renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.

==Regional governors==
[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]

As the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.

==Papal military==
Historically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>
In 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]], Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.<ref>Charles A. Coulombe, ''The Pope's Legion: The Multinational Fighting Force that Defended the Vatican'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008</ref>

The Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the [[Palatine Guard]], which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]];{{sfn|Levillain|2002|page=1095}} the [[Noble Guard]], which also disbanded in 1970; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force.

A small [[Papal Navy]] was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.

the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.

The [[maple leaves]] in the shield, [[blazon]]ed \"proper\", were originally drawn [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] (green) but were redrawn [[Gules (heraldry)|gules]] (red) in 1957 and a circlet of the [[Order of Canada]] was added to the arms for limited use in 1987. The shield design forms the [[Royal standards of Canada#Sovereign's standard|monarch's royal standard]] and is also found on the [[Canadian Red Ensign]]. The [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada]], which formerly used the shield over the [[Union Flag]], now uses the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the arms on a blue field.

The arms are embossed on the covers of [[Canadian passport]]s, in order to legally signify and symbolize that the bearer is travelling under the aid of the [[The Crown#Concept|Crown of Canada]].

Nine quarterings on a shield was considered too complex<ref name=RHSC/> for a national symbol and by 1915 a push had begun to design a new coat of arms for Canada.<ref name=fraser2>{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Alistair B|title=The Flags of Canada|date=30 January 1998|chapter=Chapter I, Canada's National Symbols|url=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/index.html|chapterurl=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Nation/NatSym.html|accessdate=1 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915061016/http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/index.html| archivedate=15 September 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> A committee was formed in 1919 to pursue the issue, eventually agreeing that the elements of the new arms would reference the Royal Arms of England, Ireland, Scotland, and France, with maple leaves representing Canada, though there was at the time no consensus on how the leaves were to be used.<ref name=fraser2/> The decision was settled by 1920, and the committee conferred with the [[College of Arms]] in London, only to face resistance to the use of the Royal Arms from the [[Garter King of Arms]].<ref name=fraser2/> After some manoeuvring, including the personal intervention of [[Winston Churchill]], the new arms of Canada were eventually formally requested by an [[Order in Council]] on 30 April 1921 and adopted on 21 November of the same year by proclamation of King [[George V]] as the Arms or Ensigns Armorial of the Dominion of Canada.<ref name=proclamation>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm1_e.cfm |title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion – The arms of Canada |publisher=Canadian Heritage |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924075037/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm1_e.cfm|archivedate=24 September 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"London Gazette 1921 Proclamation\">{{London Gazette|issue=32525|page=9242|date=22 November 1921}}</ref> The new layout closely reflected the arms of the United Kingdom<ref name=description>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm2_e.cfm |title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion – The arms of Canada (page 2)|publisher=Canadian Heritage |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924072609/http://www.pch.gc.ca/PROGS/CPSC-CCSP/sc-cs/arm2_e.cfm |archivedate=24 September 2008}}</ref> with the addition of maple leaves in the base and the reference to the French royal arms in the fourth quarter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/symboles-histoire-symbols-stories/symbole_canada_symbols-eng.pdf|title=Symbols of Canada|year=2008|publisher=Canadian Heritage|accessdate=20 November 2008|page=6}}</ref> The proclamation also established white and red as the [[national colours of Canada]].

In 1931, with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, Canada and other Dominions became fully sovereign from the United Kingdom. This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for [[Elizabeth II]], where the title has been redefined as ''Queen of Canada''.<ref name=Swann>{{cite book|last=Swann|first=Conrad|title=Canada Symbols of Sovereignty: An investigation of the arms and seals borne from the earliest times to the present in connection with public authority in and over Canada. along with consideration of some connected flags|chapter=Chapter I, Arms of dominion and sovereignty and public authority|location=Toronto|publisher= University of Toronto Press}}</ref> These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.

By 1957, the arms were redrawn by [[Alan Beddoe]] so as to have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more resembling [[St. Edward's Crown]], as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name=RHSC/> To mark the 1982 [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended the last vestiges of British authority over Canada, a [[McGill University]] student named Bruce Hicks proposed to [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State]] [[Gerald Regan]] that the motto of the [[Order of Canada]] be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the [[Order of the Garter]], the Scottish [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms]] the [[Order of the Thistle]], and the royalist [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Regime]] the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]] and [[Order of Saint Michael]]).<ref name=Hicks>{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Bruce|title=The Campaign to Change the Royal Arms of Canada (Hogtown Heraldry 12:4)}}</ref> While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.<ref name=McCreery>{{cite book|last=McCreery|first=Christopher|title=The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History and Development|isbn=0-8020-3940-5|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press}}</ref>

It took until 1994 for the Queen to approve the new design for general use, though the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] began to allow for its limited use beginning in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians.<ref name=hansard/> These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the [[Order of Canada]]—''Desiderantes meliorem patriam''. As soon as royal approval was forthcoming, the full achievement was redesigned for use by the federal government within the [[Federal Identity Program]].<ref name=RHSC/> The present design of the arms of Canada was drawn by [[Cathy Bursey-Sabourin]], Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.<ref name=Poster>{{cite book|last=Canadian Heritage|title=The Arms of Canada (Ottawa: Government of Canada)}}</ref>

In June 2008, Member of Parliament [[Pat Martin]] introduced a [[Motion (democracy)|motion]] into the [[House of Commons of Canada]] calling on the government to amend the coat of arms to incorporate symbols representing Canada's [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/coat-of-arms-ignores-aboriginal-people-mp-says-1.748913 |title=Coat of arms ignores aboriginal people, MP say |date=20 June 2008 |publisher=CBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622224734/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2008/06/20/coat-arms.html |archive-date=22 June 2008 |url-status=live |access-date=20 June 2008}}</ref>

The [[Heraldry|heraldic]] [[blazon]] of Canada's coat of arms, as declared in the 1921 proclamation, is:

<blockquote>Tierced in fesse the first and second divisions containing the quarterly coat following, namely, 1st, [[gules]] three lions passant guardant in [[pale (heraldry)|pale]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], 2nd, Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory gules, 3rd, [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] a harp Or stringed [[argent]], 4th, azure, three fleurs-de-lis Or, and the third division argent three maple leaves conjoined on one stem proper. And upon a royal helmet mantled argent doubled gules the crest, that is to say, on a wreath of the colours argent and gules a lion passant guardant Or imperially crowned proper and holding in the dexter paw a maple leaf gules.

the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.

The [[maple leaves]] in the shield, [[blazon]]ed \"proper\", were originally drawn [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] (green) but were redrawn [[Gules (heraldry)|gules]] (red) in 1957 and a circlet of the [[Order of Canada]] was added to the arms for limited use in 1987. The shield design forms the [[Royal standards of Canada#Sovereign's standard|monarch's royal standard]] and is also found on the [[Canadian Red Ensign]]. The [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada]], which formerly used the shield over the [[Union Flag]], now uses the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the arms on a blue field.

The arms are embossed on the covers of [[Canadian passport]]s, in order to legally signify and symbolize that the bearer is travelling under the aid of the [[The Crown#Concept|Crown of Canada]].

Nine quarterings on a shield was considered too complex<ref name=RHSC/> for a national symbol and by 1915 a push had begun to design a new coat of arms for Canada.<ref name=fraser2>{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Alistair B|title=The Flags of Canada|date=30 January 1998|chapter=Chapter I, Canada's National Symbols|url=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/index.html|chapterurl=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Nation/NatSym.html|accessdate=1 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915061016/http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/index.html| archivedate=15 September 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> A committee was formed in 1919 to pursue the issue, eventually agreeing that the elements of the new arms would reference the Royal Arms of England, Ireland, Scotland, and France, with maple leaves representing Canada, though there was at the time no consensus on how the leaves were to be used.<ref name=fraser2/> The decision was settled by 1920, and the committee conferred with the [[College of Arms]] in London, only to face resistance to the use of the Royal Arms from the [[Garter King of Arms]].<ref name=fraser2/> After some manoeuvring, including the personal intervention of [[Winston Churchill]], the new arms of Canada were eventually formally requested by an [[Order in Council]] on 30 April 1921 and adopted on 21 November of the same year by proclamation of King [[George V]] as the Arms or Ensigns Armorial of the Dominion of Canada.<ref name=proclamation>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm1_e.cfm |title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion – The arms of Canada |publisher=Canadian Heritage |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924075037/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm1_e.cfm|archivedate=24 September 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"London Gazette 1921 Proclamation\">{{London Gazette|issue=32525|page=9242|date=22 November 1921}}</ref> The new layout closely reflected the arms of the United Kingdom<ref name=description>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm2_e.cfm |title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion – The arms of Canada (page 2)|publisher=Canadian Heritage |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924072609/http://www.pch.gc.ca/PROGS/CPSC-CCSP/sc-cs/arm2_e.cfm |archivedate=24 September 2008}}</ref> with the addition of maple leaves in the base and the reference to the French royal arms in the fourth quarter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/symboles-histoire-symbols-stories/symbole_canada_symbols-eng.pdf|title=Symbols of Canada|year=2008|publisher=Canadian Heritage|accessdate=20 November 2008|page=6}}</ref> The proclamation also established white and red as the [[national colours of Canada]].

In 1931, with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, Canada and other Dominions became fully sovereign from the United Kingdom. This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for [[Elizabeth II]], where the title has been redefined as ''Queen of Canada''.<ref name=Swann>{{cite book|last=Swann|first=Conrad|title=Canada Symbols of Sovereignty: An investigation of the arms and seals borne from the earliest times to the present in connection with public authority in and over Canada. along with consideration of some connected flags|chapter=Chapter I, Arms of dominion and sovereignty and public authority|location=Toronto|publisher= University of Toronto Press}}</ref> These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.

By 1957, the arms were redrawn by [[Alan Beddoe]] so as to have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more resembling [[St. Edward's Crown]], as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name=RHSC/> To mark the 1982 [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended the last vestiges of British authority over Canada, a [[McGill University]] student named Bruce Hicks proposed to [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State]] [[Gerald Regan]] that the motto of the [[Order of Canada]] be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the [[Order of the Garter]], the Scottish [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms]] the [[Order of the Thistle]], and the royalist [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Regime]] the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]] and [[Order of Saint Michael]]).<ref name=Hicks>{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Bruce|title=The Campaign to Change the Royal Arms of Canada (Hogtown Heraldry 12:4)}}</ref> While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.<ref name=McCreery>{{cite book|last=McCreery|first=Christopher|title=The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History and Development|isbn=0-8020-3940-5|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press}}</ref>

It took until 1994 for the Queen to approve the new design for general use, though the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] began to allow for its limited use beginning in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians.<ref name=hansard/> These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the [[Order of Canada]]—''Desiderantes meliorem patriam''. As soon as royal approval was forthcoming, the full achievement was redesigned for use by the federal government within the [[Federal Identity Program]].<ref name=RHSC/> The present design of the arms of Canada was drawn by [[Cathy Bursey-Sabourin]], Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.<ref name=Poster>{{cite book|last=Canadian Heritage|title=The Arms of Canada (Ottawa: Government of Canada)}}</ref>

In June 2008, Member of Parliament [[Pat Martin]] introduced a [[Motion (democracy)|motion]] into the [[House of Commons of Canada]] calling on the government to amend the coat of arms to incorporate symbols representing Canada's [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/coat-of-arms-ignores-aboriginal-people-mp-says-1.748913 |title=Coat of arms ignores aboriginal people, MP say |date=20 June 2008 |publisher=CBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622224734/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2008/06/20/coat-arms.html |archive-date=22 June 2008 |url-status=live |access-date=20 June 2008}}</ref>

The [[Heraldry|heraldic]] [[blazon]] of Canada's coat of arms, as declared in the 1921 proclamation, is:

<blockquote>Tierced in fesse the first and second divisions containing the quarterly coat following, namely, 1st, [[gules]] three lions passant guardant in [[pale (heraldry)|pale]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], 2nd, Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory gules, 3rd, [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] a harp Or stringed [[argent]], 4th, azure, three fleurs-de-lis Or, and the third division argent three maple leaves conjoined on one stem proper. And upon a royal helmet mantled argent doubled gules the crest, that is to say, on a wreath of the colours argent and gules a lion passant guardant Or imperially crowned proper and holding in the dexter paw a maple leaf gules.

The Scottish unicorn<ref name=RHSC/> has a gold horn, a gold mane, gold hooves, and around its neck a gold, chained [[coronet]] of crosses and fleurs-de-lis; it holds a lance flying the three gold fleurs-de-lis of royal France on a blue background.<ref name=description /> Unlike the British version, the lion is not crowned, nor is it facing the viewer.

'''Harlow''' is a town and local government district in the west of [[Essex]], England. A [[Planned community|new town]], situated on the border with [[Hertfordshire]] and London, Harlow occupies a large area of land on the south bank of the upper [[River Stort|Stort Valley]], which has been made navigable through other towns and features a canal section near its [[watermill]]. [[Old Harlow]] is a village-size suburb founded by the early medieval age and most of its [[high street]] buildings are early Victorian and residential, mostly protected by one of the Conservation Areas in the district. In Old Harlow is a field named '''Harlowbury''', a de-settled monastic area which has the remains of a chapel, a [[scheduled ancient monument]].

The [[M11 motorway]] passes through the east of the district, entirely to the east of the town. Harlow has its own commercial and leisure economy. It is also an outer part of the [[London commuter belt]] and employment centre of the M11 corridor which includes [[Cambridge]] and [[London Stansted Airport]] to the north. At the time of the 2011 Census, Harlow's population was recorded at 81,944 and its district had the third-highest proportion of [[social housing]] in England, 26.9%,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} a legacy of the 1947 commitment to re-house [[The Blitz|blitzed]] London families after World War II and provide a percentage of homes for other needy families who cannot afford [[renting|market rent]]s.

==Etymology==

There is some dispute as to where the [[placename]] Harlow derives from. One theory is that it derives from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words 'here' and 'hlaw', meaning \"army hill\", probably to be identified with Mulberry Hill, which was used as the [[wikt:moot|moot]] or meeting place for the district.

The other theory is that it derives from the words 'here' and 'hearg', meaning \"temple hill/mound\", probably to be identified with an [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] burial mound, later a [[Roman Britain|Roman temple]] site on River Way.

==History==

===Early history===

The earliest deposits are of a Mesolithic (circa 10,000 BC) hunting camp excavated by Davey in Northbrooks in the 1970s (Unpublished) closely followed by the large and unexcavated deposits of Neolithic flint beside Gilden Way. These deposits are mostly known because of the large numbers of surface-bound, worked flint. Substantial amounts of worked flint suggest an organised working of flint in the area. Large amounts of debitage litter the area and tools found include axeheads, hammers, blades, dowels and other boring tools and multipurpose flints such as scrapers. An organised field walk in the late 1990s by Bartlett (Unpublished) indicates that most of the area, some 80 hectares, produced worked flint from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age with a smattering of Mesolithic. This indicates organised industry existed from 5000 BC to 2000 BC. The deposits are so large and dispersed that any major archaeological work in the area will have to take this into consideration before any ground work is started. Harlow was in Roman times the site of a small town (around [[Harlow Mill railway station]]) with a substantial stone built temple.<ref>Barry C. Burnham, J. S. Wacher: ''The Small Towns of Roman Britain'', Berkeley, Los Angeles 1990, pp. 186-187</ref>

===Later history===
[[File:St Mary's Church, Churchgate Street - geograph.org.uk - 1576708.jpg|thumb|[[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]], Churchgate Street]]

The entry in the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Domesday Book]] reads: ''Herlaua: St Edmunds Abbey before and after 1066; Geoffrey from Count Eustace; Thorgils from Eudo the Steward; Richard from Ranulf, brother of Ilger. Mill, 7 beehives, 8 cobs, 43 cattle, 3 foals.'' The mill is now a 300-year-old listed building and restaurant.<ref>Harlow Mill (now restaurant) – Grade II [[listed building|listing]]. {{National Heritage List for England|num=1111737|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

The original village, mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], developed as a typical rural community around what is now known as [[Old Harlow]], with many of its buildings still standing. This includes for instance the Grade II listed [[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]] in Churchgate Street.  Its former Chapel is in a ruinous state in a field which was once the '''Harlowbury Abbey''' part of Old Harlow, is Grade I listed and is a [[scheduled ancient monument]].<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1111694|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

Kingsmoor House on Paringdon Road is a Grade II* listed building and dates from the 18th century. It was built as a gentleman's residence and owned by local families including the [[Harlow Woods|Risden]], [[John Archer-Houblon|Houblon]] and [[Edward Joseph Todhunter|Todhunter]] families. It was later used as a private school and council offices before falling derelict.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingsmoor House - Harlow - May 2011 |url=https://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/residential-sites/18970-kingsmoor-house-harlow-2011-a.html |website=Derelict Places}}</ref> It has since been restored and converted into residential apartments.

===The New Town===

The original Harlow [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] was built after [[World War II]] to ease overcrowding in London and the surrounding areas due to the devastation caused by the bombing during the Blitz. Harlow was, along with places such as [[Basildon]], [[Stevenage]] and [[Hemel Hempstead]] a result of the New Towns Act of 1946, with the master plan for Harlow drawn up in 1947 by Sir [[Frederick Gibberd]].<ref>[http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm Gardens Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020033303/http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm |date=20 October 2004 }} – Frederick Gibberd</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8603701.stm New town, a name change and all the jazz] BBC News web site</ref> The town was planned from the outset and was designed to respect the existing landscape. A number of landscape wedges - which later became known as Green Wedges - were designed to cut through the town and separate the neighbourhoods of the town. The development incorporated the [[market town]] of Harlow, now a neighbourhood known as [[Old Harlow]], and the villages of Great Parndon, Latton, Tye Green, Potter Street, Churchgate Street, Little Parndon, and Netteswell. Each of the town's neighbourhoods is self-supporting with its own shopping precincts, community facilities and [[public house|pubs]]. Gibberd invited many of the country's leading post-war architects to design buildings in the town, including [[Philip Powell (architect)|Philip Powell]] and [[Hidalgo Moya]], [[Leonard Manasseh]], Michael Neylan, E C P Monson, Gerard Goalen, [[Maxwell Fry]], [[Jane Drew]], Graham Dawbarn, [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]] and [[William Crabtree]].  Harlow has one of the most extensive cycle track networks in the country, connecting all areas of the town to the town centre and industrial areas.  The cycle network is composed mostly of the original old town roads.

The town's authorities built Britain's first pedestrian precinct,<ref>[https://www.mun.ca/geog/interdisiplinary/harlow/harlow1.php Memorial University – Department of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121041144/http://www.mun.ca/geog/interdisiplinary/harlow/harlow1.php |date=21 January 2008 }} – Harlow's History and Geography</ref> and first modern-style residential [[tower block]], The Lawn,<ref>[https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1271496 English Heritage] – The Lawn</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6264579.stm BBC News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907002448/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6264579.stm |date=7 September 2007 }} – ''Redeveloping Essex's fallen utopia ''</ref> constructed in 1951; it is now a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]]. Gibberd's tromp-l'oeil terrace in Orchard Croft and Dawbarn's maisonette blocks at Pennymead are also notable, as is Michael Neylan's pioneering development at Bishopsfield. The first neighbourhood, Mark Hall, is a conservation area. From 1894 to 1955 the Harlow parish formed part of the [[Epping Rural District]] of Essex.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10241649 Vision of Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309114818/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10241649 |date=9 March 2007 }} – Harlow parish</ref> From 1955 to 1974, Harlow was an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10241649 Vision of Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309114838/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10241649 |date=9 March 2007 }} – Harlow UD</ref>

The town centre, and many of its neighbourhood shopping facilities have undergone major redevelopment, along with many of the town's original buildings. Subsequently, many of the original town buildings, including most of its health centres, the Staple Tye shopping centre and many industrial units have been rebuilt. Gibberd's original town hall, a landmark in the town, has been demolished and replaced by a new civic centre and The Water Gardens shopping area.

===Redevelopment===
[[File:The Chase - geograph.org.uk - 400869.jpg|thumb|The Newhall housing development built circa 2007 between Old Harlow and Church Langley]]

Since becoming a new town, Harlow has undergone several stages of expansion, the first of which was the \"mini expansion\" that was created by the building of the Sumners and Katherines estates in the mid-to-late seventies to the west of the existing town. Since then Harlow has further expanded with the Church Langley estate completed in 2005, and its newest neighbourhood [[Newhall, Essex|Newhall]] has completed the first stage of its development, with the second stage underway in 2013. The [[Harlow Gateway Scheme]] is currently underway, with the relocation of the Harlow Football Stadium to Barrow's Farm in early 2006, and the building of a new hotel, apartments, and a restaurant adjacent to the railway station being complete. The next stage of this scheme involves the completion of the 530 eco-homes being built on the former sports centre site, and the centre's relocation to the nearby former college playing field site.

Other major developments under consideration include both a northern and southern bypass of the town, and significant expansion to the north, following the completed expansion to the east. The Harlow North<ref>[http://www.harlownorth.com Ropemaker Properties Limited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305002149/http://www.harlownorth.com/ |date=5 March 2007 }} – Harlow North</ref> plans, currently awaiting permission, involve an extension of the town across the floodplains on the town's northern border, into neighbouring [[Hertfordshire]]. The plan was supported by former MP [[Bill Rammell]], all three political groups on Harlow Council, and the [[East of England Regional Assembly]]. It is opposed by Hertfordshire County Council, East Herts Council, [[Mark Prisk]], MP for Hertford and Stortford in whose constituency the development would be, and all the parishes concerned. The opposition is coordinated by a local group based in neighbouring East Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stopharlownorth.com|title=Page Redirection|website=www.stopharlownorth.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105135104/http://www.stopharlownorth.com/|archivedate=5 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> An attempt to have Harlow North designated an \"Eco Town\" was rejected by the Minister for Housing, [[Caroline Flint]] MP, in April 2008.

The south of the town centre also underwent major regeneration, with the new Civic Centre being built and the town's famous Water Gardens being redeveloped, a landscape listed by [[English Heritage]].

In 2004 Harlow businessman [[Mohammad Ghadami|Mo Ghadami]] won his High Court case to block a multimillion-pound extension of the town's Harvey Centre. The Iranian-born entrepreneur, who presented his case in person, persuaded Mr Justice Richards to quash Harlow DC's grant of planning permission for the development. In his judgment he backed Mr Ghadami's claim of 'apparent bias or predetermination' in the decision, as a result of the continued participation of Michael Garnett, the chairman of the planning committee, in the planning process after he had attempted in telephone calls to persuade Mr Ghadami to consent to the scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/harlow-planning-committee-chairmans-calls-to-objector-under-scrutiny/1231710.article|title=HARLOW PLANNING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN'S CALLS TO OBJECTOR UNDER SCRUTINY|website=lgcplus.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327014905/http://www.lgcplus.com/harlow-planning-committee-chairmans-calls-to-objector-under-scrutiny/1231710.article|archivedate=27 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Environment==

A major feature of Harlow New Town is its green spaces; over one third of the district is parkland or fields containing public footpaths. One of the original design features of Gibberd's masterplan is the Green Wedges in the town, designed to provide open space for wildlife and recreation and to separate neighbourhoods. 23% of the district is designated as Green Wedge. The Green Wedges are protected from inappropriate development, through the Local Plan.<ref name=gwreview>Harlow Council. [http://www.harlow.gov.uk/sites/harlow/files/Green%20Wedge%20Review.pdf \"Green Wedge Review\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062254/http://www.harlow.gov.uk/sites/harlow/files/Green%20Wedge%20Review.pdf |date=7 October 2016 }}, April 2014.</ref>

The town is entirely surrounded by Green Belt land, a land designation which originated in London to prevent the city sprawling, and 21% of the district is allocated as Green Belt.<ref name=gwreview /> The National Planning Policy Framework states that one of the purposes of Green Belt land is to protect unrestricted sprawl from large built-up areas.<ref name=nppf>DCLG.

[[Harlow Town Park]], at a size of 71.6-hectares (just under 1&nbsp;km²), is one of the largest urban parks in the country. The multi-functional park has been used for recreation and enjoyment for over 50 years.  This park is in the centre Netteswell [[wards of the United Kingdom|ward]] and is between the town centre and the railway station, both of which are within walking distance of the park, which is a natural thoroughfare from the station to the town centre.

There are only 12 parks with significant post-war element on the English Heritage 'Register of Parks'. With these Harlow is seen as one of the first examples of a civic scheme to marry the modern science of town and country planning.

In 2006 the entire South East of England was affected by drought, with Harlow covered by a water restriction order, preventing unnecessary use of water.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Economy==
Harlow was originally expected to provide a majority of employment opportunities in manufacturing,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} with two major developments of The Pinnacles and Templefields providing the biggest employers in the region; as with the rest of the country, this manufacturing base has declined and Harlow has had to adjust.

The original manufacturing took the form of a biscuit factory, on the Pinnacles. Owned and run as a co-op, it provided employment to the town for over 50 years, before closing in 2002. It has since been demolished and the site now has small industrial units. At its peak, the factory employed over 500 people. At the time of its closure, the owner was Burton's Foods Ltd. An £8&nbsp;million production line – installed in 1999 – was left to rust in the car park upon the closure of the factory.

[[Raytheon]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] both have large premises within the town. 
In July 2017 [[Public Health England]] had bought the vacant site from GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) hoping to move altogether 2,745 jobs there, of which about 500 are from [[Porton Down]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-40547531 Harlow site to be home to government's public health arm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216084353/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-40547531 |date=16 February 2018 }} BBC News,9 July 2017</ref>

[[Nortel]] had a large site on the eastern edge of the town, acquired when [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]] was bought in 1991, and it was here that [[Charles K. Kao]] developed [[optical fibre]] data transmission. Nortel still has a presence,{{when|date=January 2018}} but it is much reduced. 
One of Europe's leading online golf stores, Onlinegolf, is based in Harlow.

Unemployment is frequently around 10%,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} higher than the national average in the UK. Harlow also has a large number of people in social housing, almost 30%<ref name=census>[http://www.harlow.gov.uk/about_the_council/council_services/business_services/regeneration_unit/key_statistics_and_data/harlow_comparison_with_essex.aspx Harlow District Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023055606/http://www.harlow.gov.uk/about_the_council/council_services/business_services/regeneration_unit/key_statistics_and_data/harlow_comparison_with_essex.aspx |date=23 October 2008 }} – Harlow: A Comparison with Essex 2001 Census</ref> of dwellings being housing association and local authority owned, and many more privately rented.

==Politics==
:''See also: [[Harlow (UK Parliament constituency)|Harlow]], [[Harlow District Council elections]]''
The Member of parliament (MP) for [[Harlow (UK Parliament constituency)|Harlow]] since the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] is [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Robert Halfon]]. He defeated [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] Phil Waite, his predecessor being [[Bill Rammell]], who had been the MP since the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]], but had only held the seat at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] by a majority of 97 votes.

Elections to the district council are held in three out of every four years, with one-third of the 33 seats on the council being elected at each election.

==Transport==

===Rail===

Harlow is served by two [[train station|railway station]]s, [[Harlow Town railway station]] and [[Harlow Mill railway station]].  There is also a bus service to [[Epping tube station]] on the London Underground.

===Road===
Harlow is reached from junction 7 of the [[M11 motorway]], which runs from London to Cambridge, placing it within a short distance of Stansted Airport and the [[A120 road|A120]] and the orbital [[M25 motorway]]. The  [[M11 motorway]] was originally planned to run to the west of Harlow, not the east as it does today. Having planned for one of the two big industrial estates to be built to the west of the town for easy motorway access, Sir Fredrick Gibberd was appalled when the motorway was eventually built to the east of the town instead, describing it as \"just about the most monstrous thing to ever happen to me as a planner\" during a 1982 interview.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gibberd|first1=Fredrick|title=Sir Fredrick Gibberd's - Harlow New Town 1982|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB3T5Gnfcu0&t=140s|website=Youtube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429145044/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB3T5Gnfcu0&t=140s|archivedate=29 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Running through the town is the [[A414 road|A414]], a major road from [[Hertford]] to [[Chelmsford]] and linking the town with the [[A10 road (England)|A10]] to the west. Another major road running from Harlow is the A1184, which also leads to the nearby town of [[Bishop's Stortford]].

===Air===
[[Bishop's Stortford]] is the closest large town to [[London Stansted Airport]], though Harlow is only 10 miles from this major transport hub, and therefore provides several hundred airport employees. The airport operator withdrew a planning application for a second runway after the General Election of 2010, when all major political parties opposed it.

===Bus===
[[File:Harlow bus station (geograph 3445799).jpg|thumb|right|Harlow Bus Station]]
Harlow has an extensive bus network and serves as a regional hub for the local area, with operators such as Arriva (Herts and Essex) and Trustybus. There are links to many other local towns and villages such as Chelmsford City, Epping and Bishops Stortford.

Essex County Council was involved in development to Harlow's First Avenue, which was intended to reduce congestion and create better transport connections between the Newhall housing developments. The scheme was implemented in two phases, each phase focusing on developing First Avenue on either side of Howard Way. Phase two had an estimated cost of £4.4&nbsp;million and was due to be completed in early 2010, phase one is already complete and is listed as having had £3.6&nbsp;million of funding from the [[Community Infrastructure Fund]] (CIF).<ref>{{cite web

==Art and culture==
[[File:Trigon, Harlow (25996639083).jpg|thumb|upright|''Trigon'' by [[Lynn Chadwick]], in a Harlow shopping street]]

Harlow is the home to a major collection of public sculptures (over 100 in total) by artists such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]], and [[Ralph Brown (sculptor)|Ralph Brown]]. Many of these are owned by the [[Harlow art trust|Harlow Art Trust]], an organisation set up in 1953 by the lead architect of Harlow [[Frederick Gibberd]]. Gibberd had idealistic notions of the New Town as a place where people who might not normally have access to art could enjoy great sculptures by great artists on every street corner. Consequently, almost all of Harlow's sculpture collection is in the open air, in shopping centres, housing estates and parks around the town.<ref>Whiteley, Gillian: ''Sculpture in Harlow'', Harlow Art Trust, 2005</ref>

In 2009 Harlow Council voted to celebrate Harlow's collection of sculpture by branding Harlow as 'Harlow Sculpture Town – The World's First Sculpture Town'. [[Harlow Sculpture Town]] began as an initiative from Harlow Art Trust, presenting itself as 'Sculpture Town', in a similar way to [[Hay-on-Wye]]'s presentation of itself as [[Booktown]].<ref>''Harlow Herald'', 31 March 2009{{page needed|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.harlowarttrust.org.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151329/http://www.harlowarttrust.org.uk/ |date=8 October 2011 }} Harlow Art Trust</ref>

As part of the 'Sculpture Town' branding, Harlow is also home to the [[Gibberd Garden]], the former home of Frederick and Elizabeth Gibberd, which is a managed twentieth-century garden, and home to some of the Gibberd's private sculpture collection.<ref>http://www.thegibberdgarden.co.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309234136/http://www.thegibberdgarden.co.uk/ |date=9 March 2009 }} see Gibberd Garden</ref> The Gibberd Gallery, in the Civic Centre, contains a collection of twentieth-century watercolours and temporary exhibitions.

[[File:The Playhouse, Harlow - geograph.org.uk - 140524.jpg|thumb|The Playhouse Theatre]]

Harlow's [[Playhouse Theatre, Harlow|Playhouse Theatre]] is in the town.

Harlow has a local museum, which hold exhibitions and which contains artefacts on Harlow's historic past, charting the story of the town through the ages. Harlow Museum is in Muskham Road, and is set within the grounds of a sixteenth-century manor building with walled gardens. The museum is currently operated by Science Alive, who also run the Time Machine Gallery at the Leisurezone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science-alive.co.uk/harlow-museum/|title=Harlow Museum|website=science-alive.co.uk|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200844/http://www.science-alive.co.uk/harlow-museum/|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The museum is run in conjunction with the Essex Records Office (ERO) which holds family history archives in the search room. Admission to the museum is currently free, but visitors are encouraged to make a donation to ensure future maintenance of services.

The Town of Harlow and Harlow New Town are cited in the song \"[[Get 'Em Out by Friday]]\", by progressive rock group [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], on their 1972 album ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]''.

Harlow was home to [[The Square, Harlow|The Square]], named one of the Top 10 Small Venues in the UK by [[NME]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/89447 |title=Finalists revealed in NME's search for Britain's Best Small Venue with Jack Daniel's 2015 |date=10 November 2015 |website=NME |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061717/http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/89447 |archivedate=7 October 2016 }}</ref> but the venue was closed due to re-development of the site, and is currently undergoing demolition.

'''Harlow''' is a town and local government district in the west of [[Essex]], England. A [[Planned community|new town]], situated on the border with [[Hertfordshire]] and London, Harlow occupies a large area of land on the south bank of the upper [[River Stort|Stort Valley]], which has been made navigable through other towns and features a canal section near its [[watermill]]. [[Old Harlow]] is a village-size suburb founded by the early medieval age and most of its [[high street]] buildings are early Victorian and residential, mostly protected by one of the Conservation Areas in the district. In Old Harlow is a field named '''Harlowbury''', a de-settled monastic area which has the remains of a chapel, a [[scheduled ancient monument]].

The [[M11 motorway]] passes through the east of the district, entirely to the east of the town. Harlow has its own commercial and leisure economy. It is also an outer part of the [[London commuter belt]] and employment centre of the M11 corridor which includes [[Cambridge]] and [[London Stansted Airport]] to the north. At the time of the 2011 Census, Harlow's population was recorded at 81,944 and its district had the third-highest proportion of [[social housing]] in England, 26.9%,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} a legacy of the 1947 commitment to re-house [[The Blitz|blitzed]] London families after World War II and provide a percentage of homes for other needy families who cannot afford [[renting|market rent]]s.

==Etymology==

There is some dispute as to where the [[placename]] Harlow derives from. One theory is that it derives from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words 'here' and 'hlaw', meaning \"army hill\", probably to be identified with Mulberry Hill, which was used as the [[wikt:moot|moot]] or meeting place for the district.

The other theory is that it derives from the words 'here' and 'hearg', meaning \"temple hill/mound\", probably to be identified with an [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] burial mound, later a [[Roman Britain|Roman temple]] site on River Way.

==History==

===Early history===

The earliest deposits are of a Mesolithic (circa 10,000 BC) hunting camp excavated by Davey in Northbrooks in the 1970s (Unpublished) closely followed by the large and unexcavated deposits of Neolithic flint beside Gilden Way. These deposits are mostly known because of the large numbers of surface-bound, worked flint. Substantial amounts of worked flint suggest an organised working of flint in the area. Large amounts of debitage litter the area and tools found include axeheads, hammers, blades, dowels and other boring tools and multipurpose flints such as scrapers. An organised field walk in the late 1990s by Bartlett (Unpublished) indicates that most of the area, some 80 hectares, produced worked flint from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age with a smattering of Mesolithic. This indicates organised industry existed from 5000 BC to 2000 BC. The deposits are so large and dispersed that any major archaeological work in the area will have to take this into consideration before any ground work is started. Harlow was in Roman times the site of a small town (around [[Harlow Mill railway station]]) with a substantial stone built temple.<ref>Barry C. Burnham, J. S. Wacher: ''The Small Towns of Roman Britain'', Berkeley, Los Angeles 1990, pp. 186-187</ref>

===Later history===
[[File:St Mary's Church, Churchgate Street - geograph.org.uk - 1576708.jpg|thumb|[[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]], Churchgate Street]]

The entry in the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Domesday Book]] reads: ''Herlaua: St Edmunds Abbey before and after 1066; Geoffrey from Count Eustace; Thorgils from Eudo the Steward; Richard from Ranulf, brother of Ilger. Mill, 7 beehives, 8 cobs, 43 cattle, 3 foals.'' The mill is now a 300-year-old listed building and restaurant.<ref>Harlow Mill (now restaurant) – Grade II [[listed building|listing]]. {{National Heritage List for England|num=1111737|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

The original village, mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], developed as a typical rural community around what is now known as [[Old Harlow]], with many of its buildings still standing. This includes for instance the Grade II listed [[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]] in Churchgate Street.  Its former Chapel is in a ruinous state in a field which was once the '''Harlowbury Abbey''' part of Old Harlow, is Grade I listed and is a [[scheduled ancient monument]].<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1111694|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

Kingsmoor House on Paringdon Road is a Grade II* listed building and dates from the 18th century. It was built as a gentleman's residence and owned by local families including the [[Harlow Woods|Risden]], [[John Archer-Houblon|Houblon]] and [[Edward Joseph Todhunter|Todhunter]] families. It was later used as a private school and council offices before falling derelict.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingsmoor House - Harlow - May 2011 |url=https://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/residential-sites/18970-kingsmoor-house-harlow-2011-a.html |website=Derelict Places}}</ref> It has since been restored and converted into residential apartments.

===The New Town===

The original Harlow [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] was built after [[World War II]] to ease overcrowding in London and the surrounding areas due to the devastation caused by the bombing during the Blitz. Harlow was, along with places such as [[Basildon]], [[Stevenage]] and [[Hemel Hempstead]] a result of the New Towns Act of 1946, with the master plan for Harlow drawn up in 1947 by Sir [[Frederick Gibberd]].<ref>[http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm Gardens Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020033303/http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm |date=20 October 2004 }} – Frederick Gibberd</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8603701.stm New town, a name change and all the jazz] BBC News web site</ref> The town was planned from the outset and was designed to respect the existing landscape. A number of landscape wedges - which later became known as Green Wedges - were designed to cut through the town and separate the neighbourhoods of the town. The development incorporated the [[market town]] of Harlow, now a neighbourhood known as [[Old Harlow]], and the villages of Great Parndon, Latton, Tye Green, Potter Street, Churchgate Street, Little Parndon, and Netteswell. Each of the town's neighbourhoods is self-supporting with its own shopping precincts, community facilities and [[public house|pubs]]. Gibberd invited many of the country's leading post-war architects to design buildings in the town, including [[Philip Powell (architect)|Philip Powell]] and [[Hidalgo Moya]], [[Leonard Manasseh]], Michael Neylan, E C P Monson, Gerard Goalen, [[Maxwell Fry]], [[Jane Drew]], Graham Dawbarn, [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]] and [[William Crabtree]].  Harlow has one of the most extensive cycle track networks in the country, connecting all areas of the town to the town centre and industrial areas.  The cycle network is composed mostly of the original old town roads.

The town's authorities built Britain's first pedestrian precinct,<ref>[https://www.mun.ca/geog/interdisiplinary/harlow/harlow1.php Memorial University – Department of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121041144/http://www.mun.ca/geog/interdisiplinary/harlow/harlow1.php |date=21 January 2008 }} – Harlow's History and Geography</ref> and first modern-style residential [[tower block]], The Lawn,<ref>[https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1271496 English Heritage] – The Lawn</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6264579.stm BBC News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907002448/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6264579.stm |date=7 September 2007 }} – ''Redeveloping Essex's fallen utopia ''</ref> constructed in 1951; it is now a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]].

The first neighbourhood, Mark Hall, is a conservation area. From 1894 to 1955 the Harlow parish formed part of the [[Epping Rural District]] of Essex.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10241649 Vision of Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309114818/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10241649 |date=9 March 2007 }} – Harlow parish</ref> From 1955 to 1974, Harlow was an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10241649 Vision of Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309114838/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10241649 |date=9 March 2007 }} – Harlow UD</ref>

The town centre, and many of its neighbourhood shopping facilities have undergone major redevelopment, along with many of the town's original buildings. Subsequently, many of the original town buildings, including most of its health centres, the Staple Tye shopping centre and many industrial units have been rebuilt. Gibberd's original town hall, a landmark in the town, has been demolished and replaced by a new civic centre and The Water Gardens shopping area.

===Redevelopment===
[[File:The Chase - geograph.org.uk - 400869.jpg|thumb|The Newhall housing development built circa 2007 between Old Harlow and Church Langley]]

Since becoming a new town, Harlow has undergone several stages of expansion, the first of which was the \"mini expansion\" that was created by the building of the Sumners and Katherines estates in the mid-to-late seventies to the west of the existing town. Since then Harlow has further expanded with the Church Langley estate completed in 2005, and its newest neighbourhood [[Newhall, Essex|Newhall]] has completed the first stage of its development, with the second stage underway in 2013. The [[Harlow Gateway Scheme]] is currently underway, with the relocation of the Harlow Football Stadium to Barrow's Farm in early 2006, and the building of a new hotel, apartments, and a restaurant adjacent to the railway station being complete. The next stage of this scheme involves the completion of the 530 eco-homes being built on the former sports centre site, and the centre's relocation to the nearby former college playing field site.

Other major developments under consideration include both a northern and southern bypass of the town, and significant expansion to the north, following the completed expansion to the east. The Harlow North<ref>[http://www.harlownorth.com Ropemaker Properties Limited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305002149/http://www.harlownorth.com/ |date=5 March 2007 }} – Harlow North</ref> plans, currently awaiting permission, involve an extension of the town across the floodplains on the town's northern border, into neighbouring [[Hertfordshire]]. The plan was supported by former MP [[Bill Rammell]], all three political groups on Harlow Council, and the [[East of England Regional Assembly]]. It is opposed by Hertfordshire County Council, East Herts Council, [[Mark Prisk]], MP for Hertford and Stortford in whose constituency the development would be, and all the parishes concerned. The opposition is coordinated by a local group based in neighbouring East Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stopharlownorth.com|title=Page Redirection|website=www.stopharlownorth.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105135104/http://www.stopharlownorth.com/|archivedate=5 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> An attempt to have Harlow North designated an \"Eco Town\" was rejected by the Minister for Housing, [[Caroline Flint]] MP, in April 2008.

The south of the town centre also underwent major regeneration, with the new Civic Centre being built and the town's famous Water Gardens being redeveloped, a landscape listed by [[English Heritage]].

In 2004 Harlow businessman [[Mohammad Ghadami|Mo Ghadami]] won his High Court case to block a multimillion-pound extension of the town's Harvey Centre. The Iranian-born entrepreneur, who presented his case in person, persuaded Mr Justice Richards to quash Harlow DC's grant of planning permission for the development. In his judgment he backed Mr Ghadami's claim of 'apparent bias or predetermination' in the decision, as a result of the continued participation of Michael Garnett, the chairman of the planning committee, in the planning process after he had attempted in telephone calls to persuade Mr Ghadami to consent to the scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/harlow-planning-committee-chairmans-calls-to-objector-under-scrutiny/1231710.article|title=HARLOW PLANNING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN'S CALLS TO OBJECTOR UNDER SCRUTINY|website=lgcplus.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327014905/http://www.lgcplus.com/harlow-planning-committee-chairmans-calls-to-objector-under-scrutiny/1231710.article|archivedate=27 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Environment==

A major feature of Harlow New Town is its green spaces; over one third of the district is parkland or fields containing public footpaths. One of the original design features of Gibberd's masterplan is the Green Wedges in the town, designed to provide open space for wildlife and recreation and to separate neighbourhoods. 23% of the district is designated as Green Wedge. The Green Wedges are protected from inappropriate development, through the Local Plan.<ref name=gwreview>Harlow Council. [http://www.harlow.gov.uk/sites/harlow/files/Green%20Wedge%20Review.pdf \"Green Wedge Review\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062254/http://www.harlow.gov.uk/sites/harlow/files/Green%20Wedge%20Review.pdf |date=7 October 2016 }}, April 2014.</ref>

The town is entirely surrounded by Green Belt land, a land designation which originated in London to prevent the city sprawling, and 21% of the district is allocated as Green Belt.<ref name=gwreview /> The National Planning Policy Framework states that one of the purposes of Green Belt land is to protect unrestricted sprawl from large built-up areas.<ref name=nppf>DCLG.

[[Harlow Town Park]], at a size of 71.6-hectares (just under 1&nbsp;km²), is one of the largest urban parks in the country. The multi-functional park has been used for recreation and enjoyment for over 50 years.  This park is in the centre Netteswell [[wards of the United Kingdom|ward]] and is between the town centre and the railway station, both of which are within walking distance of the park, which is a natural thoroughfare from the station to the town centre.

There are only 12 parks with significant post-war element on the English Heritage 'Register of Parks'. With these Harlow is seen as one of the first examples of a civic scheme to marry the modern science of town and country planning.

In 2006 the entire South East of England was affected by drought, with Harlow covered by a water restriction order, preventing unnecessary use of water.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Economy==
Harlow was originally expected to provide a majority of employment opportunities in manufacturing,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} with two major developments of The Pinnacles and Templefields providing the biggest employers in the region; as with the rest of the country, this manufacturing base has declined and Harlow has had to adjust.

The original manufacturing took the form of a biscuit factory, on the Pinnacles. Owned and run as a co-op, it provided employment to the town for over 50 years, before closing in 2002. It has since been demolished and the site now has small industrial units. At its peak, the factory employed over 500 people. At the time of its closure, the owner was Burton's Foods Ltd. An £8&nbsp;million production line – installed in 1999 – was left to rust in the car park upon the closure of the factory.

[[Raytheon]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] both have large premises within the town. 
In July 2017 [[Public Health England]] had bought the vacant site from GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) hoping to move altogether 2,745 jobs there, of which about 500 are from [[Porton Down]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-40547531 Harlow site to be home to government's public health arm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216084353/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-40547531 |date=16 February 2018 }} BBC News,9 July 2017</ref>

[[Nortel]] had a large site on the eastern edge of the town, acquired when [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]] was bought in 1991, and it was here that [[Charles K. Kao]] developed [[optical fibre]] data transmission. Nortel still has a presence,{{when|date=January 2018}} but it is much reduced. 
One of Europe's leading online golf stores, Onlinegolf, is based in Harlow.

Unemployment is frequently around 10%,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} higher than the national average in the UK. Harlow also has a large number of people in social housing, almost 30%<ref name=census>[http://www.harlow.gov.uk/about_the_council/council_services/business_services/regeneration_unit/key_statistics_and_data/harlow_comparison_with_essex.aspx Harlow District Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023055606/http://www.harlow.gov.uk/about_the_council/council_services/business_services/regeneration_unit/key_statistics_and_data/harlow_comparison_with_essex.aspx |date=23 October 2008 }} – Harlow: A Comparison with Essex 2001 Census</ref> of dwellings being housing association and local authority owned, and many more privately rented.

==Politics==

==Transport==

===Rail===

Harlow is served by two [[train station|railway station]]s, [[Harlow Town railway station]] and [[Harlow Mill railway station]].  There is also a bus service to [[Epping tube station]] on the London Underground.

===Road===
Harlow is reached from junction 7 of the [[M11 motorway]], which runs from London to Cambridge, placing it within a short distance of Stansted Airport and the [[A120 road|A120]] and the orbital [[M25 motorway]]. The  [[M11 motorway]] was originally planned to run to the west of Harlow, not the east as it does today. Having planned for one of the two big industrial estates to be built to the west of the town for easy motorway access, Sir Fredrick Gibberd was appalled when the motorway was eventually built to the east of the town instead, describing it as \"just about the most monstrous thing to ever happen to me as a planner\" during a 1982 interview.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gibberd|first1=Fredrick|title=Sir Fredrick Gibberd's - Harlow New Town 1982|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB3T5Gnfcu0&t=140s|website=Youtube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429145044/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB3T5Gnfcu0&t=140s|archivedate=29 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Running through the town is the [[A414 road|A414]], a major road from [[Hertford]] to [[Chelmsford]] and linking the town with the [[A10 road (England)|A10]] to the west. Another major road running from Harlow is the A1184, which also leads to the nearby town of [[Bishop's Stortford]].

===Air===
[[Bishop's Stortford]] is the closest large town to [[London Stansted Airport]], though Harlow is only 10 miles from this major transport hub, and therefore provides several hundred airport employees. The airport operator withdrew a planning application for a second runway after the General Election of 2010, when all major political parties opposed it.

===Bus===
[[File:Harlow bus station (geograph 3445799).jpg|thumb|right|Harlow Bus Station]]
Harlow has an extensive bus network and serves as a regional hub for the local area, with operators such as Arriva (Herts and Essex) and Trustybus. There are links to many other local towns and villages such as Chelmsford City, Epping and Bishops Stortford.

Essex County Council was involved in development to Harlow's First Avenue, which was intended to reduce congestion and create better transport connections between the Newhall housing developments. The scheme was implemented in two phases, each phase focusing on developing First Avenue on either side of Howard Way. Phase two had an estimated cost of £4.4&nbsp;million and was due to be completed in early 2010, phase one is already complete and is listed as having had £3.6&nbsp;million of funding from the [[Community Infrastructure Fund]] (CIF).<ref>{{cite web

==Art and culture==
[[File:Trigon, Harlow (25996639083).jpg|thumb|upright|''Trigon'' by [[Lynn Chadwick]], in a Harlow shopping street]]

Harlow is the home to a major collection of public sculptures (over 100 in total) by artists such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]], and [[Ralph Brown (sculptor)|Ralph Brown]]. Many of these are owned by the [[Harlow art trust|Harlow Art Trust]], an organisation set up in 1953 by the lead architect of Harlow [[Frederick Gibberd]]. Gibberd had idealistic notions of the New Town as a place where people who might not normally have access to art could enjoy great sculptures by great artists on every street corner. Consequently, almost all of Harlow's sculpture collection is in the open air, in shopping centres, housing estates and parks around the town.<ref>Whiteley, Gillian: ''Sculpture in Harlow'', Harlow Art Trust, 2005</ref>

In 2009 Harlow Council voted to celebrate Harlow's collection of sculpture by branding Harlow as 'Harlow Sculpture Town – The World's First Sculpture Town'. [[Harlow Sculpture Town]] began as an initiative from Harlow Art Trust, presenting itself as 'Sculpture Town', in a similar way to [[Hay-on-Wye]]'s presentation of itself as [[Booktown]].<ref>''Harlow Herald'', 31 March 2009{{page needed|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.harlowarttrust.org.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151329/http://www.harlowarttrust.org.uk/ |date=8 October 2011 }} Harlow Art Trust</ref>

As part of the 'Sculpture Town' branding, Harlow is also home to the [[Gibberd Garden]], the former home of Frederick and Elizabeth Gibberd, which is a managed twentieth-century garden, and home to some of the Gibberd's private sculpture collection.<ref>http://www.thegibberdgarden.co.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309234136/http://www.thegibberdgarden.co.uk/ |date=9 March 2009 }} see Gibberd Garden</ref> The Gibberd Gallery, in the Civic Centre, contains a collection of twentieth-century watercolours and temporary exhibitions.

== Plot ==
Siva aka S.K ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) is a theatre actor whose only aim is to become a superstar like [[Rajinikanth]]. However, his lack of acting out romantic scenes hinders his path to the dream, and is even rejected by director [[K. S. Ravikumar]] during the audition for his new film ''[[Avvai Shanmugi]] 2''. He comes across Kavya ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), who is a doctor, and instantly falls in love with her. He goes to her house to propose his love, only to find out that she is engaged to a [[Pune]]-based doctor named Vishwanath alias Vishwa ([[Anson Paul]]). Siva, though becoming disappointed, decides to woo Kavya anyway and somehow break her engagement with Vishwa. He disguises himself as a nurse, going by the name of \"Remo\" (short for \"Regina Motwani\", a combination of the names of actresses [[Regina Cassandra]] and [[Hansika Motwani]]), and takes up a job in the same hospital where Kavya works.

Ensuring that Kavya never finds out his true identity, Siva as Remo establishes a close friendship with her but is unable to convince her to end her engagement with Vishwa. Undeterred, he organizes a massive surprise on her birthday and proposes to her as Siva. Kavya, who has been charmed by the surprise and fallen in love with Siva, is in a dilemma as she is unable to decide between Vishwa and Siva. Siva takes advantage of her dilemma and juggles the roles of both Siva as well as Remo with the aim of breaking her engagement, all the while hiding his dual identity from her. Eventually, Kavya gives in and admits her feelings to Siva, but, to the shock of both her and Siva, Vishwa has decided to prepone their marriage to the very next day because Vishwa saw Kavya enjoying with Siva. Kavya decides to end her engagement and leave her house to be with Siva. While Kavya pours out her feelings to Siva (who is disguised as Remo), Vishwa arrives with some goons to forcibly take her away.It was also shown early that Vishwa had only lust for Kavya as she was very beautiful.  Siva, still in his Remo guise, thrashes Vishwa and his goons, but at the same moment, he is forced to rush to the hospital to attend to a terminally-ill orphan named Nancy (Baby Raksha), with whom he had established a close bond. On Nancy's cajoling (Siva as Remo has earlier promised her that he would \"change himself\" to a man as a \"magic trick\"), Siva removes his Remo disguise, exposing his identity to Kavya. Betrayed and hurt, Kavya berates Siva for cheating her and ending her engagement and warns him never to go behind her again. Despite Siva's repeated pleas, Kavya refuses to budge and Siva sadly walks away.

A few months later, an old man sits next to Kavya in a bus. Kavya tells her latest problem to him: Siva is still attracted to her and constantly calls her, despite her having changed her number 46 times. However, she also adds that she still loves Siva and is only avoiding him as she wants to punish him for cheating her earlier. At this juncture, she accidentally finds out that the old man is none other than Siva in disguise. After scolding Siva for cheating her yet again, she softens and asks him to marry her, to which he happily agrees.

The film ends with Siva finally achieving his dream: acting along with his best friend Vallikanth ([[Sathish]]) in a movie which seems to be his life story named ''Remo Nee Kadhalan'' (''Remo O Premikudu'' and ''Remo Ninda Premam'' in Telugu and Malayalam versions), directed by K. S. Ravikumar, in which actress [[Sri Divya]] plays the role of Kavya as Dr. Divya.

The actor opened up about this in an interview with Kaushik LM, for The News Minute:

{{Quote|text=''After director Bakkiyaraj's narration, I didn't open up to anyone for a few days as I couldn't visualize myself as a lady. I finally shared this idea with my friends, including Sathish and Arunraja Kamaraj, and narrated the script to them for about 45 mins. They responded positively and laughed at the very same moments which appealed to me as well. Cross-dressing is the biggest challenge in cinema and I've given it my all for “Remo”. I don't see myself taking up such an experiment again. I couldn't afford to look hefty in the nurse look and had to become really lean. I stopped gymming for about 7 months and lost up to 9 kilos. I had to look cute in this look and match Keerthy's age, too. Also, for these portions, I dubbed for just five minutes of footage each day. I took about 4 to 5 hours each day in the morning to complete this. I used to shuttle from my house in ECR to Prasad Labs daily. It was tough, as my voice needed ample rest while dubbing for the lady portions.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/sivakarthikeyan-interview-remo-hero-opens-cross-dressing-stalking-and-more-50783|title=Sivakarthikeyan interview: 'Remo' hero opens up on cross dressing, social responsibility and more|last=|first=|date=|website=www.thenewsminute.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

== Plot ==
Siva aka S.K ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) is a theatre actor whose only aim is to become a superstar like [[Rajinikanth]]. However, his lack of acting out romantic scenes hinders his path to the dream, and is even rejected by director [[K. S. Ravikumar]] during the audition for his new film ''[[Avvai Shanmugi]] 2''. He comes across Kavya ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), who is a doctor, and instantly falls in love with her. He goes to her house to propose his love, only to find out that she is engaged to a [[Pune]]-based doctor named Vishwanath alias Vishwa ([[Anson Paul]]). Siva, though becoming disappointed, decides to woo Kavya anyway and somehow break her engagement with Vishwa. He disguises himself as a nurse, going by the name of \"Remo\" (short for \"Regina Motwani\", a combination of the names of actresses [[Regina Cassandra]] and [[Hansika Motwani]]), and takes up a job in the same hospital where Kavya works.

Ensuring that Kavya never finds out his true identity, Siva as Remo establishes a close friendship with her but is unable to convince her to end her engagement with Vishwa. Undeterred, he organizes a massive surprise on her birthday and proposes to her as Siva. Kavya, who has been charmed by the surprise and fallen in love with Siva, is in a dilemma as she is unable to decide between Vishwa and Siva. Siva takes advantage of her dilemma and juggles the roles of both Siva as well as Remo with the aim of breaking her engagement, all the while hiding his dual identity from her. Eventually, Kavya gives in and admits her feelings to Siva, but, to the shock of both her and Siva, Vishwa has decided to prepone their marriage to the very next day because Vishwa saw Kavya enjoying with Siva. Kavya decides to end her engagement and leave her house to be with Siva. While Kavya pours out her feelings to Siva (who is disguised as Remo), Vishwa arrives with some goons to forcibly take her away.It was also shown early that Vishwa had only lust for Kavya as she was very beautiful.  Siva, still in his Remo guise, thrashes Vishwa and his goons, but at the same moment, he is forced to rush to the hospital to attend to a terminally-ill orphan named Nancy (Baby Raksha), with whom he had established a close bond. On Nancy's cajoling (Siva as Remo has earlier promised her that he would \"change himself\" to a man as a \"magic trick\"), Siva removes his Remo disguise, exposing his identity to Kavya. Betrayed and hurt, Kavya berates Siva for cheating her and ending her engagement and warns him never to go behind her again. Despite Siva's repeated pleas, Kavya refuses to budge and Siva sadly walks away.

A few months later, an old man sits next to Kavya in a bus. Kavya tells her latest problem to him: Siva is still attracted to her and constantly calls her, despite her having changed her number 46 times. However, she also adds that she still loves Siva and is only avoiding him as she wants to punish him for cheating her earlier. At this juncture, she accidentally finds out that the old man is none other than Siva in disguise. After scolding Siva for cheating her yet again, she softens and asks him to marry her, to which he happily agrees.

The film ends with Siva finally achieving his dream: acting along with his best friend Vallikanth ([[Sathish]]) in a movie which seems to be his life story named ''Remo Nee Kadhalan'' (''Remo O Premikudu'' and ''Remo Ninda Premam'' in Telugu and Malayalam versions), directed by K. S. Ravikumar, in which actress [[Sri Divya]] plays the role of Kavya as Dr. Divya.

The actor opened up about this in an interview with Kaushik LM, for The News Minute:

{{Quote|text=''After director Bakkiyaraj's narration, I didn't open up to anyone for a few days as I couldn't visualize myself as a lady. I finally shared this idea with my friends, including Sathish and Arunraja Kamaraj, and narrated the script to them for about 45 mins. They responded positively and laughed at the very same moments which appealed to me as well. Cross-dressing is the biggest challenge in cinema and I've given it my all for “Remo”. I don't see myself taking up such an experiment again. I couldn't afford to look hefty in the nurse look and had to become really lean. I stopped gymming for about 7 months and lost up to 9 kilos. I had to look cute in this look and match Keerthy's age, too. Also, for these portions, I dubbed for just five minutes of footage each day. I took about 4 to 5 hours each day in the morning to complete this. I used to shuttle from my house in ECR to Prasad Labs daily. It was tough, as my voice needed ample rest while dubbing for the lady portions.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/sivakarthikeyan-interview-remo-hero-opens-cross-dressing-stalking-and-more-50783|title=Sivakarthikeyan interview: 'Remo' hero opens up on cross dressing, social responsibility and more|last=|first=|date=|website=www.thenewsminute.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

The '''Game of Life''', also known simply as '''Life''', is a [[cellular automaton]] devised by the British [[mathematician]] [[John Horton Conway]] in 1970.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/life.pdf | title=Mathematical Games - The Fantastic Combinations of John Conway's New Solitaire Game 'Life' | first=Martin | last=Gardner  | issue=223 | journal=[[Scientific American]] | date=October 1970 | pages=120–123| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1070-120 }}</ref>

The game is a [[zero-player game]], meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [[Turing complete]] and can simulate a [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] or any other [[Turing machine]].

==Rules==
The universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
# Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

The initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a ''[[pure function]]'' of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

==Origins==
In late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179 1179]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179}}</ref> This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Motivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877 877]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877}}</ref> [[John Horton Conway|Conway's]] initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.

Conway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:
# There should be no explosive growth.
# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.
# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.
# The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.<ref>Conway, private communication to the 'Life list', 14 April 1999.</ref>

The game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s \"[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]\" column. Theoretically, ''Conway's Life'' has the power of a [[universal Turing machine]]: anything that can be computed [[algorithm]]ically can be computed within ''Life''.<ref name=\"chapman\"> It is a model and simulation that is interesting to watch and can show that simple things can become complicated problems.{{cite web|url=http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/|title=Life Universal Computer|author=Paul Chapman|accessdate=12 July 2009|date=11 November 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"bcg\">{{Cite book | last1=Berlekamp | first1=E.

Since its publication, ''Conway's Game of Life'' has attracted much interest, because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can evolve. ''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. Scholars in various fields, such as [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[economics]], [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[generative science]]s have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules.{{citation needed|reason=Example from philosophy given, but claim made across various fields, some evidence to substantiate, elucidate the implicit claim of \"diverse academic use of this game\" should be provided|date=April 2015}} The game can also serve as a didactic [[analogy]], used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]] has used the analogy of ''Conway's Life'' \"universe\" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as [[consciousness]] and [[free will]], from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=D.

The popularity of ''Conway's Game of Life'' was helped by its coming into being just in time for a new generation of inexpensive computer access which was being released into the market. The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractal]]s. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P. Goucher|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>

==Examples of patterns==
Many different types of patterns occur in the ''Game of Life'', which are classified according to their behaviour. Common pattern types include: ''[[Still life (cellular automaton)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.

The earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> these were the first spaceships ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

Conway originally conjectured that no pattern can grow indefinitely—i.e., that for any initial configuration with a finite number of living cells, the population cannot grow beyond some finite upper limit. In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], led by [[Bill Gosper]]; the \"Gosper glider gun\" produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|title=Gosper glider gun|author=Stephen A. Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2015, a gun called the \"Simkin glider gun\", which releases a glider every 120th generation, was discovered that has fewer live cells but which is spread out across a larger bounding box at its extremities.<ref>[http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1599&start=200#p19125 The Hunting of the New Herschel Conduits], ConwayLife forums, April 28th, 2015, posts by Michael Simkin (\"simsim314\") and Dongook Lee (\"Scorbie\").</ref>

Smaller patterns were later found that also exhibit infinite growth. All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely. The first two create a single ''block-laying switch engine'': a configuration that leaves behind two-by-two still life blocks as its translates itself across the game's universe.<ref>

Later discoveries included other ''[[Gun (cellular automaton)|guns]]'', which are stationary, and which produce gliders or other spaceships; ''[[puffer train]]s'', which move along leaving behind a trail of debris; and ''[[rake (cellular automaton)|rakes]]'', which move and emit spaceships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#rake|title=Rake|author=Stephen A. Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Gosper also constructed the first pattern with an [[Asymptotically optimal algorithm|asymptotically optimal]] [[quadratic growth|quadratic growth rate]], called a ''[[Breeder (cellular automaton)|breeder]]'' or ''lobster'', which worked by leaving behind a trail of guns.

It is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite-state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].<ref name=\"chapman\"/><ref name=\"bcg\"/> In fact, several different programmable computer architectures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>

Furthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.<ref name=\"bcg\"/>

On March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a [[Knight (chess)|knight in chess]]), as opposed to moving orthogonally or along a 45° diagonal. This is the first new spaceship movement pattern for an elementary spaceship found in forty-eight years. \"Elementary\" means that it cannot be decomposed into smaller interacting patterns such as gliders and still lifes.<ref>[http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Elementary \"Elementary\"], LifeWiki, retrieved 2018-11-21</ref>

==Undecidability==

Many patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.

''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.<ref>Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982</ref>

Indeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.

==Self-replication==
On May 18, 2010, Andrew J.

In October 2018, Adam P. Goucher finished his construction of the 0E0P metacell, a metacell capable of self-replication.

==Iteration==
From most random initial patterns of living cells on the grid, observers will find the population constantly changing as the generations tick by. The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated sub patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.

==Algorithms==
Early patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.

A variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>
[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of Life on the surface of a trefoil knot|thumb|Game of Life on the surface of a [[trefoil knot]]]]
To avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.

If it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.

[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]
[[File:Игра \"Жизнь\".gif|thumb|right|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions]]

In principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a [[Möbius strip]].

Alternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.

For exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15–18 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201–209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 }}</ref> [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life}}</ref>

==Variations==
{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}
Since ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours, survives if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.<ref>[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife – An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A. Silver|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref>

Additional {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata exist. The vast majority of these 2<sup>18</sup> different rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Life-like#Life-like_cellular_automata |title=Life-like cellular automata - LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> produce universes that are either too chaotic or too desolate to be of interest, but a large subset do display interesting behavior. A further generalization produces the ''isotropic'' rulespace, with 2<sup>102</sup> possible CA rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Isotropic |title=Isotropic - LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> (Conway's Life again being one of them). These are rules that use the same square grid as the ''Life''-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state—not just the total number of those neighbours.

[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]

Some variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations. A variant using non-periodic tile grids has also been made.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22134-first-gliders-navigate-everchanging-penrose-universe.html|magazine=New Scientist|title=First gliders navigate ever-changing Penrose universe}}</ref>

Conway's rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, ''live'' and ''dead'', there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.

Patterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>

''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between [[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]] and other objects within the game.<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_i.htm#immigration |title=Immigration |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A. Silver |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Another similar variation, called ''QuadLife'', involves four different on states. When a new cell is born from three different on neighbours, it takes on the fourth value, and otherwise, like ''Immigration'', it takes the majority value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_q.htm#quadlife |title=QuadLife |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A. Silver |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Except for the variation among on cells, both of these variations act identically to Life.

Computers have been used to follow ''Life'' configurations since it was first publicized. When John Conway was first investigating how various starting configurations developed, he tracked them by hand using a [[Go (game)|Go]] board with its black and white stones. This was tedious and prone to errors. While Conway was investigating the R-pentomino, John Francis, an undergraduate student at The [[University of Cambridge]], wrote a program (for an IBM 360 at the nearby Institute of Theoretical Astronomy) to check Conway's results. This program showed that the configuration had not reached a stable state after 1000 generations.

The first interactive ''Life'' program was written in an early version of [[ALGOL 68C]] for the [[PDP-7]] by [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|M. J. T. Guy]] and [[Stephen R. Bourne|S. R. Bourne]]. The results were published in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', along with the statement: \"Without its help, some discoveries about the game would have been difficult to make.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Mathematical Games: The fantastic combinations of John Conway's new solitaire game \"Life\"|first=Martin|last=Gardner|journal=Scientific American|volume=223|issue=4|date=October 1970|pages=120–123|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1070-120}}</ref>

Two early implementations of Life on home computers were by Malcolm Banthorpe written in [[BBC BASIC]]. The first was in the January 1984 issue of [[Acorn User]] magazine and Banthorpe followed this with a 3D version in the May 1984 issue (these can be downloaded as PDFs).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://8bs.com/aumags.htm |title=Acorn User Magazine Scans |author=<!--Not stated-->|publisher=The BBC and Master Computer Public Domain Library |access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>
Susan Stepney, Professor of Computer Science at the [[University of York]], followed this up in 1988 with \"Life on the line\", a program that generated one-dimensional cellular automata.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/bib/ss/au.htm|title= AcornUser articles |last= Stepney |first= Susan |website=www-users.cs.york.ac.uk |publisher= AcornUser|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>

There are now thousands of ''Life'' programs online, so a full list will not be provided here. The following is a small selection of programs with some special claim to notability, such as popularity or unusual features. Most of these programs incorporate a graphical user interface for pattern editing and simulation, the capability for simulating multiple rules including Life, and a large library of interesting patterns in Life and other CA rules.

The '''Game of Life''', also known simply as '''Life''', is a [[cellular automaton]] devised by the British [[mathematician]] [[John Horton Conway]] in 1970.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/life.pdf | title=Mathematical Games - The Fantastic Combinations of John Conway's New Solitaire Game 'Life' | first=Martin | last=Gardner  | issue=223 | journal=[[Scientific American]] | date=October 1970 | pages=120–123| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1070-120 }}</ref>

The game is a [[zero-player game]], meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [[Turing complete]] and can simulate a [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] or any other [[Turing machine]].

==Rules==
The universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
# Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

The initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a ''[[pure function]]'' of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

==Origins==
In late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179 1179]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179}}</ref> This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Motivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877 877]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877}}</ref> [[John Horton Conway|Conway's]] initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.

Conway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:
# There should be no explosive growth.
# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.
# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.

The game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s \"[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]\" column. Theoretically, ''Conway's Life'' has the power of a [[universal Turing machine]]: anything that can be computed [[algorithm]]ically can be computed within ''Life''.<ref name=\"chapman\"> It is a model and simulation that is interesting to watch and can show that simple things can become complicated problems.{{cite web|url=http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/|title=Life Universal Computer|author=Paul Chapman|accessdate=12 July 2009|date=11 November 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"bcg\">{{Cite book | last1=Berlekamp | first1=E.

Since its publication, ''Conway's Game of Life'' has attracted much interest, because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can evolve. ''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. Scholars in various fields, such as [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[economics]], [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[generative science]]s have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules.{{citation needed|reason=Example from philosophy given, but claim made across various fields, some evidence to substantiate, elucidate the implicit claim of \"diverse academic use of this game\" should be provided|date=April 2015}} The game can also serve as a didactic [[analogy]], used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]] has used the analogy of ''Conway's Life'' \"universe\" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as [[consciousness]] and [[free will]], from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=D.

The popularity of ''Conway's Game of Life'' was helped by its coming into being just in time for a new generation of inexpensive computer access which was being released into the market. The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractal]]s. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P.

==Examples of patterns==
Many different types of patterns occur in the ''Game of Life'', which are classified according to their behaviour. Common pattern types include: ''[[Still life (cellular automaton)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.

The earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> these were the first spaceships ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

Conway originally conjectured that no pattern can grow indefinitely—i.e., that for any initial configuration with a finite number of living cells, the population cannot grow beyond some finite upper limit. In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], led by [[Bill Gosper]]; the \"Gosper glider gun\" produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|title=Gosper glider gun|author=Stephen A. Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2015, a gun called the \"Simkin glider gun\", which releases a glider every 120th generation, was discovered that has fewer live cells but which is spread out across a larger bounding box at its extremities.<ref>[http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1599&start=200#p19125 The Hunting of the New Herschel Conduits], ConwayLife forums, April 28th, 2015, posts by Michael Simkin (\"simsim314\") and Dongook Lee (\"Scorbie\").</ref>

Smaller patterns were later found that also exhibit infinite growth. All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely. The first two create a single ''block-laying switch engine'': a configuration that leaves behind two-by-two still life blocks as its translates itself across the game's universe.<ref>

Later discoveries included other ''[[Gun (cellular automaton)|guns]]'', which are stationary, and which produce gliders or other spaceships; ''[[puffer train]]s'', which move along leaving behind a trail of debris; and ''[[rake (cellular automaton)|rakes]]'', which move and emit spaceships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#rake|title=Rake|author=Stephen A. Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Gosper also constructed the first pattern with an [[Asymptotically optimal algorithm|asymptotically optimal]] [[quadratic growth|quadratic growth rate]], called a ''[[Breeder (cellular automaton)|breeder]]'' or ''lobster'', which worked by leaving behind a trail of guns.

It is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite-state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].<ref name=\"chapman\"/><ref name=\"bcg\"/> In fact, several different programmable computer architectures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>

Furthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.<ref name=\"bcg\"/>

On March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a [[Knight (chess)|knight in chess]]), as opposed to moving orthogonally or along a 45° diagonal. This is the first new spaceship movement pattern for an elementary spaceship found in forty-eight years. \"Elementary\" means that it cannot be decomposed into smaller interacting patterns such as gliders and still lifes.<ref>[http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Elementary \"Elementary\"], LifeWiki, retrieved 2018-11-21</ref>

==Undecidability==

Many patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.

''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.<ref>Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982</ref>

Indeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.

==Self-replication==
On May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade announced a self-constructing pattern, dubbed \"Gemini\", that creates a copy of itself while destroying its parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=399&p=2327#p2327 |title=Universal Constructor Based Spaceship |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gemini |title=Gemini – LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders oscillating between two stable configurations made of Chapman–Greene construction arms. These, in turn, create new copies of the pattern, and destroy the previous copy. Gemini is also a spaceship, and is the first spaceship constructed in the Game of Life that is an oblique spaceship, which is a spaceship that is neither orthogonal nor purely diagonal.<ref>{{Cite news|periodical=New Scientist|date=16 June 2010|first=Jacob|last=Aron|title=First replicating creature spawned in life simulator|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627653.800-first-replicating-creature-spawned-in-life-simulator.html|accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Types_of_spaceships#Knightship |title=Gemini – LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref> In December 2015, diagonal versions of the Gemini were built.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Demonoid|title=Demonoid|publisher=LifeWiki|access-date=18 June 2016}}</ref>

On November 23, 2013, Dave Greene built the first [[replicator (cellular automaton)|replicator]] in ''Conway's Game of Life'' that creates a complete copy of itself, including the instruction tape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1006&p=9917#p9901|title=Geminoid Challenge|publisher=Conwaylife.com|accessdate=2015-06-25}}</ref>

In October 2018, Adam P. Goucher finished his construction of the 0E0P metacell, a metacell capable of self-replication. This differed from previous metacells, such as the OTCA metapixel by Brice Due, which only worked with already constructed copies near them. The 0E0P metacell works by using construction arms to create copies that simulate the programmed rule.<ref>{{Citation|last=Passe-Science|title=Automate Cellulaire - Passe-science #27|date=2019-05-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfRSVPhzN5M|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref> The actual simulation of Conway's Life or other [[Moore neighborhood]] rules is done by simulating an equivalent rule using the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] with more states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cp4space.wordpress.com/2018/11/12/fully-self-directed-replication/|title=Fully self-directed replication|last=apgoucher|date=2018-11-12|website=Complex Projective 4-Space|language=en|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref> The name 0E0P is short for \"Zero Encoded by Zero Population\", which indicates that instead of a metacell being in an \"off\" state simulating empty space, the 0E0P metacell removes itself when the cell enters that state, leaving a blank space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/0E0P|title=0E0P metacell - LifeWiki|website=www.conwaylife.com|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref>

==Iteration==
From most random initial patterns of living cells on the grid, observers will find the population constantly changing as the generations tick by. The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated sub patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.

==Algorithms==
Early patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.

A variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>
[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of Life on the surface of a trefoil knot|thumb|Game of Life on the surface of a [[trefoil knot]]]]
To avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.

If it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.

[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]
[[File:Игра \"Жизнь\".gif|thumb|right|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions]]

In principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a [[Möbius strip]].

Alternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.

For exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15–18 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201–209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 }}</ref> [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life}}</ref>

==Variations==
{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}
Since ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours, survives if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.<ref>[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife – An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A. Silver|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref>

Additional {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata exist. The vast majority of these 2<sup>18</sup> different rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Life-like#Life-like_cellular_automata |title=Life-like cellular automata - LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> produce universes that are either too chaotic or too desolate to be of interest, but a large subset do display interesting behavior. A further generalization produces the ''isotropic'' rulespace, with 2<sup>102</sup> possible CA rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Isotropic |title=Isotropic - LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> (Conway's Life again being one of them). These are rules that use the same square grid as the ''Life''-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state—not just the total number of those neighbours.

[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]

Some variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations. A variant using non-periodic tile grids has also been made.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22134-first-gliders-navigate-everchanging-penrose-universe.html|magazine=New Scientist|title=First gliders navigate ever-changing Penrose universe}}</ref>

Conway's rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, ''live'' and ''dead'', there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.

Patterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>

''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between [[Spaceship (CA)|spaceships]] and other objects within the game.<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_i.htm#immigration |title=Immigration |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A. Silver |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Another similar variation, called ''QuadLife'', involves four different on states. When a new cell is born from three different on neighbours, it takes on the fourth value, and otherwise, like ''Immigration'', it takes the majority value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_q.htm#quadlife |title=QuadLife |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A. Silver |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Except for the variation among on cells, both of these variations act identically to Life.

==Notable programs==
[[File:Turing Machine in Golly.png|thumb|right|The 6&thinsp;366&thinsp;548&thinsp;773&thinsp;467&thinsp;669&thinsp;985&thinsp;195&thinsp;496&thinsp;000<sup>th</sup> ({{val|6|e=27}}-th) generation of a [[Turing machine]], made in the game of Life, computed in less than 30 seconds on an [[Intel]] Core Duo 2 GHz CPU using Golly in [[Hashlife]] mode]]

Computers have been used to follow ''Life'' configurations since it was first publicized. When John Conway was first investigating how various starting configurations developed, he tracked them by hand using a [[Go (game)|Go]] board with its black and white stones. This was tedious and prone to errors. While Conway was investigating the R-pentomino, John Francis, an undergraduate student at The [[University of Cambridge]], wrote a program (for an IBM 360 at the nearby Institute of Theoretical Astronomy) to check Conway's results. This program showed that the configuration had not reached a stable state after 1000 generations.

The first interactive ''Life'' program was written in an early version of [[ALGOL 68C]] for the [[PDP-7]] by [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|M. J. T. Guy]] and [[Stephen R. Bourne|S. R. Bourne]]. The results were published in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', along with the statement: \"Without its help, some discoveries about the game would have been difficult to make.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Mathematical Games: The fantastic combinations of John Conway's new solitaire game \"Life\"|first=Martin|last=Gardner|journal=Scientific American|volume=223|issue=4|date=October 1970|pages=120–123|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1070-120}}</ref>

Two early implementations of Life on home computers were by Malcolm Banthorpe written in [[BBC BASIC]]. The first was in the January 1984 issue of [[Acorn User]] magazine and Banthorpe followed this with a 3D version in the May 1984 issue (these can be downloaded as PDFs).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://8bs.com/aumags.htm |title=Acorn User Magazine Scans |author=<!--Not stated-->|publisher=The BBC and Master Computer Public Domain Library |access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>
Susan Stepney, Professor of Computer Science at the [[University of York]], followed this up in 1988 with \"Life on the line\", a program that generated one-dimensional cellular automata.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/bib/ss/au.htm|title= AcornUser articles |last= Stepney |first= Susan |website=www-users.cs.york.ac.uk |publisher= AcornUser|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>

There are now thousands of ''Life'' programs online, so a full list will not be provided here. The following is a small selection of programs with some special claim to notability, such as popularity or unusual features. Most of these programs incorporate a graphical user interface for pattern editing and simulation, the capability for simulating multiple rules including Life, and a large library of interesting patterns in Life and other CA rules.
* [[Golly (program)|Golly]] is a cross-platform (Windows, Macintosh, Linux and also iOS and Android) open-source simulation system for ''Life'' and other cellular automata (including all ''Life''-like cellular automata, the ''Generations'' family of cellular automata from ''Mirek's Cellebration'', John von Neumann's 29-state cellular automaton, and others), by Andrew Trevorrow and Tomas Rokicki. It includes the ''Hashlife'' algorithm for extremely fast generation, and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scriptability for both editing and simulation.
* ''Mirek's Cellebration'' is a freeware 1-D and 2-D cellular automata viewer, explorer and editor for Windows. It includes powerful facilities for simulating and viewing a wide variety of CA rules including ''Life'', and a scriptable editor.
* ''Xlife'' is a cellular-automaton laboratory by Jon Bennett. The standard UNIX X11 Life simulation application for a long time, it has also been ported to Windows. It can handle cellular automaton rules with the same neighbourhood as ''Life'', and up to eight possible states per cell.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Xlife |title=Xlife}}</ref>

Google implemented an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] of ''Conway's Game of Life'' in 2012. Users who search for the term are shown an implementation of the game in the search results page.

The '''Quad Cities River Bandits''' are a [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[minor league baseball]] team, affiliated with the [[Houston Astros]], that plays in the [[Midwest League]]. Its home games are played at [[Modern Woodmen Park]] (formerly John O'Donnell Stadium) in [[Davenport, Iowa]], one of the [[Quad Cities]].

==History==
Beginning in 1879, Quad City area professional baseball has a history that includes three teams.  Davenport, Moline ([[Moline Plowboys]]) and Rock Island ([[Rock Island Islanders]]) all have hosted [[minor league baseball]] teams. A fourth area team played in nearby [[Kewanee, Illinois]]. The 1879 Davenport Brown Stockings, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Bid McPhee]],  finished 5-15 in the Northwestern League. The Brown Stockings played with the Dubuque Red Stockings, Omaha Green Stockings and Rockford White Stockings, before the Northwestern League folded after one season. The Davenport Onion Weeders (1888), Davenport Hawkeyes (1889) and Davenport Pilgrims (1891) played before the turn of the 20th century in the [[Western Association]] (1888), [[Central Interstate League]] (1889) and the [[Illinois-Iowa League]] (1891).<ref name=\"baseball-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/ |title=Minor League Baseball History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/league.cgi?id=9db35b65|title=1879 Northwestern League|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/l-NWES1/y-1879|title=1879 Northwestern League (NL) on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Northwestern_League|title=Northwestern League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Western_Association|title=Western Association - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

In 1901, the [[Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League]] or \"Three-I League\" was founded, with the Davenport River Rats and Rock Island Islanders as charter members. This Davenport team set the foundation of the franchise that exists today. Other charter members of the 1901 Three-I League were the [[Bloomington Blues]], [[Cedar Rapids Rabbits]], [[Decatur Commodores]], [[Evansville River Rats]], Rockford Red Sox and [[Terre Haute Hottentots]]. The Davenport franchise changed monikers frequently in the early years, playing as the Davenport River Rats (1901–04), Davenport Riversides (1905), Davenport  Knickerbockers (1906), Davenport  Prodigals (1909–12) and [[Davenport Blue Sox]] (1913–1916). The Davenport Blue Sox won the 1914 Three-I League Championship.
<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" />

The third Quad City area team was added In July, 1914. The [[Danville Speakers]] of the Three-I League relocated to Moline and the [[Moline Plowboys]] were established. The Moline Plowboys won Three-I League Championships in 1915, 1921 and 1937. A fourth area team, the nearby [[Kewanee Boilermakers]], were members of the Class C [[Central Association]] (1908-1913 and 1948-1949). Kewanee won the 1949 Central Association Championship as the Kewanee A's, affiliates of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1948-1949) after Moline relocated to Kewanee in mid-season 1948. The Moline Plowboys/Moline A's were affiliates of the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1922), [[St Louis Browns]] (1931–32), [[Chicago Cubs]] (1937–40) and the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1947–48). The Rock Island Islanders were affiliates of the [[St. Louis Browns]] (1932) and [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1933).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kewanee,_IL|title=Kewanee, IL - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Moline,_IL|title=Moline, IL - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Rock_Island_Islanders|title=Rock Island Islanders - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

After folding in 1916, the Davenport Blue Sox resumed play in 1929. On May 26, 1931, the Davenport Blue Sox moved into newly built Municipal Stadium, nicknamed the \"Muny.\" The Davenport Blue Sox played in the [[Mississippi Valley League]] (1929–1933) and [[Western League (1900–1958)|Western League]] (1934–1937). The Blue Sox were an affiliate of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (1936-1937).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Davenport_Blue_Sox|title=Davenport Blue Sox - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

The Rock Island Islanders and Davenport Blue Sox faced each other in the Mississippi Valley League Championship series in both 1932 and 1933. Rock Island won the 1932 Championship in six games. Davenport defeated the Islanders to win the 1933 Championship in the final season of the Mississippi Valley League. The 1933 Blue Sox were led by Ed Hall's 151 RBI and [[Como Cotelle]]'s .407 average. The 1936 Blue Sox continued the strong decade, winning the 1936 [[Western League (1900–1958)|Western League]] Championship.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=fitzpa002joh John Fitzpatrick Minor League Statistics & History] Baseball-Reference.com</ref>

The 1933 Davenport Blue Sox were ranked in [[The National Baseball Association's top 100 minor league teams]] (#58). Davenport finished 83-32 before defeating Rock Island in the 1933 Mississippi Valley League Championship series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=58|title=Top 100 Teams &#124; MiLB.com History &#124; The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}</ref>

The Davenport Blue Sox and Rock Island Islanders were both members of the [[Western League (1900–1958)|Western League]] in 1937. The Rock Island Islanders franchise folded on July 7 1937. The Western League itself then folded after the season, leaving Davenport without a team until 1946. The Rock Island Islanders franchise never played again. The Moline A's (1947-1948) moved to become the [[Kewanee A's]] (1948-1949), who folded permanently along with the Central Association in 1949. Moline played home games at [[Browning Field]] and Rock Island at [[Douglas Park (Rock Island)|Douglas Park]]. Both Browning Field and Douglas Park are in use today.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Western_League|title=Western League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kewanee_A%27s|title=Kewanee A's - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

After a nine-season baseball hiatus during [[World War II]], baseball returned to Davenport in 1946. The Davenport Cubs (1946-1947) rejoined the Class B [[Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League]] (Three-I League) as an affiliate of the [[Chicago Cubs]]. Led by future MLB players [[Roy Smalley, Jr.|Roy Smalley]] and [[Rube Walker]], the 1946 Davenport Cubs won the regular season pennant.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\">Rask, Tim; Baseball at John O'Donnell Stadium (2004) Arcadia Publishing; {{ISBN|0-7385-3247-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=b26d1c3a |title=1946 Davenport Cubs Statistics – Minor Leagues |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref> 

The Davenport Pirates (1948-1949) were an affiliate of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].  [[Bob Purkey]], [[Frank Thomas (outfielder)|Frank Thomas]] and future [[Cy Young Award]] Winner [[Vern Law]] were on the 1949 Pirates. The Pirates swept Evansville, 3-0, to win the 1949 Three-I League Championship. In 1949 Davenport drew 133,505 fans, a franchise record that would stand until 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/about/page.jsp?ymd=20090224&content_id=514556&vkey=about_t565&fext=.js |title=pre-1960s &#124; MiLB.com About &#124; The Official Site of Minor League Baseball |publisher=Milb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref>

Remaining in the Three-I League, the 1950 Davenport Quads operated as an Independent team. The Davenport Tigers (1951-1952) were an affiliate of the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1951-1952). [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Jim Bunning]] pitched for the 1951 Davenport Tigers and [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] announcer [[Milo Hamilton]] was the Tigers' announcer on radio. [[Harvey Kuenn]] played for the 1952 tigers, hitting .340. Kuehn was called up to the Detroit Tigers after the 1952 Davenport season ended. Kuenn won the 1953 [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=2ca0259a |title=1952 Davenport Tigers Statistics – Minor Leagues |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/broadcaster-milo-hamilton-dies/c-150122950|title=Hall of Fame broadcaster Milo Hamilton dies|website=MLB.com}}</ref>

After the 1952 season, Davenport folded. They were replaced by the [[Peoria Chiefs]] in the 1953 Three-I League. Davenport remained without a team for four seasons. The 1957 Davenport DavSox (1957-1958) rejoined the Three-I League as an affiliate of the [[Chicago White Sox]] (1957-1958). The 1958 DavSox advanced to the Three-I Championship series, where they were defeated by the [[Cedar Rapids Braves]] 3  games to 2. The 1958 season would be the last for Davenport in the Three-I League.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=6003a38a |title=1959 Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Three-I_League|title=Three-I League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Davenport_DavSox|title=Davenport DavSox - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

===Midwest League:1960–present===
Despite finishing third in the league in attendance (61,522), the DavSox moved to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] after the 1958 season to become the [[Lincoln Chiefs]] (who drew 44,783 in the 1959 Three-I League) . This left Davenport without a team for the 1959 season. As a result, local businessman Hugo \"Hooks\" Kohn started a drive to bring a new team to Davenport. Hooks Kohn was a local baseball enthusiast and a leading pioneer/player of \"Diamond Ball\", a Davenport game that evolved into today's [[softball]]. With Kohn heading the '''Quad City Baseball Fans Association''', a team was secured for the 1960 season as a [[Milwaukee Braves]] affiliate, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Travis Jackson]] to serve as the 1960 Manager. The Quad City Baseball Fans Association would oversee operation of the Davenport franchise from 1960 through 1986.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/news/a-field-of-history/article_1f510730-2029-5b92-b576-1befeb2c0e36.html|title=A field of history|first=John Willard / QUAD-CITY|last=TIMES|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref><ref>http://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/article_776f9300-55a4-11df-99bc-001cc4c03286.html Q-C reaches 50 years in the Midwest League]</ref><ref name=\"auto2\"/>

The 1960 [[Davenport Braves]] became a member of the fledgling [[Midwest League]], a partnership that has continued without interruption in seven decades. The 1960 Davenport Braves joined the [[Waterloo Hawks]], [[Keokuk Cardinals]], [[Dubuque Packers]], [[Clinton C-Sox]], [[Kokomo Dodgers]], [[Quincy Giants]] and [[Decatur Commodores]] to form the 8-team 1960 Midwest League. The creation of the [[Midwest League]] essentially ended the Three-I, which folded after the 1961 season. In its long history, the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League hosted teams in 31 cities.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=373abb77 1960 Midwest League Statistics] Baseball-Reference.com</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/era-comes-to-close-for-q-c-minor-league-baseball/article_6bb44a98-44f1-11de-b57e-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Era comes to close for Q-C minor league baseball|first=Steve|last=Batterson|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref>

In 1961, the franchise permanently dropped \"Davenport\" and became the \"Quad City\" Braves. In 1962, The Quad City Angels became an affiliate of the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]]. The affiliate change was occurred because Cedar Rapids, also a Braves affiliate, was one of six former Three-I teams that joined the Midwest League in 1962 when the Three-I folded. Thus began a lengthy frnchise affiliation with the Angels. The Quad City Angels of 1963 and 1964 were managed by [[Chuck Tanner]] and the 1964 Angels became the first Midwest League franchise to draw more than 100,000 fans in a season. The Quad City Angels won the 1968 and 1971 Midwest League titles.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTFA9XC7D4UC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=quad+city+baseball+fans+association&source=bl&ots=HQ4x2AbKWG&sig=5cxzXezcfICO2JU6D5Hxdn1-w2E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GHnYUIC0KcH0qAHslYDoAg&ved=0CHEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=quad+city+baseball+fans+association&f=false|title=Baseball at Davenport's John O'Donnell Stadium|first=Tim|last=Rask|date=March 10, 2004|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|via=Google Books}}</ref> <ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=a292d12e 1971 Quad Cities Angels Statistics – Minor Leagues] Baseball-Reference.com</ref>

The Angels affiliation ran from 1962 through the 1992 season, minus the six-year affiliation with the [[Chicago Cubs]] (1979–84), with the [[Quad Cities Cubs]] winning the 1979 Midwest League Championship. Quad Cities was an affiliate of the [[Houston Astros]] (1993-1998), [[Minnesota Twins]] (1999-2004), [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (2005-2012) and Houston (2013–present).<ref>{{cite web|first=Joel|last=Dinda|title=Davenport, Iowa, in the Midwest League|url=http://www.mwlguide.com/cities/davenport/index.html|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref>

===Franchise monikers===
The Davenport franchise used \"Davenport\" before changing to \"Quad City\" in 1962, as other local minor league franchises had folded. The franchise generally used the nickname of its major-league affiliate from 1946 through the 1991 season. This changed in 1992, when the team created its own nickname in a \"name the team' contest. The contest winning name was: \"Quad City River Bandits\" and from 1992 through the 2003 the team kept this name. On October 20, 2003, the team was renamed the \"Swing of the Quad Cities\"; after another \"name the team\" contest was held. However, On December 13, 2007, returned to the \"Quad Cities River Bandits\" after voters in a third contest chose the River Bandits name over \"The Swing\" and four other finalists: \"Channel Cats\", \"The Current\",  \"River Eagles\", and \"Talons.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Quad Cities River Bandits (press release)|title=The Fans Have Spoken: 'River Bandits' Returns to the Quad Cities|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4317/|date=2007-12-13}}</ref>

The renaming of the Bandits has proven to be one of sports’ most successful rebranding campaigns – merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.

===History of franchise ownership===
After success in securing a Midwest League Franchise for Davenport beginning with the 1960 season, the non-profit Quad City Baseball Fans Association continued to operate the franchise from 1960 to 1986. In 1986 [[Chicago]] businessman [[Harry H. Semrow]] purchased the team from the association for $350,000, but Semrow was forced to sell after the 1987 season due to poor health. 

Richard Holtzman, another Chicago businessman who owned as many as five minor league teams, purchased the franchise from Semrow and remained as owner from 1987 until 1998. In 1998, Holtzman sold the team to Seventh Inning Stretch, a company owned by Kevin Krause, a businessman out of [[Mason City, Iowa]], and son of [[Kum & Go]] co-founder William Krause.

On December 28, 2006, Krause agreed to sell the team to [[Florida]]-based Main Street Baseball for an undisclosed price; the sale was completed on November 29, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Batterson|title=Florida Group Buys Swing of Q-C|url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2006/12/29/news/local/doc4594b96650622371753668.txt|work=[[Quad-City Times]]|date=2006-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Swing of the Quad Cities (press release)|title=It's official: Main Street Iowa completes purchase of Swing|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4313/|date=2007-11-29}}</ref>

Under Main Street Baseball's ownership, led by Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt, the River Bandits sparked a stunning resurgence of baseball in the Quad Cities, winning league championships in 2011 and 2013, setting new attendance records and capturing numerous awards for their innovative promotions.<ref name=\"milb.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20071220&content_id=41529816&sid=t565&vkey=team4|title=Dave Heller's Bio &#124; Quad Cities River Bandits About<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

Since Heller and Herrfeldt took over the Bandits, sponsorship sales, suite sales, ticket sales, and concession sales have all seen annual increases. The team's average attendance in its first year under Main Street rose by more than 56%, the largest such increase in baseball, and has climbed to nearly 3,700 fans per game. The Bandits have also led one of sports' most successful rebranding campaigns – merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009!), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.

Main Street Baseball has also been a trail-blazer, having hired the Midwest League's only female general manager (Stefanie Brown) then hiring the only African-American GM in minor league baseball. The River Bandits have also consistently had more women in leadership positions than most any team in baseball, and are the only minor league club to have won back-to-back Diversity Economic Impact Engagement (DEIE) Scholarships from major league baseball since MLB started awarding them in 2012.

The River Bandits have been voted Best Family Entertainment by the Quad-City Times for each of the past five years and were recently voted by the River Cities Reader as \"The Best Place for An Inexpensive Date that Doesn't Look Like It.\" The team won the prestigious \"Golden Bobblehead\" award in 2013 for best charitable promotion in Minor League Baseball for its innovative \"Photo Jersey Auction\" to benefit Autism Awareness. It also won a \"Veeckie Award\" from ESPN in 2009 for best minor league promotion (\"Tattoo Night\") and the \"Promotion of the Year\" Award from Ballpark Digest the same year for the team's \"Mega-Candy Drop\", as well as a Gold Award from the U.S. Army for its community service. The team has also won repeated awards for Heller's creative TV and radio ads, which have repeatedly been recognized as among the best in the industry.<ref name=\"milb.com\"/>

==The ballparks==
Early Davenport teams played Sunday games on Sullivan Island outside of town, presumably to avoid Sunday activity laws.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/venues/v-675|title=Fairgrounds Park in Davenport, IA history and teams on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref>

The Davenport teams of 1901–1916, ending with the Davenport Blue Sox, played at '''Davenport Base Ball Park'''. It was also called \"Blue Sox Stadium\". The ballpark was located at Bowditch & Second Streets, or Third Street & Telegraph Road in Davenport, Iowa.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/venues/v-676|title=Davenport Base Ball Park in Davenport, IA history and teams on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Blue_Sox_Stadium|title=Blue Sox Stadium - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

The Davenport Blue Sox of 1929 and 1930 played at '''Fairgrounds Park''', located within the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds in Davenport, Iowa. the ballpark was also known as \"Blue Sox Ball Park.\" The ballpark had a capacity of 5,500 (1929). Located at West Locust & North Clark Street, with an address of with an address of 2815 West Locust Street Davenport, Iowa. The Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds are still in use today.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mvfair.com/|title=Home &#124; Mississippi Valley Fair|website=mvfair.com}}</ref>

Playing at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds, the city of Davenport realized a stadium was needed. The city preferred a [[Mississippi River]] riverfront location near downtown and a lighted stadium. Subsequently, the Davenport Levee Commission proposed a new, lighted, brick stadium along the Davenport riverfront.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>

On May 26, 1931, the new Municipal Stadium opened. It is still the franchise ballpark today. With a site on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]], the new stadium was constructed entirely with local labor for a total construction cost $165,000. It had light towers (first night game was June 4, 1931) with the grandstand facing the Mississippi River. Municipal Stadium was fondly nicknamed \"The Muny.\" In 1971, Municipal Stadium was renamed '''John O'Donnell Stadium''' after the longtime sports editor of the ''[[Quad-City Times]]''. Over time, the ballpark has shown its unique view, versatility and staying power, continuing to host baseball today as [[Modern Woodmen Park]].<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mwlguide.com/cities/davenport/park.html |title=Davenport's Modern Woodmen Park |publisher=MWLguide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.delcotimes.com/news/hallowed-grounds-top-classic-minor-league-ballparks/article_d088d232-1d57-5f3f-8ef9-d7c98e1712d3.html|title=Hallowed grounds: Top 10 classic minor league ballparks|first=The|last=Highwayman|website=The Delaware County Daily Times}}</ref>

Many baseball events have been held at the Stadium through the years. Some of historical note:
* Hosting eight [[Midwest League]] All-Star Games in six different decades: 1964, 1968, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1990, 2006 and 2011
* The [[Davenport Blue Sox]] had several exhibitions against [[Negro League]] teams in the 1930s.
* The Major League [[St. Louis Browns]] played the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a 1942 exhibition game.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/>

===Modern Woodman Park renovations===
Sitting on the banks of the river, the stadium has survived many floods, including major [[Mississippi River floods]] of 1965, 1969, 1993 and 2001, all of which breached the facility. Pictures of the flooded stadium are plentiful in the news media. The [[Great Flood of 1993]] was especially damaging to the facility.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/floods-are-big-part-of-ballpark-s-legacy/article_97e8b50f-2990-5a31-be66-5d1190ec0f3c.html|title=Floods are big part of ballpark's legacy|first=Don|last=Doxsie|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref>

Designed to combat the recurring and costly toll of flooding, a project was undertaken in 2004 to modernize and protect the facility in a joint effort of The River Bandits and the City of Davenport. The result was a massive redesign of the field and grounds at [[Modern Woodmen Park]]. The entire structure and field of the original 1931 stadium were redone. Only the exterior façade of the old stadium remained, with concessions, concourses, level loge boxes, and seating areas being reconstructed. The improvements essentially created a new ballpark within the shell of the old park. The resulting 2004 renovations included a raised playing field; a slight shift of the playing field to better face the river; removal of the drive behind the outfield fence; the addition of a berm in the outfield and the addition of exterior brick/metal columns, put in place for decoration and also to hold portable flood walls to be inserted outside the stadium. The new protections secured and protected the facility during other major [[Mississippi River floods]] in 2008, 2011 and 2013. Before the 2004 renovations, flooding created financial and logistical problems, as the team was regularly forced to move \"home\" games to local facilities or other MWL venues such as [[Clinton, Iowa]], [[North Scott High School]], Brady Street Stadium or [[Black Hawk College]].<ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>

The ballpark has incorporated modern and creative features. Including a corn field beside left-field, from which the players are introduced.<ref name=\"charliesballparks1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.charliesballparks.com/st/IA-Davenport-ODonnell.htm |title=Jewel of the Quad Cities |accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> The team unveiled a $347,000 HD video board shortly before the Bandits hosted the 2011 Midwest League All-Star Game.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/article_8f5768ce-50c3-11e0-aa6f-001cc4c03286.html |title=Bandits adding HD video board at ballpark |date=17 March 2011 |first= Steve |last=Batterson |publisher=Quad City Times}}</ref> The renamed and remodeled Modern Woodmen Park was selected the Midwest League's best ballpark by ''Baseball America'' and earned a five-star rating from BallparkDigest.com.<ref name=\"mainstreetcommunications.com\"/>

In 2007, stadium renaming rights went to Rock Island-based-[[Modern Woodmen of America]] for a reported $4.5 million.<ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"mainstreetcommunications.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainstreetcommunications.com/baseball/|title=Main Street Communications » Baseball|website=www.mainstreetcommunications.com}}</ref>

Since then, [[Modern Woodmen Park]] has earned more accolades than any minor league ballpark in the country. It was voted \"the best minor league ballpark in America\" by the readers of USA Today and 10Best.com and the Midwest League's best ballpark by ''Baseball America''. It also earned a 5-star rating from BallparkDigest.com, was named one of the two most beautiful ballparks in minor league baseball by USA Today, one of the top 10 in the nation by Parade Magazine, and was selected \"the #2 Coolest Minor League Ballpark in America\" by Complex Magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20091008&content_id=7396404&sid=t565&vkey=team4|title=Awards & Honors &#124; Quad Cities River Bandits About<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

Under Main Street Baseball's leadership, the River Bandits have added many fun new features to the ballpark, including a new outfield bar, a new picnic area, five concourse-level \"loge boxes\", an {{convert|80|ft|adj=on}} long [[wikt:high definition|HD]] ribbon-board, a huge new 20' x 36' tall HD videoboard, a new playground, birthday room, additional office and storage space, a new concessions stand and more than a dozen new portable food carts, a Hall of Fame autographed jersey display, an unmatched collection of bobbleheads from across the country and a sponsored corn field from which the players are introduced at the game's outset.<ref name=\"milb.com\"/>

In 2011, the Bandits unveiled their new Budweiser Champions Club, a 2500 s.f. glass-enclosed multi-purpose banquet hall with glass garage doors that open and close depending on the weather. That room has helped increase wedding business by more than 500%, and is regularly sold out during the Christmas season. It was voted by BallparkDigest.com as \"the best ballpark renovation under $1 million.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballparkdigest.com/201311186812/awards/news/2013-ballpark-renovations-under-1m-centennial-field-modern-woodmen-park|title=2013 Ballpark Renovations Under $1M: Centennial Field, Modern Woodmen Park|first=Kevin|last=Reichard|date=November 18, 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, added a {{convert|110|ft|adj=on}} tall Ferris Wheel to the landscape of the stadium, with the Ferris Wheel located behind the left-field wall. Also, a {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} tall Drop-N-Twist, an old-fashioned carousel, three bounce houses, and several other amusement rides have been added since then. Also added in 2014 were three new themed areas, including a 1,500 s.f. deck featuring a firepit to keep fans warm during April and May, 51 new [[Swivel seat|swivel-chair seats]] adjacent to the field, and 18 new extra-wide seats adjacent to the visitor's dugout, as well as four new padded seats set aside for veterans and active-duty military.

In 2015, the franchise continued to improve the ballpark with a 10,000 s.f. expansion of the third-base concourse.<ref name=\"milb.com\"/>

The '''Quad Cities River Bandits''' are a [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[minor league baseball]] team, affiliated with the [[Houston Astros]], that plays in the [[Midwest League]]. Its home games are played at [[Modern Woodmen Park]] (formerly John O'Donnell Stadium) in [[Davenport, Iowa]], one of the [[Quad Cities]].

==History==
Beginning in 1879, Quad City area professional baseball has a history that includes three teams.  Davenport, Moline ([[Moline Plowboys]]) and Rock Island ([[Rock Island Islanders]]) all have hosted [[minor league baseball]] teams. A fourth area team played in nearby [[Kewanee, Illinois]]. The 1879 Davenport Brown Stockings, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Bid McPhee]],  finished 5-15 in the Northwestern League. The Brown Stockings played with the Dubuque Red Stockings, Omaha Green Stockings and Rockford White Stockings, before the Northwestern League folded after one season. The Davenport Onion Weeders (1888), Davenport Hawkeyes (1889) and Davenport Pilgrims (1891) played before the turn of the 20th century in the [[Western Association]] (1888), [[Central Interstate League]] (1889) and the [[Illinois-Iowa League]] (1891).<ref name=\"baseball-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/ |title=Minor League Baseball History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/league.cgi?id=9db35b65|title=1879 Northwestern League|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/l-NWES1/y-1879|title=1879 Northwestern League (NL) on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Northwestern_League|title=Northwestern League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Western_Association|title=Western Association - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

In 1901, the [[Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League]] or \"Three-I League\" was founded, with the Davenport River Rats and Rock Island Islanders as charter members. This Davenport team set the foundation of the franchise that exists today. Other charter members of the 1901 Three-I League were the [[Bloomington Blues]], [[Cedar Rapids Rabbits]], [[Decatur Commodores]], [[Evansville River Rats]], Rockford Red Sox and [[Terre Haute Hottentots]]. The Davenport franchise changed monikers frequently in the early years, playing as the Davenport River Rats (1901–04), Davenport Riversides (1905), Davenport  Knickerbockers (1906), Davenport  Prodigals (1909–12) and [[Davenport Blue Sox]] (1913–1916). The Davenport Blue Sox won the 1914 Three-I League Championship.
<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" />

The third Quad City area team was added In July, 1914. The [[Danville Speakers]] of the Three-I League relocated to Moline and the [[Moline Plowboys]] were established. The Moline Plowboys won Three-I League Championships in 1915, 1921 and 1937. A fourth area team, the nearby [[Kewanee Boilermakers]], were members of the Class C [[Central Association]] (1908-1913 and 1948-1949). Kewanee won the 1949 Central Association Championship as the Kewanee A's, affiliates of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1948-1949) after Moline relocated to Kewanee in mid-season 1948. The Moline Plowboys/Moline A's were affiliates of the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1922), [[St Louis Browns]] (1931–32), [[Chicago Cubs]] (1937–40) and the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1947–48). The Rock Island Islanders were affiliates of the [[St. Louis Browns]] (1932) and [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1933).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kewanee,_IL|title=Kewanee, IL - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Moline,_IL|title=Moline, IL - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Rock_Island_Islanders|title=Rock Island Islanders - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

After folding in 1916, the Davenport Blue Sox resumed play in 1929. On May 26, 1931, the Davenport Blue Sox moved into newly built Municipal Stadium, nicknamed the \"Muny.\" The Davenport Blue Sox played in the [[Mississippi Valley League]] (1929–1933) and [[Western League (1900–1958)|Western League]] (1934–1937). The Blue Sox were an affiliate of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (1936-1937).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Davenport_Blue_Sox|title=Davenport Blue Sox - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

The Rock Island Islanders and Davenport Blue Sox faced each other in the Mississippi Valley League Championship series in both 1932 and 1933. Rock Island won the 1932 Championship in six games. Davenport defeated the Islanders to win the 1933 Championship in the final season of the Mississippi Valley League. The 1933 Blue Sox were led by Ed Hall's 151 RBI and [[Como Cotelle]]'s .407 average. The 1936 Blue Sox continued the strong decade, winning the 1936 [[Western League (1900–1958)|Western League]] Championship.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=fitzpa002joh John Fitzpatrick Minor League Statistics & History] Baseball-Reference.com</ref>

The 1933 Davenport Blue Sox were ranked in the [[The National Baseball Association's top 100 minor league teams]] (#58). Davenport finished 83-32 before defeating Rock Island in the 1933 Mississippi Valley League Championship series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=58|title=Top 100 Teams &#124; MiLB.com History &#124; The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}</ref>

The Davenport Blue Sox and Rock Island Islanders were both members of the [[Western League (1900–1958)|Western League]] in 1937. The Rock Island Islanders franchise folded on July 7 1937. The Western League itself then folded after the season, leaving Davenport without a team until 1946. The Rock Island Islanders franchise never played again. The Moline A's (1947-1948) moved to become the [[Kewanee A's]] (1948-1949), who folded permanently along with the Central Association in 1949. Moline played home games at [[Browning Field]] and Rock Island at [[Douglas Park (Rock Island)|Douglas Park]]. Both Browning Field and Douglas Park are in use today.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Western_League|title=Western League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kewanee_A%27s|title=Kewanee A's - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

After a nine-season baseball hiatus during [[World War II]], baseball returned to Davenport in 1946. The Davenport Cubs (1946-1947) rejoined the Class B [[Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League]] (Three-I League) as an affiliate of the [[Chicago Cubs]]. Led by future MLB players [[Roy Smalley, Jr.|Roy Smalley]] and [[Rube Walker]], the 1946 Davenport Cubs won the regular season pennant.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\">Rask, Tim; Baseball at John O'Donnell Stadium (2004) Arcadia Publishing; {{ISBN|0-7385-3247-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=b26d1c3a |title=1946 Davenport Cubs Statistics – Minor Leagues |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref> 

The Davenport Pirates (1948-1949) were an affiliate of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].  [[Bob Purkey]], [[Frank Thomas (outfielder)|Frank Thomas]] and future [[Cy Young Award]] Winner [[Vern Law]] were on the 1949 Pirates. The Pirates swept Evansville, 3-0, to win the 1949 Three-I League Championship. In 1949 Davenport drew 133,505 fans, a franchise record that would stand until 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/about/page.jsp?ymd=20090224&content_id=514556&vkey=about_t565&fext=.js |title=pre-1960s &#124; MiLB.com About &#124; The Official Site of Minor League Baseball |publisher=Milb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref>

Remaining in the Three-I League, the 1950 Davenport Quads operated as an Independent team. The Davenport Tigers (1951-1952) were an affiliate of the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1951-1952). [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Jim Bunning]] pitched for the 1951 Davenport Tigers and [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] announcer [[Milo Hamilton]] was the Tigers' announcer on radio. [[Harvey Kuenn]] played for the 1952 tigers, hitting .340. Kuehn was called up to the Detroit Tigers after the 1952 Davenport season ended. Kuenn won the 1953 [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=2ca0259a |title=1952 Davenport Tigers Statistics – Minor Leagues |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/broadcaster-milo-hamilton-dies/c-150122950|title=Hall of Fame broadcaster Milo Hamilton dies|website=MLB.com}}</ref>

After the 1952 season, Davenport folded. They were replaced by the [[Peoria Chiefs]] in the 1953 Three-I League. Davenport remained without a team for four seasons. The 1957 Davenport DavSox (1957-1958) rejoined the Three-I League as an affiliate of the [[Chicago White Sox]] (1957-1958). The 1958 DavSox advanced to the Three-I Championship series, where they were defeated by the [[Cedar Rapids Braves]] 3  games to 2. The 1958 season would be the last for Davenport in the Three-I League.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=6003a38a |title=1959 Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Three-I_League|title=Three-I League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Davenport_DavSox|title=Davenport DavSox - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

===Midwest League:1960–present===
Despite finishing third in the league in attendance (61,522), the DavSox moved to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] after the 1958 season to become the [[Lincoln Chiefs]] (who drew 44,783 in the 1959 Three-I League) . This left Davenport without a team for the 1959 season. As a result, local businessman Hugo \"Hooks\" Kohn started a drive to bring a new team to Davenport. Hooks Kohn was a local baseball enthusiast and a leading pioneer/player of \"Diamond Ball\", a Davenport game that evolved into today's [[softball]]. With Kohn heading the '''Quad City Baseball Fans Association''', a team was secured for the 1960 season as a [[Milwaukee Braves]] affiliate, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Travis Jackson]] to serve as the 1960 Manager. The Quad City Baseball Fans Association would oversee operation of the Davenport franchise from 1960 through 1986.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/news/a-field-of-history/article_1f510730-2029-5b92-b576-1befeb2c0e36.html|title=A field of history|first=John Willard / QUAD-CITY|last=TIMES|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref><ref>http://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/article_776f9300-55a4-11df-99bc-001cc4c03286.html Q-C reaches 50 years in the Midwest League]</ref><ref name=\"auto2\"/>

The 1960 [[Davenport Braves]] became a member of the fledgling [[Midwest League]], a partnership that has continued without interruption in seven decades. The 1960 Davenport Braves joined the [[Waterloo Hawks]], [[Keokuk Cardinals]], [[Dubuque Packers]], [[Clinton C-Sox]], [[Kokomo Dodgers]], [[Quincy Giants]] and [[Decatur Commodores]] to form the 8-team 1960 Midwest League. The creation of the [[Midwest League]] essentially ended the Three-I, which folded after the 1961 season. In its long history, the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League hosted teams in 31 cities.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=373abb77 1960 Midwest League Statistics] Baseball-Reference.com</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/era-comes-to-close-for-q-c-minor-league-baseball/article_6bb44a98-44f1-11de-b57e-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Era comes to close for Q-C minor league baseball|first=Steve|last=Batterson|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref>

In 1961, the franchise permanently dropped \"Davenport\" and became the \"Quad City\" Braves. In 1962, The Quad City Angels became an affiliate of the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]]. The affiliate change was occurred because Cedar Rapids, also a Braves affiliate, was one of six former Three-I teams that joined the Midwest League in 1962 when the Three-I folded. Thus began a lengthy frnchise affiliation with the Angels. The Quad City Angels of 1963 and 1964 were managed by [[Chuck Tanner]] and the 1964 Angels became the first Midwest League franchise to draw more than 100,000 fans in a season. The Quad City Angels won the 1968 and 1971 Midwest League titles.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTFA9XC7D4UC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=quad+city+baseball+fans+association&source=bl&ots=HQ4x2AbKWG&sig=5cxzXezcfICO2JU6D5Hxdn1-w2E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GHnYUIC0KcH0qAHslYDoAg&ved=0CHEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=quad+city+baseball+fans+association&f=false|title=Baseball at Davenport's John O'Donnell Stadium|first=Tim|last=Rask|date=March 10, 2004|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|via=Google Books}}</ref> <ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=a292d12e 1971 Quad Cities Angels Statistics – Minor Leagues] Baseball-Reference.com</ref>

The Angels affiliation ran from 1962 through the 1992 season, minus the six-year affiliation with the [[Chicago Cubs]] (1979–84), with the [[Quad Cities Cubs]] winning the 1979 Midwest League Championship. Quad Cities was an affiliate of the [[Houston Astros]] (1993-1998), [[Minnesota Twins]] (1999-2004), [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (2005-2012) and Houston (2013–present).<ref>{{cite web|first=Joel|last=Dinda|title=Davenport, Iowa, in the Midwest League|url=http://www.mwlguide.com/cities/davenport/index.html|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref>

===Franchise monikers===
The Davenport franchise used \"Davenport\" before changing to \"Quad City\" in 1962, as other local minor league franchises had folded. The franchise generally used the nickname of its major-league affiliate from 1946 through the 1991 season. This changed in 1992, when the team created its own nickname in a \"name the team' contest. The contest winning name was: \"Quad City River Bandits\" and from 1992 through the 2003 the team kept this name. On October 20, 2003, the team was renamed the \"Swing of the Quad Cities\"; after another \"name the team\" contest was held. However, On December 13, 2007, returned to the \"Quad Cities River Bandits\" after voters in a third contest chose the River Bandits name over \"The Swing\" and four other finalists: \"Channel Cats\", \"The Current\",  \"River Eagles\", and \"Talons.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Quad Cities River Bandits (press release)|title=The Fans Have Spoken: 'River Bandits' Returns to the Quad Cities|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4317/|date=2007-12-13}}</ref>

The renaming of the Bandits has proven to be one of sports’ most successful rebranding campaigns – merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.

===History of franchise ownership===
After success in securing a Midwest League Franchise for Davenport beginning with the 1960 season, the non-profit Quad City Baseball Fans Association continued to operate the franchise from 1960 to 1986. In 1986 [[Chicago]] businessman [[Harry H. Semrow]] purchased the team from the association for $350,000, but Semrow was forced to sell after the 1987 season due to poor health. 

Richard Holtzman, another Chicago businessman who owned as many as five minor league teams, purchased the franchise from Semrow and remained as owner from 1987 until 1998. In 1998, Holtzman sold the team to Seventh Inning Stretch, a company owned by Kevin Krause, a businessman out of [[Mason City, Iowa]], and son of [[Kum & Go]] co-founder William Krause.

On December 28, 2006, Krause agreed to sell the team to [[Florida]]-based Main Street Baseball for an undisclosed price; the sale was completed on November 29, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Batterson|title=Florida Group Buys Swing of Q-C|url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2006/12/29/news/local/doc4594b96650622371753668.txt|work=[[Quad-City Times]]|date=2006-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Swing of the Quad Cities (press release)|title=It's official: Main Street Iowa completes purchase of Swing|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4313/|date=2007-11-29}}</ref>

Under Main Street Baseball's ownership, led by Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt, the River Bandits sparked a stunning resurgence of baseball in the Quad Cities, winning league championships in 2011 and 2013, setting new attendance records and capturing numerous awards for their innovative promotions.<ref name=\"milb.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20071220&content_id=41529816&sid=t565&vkey=team4|title=Dave Heller's Bio &#124; Quad Cities River Bandits About<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

Since Heller and Herrfeldt took over the Bandits, sponsorship sales, suite sales, ticket sales, and concession sales have all seen annual increases. The team's average attendance in its first year under Main Street rose by more than 56%, the largest such increase in baseball, and has climbed to nearly 3,700 fans per game. The Bandits have also led one of sports' most successful rebranding campaigns – merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009!), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.

Main Street Baseball has also been a trail-blazer, having hired the Midwest League's only female general manager (Stefanie Brown) then hiring the only African-American GM in minor league baseball. The River Bandits have also consistently had more women in leadership positions than most any team in baseball, and are the only minor league club to have won back-to-back Diversity Economic Impact Engagement (DEIE) Scholarships from major league baseball since MLB started awarding them in 2012.

The River Bandits have been voted Best Family Entertainment by the Quad-City Times for each of the past five years and were recently voted by the River Cities Reader as \"The Best Place for An Inexpensive Date that Doesn't Look Like It.\" The team won the prestigious \"Golden Bobblehead\" award in 2013 for best charitable promotion in Minor League Baseball for its innovative \"Photo Jersey Auction\" to benefit Autism Awareness. It also won a \"Veeckie Award\" from ESPN in 2009 for best minor league promotion (\"Tattoo Night\") and the \"Promotion of the Year\" Award from Ballpark Digest the same year for the team's \"Mega-Candy Drop\", as well as a Gold Award from the U.S. Army for its community service. The team has also won repeated awards for Heller's creative TV and radio ads, which have repeatedly been recognized as among the best in the industry.<ref name=\"milb.com\"/>

==The ballparks==
Early Davenport teams played Sunday games on Sullivan Island outside of town, presumably to avoid Sunday activity laws.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/venues/v-675|title=Fairgrounds Park in Davenport, IA history and teams on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref>

The Davenport teams of 1901–1916, ending with the Davenport Blue Sox, played at '''Davenport Base Ball Park'''. It was also called \"Blue Sox Stadium\". The ballpark was located at Bowditch & Second Streets, or Third Street & Telegraph Road in Davenport, Iowa.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/venues/v-676|title=Davenport Base Ball Park in Davenport, IA history and teams on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Blue_Sox_Stadium|title=Blue Sox Stadium - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>

The Davenport Blue Sox of 1929 and 1930 played at '''Fairgrounds Park''', located within the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds in Davenport, Iowa. the ballpark was also known as \"Blue Sox Ball Park.\" The ballpark had a capacity of 5,500 (1929). Located at West Locust & North Clark Street, with an address of with an address of 2815 West Locust Street Davenport, Iowa. The Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds are still in use today.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mvfair.com/|title=Home &#124; Mississippi Valley Fair|website=mvfair.com}}</ref>

Playing at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds, the city of Davenport realized a stadium was needed. The city preferred a [[Mississippi River]] riverfront location near downtown and a lighted stadium. Subsequently, the Davenport Levee Commission proposed a new, lighted, brick stadium along the Davenport riverfront.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>

On May 26, 1931, the new Municipal Stadium opened. It is still the franchise ballpark today. With a site on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]], the new stadium was constructed entirely with local labor for a total construction cost $165,000. It had light towers (first night game was June 4, 1931) with the grandstand facing the Mississippi River. Municipal Stadium was fondly nicknamed \"The Muny.\" In 1971, Municipal Stadium was renamed '''John O'Donnell Stadium''' after the longtime sports editor of the ''[[Quad-City Times]]''. Over time, the ballpark has shown its unique view, versatility and staying power, continuing to host baseball today as [[Modern Woodmen Park]].<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mwlguide.com/cities/davenport/park.html |title=Davenport's Modern Woodmen Park |publisher=MWLguide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.delcotimes.com/news/hallowed-grounds-top-classic-minor-league-ballparks/article_d088d232-1d57-5f3f-8ef9-d7c98e1712d3.html|title=Hallowed grounds: Top 10 classic minor league ballparks|first=The|last=Highwayman|website=The Delaware County Daily Times}}</ref>

Many baseball events have been held at the Stadium through the years. Some of historical note:
* Hosting eight [[Midwest League]] All-Star Games in six different decades: 1964, 1968, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1990, 2006 and 2011
* The [[Davenport Blue Sox]] had several exhibitions against [[Negro League]] teams in the 1930s.
* The Major League [[St. Louis Browns]] played the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a 1942 exhibition game.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/>

===Modern Woodman Park renovations===
Sitting on the banks of the river, the stadium has survived many floods, including major [[Mississippi River floods]] of 1965, 1969, 1993 and 2001, all of which breached the facility. Pictures of the flooded stadium are plentiful in the news media. The [[Great Flood of 1993]] was especially damaging to the facility.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/floods-are-big-part-of-ballpark-s-legacy/article_97e8b50f-2990-5a31-be66-5d1190ec0f3c.html|title=Floods are big part of ballpark's legacy|first=Don|last=Doxsie|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref>

Designed to combat the recurring and costly toll of flooding, a project was undertaken in 2004 to modernize and protect the facility in a joint effort of The River Bandits and the City of Davenport. The result was a massive redesign of the field and grounds at [[Modern Woodmen Park]]. The entire structure and field of the original 1931 stadium were redone. Only the exterior façade of the old stadium remained, with concessions, concourses, level loge boxes, and seating areas being reconstructed. The improvements essentially created a new ballpark within the shell of the old park. The resulting 2004 renovations included a raised playing field; a slight shift of the playing field to better face the river; removal of the drive behind the outfield fence; the addition of a berm in the outfield and the addition of exterior brick/metal columns, put in place for decoration and also to hold portable flood walls to be inserted outside the stadium. The new protections secured and protected the facility during other major [[Mississippi River floods]] in 2008, 2011 and 2013. Before the 2004 renovations, flooding created financial and logistical problems, as the team was regularly forced to move \"home\" games to local facilities or other MWL venues such as [[Clinton, Iowa]], [[North Scott High School]], Brady Street Stadium or [[Black Hawk College]].<ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>

The ballpark has incorporated modern and creative features. Including a corn field beside left-field, from which the players are introduced.<ref name=\"charliesballparks1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.charliesballparks.com/st/IA-Davenport-ODonnell.htm |title=Jewel of the Quad Cities |accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> The team unveiled a $347,000 HD video board shortly before the Bandits hosted the 2011 Midwest League All-Star Game.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/article_8f5768ce-50c3-11e0-aa6f-001cc4c03286.html |title=Bandits adding HD video board at ballpark |date=17 March 2011 |first= Steve |last=Batterson |publisher=Quad City Times}}</ref> The renamed and remodeled Modern Woodmen Park was selected the Midwest League's best ballpark by ''Baseball America'' and earned a five-star rating from BallparkDigest.com.<ref name=\"mainstreetcommunications.com\"/>

In 2007, stadium renaming rights went to Rock Island-based-[[Modern Woodmen of America]] for a reported $4.5 million.<ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"mainstreetcommunications.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainstreetcommunications.com/baseball/|title=Main Street Communications » Baseball|website=www.mainstreetcommunications.com}}</ref>

Since then, [[Modern Woodmen Park]] has earned more accolades than any minor league ballpark in the country. It was voted \"the best minor league ballpark in America\" by the readers of USA Today and 10Best.com and the Midwest League's best ballpark by ''Baseball America''. It also earned a 5-star rating from BallparkDigest.com, was named one of the two most beautiful ballparks in minor league baseball by USA Today, one of the top 10 in the nation by Parade Magazine, and was selected \"the #2 Coolest Minor League Ballpark in America\" by Complex Magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20091008&content_id=7396404&sid=t565&vkey=team4|title=Awards & Honors &#124; Quad Cities River Bandits About<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

Under Main Street Baseball's leadership, the River Bandits have added many fun new features to the ballpark, including a new outfield bar, a new picnic area, five concourse-level \"loge boxes\", an {{convert|80|ft|adj=on}} long [[wikt:high definition|HD]] ribbon-board, a huge new 20' x 36' tall HD videoboard, a new playground, birthday room, additional office and storage space, a new concessions stand and more than a dozen new portable food carts, a Hall of Fame autographed jersey display, an unmatched collection of bobbleheads from across the country and a sponsored corn field from which the players are introduced at the game's outset.<ref name=\"milb.com\"/>

In 2011, the Bandits unveiled their new Budweiser Champions Club, a 2500 s.f. glass-enclosed multi-purpose banquet hall with glass garage doors that open and close depending on the weather. That room has helped increase wedding business by more than 500%, and is regularly sold out during the Christmas season. It was voted by BallparkDigest.com as \"the best ballpark renovation under $1 million.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballparkdigest.com/201311186812/awards/news/2013-ballpark-renovations-under-1m-centennial-field-modern-woodmen-park|title=2013 Ballpark Renovations Under $1M: Centennial Field, Modern Woodmen Park|first=Kevin|last=Reichard|date=November 18, 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, added a {{convert|110|ft|adj=on}} tall Ferris Wheel to the landscape of the stadium, with the Ferris Wheel located behind the left-field wall. Also, a {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} tall Drop-N-Twist, an old-fashioned carousel, three bounce houses, and several other amusement rides have been added since then. Also added in 2014 were three new themed areas, including a 1,500 s.f. deck featuring a firepit to keep fans warm during April and May, 51 new [[Swivel seat|swivel-chair seats]] adjacent to the field, and 18 new extra-wide seats adjacent to the visitor's dugout, as well as four new padded seats set aside for veterans and active-duty military.

In 2015, the franchise continued to improve the ballpark with a 10,000 s.f. expansion of the third-base concourse.<ref name=\"milb.com\"/>

In 1964, on a return trip to the Piapot Cree reserve in Canada for a [[powwow]], she was welcomed and (in a Cree Nation context) adopted by the youngest son of Chief [[Piapot]], Emile Piapot and his wife, Clara Starblanket Piapot, who added to Sainte-Marie's cultural value and place in native culture.<ref name=\"DirectorsCut\">''Buffy Sainte-Marie: A Multimedia Life (Director's Cut)'' DVD, distributed by Filmwest Associates of Canada and the US, [http://www.filmwest.com], 2006</ref>

In 1968, she married surfing teacher Dewain Bugbee of Hawaii; they divorced in 1971. She married Sheldon Wolfchild from Minnesota in 1975; they have a son, Dakota \"Cody\" Starblanket Wolfchild. That union also ended in divorce. She married her co-writer for \"[[Up Where We Belong]],\" [[Jack Nitzsche]],  on March 19, 1982. He died from a heart attack on August 25, 2000.  As of 2007, she lives in [[Hawaii]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/comments/29841 |title=Buffy fans Tarantino and Morrissey – Reader comments at The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>

Although not a Bahá'í herself, she became an active friend of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and has appeared at concerts, conferences and conventions of that religion. In 1992, she appeared in the musical event prelude to the [[Bahá'í World Congress]], a double concert \"Live Unity: The Sound of the World\" in 1992 with video broadcast and documentary.<ref>[http://info.bahai.org/article-1-9-2-2.html Bahá'ís and the Arts: Language of the Heart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026122949/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-9-2-2.html# |date=October 26, 2012 }} by Ann Boyles, also published in 1994–95 edition of ''The Bahá'í World'', pgs. 243–72</ref> In the video documentary of the event Sainte-Marie is seen on the ''[[Dini Petty]] Show'' explaining the Bahá'í teaching of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]].<ref>''Live Unity:The Sound of the World'' A Concert Documentary, VCR Video, distributed by Unity Arts Inc., of Canada, © Live Unity Enterprises, Inc., 1992</ref> She also appears in the 1985 video ''Mona With The Children'' by Douglas John Cameron.

==Career==
Sainte-Marie plays piano and guitar, self-taught, in her childhood and teen years. In college some of her songs, \"Ananias\", the Indian lament, \"[[Now That the Buffalo's Gone]]\" and \"Mayoo Sto Hoon\" (a cover of a [[Hindi]] Bollywood song called Mayus To Hoon Waade Se Tere from the 1960 movie Barsaat Ki Raat) were already in her repertoire.<ref name=\"moonshot\"/>

===1960s===

By 1962, in her early twenties, she was touring alone, developing her craft and performing in various concert halls, folk music festivals and [[First Nations]] reservations across the United States, Canada and abroad. She spent a considerable amount of time in the coffeehouses of downtown Toronto's old [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] district, and New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] as part of the early to mid-1960s folk scene, often alongside other emerging Canadian contemporaries, such as [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Joni Mitchell]]. (She also introduced Mitchell to Elliot Roberts, who became Joni's manager.)<ref name=\"DirectorsCut\"/>

In 1963, recovering from a throat infection, Sainte-Marie became addicted to [[codeine]] and recovering from the experience became the basis of her song \"[[Cod'ine]]\",<ref name=\"profiles\"/> later covered by [[Donovan]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Charlatans (American band)|the Charlatans]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[Man (band)|Man]],<ref>On their album ''[[Maximum Darkness]]''</ref> [[the Litter]], [[the Leaves]], [[Jimmy Gilmer]], [[Gram Parsons]],<ref>On ''Another Side of This Life: The Lost Recordings of Gram Parsons 1965–1966''</ref> Charles Brutus McClay,<ref>Charles Brutus McClay – \"Bottled in France\", released 1970 by CBS France, cat.nr.64478</ref> [[the Barracudas]] (spelled \"Codeine\"),<ref>The Barracudas – \"Drop Out with The Barracudas\", released 1981 by Zonophone, cat.nr.ZONO103</ref> [[The Golden Horde (band)|the Golden Horde]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/the-golden-horde/codeine-live-london-1991|title=Codeine (live, London, 1991) by The Golden Horde on SoundCloud|publisher=Soundcloud.com|date=March 9, 2012|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> [[Nicole Atkins]] and [[Courtney Love]].

She was subsequently named [[Billboard Magazine]]'s Best New Artist. Some of her songs such as 
\"[[It's My Way|Now That The Buffalo's Gone]]\" (1964) and
\"[[Little Wheel Spin and Spin|My Country 'Tis of Thy People You're Dying]]\" (1964, included on her 1966 album) addressing the mistreatment of Native Americans created a lot of controversy at the time.<ref name=\"encyc-great-plains\"/> In 1967, she released ''Fire and Fleet and Candlelight'', which contained her interpretation of the traditional [[Yorkshire dialect]] song \"[[Lyke Wake Dirge]]\". Sainte-Marie's other well-known songs include \"[[Mister Can't You See]]\", (a [[Top 40]] U.S. hit in 1972); \"He's an Indian Cowboy in the Rodeo\"; and the theme song of the popular movie ''[[Soldier Blue]]''. She appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s ''[[Rainbow Quest|Rainbow Quest with Pete Seeger]]'' in 1965 and several Canadian Television productions from the 1960s to the 1990s,<ref name=\"DirectorsCut\"/> and other TV shows such as ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Soul Train]]'', ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''; and sang the opening song \"The Circle Game\" (written by Joni Mitchell<ref name=\"DirectorsCut\"/>) in Stuart Hagmann's film ''[[The Strawberry Statement (film)|The Strawberry Statement]]'' (1970) ''[[Then Came Bronson]]''; episode 20 \"Mating Dance for Tender Grass\" (1970) sang and acted.

In the late 1960s, she used a [[Buchla]] synthesizer to record the album ''Illuminations'', which did not receive much notice. It was the first totally [[quadraphonic]] electronic vocal album. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== 1970s===
[[File:Buffy Sainte-Marie 1970.JPG|thumb|Sainte-Marie in 1970]]

In late 1975, Sainte-Marie received a phone call from  ''[[Sesame Street]]'' producer [[Dulcy Singer]] to appear on the show for a one-shot guest appearance. Sainte-Marie told Singer she had no interest in doing a children's TV show, but reconsidered after asking \"Have you done any Native American programming?\" According to Sainte-Marie, Singer wanted her to count and recite the alphabet but Buffy wanted to teach the show's young viewers that \"Indians still exist\".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} She regularly appeared on ''Sesame Street'' over a five-year period from 1976 to 1981. Sainte-Marie breastfed her first son, Dakota \"Cody\" Starblanket Wolfchild, during a 1977 episode, which is believed to be the first representation of breastfeeding ever aired on television.<ref>

''Sesame Street'' even aired a week of shows from her home in Hawaii in January 1978.

Sainte-Marie's closest friend from the ''Sesame Street'' cast was [[Alaina Reed Hall|Alaina Reed]], who played [[List of human Sesame Street characters|Olivia Robinson]] on the show and later joined the cast of ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''.

In 1979, ''[[Spirit of the Wind]]'', featuring Sainte-Marie's original musical score including the song \"Spirit of the Wind\", was one of three entries that year at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The film is a docudrama about [[George Attla]], the 'winningest [[dog musher]] of all time,' as the film presents him, with all parts played by Native Americans except one by [[Slim Pickens]].

Sainte-Marie voiced the Cheyenne character, Kate Bighead, in the 1991 made-for-TV movie ''[[Son of the Morning Star]]'', telling the Indian side of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], where [[George Armstrong Custer|Lt. Col. George Custer]] was killed.

In 1992, after a sixteen-year recording hiatus, Sainte-Marie released the album ''[[Coincidence and Likely Stories]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Recorded in 1990 at home in Hawaii on her computer and transmitted via modem through the Internet to producer Chris Birkett in London, England,<ref name=\"DirectorsCut\" /> the album included the politically charged songs \"The Big Ones Get Away\" and \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" (which mentions [[Leonard Peltier]]), both commenting on the ongoing plight of Native Americans (see also the book ''[[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee]]''.) Also in 1992, Sainte-Marie appeared in the television film ''The Broken Chain'' with [[Wes Studi]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]] along with First Nations Bahá'í [[Phil Lucas]]. Her next album followed up in 1996 with ''Up Where We Belong'', an album on which she re-recorded a number of her greatest hits in more unplugged and acoustic versions, including a re-release of \"[[Universal Soldier (song)|Universal Soldier]]\". Sainte-Marie has exhibited her art at the [[Glenbow Museum]] in Calgary, the [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]], the [[Emily Carr]] Gallery in [[Vancouver]] and the American Indian Arts Museum in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].

Also in 1995, the Indigo Girls released two versions of Sainte-Marie's protest song \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" on their live album [[1200 Curfews]]. The song appears toward the end of Disc One in a live format, Recorded at the Atwood Concert Hall in the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts in [[Anchorage]], Alaska. \"Every word is true,\" Emily says in the introduction. The second, found at the end of Disc Two, is a studio recording.

In 1996, she started a philanthropic non-profit fund [[Nihewan Foundation for American Indian Education]] devoted to improving Native American students participation in learning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nihewan.com |title=nihewan.com,nihewan.com |publisher=Nihewan.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>  The word \"Nihewan\" comes from the Cree language and means \"talk Cree,\" which implies \"Be Your Culture.\"

Sainte-Marie founded the [[Cradleboard Teaching Project]] in October 1996 using funds from her Nihewan Foundation and with a two-year grant from the [[W.K. Kellogg Foundation]] of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]].

==Blacklisting==
Sainte-Marie claimed in a 2008 interview at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5_3IhqNZKI|title=2008 Native Writer's Series #3 – Buffy Sainte-Marie|publisher=YouTube|date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> that she had been [[Blacklisting|blacklisted]] by American radio stations and that she, along with Native Americans and other native people in the Red Power movements, were put out of business in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paulsen|first=Sasha|title=An original rebel with a resonating voice|journal=[[Napa Valley Register]]|publisher=Lee Enterprises, Inc.|location=Napa, CA|date=September 24, 2011|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/an-original-rebel-with-a-resonating-voice/article_1d0ae17a-ea4b-11e0-8335-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>

In a 1999 interview at [[Diné College]] with a staff writer with ''[[Indian Country Today]]'', Sainte-Marie said \"I found out 10 years later, in the 1980s, that President [[Lyndon B.

In 1964, on a return trip to the Piapot Cree reserve in Canada for a [[powwow]], she was welcomed and (in a Cree Nation context) adopted by the youngest son of Chief [[Piapot]], Emile Piapot and his wife, Clara Starblanket Piapot, who added to Sainte-Marie's cultural value and place in native culture.<ref name=\"DirectorsCut\">''Buffy Sainte-Marie: A Multimedia Life (Director's Cut)'' DVD, distributed by Filmwest Associates of Canada and the US, [http://www.filmwest.com], 2006</ref>

In 1968, she married surfing teacher Dewain Bugbee of Hawaii; they divorced in 1971. She married Sheldon Wolfchild from Minnesota in 1975; they have a son, Dakota \"Cody\" Starblanket Wolfchild. That union also ended in divorce. She married her co-writer for \"[[Up Where We Belong]],\" [[Jack Nitzsche]],  on March 19, 1982. He died from a heart attack on August 25, 2000.

Although not a Bahá'í herself, she became an active friend of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and has appeared at concerts, conferences and conventions of that religion. In 1992, she appeared in the musical event prelude to the [[Bahá'í World Congress]], a double concert \"Live Unity: The Sound of the World\" in 1992 with video broadcast and documentary.<ref>[http://info.bahai.org/article-1-9-2-2.html Bahá'ís and the Arts: Language of the Heart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026122949/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-9-2-2.html# |date=October 26, 2012 }} by Ann Boyles, also published in 1994–95 edition of ''The Bahá'í World'', pgs. 243–72</ref> In the video documentary of the event Sainte-Marie is seen on the ''[[Dini Petty]] Show'' explaining the Bahá'í teaching of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]].<ref>''Live Unity:The Sound of the World'' A Concert Documentary, VCR Video, distributed by Unity Arts Inc., of Canada, © Live Unity Enterprises, Inc., 1992</ref> She also appears in the 1985 video ''Mona With The Children'' by Douglas John Cameron.

==Career==
Sainte-Marie plays piano and guitar, self-taught, in her childhood and teen years. In college some of her songs, \"Ananias\", the Indian lament, \"[[Now That the Buffalo's Gone]]\" and \"Mayoo Sto Hoon\" (a cover of a [[Hindi]] Bollywood song called Mayus To Hoon Waade Se Tere from the 1960 movie Barsaat Ki Raat) were already in her repertoire.<ref name=\"moonshot\"/>

===1960s===
[[File:Grand Gala du Disque in RAI. Canadese zangeres Buffy Sainte-Marie, Bestanddeelnr 921-1411.jpg|thumb|upright|Sainte-Marie performing in the Netherlands in the Grand Gala du Disque Populaire 1968]]
By 1962, in her early twenties, she was touring alone, developing her craft and performing in various concert halls, folk music festivals and [[First Nations]] reservations across the United States, Canada and abroad. She spent a considerable amount of time in the coffeehouses of downtown Toronto's old [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] district, and New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] as part of the early to mid-1960s folk scene, often alongside other emerging Canadian contemporaries, such as [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Joni Mitchell]]. (She also introduced Mitchell to Elliot Roberts, who became Joni's manager.)<ref name=\"DirectorsCut\"/>

In 1963, recovering from a throat infection, Sainte-Marie became addicted to [[codeine]] and recovering from the experience became the basis of her song \"[[Cod'ine]]\",<ref name=\"profiles\"/> later covered by [[Donovan]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Charlatans (American band)|the Charlatans]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[Man (band)|Man]],<ref>On their album ''[[Maximum Darkness]]''</ref> [[the Litter]], [[the Leaves]], [[Jimmy Gilmer]], [[Gram Parsons]],<ref>On ''Another Side of This Life: The Lost Recordings of Gram Parsons 1965–1966''</ref> Charles Brutus McClay,<ref>Charles Brutus McClay – \"Bottled in France\", released 1970 by CBS France, cat.nr.64478</ref> [[the Barracudas]] (spelled \"Codeine\"),<ref>The Barracudas – \"Drop Out with The Barracudas\", released 1981 by Zonophone, cat.nr.ZONO103</ref> [[The Golden Horde (band)|the Golden Horde]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/the-golden-horde/codeine-live-london-1991|title=Codeine (live, London, 1991) by The Golden Horde on SoundCloud|publisher=Soundcloud.com|date=March 9, 2012|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> [[Nicole Atkins]] and [[Courtney Love]]. Also in 1963, she witnessed wounded soldiers returning from [[Vietnam war]] at a time when the U.S. government was denying involvement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/vietnam/index-1961.html|title=Vietnam War 1961–1964|publisher=The History Place|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> – which inspired her protest song, \"[[Universal Soldier (song)|Universal Soldier]]\"<ref name=\"blues\">[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0312200579&id=9SiONFzWde0C&pg=PA528 ''Folk and Blues: The Premier Encyclopedia of American Roots Music''] by Irwin Stambler, Lyndon Stambler, pp. 528–530.</ref> which was released on her debut album, ''[[It's My Way]]'' on [[Vanguard Records]] in 1964, and later became a hit for both Donovan and [[Glen Campbell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19793/m1|title=Show 34 – Revolt of the Fat Angel: American musicians respond to the British invaders|publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu|date=April 18, 2014|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>

She was subsequently named [[Billboard Magazine]]'s Best New Artist. Some of her songs such as 
\"[[It's My Way|Now That The Buffalo's Gone]]\" (1964) and
\"[[Little Wheel Spin and Spin|My Country 'Tis of Thy People You're Dying]]\" (1964, included on her 1966 album) addressing the mistreatment of Native Americans created a lot of controversy at the time.<ref name=\"encyc-great-plains\"/> In 1967, she released ''Fire and Fleet and Candlelight'', which contained her interpretation of the traditional [[Yorkshire dialect]] song \"[[Lyke Wake Dirge]]\". Sainte-Marie's other well-known songs include \"[[Mister Can't You See]]\", (a [[Top 40]] U.S. hit in 1972); \"He's an Indian Cowboy in the Rodeo\"; and the theme song of the popular movie ''[[Soldier Blue]]''. She appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s ''[[Rainbow Quest|Rainbow Quest with Pete Seeger]]'' in 1965 and several Canadian Television productions from the 1960s to the 1990s,<ref name=\"DirectorsCut\"/> and other TV shows such as ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Soul Train]]'', ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''; and sang the opening song \"The Circle Game\" (written by Joni Mitchell<ref name=\"DirectorsCut\"/>) in Stuart Hagmann's film ''[[The Strawberry Statement (film)|The Strawberry Statement]]'' (1970) ''[[Then Came Bronson]]''; episode 20 \"Mating Dance for Tender Grass\" (1970) sang and acted.

In the late 1960s, she used a [[Buchla]] synthesizer to record the album ''Illuminations'', which did not receive much notice. It was the first totally [[quadraphonic]] electronic vocal album. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1996, she started a philanthropic non-profit fund [[Nihewan Foundation for American Indian Education]] devoted to improving Native American students participation in learning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nihewan.com |title=nihewan.com,nihewan.com |publisher=Nihewan.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>  The word \"Nihewan\" comes from the Cree language and means \"talk Cree,\" which implies \"Be Your Culture.\"

=== 1970s===
[[File:Buffy Sainte-Marie 1970.JPG|thumb|Sainte-Marie in 1970]]

In late 1975, Sainte-Marie received a phone call from  ''[[Sesame Street]]'' producer [[Dulcy Singer]] to appear on the show for a one-shot guest appearance. Sainte-Marie told Singer she had no interest in doing a children's TV show, but reconsidered after asking \"Have you done any Native American programming?\" According to Sainte-Marie, Singer wanted her to count and recite the alphabet but Buffy wanted to teach the show's young viewers that \"Indians still exist\".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} She regularly appeared on ''Sesame Street'' over a five-year period from 1976 to 1981. Sainte-Marie breastfed her first son, Dakota \"Cody\" Starblanket Wolfchild, during a 1977 episode, which is believed to be the first representation of breastfeeding ever aired on television.<ref>

''Sesame Street'' even aired a week of shows from her home in Hawaii in January 1978.

Sainte-Marie's closest friend from the ''Sesame Street'' cast was [[Alaina Reed Hall|Alaina Reed]], who played [[List of human Sesame Street characters|Olivia Robinson]] on the show and later joined the cast of ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''.

In 1979, ''[[Spirit of the Wind]]'', featuring Sainte-Marie's original musical score including the song \"Spirit of the Wind\", was one of three entries that year at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The film is a docudrama about [[George Attla]], the 'winningest [[dog musher]] of all time,' as the film presents him, with all parts played by Native Americans except one by [[Slim Pickens]]. The film was shown on cable TV in the early 1980s and was released in France in 2003.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

It received the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] in 1982.<ref name = \"OscarBSM\"/> 

In the early 1980s one of her native songs was used as the theme song for the [[CBC Television|CBC]]'s native series [[Spirit Bay (TV series)|Spirit Bay]]. She was cast for the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] 1993 telefilm ''The Broken Chain''. It was shot entirely in [[Virginia]]. In 1989 she wrote and performed the music for ''[[Where the Spirit Lives]]'', a film about native children being abducted and forced into residential schools.

===1990s===

Sainte-Marie voiced the Cheyenne character, Kate Bighead, in the 1991 made-for-TV movie ''[[Son of the Morning Star]]'', telling the Indian side of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], where [[George Armstrong Custer|Lt. Col. George Custer]] was killed.

In 1992, after a sixteen-year recording hiatus, Sainte-Marie released the album ''[[Coincidence and Likely Stories]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Recorded in 1990 at home in Hawaii on her computer and transmitted via modem through the Internet to producer Chris Birkett in London, England,<ref name=\"DirectorsCut\" /> the album included the politically charged songs \"The Big Ones Get Away\" and \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" (which mentions [[Leonard Peltier]]), both commenting on the ongoing plight of Native Americans (see also the book ''[[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee]]''.) Also in 1992, Sainte-Marie appeared in the television film ''The Broken Chain'' with [[Wes Studi]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]] along with First Nations Bahá'í [[Phil Lucas]]. Her next album followed up in 1996 with ''Up Where We Belong'', an album on which she re-recorded a number of her greatest hits in more unplugged and acoustic versions, including a re-release of \"[[Universal Soldier (song)|Universal Soldier]]\". Sainte-Marie has exhibited her art at the [[Glenbow Museum]] in Calgary, the [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]], the [[Emily Carr]] Gallery in [[Vancouver]] and the American Indian Arts Museum in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. In 1995, she provided the voice of the spirit in the magic mirror in HBO's ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', which featured a Native American retelling of the Snow White fairy tale.

Also in 1995, the Indigo Girls released two versions of Sainte-Marie's protest song \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" on their live album [[1200 Curfews]]. The song appears toward the end of Disc One in a live format, Recorded at the Atwood Concert Hall in the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts in [[Anchorage]], Alaska. \"Every word is true,\" Emily says in the introduction. The second, found at the end of Disc Two, is a studio recording.

Sainte-Marie founded the [[Cradleboard Teaching Project]] in October 1996 using funds from her Nihewan Foundation and with a two-year grant from the [[W.K. Kellogg Foundation]] of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]. With projects across [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], [[Cree]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Menominee]], [[Coeur D'Alene Tribe|Coeur D'Alene]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Quinault (tribe)|Quinault]], [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]], and [[Apache]] communities in eleven states, partnered with a non-native class of the same grade level for Elementary, [[Middle school|Middle]], and High School grades in the disciplines of Geography, History, Social Studies, Music and Science and produced a multimedia curriculum CD, ''Science: Through Native American Eyes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cradleboard.org/2000/history.html |title=Cradleboard History |publisher=Cradleboard.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>

In 2008, a two-CD set titled ''Buffy/Changing Woman/Sweet America: The Mid-1970s Recordings'' was released, compiling the three studio albums that she recorded for [[ABC Records]] and [[MCA Records]] between 1974 and 1976 (after departing her long-time label [[Vanguard Records]]). This was the first re-release of this material. In September 2008, Sainte-Marie made a comeback onto the music scene in Canada with the release of her studio album ''[[Running for the Drum]]''. It was produced by Chris Birkett (producer of her 1992 and 1996 [[best of]] albums). Sessions for this project commenced in 2006 in Sainte-Marie's home studio in Hawaii and in part in France. They continued until spring 2007. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Blacklisting==
Sainte-Marie claimed in a 2008 interview at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5_3IhqNZKI|title=2008 Native Writer's Series #3 – Buffy Sainte-Marie|publisher=YouTube|date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> that she had been [[Blacklisting|blacklisted]] by American radio stations and that she, along with Native Americans and other native people in the Red Power movements, were put out of business in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paulsen|first=Sasha|title=An original rebel with a resonating voice|journal=[[Napa Valley Register]]|publisher=Lee Enterprises, Inc.|location=Napa, CA|date=September 24, 2011|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/an-original-rebel-with-a-resonating-voice/article_1d0ae17a-ea4b-11e0-8335-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>

In a 1999 interview at [[Diné College]] with a staff writer with ''[[Indian Country Today]]'', Sainte-Marie said \"I found out 10 years later, in the 1980s, that President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been writing letters on [[White House]] stationery praising radio stations for suppressing my music\" and \"In the 1970s, not only was the protest movement put out of business, but the [[Red Power movement|Native American movement]] was attacked.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bsnorrell.blogspot.com/2008/10/canadian-aboriginal-music-awards-is.html?showComment=1224884880000|title=CENSORED NEWS: Uncensored: Buffy Sainte-Marie honored with Lifetime Achievement Award|publisher=Bsnorrell.blogspot.com|date=October 22, 2008|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>

On [[Wikipedia]], '''vandalism''' is the act of editing the project in a malicious manner that is [[WP:Disruptive editing|intentionally disruptive]]. Vandalism includes the addition, removal, or modification of the text or other material that is either humorous, nonsensical, a [[Reliability of Wikipedia|hoax]], or that is of an offensive, humiliating, or otherwise degrading nature.

Throughout its history, Wikipedia has struggled to maintain a balance between allowing the freedom of open editing and protecting the accuracy of its information when false information can be potentially damaging to its subjects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/2009/0825/wikipedia-testing-new-method-to-curb-false-info |title=Wikipedia testing new method to curb false info |publisher=CSMonitor.com |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801003740/http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/2009/0825/wikipedia-testing-new-method-to-curb-false-info |archive-date=1 August 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Vandalism is easy to commit on Wikipedia because anyone can edit the site,<ref name=newscientist/><ref name=BBC>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4502846.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wikipedia tightens online rules | date=6 December 2005 | access-date=26 November 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213031907/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4502846.stm | archive-date=13 December 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref> with the exception of [[:Category:Wikipedia semi-protected pages|articles that are currently semi-protected]], which means that new and unregistered users cannot edit them.

Vandalism can be committed by either guest editors or those with registered accounts; however, a semi-protected or protected page can only be edited by [[WP:Autoconfirmed|autoconfirmed or confirmed]] Wikipedia editors, or administrators, respectively.<ref name=BBC /> Frequent targets of vandalism include articles on hot and controversial topics, famous celebrities, and current events.<ref name=Newzealand>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&objectid=10432042|title=Wikipedia fights vandalism|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|last=Kleeman|first=Jenny|date=2 April 2007|access-date=25 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213202139/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&objectid=10432042|archive-date=13 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jun/18/wikipedia.news | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Lorna | last=Martin | title=Wikipedia fights off cyber vandals | date=18 June 2006 | access-date=18 December 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228130822/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jun/18/wikipedia.news | archive-date=28 December 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> In some cases, people have been falsely reported as having died.

There are various measures taken by Wikipedia to prevent or reduce the amount of vandalism. These include:
* Using Wikipedia's history functionality, which retains all prior versions of an article, restoring the article to the last version before the vandalism occurred; this is called ''reverting'' vandalism.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> The majority of vandalism on Wikipedia is reverted quickly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hicks|first=Jesse|title=This machine kills trolls|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|work=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=18 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827115824/http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|archive-date=27 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> There are various ways in which the vandalism gets detected so it can be reverted:
**'''Bots''': In many cases, the vandalism is automatically detected and reverted by a [[internet bot|bot]] (robot). The vandal is always warned with no human intervention.
** '''Recent changes patrol''': Wikipedia has a special page that lists all the most recent changes. Some editors will monitor these changes for possible vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA122#v=onepage|title=Wikipedia: the missing manual|last=Broughton|first=John|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=0-596-51516-2|location=|page=122|pages=}}</ref>
** '''Watchlists''': Any registered user can watch a page that they have created or edited or that they otherwise have an interest in. This functionality also enables users to monitor a page for vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />
** '''Incidental discovery''': Any reader who comes across vandalism by chance can revert it. In 2008, it was reported that the rarity of such incidental discovery indicated the efficacy of the other methods of vandalism removal.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />
* Locking articles so only established users, or in some cases, only administrators can edit them.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> ''Semi-protected'' articles are those that can only be edited by those with an account that is considered to be ''autoconfirmed'' – an account that is at least 4 days old with at least 10 edits, for most accounts. ''Fully protected articles'' are those that can only be edited by administrators. Protection is generally instituted after one or more editors makes a request on a special page for that purpose, and an administrator familiar with the protection guidelines chooses whether or not to fulfill this request based on the guidelines.
* Blocking and banning those who have repeatedly committed acts of vandalism from editing for a period of time or in some cases, indefinitely.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> Vandals are not blocked as an act of punishment&nbsp;– the purpose of the block is simply to [[preventive action|prevent]] further damage.<ref name=\"Broughton134\">{{cite book |title=Wikipedia: the missing manual |last=Broughton|first=John |year=2008 |isbn=0-596-51516-2 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA182&dq=%22edit+war%22wikipedia#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20war%22wikipedia&f=false}}</ref>
* The \"abuse filter\" extension, which uses [[regular expressions]] to detect common vandalism terms.<ref>See [[Wikipedia:Edit filter]]</ref>
Editors are generally warned prior to being blocked. Wikipedia employs a 4-stage warning process up to a block. This includes:<ref name=\"Broughton130\">{{cite book |title=Wikipedia: the missing manual |last=Broughton |first=John |year=2008 |isbn=0-596-51516-2 |pages=130–31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA182&dq=%22edit+war%22wikipedia#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20war%22wikipedia&f=false}}</ref>
#The first warning [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assumes good faith]] and takes a relaxed approach to the user. (in some cases, this level can be skipped if the editor assumes the user is acting in bad faith<ref>See {{slink|Wikipedia:WikiProject User warnings/Usage and layout|Levels}}</ref>).
#The second warning does not assume any faith and is an actual warning (in some cases, this level may also be skipped).
#The third warning assumes bad faith and is the first to warn the user that continued vandalism may result in a [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|block]].
#The fourth warning is a final warning, stating that any future acts of vandalism will result in a block.
#After this, other users may place additional warnings, though only administrators can actually carry out the block.

In 2005, the [[English Wikipedia]] started to require those who create new articles to have a registered account in an effort to fight vandalism. This occurred after inaccurate information was added to Wikipedia in which a journalist was accused of taking part in Kennedy's assassination.<ref name=\"newscientist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |title=Wikipedia tightens editorial rules after complaint&nbsp;– 06 December 2005 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015074757/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Wikipedia has experimented with systems in which edits to some articles, especially those of living people, are delayed until it can be reviewed and determined that they are not vandalism, and in some cases, that a source to verify accuracy is provided. This is in an effort to prevent inaccurate and potentially damaging information about living people from appearing on the site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/wikipedia_tests_approval_system_reduce_page_vandalism |title=Wikipedia Tests Approval System to Reduce Page Vandalism |publisher=Maximum PC |date=19 July 2008 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810050703/http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/wikipedia_tests_approval_system_reduce_page_vandalism |archive-date=10 August 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.ebrandz.com/miscellaneous/2009/2824-wikipedia-plans-to-enforce-new-editing-policy-to-thwart-vandals-.html |title=Wikipedia plans to enforce new editing policy to thwart vandals&nbsp;– eBrandz Search Marketing & Technology News |publisher=News.ebrandz.com |date=27 August 2009 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621061552/http://news.ebrandz.com/miscellaneous/2009/2824-wikipedia-plans-to-enforce-new-editing-policy-to-thwart-vandals-.html |archive-date=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== ClueBot NG ===

The most famous \"bot\" that fights vandalism is {{self-reference link|User:ClueBot NG|ClueBot NG}}. The bot was created by Wikipedia users Christopher Breneman and Cobi Carter in 2010, (succeeding the original ClueBot, NG stands for Next Generation)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|title=This machine kills trolls|date=18 February 2014|website=The Verge|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827115824/http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|archive-date=27 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> and uses [[machine learning]] and [[Bayesian statistics]] to determine if an edit is vandalism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18892510|title=Meet the 'bots' that edit Wikipedia|last=Nasaw|first=Daniel|date=25 July 2012|website=BBC News|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916120633/https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18892510|archive-date=16 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitfreak.com/technology/digital/1374-little-about-the-bot-that-runs-wikipedia,-cluebot-ng|title=Little about the bot that runs Wikipedia, ClueBot NG|last=Raja|first=Sumit|website=digitfreak.com|accessdate=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122134216/http://www.digitfreak.com/technology/digital/1374-little-about-the-bot-that-runs-wikipedia,-cluebot-ng|archive-date=22 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

While the bot has been effective in helping keep Wikipedia clean, some claim the bot is {{self-reference link|WP:BITE|hostile}} to new users by not being able to apply a human brain's knowledge to the edit, and leaving impersonal {{self-reference link|WP:TEMPLATES|templates}}.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bots-edit-wikipedia-humans-made/|title=The Bots Who Edit Wikipedia (And The Humans Who Made Them)|work=MakeUseOf|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511130558/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bots-edit-wikipedia-humans-made/|archive-date=11 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== [[:Special:AbuseFilter|Blacklisting]] ===

The MediaWiki title blacklist extension prevents page move vandalism and creation vandalism by using [[regular expressions]] to identify bad titles.  Titles on the blacklist can only be created by or moved to by administrators.  Pages that are also created repeatedly can be protected to prevent vandals from recreating bad pages.

In addition to the title blacklist, the spam blacklist prevents external link [[spamming]], a form of vandalism.  New/unregistered users who want to add external links are required to answer a [[CAPTCHA]].

The \"bad image list\" prevents images that could be used to vandalize pages from being inserted, such as images with sexual content. Images on the list can only be added to pages where the use of the image is explicitly allowed.

The entirety of the MediaWiki namespace, the main page, and high risk templates are protected to prevent high server load and sudden interface changes.

The edit filter can also prevent vandalism by disallowing the bad edit altogether.

== Notable acts of vandalism ==

=== Seigenthaler incident ===
{{main|Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident}}
[[File:John Seigenthaler Sr. speaking.jpg|thumb|alt=White-haired elderly gentleman in suit and tie speaks at a podium.|[[John Seigenthaler]], who in 2005 criticized Wikipedia]]
In May 2005, a user edited the [[biography|biographical]] article about [[John Seigenthaler, Sr.]] so that it contained several false and [[defamation|defamatory]] statements.<ref name=SeigenthalerUSAToday>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=29 November 2005|title=A false Wikipedia \"biography\"|first=John|last=Seigenthaler|authorlink=John Seigenthaler|access-date=17 September 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/64PWOeCKO?url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|archive-date=3 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The inaccurate claims went unnoticed between May and September 2005, when they were discovered by [[Victor S. Johnson, Jr.]], a friend of Seigenthaler. Wikipedia content is often mirrored at sites such as [[Answers.com]], which means that incorrect information can be replicated alongside correct information through a number of websites. Such information can develop a misleading air of authority because of its presence at such sites:<ref name=SeigenthalerABC>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s1613571.htm|title=Mistakes and hoaxes on-line|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 April 2006|accessdate=28 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608054128/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s1613571.htm|archive-date=8 June 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>
{{quote|
Then [Seigenthaler's] son discovered that his father's hoax biography also appeared on two other sites, Reference.com and Answers.com, which took direct feeds from Wikipedia. It was out there for four months before Seigenthaler realized and got the Wikipedia entry replaced with a more reliable account. The lies remained for another three weeks on the mirror sites downstream.
}}

=== Stephen Colbert ===
{{See also|Cultural impact of The Colbert Report#Wikipedia references|label 1=Wikipedia references on The Colbert Report}}
Comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] made repeated references to Wikipedia on his TV show ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', frequently suggesting on air that his viewers vandalize selected pages. These instances include the following:

* On a 2006 episode of his show, Colbert suggested viewers vandalize the article \"[[Elephant]]\". This resulted in an account named \"[[User:Stephencolbert|Stephencolbert]]\" being blocked from editing, as well as many elephant-related articles being protected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/08/01/did-colbert-hack-wikipedia-video/ |title=Did Colbert hack Wikipedia?&nbsp;– VIDEO |publisher=Tvsquad.com |accessdate=7 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119215141/http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/08/01/did-colbert-hack-wikipedia-video/ |archivedate=19 January 2011 }}</ref>
* On 7 August 2012, Colbert suggested that his viewers go to pages for possible 2012 U.S. Republican vice presidential candidates, such as the [[Tim Pawlenty]] and [[Rob Portman]] articles, and edit them many times. This was in response to a [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] hypothesis that mass editing of the [[Sarah Palin]] page the day before she was announced as [[John McCain]]'s running mate could help predict who would be chosen as [[Mitt Romney]]'s running mate in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]]. After Colbert's request and his viewers' subsequent actions, all these articles were put under {{srlink|Wikipedia:Protection policy#Semi-protection|semi-protection}} by Wikipedia administrators, with editing restricted to established users.<ref>{{cite web | title=Stephen Colbert's Wikipedia Vice Presidential Scheme Short Circuited | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/stephen-colberts-wikipedia-vice-presidential-359985 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=8 August 2012 | accessdate=8 August 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811002143/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/stephen-colberts-wikipedia-vice-presidential-359985 | archive-date=11 August 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref>

On [[Wikipedia]], '''vandalism''' is the act of editing the project in a malicious manner that is [[WP:Disruptive editing|intentionally disruptive]]. Vandalism includes the addition, removal, or modification of the text or other material that is either humorous, nonsensical, a [[Reliability of Wikipedia|hoax]], or that is of an offensive, humiliating, or otherwise degrading nature.

Throughout its history, Wikipedia has struggled to maintain a balance between allowing the freedom of open editing and protecting the accuracy of its information when false information can be potentially damaging to its subjects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/2009/0825/wikipedia-testing-new-method-to-curb-false-info |title=Wikipedia testing new method to curb false info |publisher=CSMonitor.com |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801003740/http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/2009/0825/wikipedia-testing-new-method-to-curb-false-info |archive-date=1 August 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Vandalism is easy to commit on Wikipedia because anyone can edit the site,<ref name=newscientist/><ref name=BBC>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4502846.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wikipedia tightens online rules | date=6 December 2005 | access-date=26 November 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213031907/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4502846.stm | archive-date=13 December 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref> with the exception of [[:Category:Wikipedia semi-protected pages|articles that are currently semi-protected]], which means that new and unregistered users cannot edit them.

There are various measures taken by Wikipedia to prevent or reduce the amount of vandalism. These include:
* Using Wikipedia's history functionality, which retains all prior versions of an article, restoring the article to the last version before the vandalism occurred; this is called ''reverting'' vandalism.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> The majority of vandalism on Wikipedia is reverted quickly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hicks|first=Jesse|title=This machine kills trolls|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|work=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=18 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827115824/http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|archive-date=27 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> There are various ways in which the vandalism gets detected so it can be reverted:
**'''Bots''': In many cases, the vandalism is automatically detected and reverted by a [[internet bot|bot]] (robot). The vandal is always warned with no human intervention.
** '''Recent changes patrol''': Wikipedia has a special page that lists all the most recent changes. Some editors will monitor these changes for possible vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA122#v=onepage|title=Wikipedia: the missing manual|last=Broughton|first=John|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=0-596-51516-2|location=|page=122|pages=}}</ref>
** '''Watchlists''': Any registered user can watch a page that they have created or edited or that they otherwise have an interest in. This functionality also enables users to monitor a page for vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />
** '''Incidental discovery''': Any reader who comes across vandalism by chance can revert it. In 2008, it was reported that the rarity of such incidental discovery indicated the efficacy of the other methods of vandalism removal.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />
* Locking articles so only established users, or in some cases, only administrators can edit them.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> ''Semi-protected'' articles are those that can only be edited by those with an account that is considered to be ''autoconfirmed'' – an account that is at least 4 days old with at least 10 edits, for most accounts. ''Fully protected articles'' are those that can only be edited by administrators. Protection is generally instituted after one or more editors makes a request on a special page for that purpose, and an administrator familiar with the protection guidelines chooses whether or not to fulfill this request based on the guidelines.
* Blocking and banning those who have repeatedly committed acts of vandalism from editing for a period of time or in some cases, indefinitely.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> Vandals are not blocked as an act of punishment&nbsp;– the purpose of the block is simply to [[preventive action|prevent]] further damage.<ref name=\"Broughton134\">{{cite book |title=Wikipedia: the missing manual |last=Broughton|first=John |year=2008 |isbn=0-596-51516-2 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA182&dq=%22edit+war%22wikipedia#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20war%22wikipedia&f=false}}</ref>
* The \"abuse filter\" extension, which uses [[regular expressions]] to detect common vandalism terms.<ref>See [[Wikipedia:Edit filter]]</ref>
Editors are generally warned prior to being blocked. Wikipedia employs a 4-stage warning process up to a block. This includes:<ref name=\"Broughton130\">{{cite book |title=Wikipedia: the missing manual |last=Broughton |first=John |year=2008 |isbn=0-596-51516-2 |pages=130–31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA182&dq=%22edit+war%22wikipedia#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20war%22wikipedia&f=false}}</ref>
#The first warning [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assumes good faith]] and takes a relaxed approach to the user. (in some cases, this level can be skipped if the editor assumes the user is acting in bad faith<ref>See {{slink|Wikipedia:WikiProject User warnings/Usage and layout|Levels}}</ref>).
#The second warning does not assume any faith and is an actual warning (in some cases, this level may also be skipped).
#The third warning assumes bad faith and is the first to warn the user that continued vandalism may result in a [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|block]].
#The fourth warning is a final warning, stating that any future acts of vandalism will result in a block.
#After this, other users may place additional warnings, though only administrators can actually carry out the block.

In 2005, the [[English Wikipedia]] started to require those who create new articles to have a registered account in an effort to fight vandalism. This occurred after inaccurate information was added to Wikipedia in which a journalist was accused of taking part in Kennedy's assassination.<ref name=\"newscientist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |title=Wikipedia tightens editorial rules after complaint&nbsp;– 06 December 2005 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015074757/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Wikipedia has experimented with systems in which edits to some articles, especially those of living people, are delayed until it can be reviewed and determined that they are not vandalism, and in some cases, that a source to verify accuracy is provided. This is in an effort to prevent inaccurate and potentially damaging information about living people from appearing on the site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/wikipedia_tests_approval_system_reduce_page_vandalism |title=Wikipedia Tests Approval System to Reduce Page Vandalism |publisher=Maximum PC |date=19 July 2008 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810050703/http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/wikipedia_tests_approval_system_reduce_page_vandalism |archive-date=10 August 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.ebrandz.com/miscellaneous/2009/2824-wikipedia-plans-to-enforce-new-editing-policy-to-thwart-vandals-.html |title=Wikipedia plans to enforce new editing policy to thwart vandals&nbsp;– eBrandz Search Marketing & Technology News |publisher=News.ebrandz.com |date=27 August 2009 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621061552/http://news.ebrandz.com/miscellaneous/2009/2824-wikipedia-plans-to-enforce-new-editing-policy-to-thwart-vandals-.html |archive-date=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== ClueBot NG ===

The most famous \"bot\" that fights vandalism is {{self-reference link|User:ClueBot NG|ClueBot NG}}. The bot was created by Wikipedia users Christopher Breneman and Cobi Carter in 2010, (succeeding the original ClueBot, NG stands for Next Generation)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|title=This machine kills trolls|date=18 February 2014|website=The Verge|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827115824/http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|archive-date=27 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> and uses [[machine learning]] and [[Bayesian statistics]] to determine if an edit is vandalism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18892510|title=Meet the 'bots' that edit Wikipedia|last=Nasaw|first=Daniel|date=25 July 2012|website=BBC News|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916120633/https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18892510|archive-date=16 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitfreak.com/technology/digital/1374-little-about-the-bot-that-runs-wikipedia,-cluebot-ng|title=Little about the bot that runs Wikipedia, ClueBot NG|last=Raja|first=Sumit|website=digitfreak.com|accessdate=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122134216/http://www.digitfreak.com/technology/digital/1374-little-about-the-bot-that-runs-wikipedia,-cluebot-ng|archive-date=22 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

While the bot has been effective in helping keep Wikipedia clean, some claim the bot is {{self-reference link|WP:BITE|hostile}} to new users by not being able to apply a human brain's knowledge to the edit, and leaving impersonal {{self-reference link|WP:TEMPLATES|templates}}.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bots-edit-wikipedia-humans-made/|title=The Bots Who Edit Wikipedia (And The Humans Who Made Them)|work=MakeUseOf|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511130558/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bots-edit-wikipedia-humans-made/|archive-date=11 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== [[:Special:AbuseFilter|Blacklisting]] ===

The MediaWiki title blacklist extension prevents page move vandalism and creation vandalism by using [[regular expressions]] to identify bad titles.  Titles on the blacklist can only be created by or moved to by administrators.  Pages that are also created repeatedly can be protected to prevent vandals from recreating bad pages.

In addition to the title blacklist, the spam blacklist prevents external link [[spamming]], a form of vandalism.  New/unregistered users who want to add external links are required to answer a [[CAPTCHA]].

The \"bad image list\" prevents images that could be used to vandalize pages from being inserted, such as images with sexual content. Images on the list can only be added to pages where the use of the image is explicitly allowed.

The entirety of the MediaWiki namespace, the main page, and high risk templates are protected to prevent high server load and sudden interface changes.

The edit filter can also prevent vandalism by disallowing the bad edit altogether.

== Notable acts of vandalism ==

=== Seigenthaler incident ===
{{main|Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident}}
[[File:John Seigenthaler Sr. speaking.jpg|thumb|alt=White-haired elderly gentleman in suit and tie speaks at a podium.|[[John Seigenthaler]], who in 2005 criticized Wikipedia]]
In May 2005, a user edited the [[biography|biographical]] article about [[John Seigenthaler, Sr.]] so that it contained several false and [[defamation|defamatory]] statements.<ref name=SeigenthalerUSAToday>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=29 November 2005|title=A false Wikipedia \"biography\"|first=John|last=Seigenthaler|authorlink=John Seigenthaler|access-date=17 September 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/64PWOeCKO?url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|archive-date=3 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The inaccurate claims went unnoticed between May and September 2005, when they were discovered by [[Victor S. Johnson, Jr.]], a friend of Seigenthaler. Wikipedia content is often mirrored at sites such as [[Answers.com]], which means that incorrect information can be replicated alongside correct information through a number of websites. Such information can develop a misleading air of authority because of its presence at such sites:<ref name=SeigenthalerABC>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s1613571.htm|title=Mistakes and hoaxes on-line|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 April 2006|accessdate=28 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608054128/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s1613571.htm|archive-date=8 June 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>
{{quote|
Then [Seigenthaler's] son discovered that his father's hoax biography also appeared on two other sites, Reference.com and Answers.com, which took direct feeds from Wikipedia. It was out there for four months before Seigenthaler realized and got the Wikipedia entry replaced with a more reliable account. The lies remained for another three weeks on the mirror sites downstream.

=== Stephen Colbert ===
{{See also|Cultural impact of The Colbert Report#Wikipedia references|label 1=Wikipedia references on The Colbert Report}}
Comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] made repeated references to Wikipedia on his TV show ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', frequently suggesting on air that his viewers vandalize selected pages. These instances include the following:

* On a 2006 episode of his show, Colbert suggested viewers vandalize the article \"[[Elephant]]\". This resulted in an account named \"[[User:Stephencolbert|Stephencolbert]]\" being blocked from editing, as well as many elephant-related articles being protected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/08/01/did-colbert-hack-wikipedia-video/ |title=Did Colbert hack Wikipedia?&nbsp;– VIDEO |publisher=Tvsquad.com |accessdate=7 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119215141/http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/08/01/did-colbert-hack-wikipedia-video/ |archivedate=19 January 2011 }}</ref>
* On 7 August 2012, Colbert suggested that his viewers go to pages for possible 2012 U.S. Republican vice presidential candidates, such as the [[Tim Pawlenty]] and [[Rob Portman]] articles, and edit them many times. This was in response to a [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] hypothesis that mass editing of the [[Sarah Palin]] page the day before she was announced as [[John McCain]]'s running mate could help predict who would be chosen as [[Mitt Romney]]'s running mate in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]].

'''Sir Norman Joseph Wisdom''',<ref name=freebmd/> {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE}}<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=54066 |date=17 June 1995 |page=14 |supp=y}}</ref> (4 February 1915 – 4 October 2010) was an English actor, comedian and singer-songwriter best known for a series of comedy films produced between 1953 and 1966 featuring his hapless onscreen character that was often called Norman Pitkin.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/05/sir-norman-wisdom-obituary|title=Sir Norman Wisdom obituary|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=6 October 2010 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location=London, UK | first=Stephen | last=Dixon}}</ref> He was awarded the 1953 [[BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles]] following the release of ''[[Trouble in Store]]'', his first film in a lead role.

Wisdom gained celebrity status in lands as far apart as South America, [[Iran]] and many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, particularly in [[Albania]] where his films were the only ones by Western actors permitted by dictator [[Enver Hoxha]] to be shown.<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8042823/Sir-Norman-Wisdom.html|title=Sir Norman Wisdom|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=6 October 2010|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London, UK}}</ref> [[Charlie Chaplin]] once referred to Wisdom as his \"favourite clown\".<ref name=\"BBCFool\"/>

Wisdom later forged a career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[New York City|New York]] and as a television actor, winning critical acclaim for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play ''Going Gently'' in 1981. He toured [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]].<ref name=\"GuardianObit\"/> After the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]], a hospice was named in his honour.<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/> In 1995 he was given the [[Freedom of the City]] of London and of [[Tirana]].<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/> The same year he was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] and was knighted five years later.<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/>

==Early life==
Norman Joseph Wisdom was born in the [[Marylebone]] district of London. His parents were Frederick, a [[chauffeur]], and Maud Wisdom (née Targett), a [[dressmaker]] who often worked for West End theatres, and had made a dress for [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].<ref>Don't Laugh at Me, p. 1</ref> The couple married in Marylebone on 15 July 1912. Wisdom had an elder brother, Frederick Thomas \"Fred\" Wisdom (13 December 1912 – 1 July 1971).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The family lived at 91 Fernhead Road, [[Maida Vale]], London W9, where they slept in one room.<ref name=\"MyTurn\">{{cite book|last1=Wisdom| first1=Norman |last2=Hall |first2=William |title= My Turn|publisher=Arrow Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-09-944676-7}}</ref> He and his brother were raised in extreme poverty and were frequently hit by their father.<ref name=\"Story\"/>

After a period in a [[Foster care|children's home]] in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], [[Kent]], Wisdom ran away when he was 11 but returned to become an [[errand boy|errand]] boy in a [[grocery store|grocer's shop]] on leaving school at 13. Having been kicked out of his home by his father and become homeless,<ref name=\"Story\">''Norman Wisdom: My Story'', [[BBC Two]], 15 October 2010</ref> in 1929 he walked (by his own account) to [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], where he became a [[cabin boy]] in the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]]. He later also worked as a [[waiting staff|waiter]].<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/>

==Military service==
Wisdom first enlisted into the [[King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)]], but his mother had him discharged as he was under age. He later re-enlisted as a [[drummer#In the military|drummer boy]]{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} in the [[10th Royal Hussars]] of the [[British Army]]. In 1930, he was posted to [[Lucknow]], in the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]] of [[British Raj|British India]],<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/> as a [[Military band|bandsman]]. There he rode horses, became the [[flyweight]] boxing champion of the [[British Indian Army|British Army in India]]<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/> and learned to play the trumpet and clarinet.<ref name=\"MyTurn\"/>

At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Wisdom was sent to work in a communications centre in a command bunker in London, where he connected telephone calls from war leaders to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]. He met [[Winston Churchill]] on several occasions when asked for updates on incoming calls.<ref name=\"MyTurn\"/> Wisdom then joined the [[Royal Corps of Signals]], and performed a similar military function at the unit headquarters in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]].

Whilst performing a [[shadow boxing]] routine in an army gym, Wisdom discovered he had a talent for entertainment,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3751896.stm|title=Sir Norman takes final stage bow|date=18 October 2004|work=BBC News |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> and began to develop his skills as a musician and [[performance art|stage entertainer]].<ref name=\"BBCFool\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/779888.stm|title=Sir Norman: Nobody's fool|date=6 June 2000|work=BBC News |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> In 1940 aged 25, at a [[NAAFI]] entertainment night, during a dance routine, Wisdom stepped down from his position in the [[orchestra pit]], and started shadow boxing. Hearing his colleagues and officers giggling, he broke into a duck waddle, followed by a series of facial expressions. He later described the reaction as: \"They were in hysterics. All the officers were falling about laughing.\"<ref name=GuardWordsWis>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/25/features.magazine1|title=Words of Wisdom|first=Burhan |last=Wazie|work=[[The Observer]] |date=25 February 2001|accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref>

Wisdom later said this was where he first patented his persona as \"The Successful Failure\".<ref name=GuardWordsWis/> Over the next few years, until he was demobilized in 1945, his routine included his characteristic singing and the trip-up-and-stumble. After Wisdom appeared at a charity concert at [[Cheltenham Town Hall]], actor [[Rex Harrison]] came backstage and urged him to become a professional entertainer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/3086186.stm|title=Plaque marks comic's time in forces|date=6 September 2003|work=BBC News |accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

==Comic entertainer==
After being demobilised Wisdom worked as a [[Taxicabs of the United Kingdom|private hire car driver]]. Having improved his diction in the army, he also took a job as a night [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]].<ref name=\"MyTurn\"/>

Wisdom made his debut as a professional entertainer at the age of 31; his rise to the top was phenomenally fast. Initially the [[Double act|straight man]] to the [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] [[David Nixon (magician)|David Nixon]],<ref name=\"BBCFool\"/> he had already adopted the costume that would remain his trademark: tweed [[flat cap]] askew, with peak turned up; a suit at least two sizes too tight; a crumpled collar and a mangled tie. The character that went with this costume — known as the Gump — was to dominate Wisdom's film career. A [[West End theatre]] star within two years, he honed his performance skills mainly between theatres in London and [[Brighton]]:<ref name=GuardWordsWis/>
{{quote|I spent virtually all of those years on the road. You could keep incredibly busy just performing in pantomimes and revues. There was a whole generation of performers who learned everything on the stage.}}
 
Wisdom made his TV debut in 1948 and was soon commanding enormous audiences and had a small film role in ''[[A Date with a Dream]]'' released in the same year.

==Starring film roles for the Rank Organisation==
Wisdom made a series of low-budget star-vehicle comedies for the [[Rank Organisation]], beginning with ''[[Trouble in Store]]'' (1953).<ref>{{cite book|last1=McFarlane|first1=Brian|last2=Slide|first2=Anthony|title=The Encyclopedia of British Film|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofbr0000unse/page/736|accessdate=22 October 2010|year=2003|publisher=Methuen Publishing Ltd|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-413-77301-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofbr0000unse/page/736 736]}}</ref> This film earned him a [[BAFTA Award]] for Most Promising Newcomer to Film in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1953|title=Film Nominations 1953|publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts|accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref> It was the second most popular film at the British box-office in 1954 and exhibitors voted him the tenth biggest star at the British box office the same year.<ref name=\"Wayne\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27253063 |title=John Wayne Heads Box-Office Poll |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tasmania |date=31 December 1954 |accessdate=24 April 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

His films' cheerful, unpretentious appeal make them the direct descendants of those made a generation earlier by [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=McFarlane|first1=Brian|last2=Slide|first2=Anthony|title=The Encyclopedia of British Film|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofbr0000unse/page/230|accessdate=22 October 2010|year=2003|publisher=Methuen Publishing Ltd|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-413-77301-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofbr0000unse/page/230 230]}}</ref> Never highly thought of by the critics, they were very popular with domestic audiences and Wisdom's films were among Britain's biggest box-office successes of their day. They were also successful in some unlikely overseas markets, helping Rank stay afloat financially when their more expensive film projects were unsuccessful.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The films usually involved the Gump character, usually called Norman, in a manual occupation in which he is barely competent and in a junior position to a straight man, often played by [[Edward Chapman (actor)|Edward Chapman]] (as Mr Grimsdale) or [[Jerry Desmonde]]. They benefited from Wisdom's capacity for physical [[slapstick]] comedy and his skill at creating a sense of the character's helplessness. The series often contained a romantic subplot; the Gump's inevitable awkwardness with women is a characteristic shared with the earlier Formby vehicles. His innocent incompetence still made him endearing to the heroine.

Wisdom's second film as star, ''[[One Good Turn (1955 film)|One Good Turn]]'' (1955), was the seventh most popular movie of 1955 in Britain.<ref>'Dirk Bogarde favourite film actor', ''The Irish Times'' (1921–Current file) [Dublin, Ireland] 29 December 1955: 9.</ref> He made a cameo in ''[[As Long as They're Happy]]'' (1955), then returned in ''[[Man of the Moment (1955 film)|Man of the Moment]]'' (1955). He was the 6th most popular star of 1955.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Dam Busters |date=29 December 1955 |page_number=12}}</ref>

Wisdom was a window cleaner in ''[[Up in the World]]'' (1956) and worked in a jewellery store in ''[[Just My Luck (1957 film)|Just My Luck]]'' (1957). The box office receipts of these last few films had declined from previous Wisdom films but ''[[The Square Peg]]'' (1959), an army comedy, reversed the trend and was one of the year's biggest hits. The film was the 7th most popular movie at the British box office in 1959.<ref>\"Year Of Profitable British Films.\" Times [London, England] 1 January 1960: 13. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.</ref> Less successful was ''[[Follow a Star]]'' (1959). ''[[There Was a Crooked Man (film)|There Was a Crooked Man]]'' (1960) was an attempt to change Wisdom's image away from Rank Organisation. ''[[The Bulldog Breed]]'' (1960) was more conventional. The film also starred a young [[Michael Caine]] who later recalled he did not enjoy working with Wisdom because he \"wasn't very nice to support-part actors\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/michael-caine-interview-my-generation-venice-film-festival-films-london-a7928461.html|title=Michael Caine interview: Every single person I knew became rich|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=9 November 2017| location=London, UK| date=4 September 2017}}</ref> Wisdom remained the 10th biggest star at the British box office.

Wisdom was in ''[[The Girl on the Boat (film)|The Girl on the Boat]]'' (1961) from a novel by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], a second film away from the Rank formula. ''[[On the Beat (1962 film)|On the Beat]]'' (1962) as a car cleaner and ''[[A Stitch in Time (film)|A Stitch in Time]]'' (1963), in which he was cast as an apprentice butcher, returned him to the regular format.

''[[The Early Bird]]'' (1965), his first colour film, had Wisdom as a milkman. After a cameo in ''[[The Sandwich Man (1966 film)|The Sandwich Man]]'' (1966), Wisdom starred in ''[[Press for Time]]'' (1966), the last film in this sequence of starring vehicles.<!-- & implicitly of films for Rank. --> Wisdom was still voted the 5th most popular star at the British box office.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Most popular star for third time |date=31 December 1966 |page_number=5}}</ref>

Whilst Wisdom's stage performances often involved musical numbers, he wrote only a few of them. He has seven songs attributed to him in the [[ASCAP]] database, which are: \"Beware\", \"Don't Laugh at Me ('cause I'm a Fool)\", \"Falling in Love\", \"Follow a Star\", \"I Love You\", \"Please Opportunity\", and \"Up in the World\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=9735600&search_in=c&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=25&start=1|title=Works Written by Wisdom Norman|work=The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

==Later career==
[[File:Norman Wisdom 2 (1965).jpg|thumb|left|Norman Wisdom demonstrating a typical expression (1965)]]
In 1966, Wisdom spent a short period in the United States to star in a Broadway production of the [[Jimmy Van Heusen]] and [[Sammy Cahn]] [[musical comedy]] ''Walking Happy''. His performance was nominated for a [[Tony Award]].

This led to Wisdom's being cast in his first Hollywood movie, ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]'' (1968). Back in England he tried to change his image slightly in ''[[What's Good for the Goose]]'' (1969), which featured a topless scene, but it was financially unsuccessful.

Wisdom was one of several actors initially considered for the role of Frank Spencer in ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]].'' However, he turned the role down and it eventually went to [[Michael Crawford]]. The creator of the series [[Raymond Allen (scriptwriter)|Raymond Allen]] later stated \"Norman Wisdom was offered the role but turned it down because he didn't find it funny\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/646955/Frank-Spencer-Raymond-Allen-sports-relief-some-mothers-do-ave-em|title=The man who made Frank Spencer|first=Peter|last=Robertson|date=24 February 2016|newspaper=[[Daily Express]] |accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>

On 31 December 1976, Wisdom performed his theme song \"Don't Laugh at Me ('cause I'm a Fool)\" on [[BBC1]]'s ''[[A Jubilee of Music]]'', celebrating British pop music for [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s impending [[Silver Jubilee]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/4227445.stm |work=BBC News |title=In pictures: Sir Norman Wisdom |date=4 February 2005 |accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref> Wisdom had performed in front of the Queen at many Royal Command Performances, the first being in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1950s/1952|title=1952, London Palladium|work=The Royal Variety Performance|publisher=Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund|accessdate=11 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009061416/http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1950s/1952|archivedate=9 October 2010}}</ref>

He also completed his first American film as a [[vaudeville]] comic in ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]''. After a typical performance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'',<ref name=\"BBCFool\"/> further US opportunities were denied him when he had to return to London after his second wife left him. His subsequent career was largely confined to television, and he toured the world with a successful cabaret act. He won critical acclaim in 1981 for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play ''Going Gently''.

After touring South Africa, Zimbabwe and Australia with some success, his appearances in Britain became more infrequent. He spent much of the 1980s in seclusion on the Isle of Man.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/05/sir-norman-wisdom-obituary|title=Sir Norman Wisdom obituary|first=Stephen|last=Dixon|date=4 October 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>

Wisdom's career revived in the 1990s, helped by the young comedian [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]], whose act was often compared to Wisdom's work.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3626118/%27All-I%27ve-ever-felt-on-stage-is-pain%27.html|title=All I've ever felt on stage is pain|last=Rees|first=Jasper|date=25 October 2004|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London, UK |accessdate=11 October 2010|quote=I saw his films as a kid.

The high point of this new popularity was the [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] he was awarded, for services to entertainment, in the 2000 New Year's honours list.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=55710 |date=30 December 1999 |page=2 |supp=y}}</ref> During the ceremony, once he had received his knighthood, he walked away and again performed his trademark trip, at which the Queen smiled and laughed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/04/norman-wisdom-dies-aged-95|title=Norman Wisdom dies aged 95|date=4 October 2010|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=5 October 2010  | first=Jo | last=Adetunji}}</ref>

From 1995 until 2004 he appeared in the recurring role of Billy Ingleton in the long-running [[BBC]] comedy ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]''.

===Popularity in Albania===
Wisdom was a well-known performer in [[Albania]], where he was one of the few Western actors whose films were allowed in the country under [[Enver Hoxha]]. According to Hoxha's [[Dialectical_materialism|dialectical materialist]] viewpoint, proletarian Norman's ultimately victorious struggles against capitalism, personified by Mr Grimsdale and the effete aristocratic characters played by Jerry Desmonde, were a Communist parable on the class war. He was known as Mr Pitkin after the character from his films. In 1995, he visited the post-[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ist country where, to his surprise, he was greeted by many appreciative fans, including the then President, [[Sali Berisha]]. During this trip, Wisdom was filmed by ''[[Newsnight]]'' as he visited a children's project funded by ChildHope UK.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9063102.stm|title=Norman Wisdom mobbed by Albanian fans on 1995 trip |date=5 October 2010 |work=Newsnight |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

In the film Wisdom plays a vicar plagued by a fly in a café. Producer Nigel Martin Davey gave him only a visual role so that he would not have to remember any lines, but on the day Wisdom was alert and had his performance changed to add more laughs.<ref name=\"BBCEspres\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6965560.stm|title=Sir Norman's swansong is released|date=27 August 2007|work=BBC News |accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

During the 1960s, he was involved in a famous legal case (''Wisdom v Chamberlain'', 1968) in which he was pursued by the [[Inland Revenue]] for tax on profits made from the sale of silver bullion he had bought when concerned about the further devaluation of [[Pound sterling|sterling]]. He contended that it was an investment but the court held that it had been a trading venture and was duly chargeable to [[income tax]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Wisdom v Chamberlain (Inspector of Taxes) (8 November 1968) |date=21 February 2017 |url=http://swarb.co.uk/wisdom-v-chamberlain-inspector-of-taxes-ca-8-nov-1968/ |website=Swarb.co.uk}}</ref>

It was available for charter at £6,000 a month but Wisdom later sold it, saying that he was \"no sailor\".<ref name=GuardWordsWis/>

===Allegations of inappropriate behaviour===

In an exclusive interview on 27 August 2007 with the ''[[News of the World]]'', journalists were given access to Wisdom's room at the home.

'''Sir Norman Joseph Wisdom''',<ref name=freebmd/> {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE}}<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=54066 |date=17 June 1995 |page=14 |supp=y}}</ref> (4 February 1915 – 4 October 2010) was an English actor, comedian and singer-songwriter best known for a series of comedy films produced between 1953 and 1966 featuring his hapless onscreen character that was often called Norman Pitkin.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/05/sir-norman-wisdom-obituary|title=Sir Norman Wisdom obituary|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=6 October 2010 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location=London, UK | first=Stephen | last=Dixon}}</ref> He was awarded the 1953 [[BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles]] following the release of ''[[Trouble in Store]]'', his first film in a lead role.

Wisdom gained celebrity status in lands as far apart as South America, [[Iran]] and many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, particularly in [[Albania]] where his films were the only ones by Western actors permitted by dictator [[Enver Hoxha]] to be shown.<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8042823/Sir-Norman-Wisdom.html|title=Sir Norman Wisdom|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=6 October 2010|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London, UK}}</ref> [[Charlie Chaplin]] once referred to Wisdom as his \"favourite clown\".<ref name=\"BBCFool\"/>

Wisdom later forged a career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[New York City|New York]] and as a television actor, winning critical acclaim for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play ''Going Gently'' in 1981. He toured [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]].<ref name=\"GuardianObit\"/> After the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]], a hospice was named in his honour.<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/> In 1995 he was given the [[Freedom of the City]] of London and of [[Tirana]].<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/> The same year he was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] and was knighted five years later.<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/>

==Early life==
Norman Joseph Wisdom was born in the [[Marylebone]] district of London. His parents were Frederick, a [[chauffeur]], and Maud Wisdom (née Targett), a [[dressmaker]] who often worked for West End theatres, and had made a dress for [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].<ref>Don't Laugh at Me, p. 1</ref> The couple married in Marylebone on 15 July 1912. Wisdom had an elder brother, Frederick Thomas \"Fred\" Wisdom (13 December 1912 – 1 July 1971).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The family lived at 91 Fernhead Road, [[Maida Vale]], London W9, where they slept in one room.<ref name=\"MyTurn\">{{cite book|last1=Wisdom| first1=Norman |last2=Hall |first2=William |title= My Turn|publisher=Arrow Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-09-944676-7}}</ref> He and his brother were raised in extreme poverty and were frequently hit by their father.<ref name=\"Story\"/>

After a period in a [[Foster care|children's home]] in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], [[Kent]], Wisdom ran away when he was 11 but returned to become an [[errand boy|errand]] boy in a [[grocery store|grocer's shop]] on leaving school at 13. Having been kicked out of his home by his father and become homeless,<ref name=\"Story\">''Norman Wisdom: My Story'', [[BBC Two]], 15 October 2010</ref> in 1929 he walked (by his own account) to [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], where he became a [[cabin boy]] in the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]]. He later also worked as a [[waiting staff|waiter]].<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/>

==Military service==
Wisdom first enlisted into the [[King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)]], but his mother had him discharged as he was under age. He later re-enlisted as a [[drummer#In the military|drummer boy]]{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} in the [[10th Royal Hussars]] of the [[British Army]]. In 1930, he was posted to [[Lucknow]], in the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]] of [[British Raj|British India]],<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/> as a [[Military band|bandsman]]. There he rode horses, became the [[flyweight]] boxing champion of the [[British Indian Army|British Army in India]]<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/> and learned to play the trumpet and clarinet.<ref name=\"MyTurn\"/>

At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Wisdom was sent to work in a communications centre in a command bunker in London, where he connected telephone calls from war leaders to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]. He met [[Winston Churchill]] on several occasions when asked for updates on incoming calls.<ref name=\"MyTurn\"/> Wisdom then joined the [[Royal Corps of Signals]], and performed a similar military function at the unit headquarters in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]].

Whilst performing a [[shadow boxing]] routine in an army gym, Wisdom discovered he had a talent for entertainment,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3751896.stm|title=Sir Norman takes final stage bow|date=18 October 2004|work=BBC News |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> and began to develop his skills as a musician and [[performance art|stage entertainer]].<ref name=\"BBCFool\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/779888.stm|title=Sir Norman: Nobody's fool|date=6 June 2000|work=BBC News |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> In 1940 aged 25, at a [[NAAFI]] entertainment night, during a dance routine, Wisdom stepped down from his position in the [[orchestra pit]], and started shadow boxing. Hearing his colleagues and officers giggling, he broke into a duck waddle, followed by a series of facial expressions. He later described the reaction as: \"They were in hysterics. All the officers were falling about laughing.\"<ref name=GuardWordsWis>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/25/features.magazine1|title=Words of Wisdom|first=Burhan |last=Wazie|work=[[The Observer]] |date=25 February 2001|accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref>

Wisdom later said this was where he first patented his persona as \"The Successful Failure\".<ref name=GuardWordsWis/> Over the next few years, until he was demobilized in 1945, his routine included his characteristic singing and the trip-up-and-stumble. After Wisdom appeared at a charity concert at [[Cheltenham Town Hall]], actor [[Rex Harrison]] came backstage and urged him to become a professional entertainer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/3086186.stm|title=Plaque marks comic's time in forces|date=6 September 2003|work=BBC News |accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

==Comic entertainer==
After being demobilised Wisdom worked as a [[Taxicabs of the United Kingdom|private hire car driver]]. Having improved his diction in the army, he also took a job as a night [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]].<ref name=\"MyTurn\"/>

Wisdom made his debut as a professional entertainer at the age of 31; his rise to the top was phenomenally fast. Initially the [[Double act|straight man]] to the [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] [[David Nixon (magician)|David Nixon]],<ref name=\"BBCFool\"/> he had already adopted the costume that would remain his trademark: tweed [[flat cap]] askew, with peak turned up; a suit at least two sizes too tight; a crumpled collar and a mangled tie. The character that went with this costume — known as the Gump — was to dominate Wisdom's film career. A [[West End theatre]] star within two years, he honed his performance skills mainly between theatres in London and [[Brighton]]:<ref name=GuardWordsWis/>
{{quote|I spent virtually all of those years on the road. You could keep incredibly busy just performing in pantomimes and revues. There was a whole generation of performers who learned everything on the stage.}}
 
Wisdom made his TV debut in 1948 and was soon commanding enormous audiences and had a small film role in ''[[A Date with a Dream]]'' released in the same year.

==Starring film roles for the Rank Organisation==
Wisdom made a series of low-budget star-vehicle comedies for the [[Rank Organisation]], beginning with ''[[Trouble in Store]]'' (1953).<ref>{{cite book|last1=McFarlane|first1=Brian|last2=Slide|first2=Anthony|title=The Encyclopedia of British Film|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofbr0000unse/page/736|accessdate=22 October 2010|year=2003|publisher=Methuen Publishing Ltd|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-413-77301-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofbr0000unse/page/736 736]}}</ref> This film earned him a [[BAFTA Award]] for Most Promising Newcomer to Film in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1953|title=Film Nominations 1953|publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts|accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref> It was the second most popular film at the British box-office in 1954 and exhibitors voted him the tenth biggest star at the British box office the same year.<ref name=\"Wayne\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27253063 |title=John Wayne Heads Box-Office Poll |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tasmania |date=31 December 1954 |accessdate=24 April 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

His films' cheerful, unpretentious appeal make them the direct descendants of those made a generation earlier by [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=McFarlane|first1=Brian|last2=Slide|first2=Anthony|title=The Encyclopedia of British Film|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofbr0000unse/page/230|accessdate=22 October 2010|year=2003|publisher=Methuen Publishing Ltd|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-413-77301-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofbr0000unse/page/230 230]}}</ref> Never highly thought of by the critics, they were very popular with domestic audiences and Wisdom's films were among Britain's biggest box-office successes of their day. They were also successful in some unlikely overseas markets, helping Rank stay afloat financially when their more expensive film projects were unsuccessful.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The films usually involved the Gump character, usually called Norman, in a manual occupation in which he is barely competent and in a junior position to a straight man, often played by [[Edward Chapman (actor)|Edward Chapman]] (as Mr Grimsdale) or [[Jerry Desmonde]]. They benefited from Wisdom's capacity for physical [[slapstick]] comedy and his skill at creating a sense of the character's helplessness. The series often contained a romantic subplot; the Gump's inevitable awkwardness with women is a characteristic shared with the earlier Formby vehicles. His innocent incompetence still made him endearing to the heroine.

Wisdom's second film as star, ''[[One Good Turn (1955 film)|One Good Turn]]'' (1955), was the seventh most popular movie of 1955 in Britain.<ref>'Dirk Bogarde favourite film actor', ''The Irish Times'' (1921–Current file) [Dublin, Ireland] 29 December 1955: 9.</ref> He made a cameo in ''[[As Long as They're Happy]]'' (1955), then returned in ''[[Man of the Moment (1955 film)|Man of the Moment]]'' (1955). He was the 6th most popular star of 1955.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Dam Busters |date=29 December 1955 |page_number=12}}</ref>

Wisdom was a window cleaner in ''[[Up in the World]]'' (1956) and worked in a jewellery store in ''[[Just My Luck (1957 film)|Just My Luck]]'' (1957). The box office receipts of these last few films had declined from previous Wisdom films but ''[[The Square Peg]]'' (1959), an army comedy, reversed the trend and was one of the year's biggest hits. The film was the 7th most popular movie at the British box office in 1959.<ref>\"Year Of Profitable British Films.\" Times [London, England] 1 January 1960: 13. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.</ref> Less successful was ''[[Follow a Star]]'' (1959). ''[[There Was a Crooked Man (film)|There Was a Crooked Man]]'' (1960) was an attempt to change Wisdom's image away from Rank Organisation. ''[[The Bulldog Breed]]'' (1960) was more conventional. The film also starred a young [[Michael Caine]] who later recalled he did not enjoy working with Wisdom because he \"wasn't very nice to support-part actors\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/michael-caine-interview-my-generation-venice-film-festival-films-london-a7928461.html|title=Michael Caine interview: Every single person I knew became rich|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=9 November 2017| location=London, UK| date=4 September 2017}}</ref> Wisdom remained the 10th biggest star at the British box office.

Wisdom was in ''[[The Girl on the Boat (film)|The Girl on the Boat]]'' (1961) from a novel by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], a second film away from the Rank formula. ''[[On the Beat (1962 film)|On the Beat]]'' (1962) as a car cleaner and ''[[A Stitch in Time (film)|A Stitch in Time]]'' (1963), in which he was cast as an apprentice butcher, returned him to the regular format.

''[[The Early Bird]]'' (1965), his first colour film, had Wisdom as a milkman. After a cameo in ''[[The Sandwich Man (1966 film)|The Sandwich Man]]'' (1966), Wisdom starred in ''[[Press for Time]]'' (1966), the last film in this sequence of starring vehicles.<!-- & implicitly of films for Rank. --> Wisdom was still voted the 5th most popular star at the British box office.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Most popular star for third time |date=31 December 1966 |page_number=5}}</ref>

Whilst Wisdom's stage performances often involved musical numbers, he wrote only a few of them. He has seven songs attributed to him in the [[ASCAP]] database, which are: \"Beware\", \"Don't Laugh at Me ('cause I'm a Fool)\", \"Falling in Love\", \"Follow a Star\", \"I Love You\", \"Please Opportunity\", and \"Up in the World\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=9735600&search_in=c&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=25&start=1|title=Works Written by Wisdom Norman|work=The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

==Later career==
[[File:Norman Wisdom 2 (1965).jpg|thumb|left|Norman Wisdom demonstrating a typical expression (1965)]]
In 1966, Wisdom spent a short period in the United States to star in a Broadway production of the [[Jimmy Van Heusen]] and [[Sammy Cahn]] [[musical comedy]] ''Walking Happy''. His performance was nominated for a [[Tony Award]].

This led to Wisdom's being cast in his first Hollywood movie, ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]'' (1968). Back in England he tried to change his image slightly in ''[[What's Good for the Goose]]'' (1969), which featured a topless scene, but it was financially unsuccessful.

Wisdom was one of several actors initially considered for the role of Frank Spencer in ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]].'' However, he turned the role down and it eventually went to [[Michael Crawford]]. The creator of the series [[Raymond Allen (scriptwriter)|Raymond Allen]] later stated \"Norman Wisdom was offered the role but turned it down because he didn't find it funny\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/646955/Frank-Spencer-Raymond-Allen-sports-relief-some-mothers-do-ave-em|title=The man who made Frank Spencer|first=Peter|last=Robertson|date=24 February 2016|newspaper=[[Daily Express]] |accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>

On 31 December 1976, Wisdom performed his theme song \"Don't Laugh at Me ('cause I'm a Fool)\" on [[BBC1]]'s ''[[A Jubilee of Music]]'', celebrating British pop music for [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s impending [[Silver Jubilee]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/4227445.stm |work=BBC News |title=In pictures: Sir Norman Wisdom |date=4 February 2005 |accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref> Wisdom had performed in front of the Queen at many Royal Command Performances, the first being in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1950s/1952|title=1952, London Palladium|work=The Royal Variety Performance|publisher=Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund|accessdate=11 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009061416/http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1950s/1952|archivedate=9 October 2010}}</ref>

He also completed his first American film as a [[vaudeville]] comic in ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]''. After a typical performance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'',<ref name=\"BBCFool\"/> further US opportunities were denied him when he had to return to London after his second wife left him. His subsequent career was largely confined to television, and he toured the world with a successful cabaret act. He won critical acclaim in 1981 for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play ''Going Gently''.

After touring South Africa, Zimbabwe and Australia with some success, his appearances in Britain became more infrequent. He spent much of the 1980s in seclusion on the Isle of Man.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/05/sir-norman-wisdom-obituary|title=Sir Norman Wisdom obituary|first=Stephen|last=Dixon|date=4 October 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>

Wisdom's career revived in the 1990s, helped by the young comedian [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]], whose act was often compared to Wisdom's work.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3626118/%27All-I%27ve-ever-felt-on-stage-is-pain%27.html|title=All I've ever felt on stage is pain|last=Rees|first=Jasper|date=25 October 2004|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London, UK |accessdate=11 October 2010|quote=I saw his films as a kid. It surprises me because if you watch my act it's nothing like his really. }}</ref> His films for Rank were playing to new audiences via television screenings, with young fans in the United Kingdom and abroad. The high point of this new popularity was the [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] he was awarded, for services to entertainment, in the 2000 New Year's honours list.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=55710 |date=30 December 1999 |page=2 |supp=y}}</ref> During the ceremony, once he had received his knighthood, he walked away and again performed his trademark trip, at which the Queen smiled and laughed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/04/norman-wisdom-dies-aged-95|title=Norman Wisdom dies aged 95|date=4 October 2010|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=5 October 2010  | first=Jo | last=Adetunji}}</ref>

From 1995 until 2004 he appeared in the recurring role of Billy Ingleton in the long-running [[BBC]] comedy ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]''. The role was originally a one-off appearance, but proved so popular that he returned as the character on a number of occasions. In 1996, he received a Special Achievement Award from the [[London Film Critics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.criticscircle.org.uk/film/award.asp?CAT=sa&title=Special%20Awards |title=Film – Special Awards |work=London Film Critics Circle |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207041912/http://criticscircle.org.uk/film/award.asp?CAT=sa&title=Special%20Awards |archivedate=7 December 2010  }}</ref>

Wisdom was a guest on a ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' special in 2000 for actor and director [[Todd Carty]]. He appeared as a half-time guest at the England vs [[Albania]] 2002 World Cup qualifier at [[St James' Park]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], and scored a penalty at the Leazes End.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/albania/724796/Albania-Stormin-Norman.html|title=Albania: Stormin' Norman|last=Labes|first=Lucinda |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 February 2009 | location=London, UK | date=31 July 2002}}</ref>

In 2002 Wisdom filmed a cameo role as a butler in a low-budget horror film. In 2004, he made an appearance on ''[[Coronation Street]],'' playing fitness fanatic pensioner Ernie Crabbe. In 2007 he came out of retirement to take a role in a short film called ''[[Expresso (film)|Expresso]]''.<ref name=\"newfilm-bbc\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blackcountry/content/articles/2007/05/03/expresso_feature.shtml |title=New film: Expresso|date=7 May 2007 |work=BBC News |accessdate=27 December 2008}}</ref>

===Popularity in Albania===
Wisdom was a well-known performer in [[Albania]], where he was one of the few Western actors whose films were allowed in the country under [[Enver Hoxha]]. According to Hoxha's [[Dialectical_materialism|dialectical materialist]] viewpoint, proletarian Norman's ultimately victorious struggles against capitalism, personified by Mr Grimsdale and the effete aristocratic characters played by Jerry Desmonde, were a Communist parable on the class war. He was known as Mr Pitkin after the character from his films. In 1995, he visited the post-[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ist country where, to his surprise, he was greeted by many appreciative fans, including the then President, [[Sali Berisha]]. During this trip, Wisdom was filmed by ''[[Newsnight]]'' as he visited a children's project funded by ChildHope UK.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9063102.stm|title=Norman Wisdom mobbed by Albanian fans on 1995 trip |date=5 October 2010 |work=Newsnight |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

==Retirement==
[[File:Norman Wisdom Peel IoM 2005 -CCR27366-.jpg|thumb|Wisdom in [[Peel, Isle of Man]], in 2005]]
In October 2004 Wisdom announced he would retire from the entertainment industry on his 90th birthday (4 February 2005). He announced that he intended to spend more time with his family, playing golf and driving around the Isle of Man, where he was living.<ref name=\"BBC retires\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3735104.stm|title=Sir Norman Wisdom to retire at 90|date=11 October 2004|work=BBC News |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref>

In 2007, Wisdom returned to acting in a short film directed by Kevin Powis, ''[[Expresso (film)|Expresso]]''.

Shot in January, it premièred at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 27 May 2007. It was later adopted by the UK charity [[Macmillan Cancer Support|Macmillan]] and released on DVD in aid of the charity.

In the film Wisdom plays a vicar plagued by a fly in a café. Producer Nigel Martin Davey gave him only a visual role so that he would not have to remember any lines, but on the day Wisdom was alert and had his performance changed to add more laughs.<ref name=\"BBCEspres\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6965560.stm|title=Sir Norman's swansong is released|date=27 August 2007|work=BBC News |accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

==Personal life==

Popular in the Isle of Man, he lived for 27 years in a house in [[Andreas, Isle of Man|Andreas]] named Ballalough ([[Manx language]] for \"lake farm\", also a humorous corruption of the English \"belly laugh\"). He supported various charities and charitable works, including orphanages in Albania.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1251406.stm|title=Sir Norman Wisdom: Clown Prince of Albania|date=30 March 2001|accessdate=25 February 2019}}</ref> In 2005 Wisdom starred in a video for the [[Manx people|Manx]] girl group Twisted Angels, for their single \"LA\", in support of the local charity Project 21.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/isle_of_man/4275924.stm|title=Sir Norman 'launches punk career'|date=23 September 2005 |work=BBC News |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref>

During the 1960s, he was involved in a famous legal case (''Wisdom v Chamberlain'', 1968) in which he was pursued by the [[Inland Revenue]] for tax on profits made from the sale of silver bullion he had bought when concerned about the further devaluation of [[Pound sterling|sterling]]. He contended that it was an investment but the court held that it had been a trading venture and was duly chargeable to [[income tax]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Wisdom v Chamberlain (Inspector of Taxes) (8 November 1968) |date=21 February 2017 |url=http://swarb.co.uk/wisdom-v-chamberlain-inspector-of-taxes-ca-8-nov-1968/ |website=Swarb.co.uk}}</ref>

A lover of cars, his collection included a 1956 [[Bentley S1#Bentley Continental|Bentley S1 Continental R Type fastback]], which he first bought in 1961, and then again in the late 1980s.'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/685318.stm|title=Wisdom's classic car farewell|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 March 2000|accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref>''' In 1969, he purchased, after the divorce from Freda Simpson, a [[AC_Cobra|Shelby Cobra 427]], CSX3206, in New York, which he kept until 1986, when it was sold to another car enthusiast in Brighton, UK.

In 1963, he bought a new motor yacht. The {{convert|94|ft}} long hull and superstructure were built in [[Spain]] for £80,000, before being towed to [[Shoreham-by-Sea]], [[West Sussex]], for fitting out. After three years of extensive works and sea trials, she was named M/Y ''Conquest'' and valued at £1.25 million by insurers. It was available for charter at £6,000 a month but Wisdom later sold it, saying that he was \"no sailor\".<ref name=GuardWordsWis/>

===Allegations of inappropriate behaviour===
Actress [[Fenella Fielding]], who worked with Wisdom on his 1959 film ''[[Follow a Star]]'', said he was \"not a very pleasant man.

==Health decline==
In mid-2006, after he suffered an irregular heart rhythm, Wisdom was flown by helicopter to hospital in [[Liverpool]] and was fitted with a [[heart pacemaker]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/isle_of_man/5165764.stm |title=Comedian recovers after heart op |accessdate=12 October 2010 | date=10 July 2006 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

On the release of ''Expresso'' to DVD in the same month, BBC News confirmed that Wisdom lived in a care home, because of his suffering from [[Multi-infarct dementia|vascular dementia]].<ref name=\"BBCEspres\"/> It was also reported that he had granted his children [[power of attorney]] over his affairs and, having sold off his flat in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], they were now in the process of selling his Isle of Man home to raise money to fund his longer term care.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.surreycomet.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1619398.mostviewed.comedy_legend_leaves_epsom_flat_for_good.php|title=Comedy legend leaves Epsom flat for good|date=18 August 2007|newspaper=[[Surrey Comet]] |publisher=Newsquest Media Group|accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

In an exclusive interview on 27 August 2007 with the ''[[News of the World]]'', journalists were given access to Wisdom's room at the home.

==History==
'''Indianapolis Municipal Airport''' opened in 1931. In 1944, it was renamed '''Weir Cook Municipal Airport''', after [[US Army Air Forces]] Col. [[Harvey Weir Cook]] of [[Wilkinson, Indiana]], who became a [[flying ace]] during World War I with seven victories and died flying a [[P-39]] over [[New Caledonia]] in World War II.

Since 1962, the airport has been owned and operated by the [[Indianapolis Airport Authority]] (IAA), an eight-member board with members appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis and other officials from Marion, [[Hendricks County, Indiana|Hendricks]] and [[Hamilton County, Indiana|Hamilton]] counties in central Indiana. In 1976, the board renamed the airport Indianapolis International Airport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2008, the board named the new main passenger facility the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal and the new entrance road Col. H. Weir Cook Memorial Drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080718/BUSINESS/80718004 |title=Airport keeps name, but will honor Weir Cook |date=July 18, 2008 |publisher=6 News Indianapolis |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826191910/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080718%2FBUSINESS%2F80718004 |archivedate=August 26, 2012 }}</ref>

From 1957 to 2008, the passenger terminal was on the east side of the airfield off High School Road. This now-demolished facility was renovated and expanded many times, notably in 1968 (Concourses A & B), 1972 (Concourse D) and 1987 (Concourse C and the attached Parking Garage). This complex, along with the International Arrivals Terminal (opened in 1976) on the north side of the airfield (off Pierson Drive), was replaced by the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal on November 12, 2008. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The April 1957 OAG shows 82 weekday departures: 24 Eastern, 22 TWA, 15 Delta, 11 American, 9 Lake Central and 1 Ozark. Eastern had a nonstop to Atlanta and one to Birmingham and TWA had two to LaGuardia; no other nonstops reached beyond Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, Louisville and Pittsburgh. (Westward nonstops didn't reach beyond St. Louis until 1967; TWA started a JFK-IND-LAX 707 that year.) The first jets were TWA 880s in 1961. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, USAir (later [[US Airways]]) had a secondary hub in Indianapolis with non-stop jets to the West Coast, East Coast and Florida and turboprop flights to cities around the [[Midwest]]. USAir peaked at 146 daily departures (including its prop affiliates), with 49% of all seats. USAir ended the hub in the late 1990s. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Indianapolis was a hub for then locally based [[ATA Airlines]] and its regional affiliate, [[Chicago Express Airlines|Chicago Express]]/[[ATA Connection]]. After that airline entered [[Chapter 11|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] in late 2004, operations at IND were cut, then eliminated in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=ATA Expects to Stop Flights From Its Hometown in January |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/business/02air.html?ref=ataairlines|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 2, 2005}}</ref>

ATA's demise gave [[Northwest Airlines]] an opportunity to expand operations, making Indianapolis a focus city with mainline flights to the West Coast, East Coast, and the South. Northwest was later acquired by [[Delta Air Lines]] in late 2008.

In 1994, [[BAA plc|BAA]] was awarded a 10-year contract to manage the Indianapolis International Airport. The contract was extended three years but was later cut a year short at the request of the BAA. Private management ended on December 31, 2007 and control reverted to IAA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com/PressRoom/MediaReleases/detail.aspx?art_lKey=55|title=Indianapolis International Airport: Error|accessdate=4 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511215606/http://www.indianapolisairport.com/PressRoom/MediaReleases/detail.aspx?art_lKey=55|archivedate=11 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/icao/en/atb/epm/CaseStudy_USA.pdf|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042000/http://www.icao.int/icao/en/atb/epm/CaseStudy_USA.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

A new {{convert|1.2|e6sqft|m2|adj=on}} midfield passenger terminal, which cost $1.1 billion, opened in 2008 between the airport's two parallel runways, southwest of the previous terminal and the crosswind runway. A new FAA Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) building, second tallest in the United States, opened in April 2006, the first component of the long-planned midfield complex. The Weir Cook Terminal itself opened for arriving flights on the evening of November 11, 2008, and for departures the following morning. [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum|HOK]] was its master designer, with AeroDesign Group (a joint venture among CSO Architects, SchenkelShultz Architecture and ARCHonsortium) serving as architect of record.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
[[File:CHW Cook terminal from Civic Plaza.JPG|thumb|Civic Plaza]]
The current terminal opened in 2008 and is named in honor of Col. Harvey Weir Cook. It has room for 44 domestic gates and 2 international gates (which can also function as domestic gates). Not all gate positions were used upon opening of the facility, to allow for future expansion by the airlines. The two gate concourse structures were built to allow for future expansion on their southwestern ends.

The new terminal allows international arrivals to go through customs in the main passenger terminal; these passengers used to disembark in a separate building. Passengers arriving at gates A4 and A5 go to the U.S. Customs and Federal Inspection Station on the arrivals level via a dedicated and secured stairway, escalator, or elevator. After clearing customs, they exit into the south end of the main terminal's domestic baggage claim area.

The A concourse has a Delta [[Sky Club]], the first airline lounge at Indianapolis International Airport since USAir closed its hub. The lounge opened on November 15, 2010.

===Ground transportation===
Eight rental car operations and the Ground Transportation Center (where information about limousine, shuttle bus, hotel courtesy vehicles and other transportation services such as [[IndyGo]] bus service can be obtained) are located on the first floor of the attached parking garage. All pick-ups and drop-offs of rental vehicles also occur here, eliminating the need for shuttling customers to and from individual companies' remote processing facilities. The five-floor parking garage covers {{convert|11|acre|ha}} on each of its levels. It features a light-filled center atrium complete with a piece of suspended artwork and contains moving sidewalks to speed pedestrians into and out of the terminal building itself.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indianapolis International Airport – Community Days brochure, October 11–12, 2008|date=August 4, 2008|url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com/admin/uploads/224/08.04.08CommunityDays.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110349/http://www.indianapolisairport.com/admin/uploads/224/08.04.08CommunityDays.pdf|archivedate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>

===Based aircraft===
In January 2019, there were 41 aircraft based at this airport: 4 single-engine aircraft, 9 multi-engine aircraft, 27 jets, and 1 helicopter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://basedaircraft.com/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f|title=National Based Aircraft Inventory – Login|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104191132/https://www.basedaircraft.com/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f|archive-date=4 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
'''Indianapolis Municipal Airport''' opened in 1931. In 1944, it was renamed '''Weir Cook Municipal Airport''', after [[US Army Air Forces]] Col. [[Harvey Weir Cook]] of [[Wilkinson, Indiana]], who became a [[flying ace]] during World War I with seven victories and died flying a [[P-39]] over [[New Caledonia]] in World War II.

Since 1962, the airport has been owned and operated by the [[Indianapolis Airport Authority]] (IAA), an eight-member board with members appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis and other officials from Marion, [[Hendricks County, Indiana|Hendricks]] and [[Hamilton County, Indiana|Hamilton]] counties in central Indiana. In 1976, the board renamed the airport Indianapolis International Airport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2008, the board named the new main passenger facility the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal and the new entrance road Col. H. Weir Cook Memorial Drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080718/BUSINESS/80718004 |title=Airport keeps name, but will honor Weir Cook |date=July 18, 2008 |publisher=6 News Indianapolis |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826191910/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080718%2FBUSINESS%2F80718004 |archivedate=August 26, 2012 }}</ref>

From 1957 to 2008, the passenger terminal was on the east side of the airfield off High School Road. This now-demolished facility was renovated and expanded many times, notably in 1968 (Concourses A & B), 1972 (Concourse D) and 1987 (Concourse C and the attached Parking Garage). This complex, along with the International Arrivals Terminal (opened in 1976) on the north side of the airfield (off Pierson Drive), was replaced by the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal on November 12, 2008. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The April 1957 OAG shows 82 weekday departures: 24 Eastern, 22 TWA, 15 Delta, 11 American, 9 Lake Central and 1 Ozark. Eastern had a nonstop to Atlanta and one to Birmingham and TWA had two to LaGuardia; no other nonstops reached beyond Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, Louisville and Pittsburgh. (Westward nonstops didn't reach beyond St. Louis until 1967; TWA started a JFK-IND-LAX 707 that year.) The first jets were TWA 880s in 1961. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, USAir (later [[US Airways]]) had a secondary hub in Indianapolis with non-stop jets to the West Coast, East Coast and Florida and turboprop flights to cities around the [[Midwest]]. USAir peaked at 146 daily departures (including its prop affiliates), with 49% of all seats. USAir ended the hub in the late 1990s. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Indianapolis was a hub for then locally based [[ATA Airlines]] and its regional affiliate, [[Chicago Express Airlines|Chicago Express]]/[[ATA Connection]]. After that airline entered [[Chapter 11|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] in late 2004, operations at IND were cut, then eliminated in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=ATA Expects to Stop Flights From Its Hometown in January |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/business/02air.html?ref=ataairlines|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 2, 2005}}</ref>

ATA's demise gave [[Northwest Airlines]] an opportunity to expand operations, making Indianapolis a focus city with mainline flights to the West Coast, East Coast, and the South. Northwest was later acquired by [[Delta Air Lines]] in late 2008.

In 1994, [[BAA plc|BAA]] was awarded a 10-year contract to manage the Indianapolis International Airport. The contract was extended three years but was later cut a year short at the request of the BAA. Private management ended on December 31, 2007 and control reverted to IAA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com/PressRoom/MediaReleases/detail.aspx?art_lKey=55|title=Indianapolis International Airport: Error|accessdate=4 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511215606/http://www.indianapolisairport.com/PressRoom/MediaReleases/detail.aspx?art_lKey=55|archivedate=11 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/icao/en/atb/epm/CaseStudy_USA.pdf|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042000/http://www.icao.int/icao/en/atb/epm/CaseStudy_USA.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

A new {{convert|1.2|e6sqft|m2|adj=on}} midfield passenger terminal, which cost $1.1 billion, opened in 2008 between the airport's two parallel runways, southwest of the previous terminal and the crosswind runway. A new FAA Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) building, second tallest in the United States, opened in April 2006, the first component of the long-planned midfield complex. The Weir Cook Terminal itself opened for arriving flights on the evening of November 11, 2008, and for departures the following morning. [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum|HOK]] was its master designer, with AeroDesign Group (a joint venture among CSO Architects, SchenkelShultz Architecture and ARCHonsortium) serving as architect of record. Aviation Capital Management (Indianapolis), a subsidiary of [[BSA LifeStructures]], was the airport's program manager.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
[[File:CHW Cook terminal from Civic Plaza.JPG|thumb|Civic Plaza]]
The current terminal opened in 2008 and is named in honor of Col. Harvey Weir Cook. It has room for 44 domestic gates and 2 international gates (which can also function as domestic gates). Not all gate positions were used upon opening of the facility, to allow for future expansion by the airlines. The two gate concourse structures were built to allow for future expansion on their southwestern ends.

The new terminal allows international arrivals to go through customs in the main passenger terminal; these passengers used to disembark in a separate building. Passengers arriving at gates A4 and A5 go to the U.S. Customs and Federal Inspection Station on the arrivals level via a dedicated and secured stairway, escalator, or elevator. After clearing customs, they exit into the south end of the main terminal's domestic baggage claim area.

The A concourse has a Delta [[Sky Club]], the first airline lounge at Indianapolis International Airport since USAir closed its hub. The lounge opened on November 15, 2010.

===Ground transportation===
Eight rental car operations and the Ground Transportation Center (where information about limousine, shuttle bus, hotel courtesy vehicles and other transportation services such as [[IndyGo]] bus service can be obtained) are located on the first floor of the attached parking garage. All pick-ups and drop-offs of rental vehicles also occur here, eliminating the need for shuttling customers to and from individual companies' remote processing facilities. The five-floor parking garage covers {{convert|11|acre|ha}} on each of its levels. It features a light-filled center atrium complete with a piece of suspended artwork and contains moving sidewalks to speed pedestrians into and out of the terminal building itself.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indianapolis International Airport – Community Days brochure, October 11–12, 2008|date=August 4, 2008|url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com/admin/uploads/224/08.04.08CommunityDays.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110349/http://www.indianapolisairport.com/admin/uploads/224/08.04.08CommunityDays.pdf|archivedate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>

===Based aircraft===
In January 2019, there were 41 aircraft based at this airport: 4 single-engine aircraft, 9 multi-engine aircraft, 27 jets, and 1 helicopter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://basedaircraft.com/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f|title=National Based Aircraft Inventory – Login|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104191132/https://www.basedaircraft.com/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f|archive-date=4 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Telomere caps.gif|thumb|right|300px|Human [[chromosome]]s (grey) capped by telomeres (white)]]
A '''telomere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|l|ə|m|ɪ|ə|ɹ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|l|ə|m|ɪ|ə|ɹ}}) is a region of repetitive [[nucleotide]] sequences at each end of a [[chromosome]], which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes. Its name is derived from the Greek nouns telos (''τέλος'') \"end\" and merοs (''μέρος'', root: ''μερ-'') \"part\". For [[vertebrate]]s, the sequence of nucleotides in telomeres is [[Adenine|A]][[Guanine|GGG]][[Thymine|TT]],<ref>Biochemistry, Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews, 6th edition, Richard Harvey, 2014, page 407.</ref> with the [[DNA#Base pairing|complementary DNA strand]] being TCCCAA, with a single-stranded TTAGGG [[Sticky and blunt ends#Overhangs and sticky ends|overhang]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Witzany G | year = 2008 | title = The viral origins of telomeres, telomerases and their important role in eukaryogenesis and genome maintenance | url = | journal = Biosemiotics | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 191–206 | doi=10.1007/s12304-008-9018-0}}</ref> This sequence of TTAGGG is repeated approximately 2,500 times in humans.<ref>Sadava, D., Hillis, D., Heller, C., & Berenbaum, M.

During [[DNA replication|chromosome replication]], the [[enzyme]]s that duplicate DNA cannot continue their duplication all the way to the end of a chromosome, so in each duplication the end of the chromosome is shortened (this is because the synthesis of [[Okazaki fragments]] requires [[Primer (molecular biology)|RNA primers]] attaching ahead on the lagging strand). The telomeres are disposable buffers at the ends of chromosomes which are truncated during cell division; their presence protects the [[gene]]s before them on the chromosome from being truncated instead. The telomeres themselves are protected by a complex of [[shelterin]] proteins, as well as by the RNA that telomeric DNA encodes ([[TERRA (biology)|TERRA]]).

Over time, due to each cell division, the telomere ends become shorter.<ref>Passarge, Eberhard.  ''Color atlas of genetics'', 2007.</ref> They are replenished by an enzyme, [[telomerase reverse transcriptase]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TERT#normalfunction|title=TERT gene |website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref>

==Discovery==
In the early 1970s, Russian theorist [[Alexei Olovnikov]] first recognized that chromosomes could not completely replicate their ends.

[[File:Telomere.png|left|thumb|Telomeres are found at the termini of chromosomes. The end of a telomere inserts back into the main body of the telomere to form a T-loop]]
In most prokaryotes, chromosomes are circular and thus do not have ends to suffer premature [[DNA replication|replication]] termination. A small fraction of [[bacteria]]l chromosomes (such as those in ''[[Streptomyces]]'', ''[[Agrobacterium]]'', and ''[[Borrelia]]'') are linear and possess telomeres, which are very different from those of the eukaryotic chromosomes in structure and functions. The known structures of bacterial telomeres take the form of [[proteins]] bound to the ends of linear chromosomes, or hairpin loops of single-stranded DNA at the ends of the linear chromosomes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/~smaloy/MicrobialGenetics/topics/chroms-genes-prots/chromosomes.html |title=Bacterial Chromosome Structure |last=Maloy|first=Stanley | name-list-format = vanc |date=July 12, 2002 |access-date=2008-06-22}}</ref>

While replicating DNA, the eukaryotic [[DNA replication]] enzymes (the [[DNA polymerase]] protein complex) cannot replicate the sequences present at the ends of the chromosomes (or more precisely the [[chromatid]] fibres). Hence, these sequences and the information they carry may get lost. This is the reason telomeres are so important in context of successful cell division: They \"cap\" the end-sequences and themselves get lost in the process of DNA replication. But the cell has an enzyme called telomerase, which carries out the task of adding repetitive nucleotide sequences to the ends of the DNA. Telomerase \"replenishes\" the telomere \"cap.\" In most multicellular eukaryotic organisms, telomerase is active only in [[germ cell]]s, some types of [[stem cell]]s such as [[embryonic stem cells]], and certain [[white blood cell]]s. Telomerase can be reactivated and telomeres reset back to an embryonic state by somatic cell nuclear transfer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lanza RP, Cibelli JB, Blackwell C, Cristofalo VJ, Francis MK, Baerlocher GM, Mak J, Schertzer M, Chavez EA, Sawyer N, Lansdorp PM, West MD | display-authors = 6 | title = Extension of cell life-span and telomere length in animals cloned from senescent somatic cells | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5466 | pages = 665–9 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10784448 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5466.665 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288..665L | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e4fed29bebe817a10fceb103b9b39c262852edf4 }}</ref> The steady shortening of telomeres with each replication in somatic (body) cells may have a role in [[senescence]] and in the prevention of [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shay JW, Wright WE | title = Senescence and immortalization: role of telomeres and telomerase | journal = Carcinogenesis | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 867–74 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15471900 | doi = 10.1093/carcin/bgh296 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wai LK | title = Telomeres, telomerase, and tumorigenesis--a review | journal = MedGenMed | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 19 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15520642 | pmc = 1435592 }}</ref> This is because the telomeres act as a sort of time-delay \"fuse\", eventually running out after a certain number of cell divisions and resulting in the eventual loss of vital genetic information from the cell's chromosome with future divisions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Greider CW | title = Telomeres, telomerase and senescence | journal = BioEssays | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 363–9 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2241933 | doi = 10.1002/bies.950120803 }}</ref>

=== Role in the cell cycle ===
{{Main|Role of telomeres in the cell cycle}}
Telomere shortening in humans can induce replicative senescence, which blocks cell division. This mechanism appears to prevent genomic instability and development of cancer in human aged cells by limiting the number of cell divisions. However, shortened telomeres impair immune function that might also increase cancer susceptibility.<ref name=\"10.1002/ajhb.21127\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eisenberg DT | title = An evolutionary review of human telomere biology: the thrifty telomere hypothesis and notes on potential adaptive paternal effects | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–67 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21319244 | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.21127 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1b4e9742b2fe7c6ee86baa8ea60df570a69440a }}</ref> If telomeres become too short, they have the potential to unfold from their presumed closed structure. The cell may detect this uncapping as DNA damage and then either stop growing, enter cellular old age ([[Cellular senescence|senescence]]), or begin programmed cell self-destruction ([[apoptosis]]) depending on the cell's genetic background ([[p53]] status). Uncapped telomeres also result in chromosomal fusions. Since this damage cannot be repaired in normal somatic cells, the cell may even go into apoptosis. Many aging-related diseases are linked to shortened telomeres. Organs deteriorate as more and more of their cells die off or enter cellular senescence.

[[File:Telosome.png|thumb|300x300px|Shelterin co-ordinates the T-loop formation of telomeres]]

===Shelterin===
{{Main|Shelterin}}
At the very distal end of the telomere is a 300 base pair single-stranded portion, which forms the T-loop. This loop is analogous to a knot, which stabilizes the telomere, preventing the telomere ends from being recognized as break points by the DNA repair machinery. Should non-homologous end joining occur at the telomeric ends, chromosomal fusion will result. The T-loop is held together by several proteins, the most notable ones being TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN1, and TIN2, collectively referred to as the shelterin complex. In humans, the shelterin complex consists of six proteins identified as TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, POT1, TPP1, and RAP1.<ref name=\"pmid20569239\" />

==Shortening==

Telomeres shorten in part because of the ''end replication problem'' that is exhibited during DNA replication in [[eukaryote]]s only. Because DNA replication does not begin at either end of the DNA strand, but starts in the center, and considering that all known [[DNA polymerase]]s read the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction, one finds a leading and a lagging strand on the DNA molecule being replicated.

On the leading strand, DNA polymerase can make a complementary DNA strand without any difficulty because it reads the template strand from 3' to 5'. However, there is a problem going in the other direction on the lagging strand. To counter this, short sequences of [[RNA]] acting as [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]]s attach to the lagging strand a short distance ahead of where the initiation site was. The DNA polymerase can start replication at that point and go to the end of the initiation site. This causes the formation of [[Okazaki fragment]]s. More RNA primers attach further on the DNA strand and DNA polymerase comes along and continues to make a new DNA strand.[[File:Dnareplication.svg|thumb|250 px|Lagging strand during DNA replication]]Eventually, the last RNA primer attaches, and DNA polymerase, RNA nuclease, and [[DNA ligase]] come along to convert the RNA (of the primers) to DNA and to seal the gaps in between the Okazaki fragments. But, in order to change RNA to DNA, there must be another DNA strand in front of the RNA primer. This happens at all the sites of the lagging strand, but it does not happen at the end where the last RNA primer is attached. Ultimately, that RNA is destroyed by enzymes that degrade any RNA left on the DNA. Thus, a section of the telomere is lost during each cycle of replication at the 5' end of the lagging strand's daughter.

However, [[in vitro|test-tube]] studies have shown that telomeres are highly susceptible to [[oxidative stress]]. There is evidence that oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage is an important determinant of telomere shortening.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Richter T, von Zglinicki T | title = A continuous correlation between oxidative stress and telomere shortening in fibroblasts | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 42 | issue = 11 | pages = 1039–42 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17869047 | doi = 10.1016/j.exger.2007.08.005 }}</ref> Telomere shortening due to free radicals explains the difference between the estimated loss per division because of the end-replication problem (c. 20 bp) and actual telomere shortening rates (50–100 bp), and has a greater absolute impact on telomere length than shortening caused by the end-replication problem. Population-based studies have also indicated an interaction between anti-oxidant intake and telomere length. In the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project (LIBCSP), authors found a moderate increase in breast cancer risk among women with the shortest telomeres and lower dietary intake of beta carotene, vitamin C or E.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shen J, Gammon MD, Terry MB, Wang Q, Bradshaw P, Teitelbaum SL, Neugut AI, Santella RM | display-authors = 6 | title = Telomere length, oxidative damage, antioxidants and breast cancer risk | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 124 | issue = 7 | pages = 1637–43 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19089916 | pmc = 2727686 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.24105 }}</ref> These results <ref name=\"Mathur MB 2016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathur MB, Epel E, Kind S, Desai M, Parks CG, Sandler DP, Khazeni N | title = Perceived stress and telomere length: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and methodologic considerations for advancing the field | journal = Brain, Behavior, and Immunity | volume = 54 | pages = 158–169 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26853993 | pmc = 5590630 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbi.2016.02.002 }}</ref> suggest that cancer risk due to telomere shortening may interact with other mechanisms of DNA damage, specifically oxidative stress.

The age of a father plays a role in the length of a child’s telomeres, which has evolutionary implications. Although leukocyte telomeres shorten with age, sperm telomeres lengthen with age. Shorter telomeres are theorized to impose lower energy costs (due to less replication) but also have immune system-related and other aging- and disease-related costs, so the effect of paternal age on telomere length might be an adaptation to increase the chances that the child will be fit for the environment they’re born into.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eisenberg DT | title = An evolutionary review of human telomere biology: the thrifty telomere hypothesis and notes on potential adaptive paternal effects | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–67 | date = 17 December 2010 | pmid = 21319244 | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.21127 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1b4e9742b2fe7c6ee86baa8ea60df570a69440a }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aston KI, Hunt SC, Susser E, Kimura M, Factor-Litvak P, Carrell D, Aviv A | title = Divergence of sperm and leukocyte age-dependent telomere dynamics: implications for male-driven evolution of telomere length in humans | journal = Molecular Human Reproduction | volume = 18 | issue = 11 | pages = 517–22 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22782639 | pmc = 3480822 | doi = 10.1093/molehr/gas028 | url = https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/18/11/517/1020026 }}</ref>

=== Potential effect of psychological stress ===

[[Meta-analysis|Meta-analyses]] found that increased perceived [[psychological stress]] was associated with a small decrease in telomere length--but that these associations attenuate to no significant association when accounting for [[publication bias]]. It is also stated, that the literature concerning telomeres as integrative biomarkers of exposure to stress and adversity is dominated by cross-sectional and correlational studies which makes causal interpretation problematic. <ref name=\"Mathur MB 2016\"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pepper GV, Bateson M, Nettle D | title = Telomeres as integrative markers of exposure to stress and adversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Royal Society Open Science | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = 180744 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30225068 | pmc = 6124068 | doi = 10.1098/rsos.180744 | bibcode = 2018RSOS....580744P }}</ref>

It is becoming apparent that reversing shortening of telomeres through temporary activation of telomerase may be a potent means to slow aging. The reason that this would extend human life is because it would extend the Hayflick limit. Three routes have been proposed to reverse telomere shortening: drugs, gene therapy, or metabolic suppression, so-called, torpor/hibernation. So far these ideas have not been proven in humans, but it has been demonstrated that telomere shortening is reversed in hibernation and aging is slowed (Turbill, ''et al.'' 2012 & 2013) and that hibernation prolongs life-span (Lyman ''et al.'' 1981).

In 2003, scientists observed that the telomeres of [[Leach's storm-petrel]] (''Oceanodroma leucorhoa'') seem to lengthen with chronological age, the first observed instance of such behaviour of telomeres.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakagawa S, Gemmell NJ, Burke T | title = Measuring vertebrate telomeres: applications and limitations | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = 2523–33 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15315667 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02291.x | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/353/1/burket16.pdf }}</ref> In 2006, Juola ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Juola FA, Haussmann MF, Dearborn DC, Vleck CM | title = Telomere shortening in a long-lived marine bird: cross-sectional analysis and test of an aging tool. | journal = [[Auk (journal)|The Auk]] | date = July 2006 | volume = 123 | issue = 3 | pages = 775–83 |doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2006)123[775:TSIALM]2.0.CO;2 |jstor=4090554 }}</ref> reported that in another unrelated, long-lived seabird species, the [[great frigatebird]] (''Fregata minor''), telomere length did decrease until at least c. 40 years of age (i.e. probably over the entire lifespan), but the speed of decrease slowed down massively with increasing ages, and that rates of telomere length decrease varied strongly between individual birds. They concluded that in this species (and probably in [[frigatebird]]s and their relatives in general), telomere length could not be used to determine a bird's age sufficiently well. Thus, it seems that there is much more variation in the behavior of telomere length than initially believed.

Furthermore, Gomes ''et al.'' found, in a study of the comparative biology of mammalian telomeres, that telomere length of different mammalian species correlates inversely, rather than directly, with lifespan, and they concluded that the contribution of telomere length to lifespan remains controversial.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gomes NM, Ryder OA, Houck ML, Charter SJ, Walker W, Forsyth NR, Austad SN, Venditti C, Pagel M, Shay JW, Wright WE | display-authors = 6 | title = Comparative biology of mammalian telomeres: hypotheses on ancestral states and the roles of telomeres in longevity determination | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 761–8 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21518243 | pmc = 3387546 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2011.00718.x }}</ref> Harris ''et al.'' found little evidence that, in humans, telomere length is a significant biomarker of normal aging with respect to important cognitive and physical abilities.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris SE, Martin-Ruiz C, von Zglinicki T, Starr JM, Deary IJ | title = Telomere length and aging biomarkers in 70-year-olds: the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 1486.e3–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 21194798 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.11.013 }}</ref> Gilley and Blackburn tested whether cellular senescence in [[paramecium]] is caused by telomere shortening, and found that telomeres were not shortened during senescence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilley D, Blackburn EH | title = Lack of telomere shortening during senescence in Paramecium | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1955–8 | date = March 1994 | pmid = 8127914 | pmc = 43283 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.5.1955 | bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.1955G }}</ref>

==Ectothermic telomeres==

Most research on telomere length and regulation, and its relationship to cancer and ageing, has been performed on mammals, especially humans, which have little or no somatic telomerase production. [[Ectotherm]]s are significantly more likely than endotherms to have variation in somatic telomerase expression. For instance, in many fish, telomerase occurs throughout the body (and associated with this, telomere length is roughly the same across all its tissue). Studies on ectotherms, and other non-mammalian organisms, show that there’s no single universal model of telomere erosion; rather, there is wide variation in relevant dynamics across Metazoa, and even within smaller taxonomic groups these patterns appear diverse. Due to the different reproductive timelines of some ectotherms, selection on disease is relevant for a much larger fraction of these creatures’ lives than it is for mammals, so early- and late-life telomere length, and their possible links to cancer, seem especially important in these species from a [[life history theory]] point of view.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olsson M, Wapstra E, Friesen C | title = Ectothermic telomeres: it's time they came in from the cold | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

A '''telomere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|l|ə|m|ɪ|ə|ɹ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|l|ə|m|ɪ|ə|ɹ}}) is a region of repetitive [[nucleotide]] sequences at each end of a [[chromosome]], which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes.

During [[DNA replication|chromosome replication]], the [[enzyme]]s that duplicate DNA cannot continue their duplication all the way to the end of a chromosome, so in each duplication the end of the chromosome is shortened (this is because the synthesis of [[Okazaki fragments]] requires [[Primer (molecular biology)|RNA primers]] attaching ahead on the lagging strand). The telomeres are disposable buffers at the ends of chromosomes which are truncated during cell division; their presence protects the [[gene]]s before them on the chromosome from being truncated instead. The telomeres themselves are protected by a complex of [[shelterin]] proteins, as well as by the RNA that telomeric DNA encodes ([[TERRA (biology)|TERRA]]).

Over time, due to each cell division, the telomere ends become shorter.<ref>Passarge, Eberhard.  ''Color atlas of genetics'', 2007.</ref> They are replenished by an enzyme, [[telomerase reverse transcriptase]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TERT#normalfunction|title=TERT gene |website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref>

==Discovery==
In the early 1970s, Russian theorist [[Alexei Olovnikov]] first recognized that chromosomes could not completely replicate their ends. Building on this, and to accommodate [[Leonard Hayflick]]'s idea of limited [[somatic cell]] division, Olovnikov suggested that DNA sequences are lost every time a cell replicates until the loss reaches a critical level, at which point cell division ends.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mender I, Shay JW | title = Telomerase Repeated Amplification Protocol (TRAP) | journal = Bio-Protocol | volume = 5 | issue = 22 | pages = e1657 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 27182535 | pmc = 4863463 | doi = 10.21769/bioprotoc.1657 }}</ref>

In 1975–1977, [[Elizabeth Blackburn]], working as a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University with [[Joseph G. Gall]], discovered the unusual nature of telomeres, with their simple repeated DNA sequences composing chromosome ends.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackburn EH, Gall JG | title = A tandemly repeated sequence at the termini of the extrachromosomal ribosomal RNA genes in Tetrahymena | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 120 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–53 | date = March 1978 | pmid = 642006 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(78)90294-2 }}</ref> Blackburn, [[Carol Greider]], and [[Jack Szostak]] were awarded the [[List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine#2001–current|2009]] [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/press.html |title=Elizabeth H.

In 1983, [[Barbara McClintock]], a distinguished American cytogeneticist and the first woman to receive an unshared [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine, received the Nobel Prize for observing that the chromosomes lacking end parts became \"sticky\" and hypothesized the existence of a special structure at the chromosome tip that would maintain chromosome stability.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbara McClintock: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1983|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1983/|publisher=Nobel Foundation|date=1983|access-date=10 March 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Telomere.png|left|thumb|Telomeres are found at the termini of chromosomes. The end of a telomere inserts back into the main body of the telomere to form a T-loop]]
In most prokaryotes, chromosomes are circular and thus do not have ends to suffer premature [[DNA replication|replication]] termination. A small fraction of [[bacteria]]l chromosomes (such as those in ''[[Streptomyces]]'', ''[[Agrobacterium]]'', and ''[[Borrelia]]'') are linear and possess telomeres, which are very different from those of the eukaryotic chromosomes in structure and functions. The known structures of bacterial telomeres take the form of [[proteins]] bound to the ends of linear chromosomes, or hairpin loops of single-stranded DNA at the ends of the linear chromosomes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/~smaloy/MicrobialGenetics/topics/chroms-genes-prots/chromosomes.html |title=Bacterial Chromosome Structure |last=Maloy|first=Stanley | name-list-format = vanc |date=July 12, 2002 |access-date=2008-06-22}}</ref>

While replicating DNA, the eukaryotic [[DNA replication]] enzymes (the [[DNA polymerase]] protein complex) cannot replicate the sequences present at the ends of the chromosomes (or more precisely the [[chromatid]] fibres). Hence, these sequences and the information they carry may get lost. This is the reason telomeres are so important in context of successful cell division: They \"cap\" the end-sequences and themselves get lost in the process of DNA replication. But the cell has an enzyme called telomerase, which carries out the task of adding repetitive nucleotide sequences to the ends of the DNA. Telomerase \"replenishes\" the telomere \"cap.\" In most multicellular eukaryotic organisms, telomerase is active only in [[germ cell]]s, some types of [[stem cell]]s such as [[embryonic stem cells]], and certain [[white blood cell]]s. Telomerase can be reactivated and telomeres reset back to an embryonic state by somatic cell nuclear transfer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lanza RP, Cibelli JB, Blackwell C, Cristofalo VJ, Francis MK, Baerlocher GM, Mak J, Schertzer M, Chavez EA, Sawyer N, Lansdorp PM, West MD | display-authors = 6 | title = Extension of cell life-span and telomere length in animals cloned from senescent somatic cells | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5466 | pages = 665–9 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10784448 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5466.665 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288..665L | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e4fed29bebe817a10fceb103b9b39c262852edf4 }}</ref> The steady shortening of telomeres with each replication in somatic (body) cells may have a role in [[senescence]] and in the prevention of [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shay JW, Wright WE | title = Senescence and immortalization: role of telomeres and telomerase | journal = Carcinogenesis | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 867–74 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15471900 | doi = 10.1093/carcin/bgh296 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wai LK | title = Telomeres, telomerase, and tumorigenesis--a review | journal = MedGenMed | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 19 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15520642 | pmc = 1435592 }}</ref> This is because the telomeres act as a sort of time-delay \"fuse\", eventually running out after a certain number of cell divisions and resulting in the eventual loss of vital genetic information from the cell's chromosome with future divisions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Greider CW | title = Telomeres, telomerase and senescence | journal = BioEssays | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 363–9 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2241933 | doi = 10.1002/bies.950120803 }}</ref>

=== Role in the cell cycle ===
{{Main|Role of telomeres in the cell cycle}}
Telomere shortening in humans can induce replicative senescence, which blocks cell division. This mechanism appears to prevent genomic instability and development of cancer in human aged cells by limiting the number of cell divisions. However, shortened telomeres impair immune function that might also increase cancer susceptibility.<ref name=\"10.1002/ajhb.21127\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eisenberg DT | title = An evolutionary review of human telomere biology: the thrifty telomere hypothesis and notes on potential adaptive paternal effects | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–67 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21319244 | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.21127 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1b4e9742b2fe7c6ee86baa8ea60df570a69440a }}</ref> If telomeres become too short, they have the potential to unfold from their presumed closed structure. The cell may detect this uncapping as DNA damage and then either stop growing, enter cellular old age ([[Cellular senescence|senescence]]), or begin programmed cell self-destruction ([[apoptosis]]) depending on the cell's genetic background ([[p53]] status). Uncapped telomeres also result in chromosomal fusions. Since this damage cannot be repaired in normal somatic cells, the cell may even go into apoptosis. Many aging-related diseases are linked to shortened telomeres. Organs deteriorate as more and more of their cells die off or enter cellular senescence.

[[File:Telosome.png|thumb|300x300px|Shelterin co-ordinates the T-loop formation of telomeres]]

===Shelterin===
{{Main|Shelterin}}
At the very distal end of the telomere is a 300 base pair single-stranded portion, which forms the T-loop. This loop is analogous to a knot, which stabilizes the telomere, preventing the telomere ends from being recognized as break points by the DNA repair machinery. Should non-homologous end joining occur at the telomeric ends, chromosomal fusion will result. The T-loop is held together by several proteins, the most notable ones being TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN1, and TIN2, collectively referred to as the shelterin complex. In humans, the shelterin complex consists of six proteins identified as TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, POT1, TPP1, and RAP1.<ref name=\"pmid20569239\" />

==Shortening==

Telomeres shorten in part because of the ''end replication problem'' that is exhibited during DNA replication in [[eukaryote]]s only. Because DNA replication does not begin at either end of the DNA strand, but starts in the center, and considering that all known [[DNA polymerase]]s read the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction, one finds a leading and a lagging strand on the DNA molecule being replicated.

On the leading strand, DNA polymerase can make a complementary DNA strand without any difficulty because it reads the template strand from 3' to 5'. However, there is a problem going in the other direction on the lagging strand. To counter this, short sequences of [[RNA]] acting as [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]]s attach to the lagging strand a short distance ahead of where the initiation site was. The DNA polymerase can start replication at that point and go to the end of the initiation site. This causes the formation of [[Okazaki fragment]]s. More RNA primers attach further on the DNA strand and DNA polymerase comes along and continues to make a new DNA strand.[[File:Dnareplication.svg|thumb|250 px|Lagging strand during DNA replication]]Eventually, the last RNA primer attaches, and DNA polymerase, RNA nuclease, and [[DNA ligase]] come along to convert the RNA (of the primers) to DNA and to seal the gaps in between the Okazaki fragments. But, in order to change RNA to DNA, there must be another DNA strand in front of the RNA primer. This happens at all the sites of the lagging strand, but it does not happen at the end where the last RNA primer is attached. Ultimately, that RNA is destroyed by enzymes that degrade any RNA left on the DNA. Thus, a section of the telomere is lost during each cycle of replication at the 5' end of the lagging strand's daughter.

However, [[in vitro|test-tube]] studies have shown that telomeres are highly susceptible to [[oxidative stress]]. There is evidence that oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage is an important determinant of telomere shortening.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Richter T, von Zglinicki T | title = A continuous correlation between oxidative stress and telomere shortening in fibroblasts | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 42 | issue = 11 | pages = 1039–42 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17869047 | doi = 10.1016/j.exger.2007.08.005 }}</ref> Telomere shortening due to free radicals explains the difference between the estimated loss per division because of the end-replication problem (c. 20 bp) and actual telomere shortening rates (50–100 bp), and has a greater absolute impact on telomere length than shortening caused by the end-replication problem. Population-based studies have also indicated an interaction between anti-oxidant intake and telomere length.

The age of a father plays a role in the length of a child’s telomeres, which has evolutionary implications. Although leukocyte telomeres shorten with age, sperm telomeres lengthen with age. Shorter telomeres are theorized to impose lower energy costs (due to less replication) but also have immune system-related and other aging- and disease-related costs, so the effect of paternal age on telomere length might be an adaptation to increase the chances that the child will be fit for the environment they’re born into.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eisenberg DT | title = An evolutionary review of human telomere biology: the thrifty telomere hypothesis and notes on potential adaptive paternal effects | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–67 | date = 17 December 2010 | pmid = 21319244 | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.21127 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1b4e9742b2fe7c6ee86baa8ea60df570a69440a }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aston KI, Hunt SC, Susser E, Kimura M, Factor-Litvak P, Carrell D, Aviv A | title = Divergence of sperm and leukocyte age-dependent telomere dynamics: implications for male-driven evolution of telomere length in humans | journal = Molecular Human Reproduction | volume = 18 | issue = 11 | pages = 517–22 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22782639 | pmc = 3480822 | doi = 10.1093/molehr/gas028 | url = https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/18/11/517/1020026 }}</ref>

=== Potential effect of psychological stress ===

[[Meta-analysis|Meta-analyses]] found that increased perceived [[psychological stress]] was associated with a small decrease in telomere length--but that these associations attenuate to no significant association when accounting for [[publication bias]]. It is also stated, that the literature concerning telomeres as integrative biomarkers of exposure to stress and adversity is dominated by cross-sectional and correlational studies which makes causal interpretation problematic. <ref name=\"Mathur MB 2016\"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pepper GV, Bateson M, Nettle D | title = Telomeres as integrative markers of exposure to stress and adversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Royal Society Open Science | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = 180744 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30225068 | pmc = 6124068 | doi = 10.1098/rsos.180744 | bibcode = 2018RSOS....580744P }}</ref>

It is becoming apparent that reversing shortening of telomeres through temporary activation of telomerase may be a potent means to slow aging. The reason that this would extend human life is because it would extend the Hayflick limit. Three routes have been proposed to reverse telomere shortening: drugs, gene therapy, or metabolic suppression, so-called, torpor/hibernation. So far these ideas have not been proven in humans, but it has been demonstrated that telomere shortening is reversed in hibernation and aging is slowed (Turbill, et al. 2012 & 2013) and that hibernation prolongs life-span (Lyman et al. 1981).

Techniques to extend telomeres could be useful for [[tissue engineering]], because they might permit healthy, noncancerous mammalian cells to be cultured in amounts large enough to be engineering materials for biomedical repairs.

Two recent studies on long-lived [[seabird]]s demonstrate that the role of telomeres is far from being understood. In 2003, scientists observed that the telomeres of [[Leach's storm-petrel]] (''Oceanodroma leucorhoa'') seem to lengthen with chronological age, the first observed instance of such behaviour of telomeres.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakagawa S, Gemmell NJ, Burke T | title = Measuring vertebrate telomeres: applications and limitations | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = 2523–33 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15315667 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02291.x | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/353/1/burket16.pdf }}</ref> In 2006, Juola ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Juola FA, Haussmann MF, Dearborn DC, Vleck CM | title = Telomere shortening in a long-lived marine bird: cross-sectional analysis and test of an aging tool. | journal = [[Auk (journal)|The Auk]] | date = July 2006 | volume = 123 | issue = 3 | pages = 775–83 |doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2006)123[775:TSIALM]2.0.CO;2 |jstor=4090554 }}</ref> reported that in another unrelated, long-lived seabird species, the [[great frigatebird]] (''Fregata minor''), telomere length did decrease until at least c. 40 years of age (i.e. probably over the entire lifespan), but the speed of decrease slowed down massively with increasing ages, and that rates of telomere length decrease varied strongly between individual birds. They concluded that in this species (and probably in [[frigatebird]]s and their relatives in general), telomere length could not be used to determine a bird's age sufficiently well. Thus, it seems that there is much more variation in the behavior of telomere length than initially believed.

Furthermore, Gomes et al. found, in a study of the comparative biology of mammalian telomeres, that telomere length of different mammalian species correlates inversely, rather than directly, with lifespan, and they concluded that the contribution of telomere length to lifespan remains controversial.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gomes NM, Ryder OA, Houck ML, Charter SJ, Walker W, Forsyth NR, Austad SN, Venditti C, Pagel M, Shay JW, Wright WE | display-authors = 6 | title = Comparative biology of mammalian telomeres: hypotheses on ancestral states and the roles of telomeres in longevity determination | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 761–8 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21518243 | pmc = 3387546 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2011.00718.x }}</ref> Harris et al. found little evidence that, in humans, telomere length is a significant biomarker of normal aging with respect to important cognitive and physical abilities.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris SE, Martin-Ruiz C, von Zglinicki T, Starr JM, Deary IJ | title = Telomere length and aging biomarkers in 70-year-olds: the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 1486.e3–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 21194798 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.11.013 }}</ref> Gilley and Blackburn tested whether cellular senescence in [[paramecium]] is caused by telomere shortening, and found that telomeres were not shortened during senescence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilley D, Blackburn EH | title = Lack of telomere shortening during senescence in Paramecium | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1955–8 | date = March 1994 | pmid = 8127914 | pmc = 43283 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.5.1955 | bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.1955G }}</ref>

==Ectothermic telomeres==

Most research on telomere length and regulation, and its relationship to cancer and ageing, has been performed on mammals, especially humans, which have little or no somatic telomerase production. [[Ectotherm]]s are significantly more likely than endotherms to have variation in somatic telomerase expression. For instance, in many fish, telomerase occurs throughout the body (and associated with this, telomere length is roughly the same across all its tissue). Studies on ectotherms, and other non-mammalian organisms, show that there’s no single universal model of telomere erosion; rather, there is wide variation in relevant dynamics across Metazoa, and even within smaller taxonomic groups these patterns appear diverse. Due to the different reproductive timelines of some ectotherms, selection on disease is relevant for a much larger fraction of these creatures’ lives than it is for mammals, so early- and late-life telomere length, and their possible links to cancer, seem especially important in these species from a [[life history theory]] point of view.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olsson M, Wapstra E, Friesen C | title = Ectothermic telomeres: it's time they came in from the cold | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

'''Dr. Liara T'Soni''' is a fictional character in [[BioWare]]'s ''[[Mass Effect]]'' franchise, who serves as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]] (or \"squadmate\") in ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 3]]''. She is an asari, a [[non-binary gender]]ed sapient [[homeothermy|homeotherm]] species with a [[pansexuality|pansexual]]-[[romantic orientation|panromantic]] orientation and are naturally inclined towards biotics<ref name=\"Alien races\"/>, the ability to \"manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields through the use of electrical impulses from the brain\", allowing for telekinesis and other abilities.<ref name=\"Biotics\"/> Liara is noted for being the galactic community's foremost expert in the field of Prothean archaeology and technology, specifically evidence concerning the demise of the ancient Protheans, believed by the galactic community to be the pre-eminent civilization in the Milky Way galaxy until their sudden disappearance fifty thousands years before the events of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.

Liara is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] in the video games. Outside of the trilogy, Liara appears as the protagonist in the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' series, and the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', a comic series with individual issues on each of several ''Mass Effect 3'' squad mates prior to the Reaper invasion. Liara also has cameo appearances in ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', and in the animated feature film, ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]'', where she is voiced by [[Jamie Marchi]].

Liara has been received positively, with placements on several \"top character\" critic and fan lists, and is one of the more popular characters in the series, particularly for fan art and [[cosplay]] activities.<ref name=\"Cosplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/check-out-this-great-liara-mass-effect-cosplay/|title=Check out this great Liara Mass Effect cosplay|author=Jody Macgregor|date=September 2, 2018 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> She was the subject of some controversy in 2007 following the release of the original ''Mass Effect'', after certain media outlets reported allegations of obscenity in the sex scenes between Shepard and their squad mates, and at least one case of government scrutiny over Liara's intimate scene with a female Shepard. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' squadmates, has been released.

==Character overview==
{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"I think, especially in Mass Effect 1 before she started to evolve, that almost everything was a discovery but especially in her relationships. She was always the scientist and always absorbing and even though she was deeply emotional she was observant and very reactionary in the way she went about things. I felt that her eyes were always looking, her ears were always listening and she was very aware and almost child-like even though she was 106 years old.\"
 |source = — Ali Hillis, in an interview with ''The Gaming Liberty''<ref name=\"Interview1\"/>}}

Liara's species, the asari were the first to discover the Citadel and proposed the creation of a Council after they made first contact with the salarians.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> As part of the Council, they serve as its \"mediators and centrists\".<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> The asari have the largest economy of all the races.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Alien races\"/> The asari are perceived to have a \"[[Femininity|feminine]]\" appearance by non-asari standards. Most asari choose to use [[She (pronoun)|feminine third-person, singular personal pronouns]] as an efficient means of conversing with non-asari on terms they could understand.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> However, Liara has on at least one occasion responded to perceived [[gender bias]] and denied that she is a \"woman\", noting that her species has \"one\" gender and that the concept of [[gender binary|gender binarism]] is meaningless to the asari.<ref name=\"Gender\"/>

The asari are capable of procreating with any sentient life form, and can reproduce with any known sex, gender or species&mdash;their offspring are always asari, regardless of the species of their \"father\", which has led to in-universe claims of asari promiscuity.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Instead of trading cellular material directly like other biological organisms, asari reproduce by \"melding\": linking their nervous systems with their partner's using their biotic abilities and utilizing the electrical pattern of their partners nerve's to provide a template for half the DNA of their resulting child. <ref name=\"polygon lore\"/> Liara is the offspring of Matriarch Aethyta and Matriarch Benezia, and is \"one-quarter krogan\" on Aethyta's side. Matriarch Aethyta is first encountered in ''Mass Effect 2'' as a bartender in Illium, where Lara was based as an information broker. She later moves on to tend a bar at the Presidium in ''Mass Effect 3'', where she is revealed as Liara's other biological parent and had been spying on her all along. As a \"pureblood\", a term often used as a cruel insult for children born of two asari, Liara grew up being [[Social exclusion|socially stigmatized]] by asari society. If Shepard discusses her parentage in the original ''Mass Effect'', Liara would speculate that her parents were possibly embarrassed by the union as the asari believe that for them to improve themselves, they should mate with other species to gain new genetic properties.

Asari can live for over a thousand years<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>, and go through three stages of life: the Maiden stage, where they explore the world out of curiosity and restlessness, with many trying their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time; the Matron stage, where they begin to feel the desire to settle down to raise children; and finally the Matriarch stage, where they are often elevated as leaders of their communities, dispensing wisdom from centuries of life experience.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Their long lifespan makes them more comfortable with observation.<ref name=\"Alien races\"/> Liara is 106 years old during her first appearance, which is the equivalent to a human teenager and within the Maiden stage of asari life. While she is legally [[age of majority]] under Citadel law, she is not considered to have reached [[adult]]hood by asari standards. In spite of her culturally young age, she is depicted in the series as possessing the skills and experience of a [[computer scientist]], [[xenoarchaeology|xenoarchaeologist]], [[philology|philologist]], and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]].<ref name=\"RollingStones\"/>

Hillis liked Liara's selflessness in the first game, commenting in a 2014 interview, \"She is so pure. There’s not a mean bone in her body. I like that about her. She’s very analytical. She doesn’t seem to be out for herself in any way.\"<ref name=\"Interview2\"/> Liara is a possible romantic interest for a male and female [[Commander Shepard]] throughout the entire ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.<ref name=\"Gamesradar\"/> 

==Creation and development==
[[File:Jillian Murray 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jillian Murray]] was the face and body model for Liara.]]
The asari are a race of \"beautiful, blue aliens\" designed to add a familiar science-fiction element to the series.<ref name=\"Art\"/> 
Due to budget concerns, BioWare realized they would be unable to make both male and female versions for each of the races, which led to the creation of an all-female one.<ref name=\"Final Hours\">''The Final Hours of Mass Effect 3''.</ref> More alien-looking designs for the asari were made, but disregarded for their lack of human attractiveness. Their clothing is meant to be both \"alluring and sexy\" while keeping a sense of \"class and style\", akin to a \"[[Hollywood]] [[red carpet]] feel\".<ref name=\"Art\"/>  

The hair fins arose from the designers mainly experimenting with different shapes,<ref name=\"Origin\"/> and the scalp tentacles on the asari evoke the image of a woman \"emerging from the water with her hair swept back\".<ref name=\"Art\"/> Inspiration was drawn mainly from sports-gear, such as climbing and scuba gear, particularly its \"pliable, flexible\" qualities.<ref>''Mass Effect Limited Collector's Edition'', Bonus DVD.</ref> After the addition of the hair fins, the asari looked more aquatic, and thus their design was altered to fit with that; this also led to the writers altering the asari home climate to be more wet.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Different silhouettes of clothing were made by the design team trying to find looks that a woman would wear, which would appear both futuristic but not \"too far\", while also in-keeping with the kind of clothes that would be worn in more aquatic environments.<ref name=\"Origin\"/>

The asari's human-like faces helped the designers in making the characters distinct, and some models were used to tweak the faces.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Unlike other characters made for the game, Liara's face did not have a specific design; instead, her face was taken from the original concepts of the asari.<ref name=\"Art\"/> American actress [[Jillian Murray]]'s face and body scans provide the basis for Liara's final design.<ref name=\"Girls\">{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim.com/girls-of-maxim/jillian-murray |title=Girls of Maxim: Jillian Murray |date=October 21, 2009 |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |accessdate=October 26, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ke7vtpE1 |archivedate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> Many asari in the series use facepaints, which helps the design team with diversifying asari characters.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Liara's facial design incorporates blue-coloured freckles instead of facepaint.<ref name=\"Endearing\"/> 

Liara T'Soni was Ali Hillis' first voice acting role for a video game.<ref name=\"Interview1\"/> When she first began voicing Liara, she was unfamiliar with voicing video game characters nor did she expect much out of the character.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgsite.net/interview/2950-ali-hillis-interview |title=Ali Hillis Interview |last=Ward |first=Dave |date=August 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}</ref> To prepare for the role, particularly for a complicated character like Liara, she would try to \"find an essence, a simplicity of a character\".<ref name=\"Interview1\"/> She credited voice director [[Ginny McSwain]] for guiding her through the entire process, by explaining to her Liara's background, who she was and the different layers of her personality, noting that all she had was a still drawing of Liara to refer to.<ref name=\"Interview\"/> 

Liara's outfit from the ''[[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker]]'' DLC was chosen by BioWare as her default appearance for ''Mass Effect 3''. The white jacket is a reminder of her background in science, while the more armor-like pieces serves a reminder to the player that the galaxy is at war, and that civilians are part of the war effort where they have to arm and defend themselves.<ref name=\"Art\"/> 

==Appearances==
===In video games===
====''Mass Effect''====
{{main|Mass Effect (video game)}}
[[File:LiaraOriginal.png|thumb|right|Prior to ''Mass Effect 3'', fans were most familiar with Liara's outfit in the original ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"Art\"/> ]]
Liara is the estranged child of Matriarch Benezia, a well-respected and powerful asari biotic.<ref name=\"Benezia\"/> Following the exposure of Benezia's involvement with the disgraced Spectre Saren Arterius and their search for an artifact known as the Conduit, Shepard is given a lead to search for Liara and discover what she knows. Liara pleads with Shepard for help when they encounter her in Therum, offering to explain her circumstances and means to be freed. If Shepard pursues other leads first and significantly delays rescuing Liara, she mistakes her rescuers for figments of her own imagination as a result of being stuck for so long. Nevertheless, she humors her \"hallucinations\" and answers their questions. She only realizes Shepard's squad are real when they reappear to release her.

On her first debriefing aboard the Normandy, Liara shares her theory of cyclical extinction: the Protheans were just the latest in a long line of civilizations to reach a violent end after reaching their apex. Liara notes that there is remarkably little evidence of the Protheans' existence, and speculates that their final fate has been deliberately covered up. As Shepard obtains fragmented visions from various sources during the hunt for Saren and his agents, Liara offers her melding abilities to try and make sense of the data. She constantly exhausts herself after each encounter, prompting frequent suggestions to report to Dr. Chakwas, but collects herself together long enough to explain what she saw. Once Shepard obtains the Cipher, the Mu Relay's location, and the distress call from the Prothean Beacon on Virmire, Liara finally recognizes enough clues to deduce the lost planet of Ilos as the Conduit's true location.

====''Mass Effect 2''====
{{main|Mass Effect 2}}
Liara's role in the original trilogy is reduced in ''Mass Effect 2'', set two years after the first game. Liara has become an information broker on Illium in direct rivalry to the Shadow Broker. She initially depicts a radically changed personality due to her experience working as a black market information dealer in the two years since ''Mass Effect''; having improved her biotic abilities, she also uses threats and other intimidation tactics to extort information, mimicking Benezia's demeanour and speech tactics when confronting others. If the player imported a Shepard from the original ''Mass Effect'' that romanced Liara, she greets Shepard with a kiss. Liara's anger at the Broker stems from when he recovered Shepard's body and was prepared to sell it to the Collectors during the events of ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]''. After certain dialogue choices, the player is finally able to break through her shell and reveal the real Liara, revealing that her seemingly darker personality is nothing more than a facade. Liara took pains in getting Shepard's body from the Broker and gave it to Cerberus so they could bring Shepard back to life. Liara knew that Cerberus would use Shepard for their own uses, but still gave them Shepard's body as she cares for Shepard and could not let the Commander go. She feared that Shepard would hate her for this, and apologizes. In spite of wanting to join Shepard, she declines Shepard's offer to join the suicide mission to rescue human colonists, in order to continue her quest for revenge against the Shadow Broker. 

Liara joins Shepard's crew temporarily in the ''Mass Effect 2'' DLC ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' if the player decides to help her hunt down the Shadow Broker. Shepard gradually breaks her hardened shell after lecturing her about mindlessly running into battles, but at the same time she states that she won't stop \"to enjoy the scenery\" until she's done. After the Shadow Broker is killed, Liara takes the opportunity to usurp his now vacant role. She says she will use her position and resources to help assist Shepard's ongoing mission to fight the Reapers. It is also possible to resume the player character's romance with Liara at the end of \"Lair of the Shadow Broker\".

====Mass Effect 3====
{{Main article|Mass Effect 3}}
Liara returns  in ''Mass Effect 3'' as a mainstay of Shepard's squad. Liara becomes the Shadow Broker regardless of whether the player imports a ''Mass Effect 2'' [[saved game]]  where ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' was completed; if not, she tells Shepard that she took on the Shadow Broker with dozens of hired mercenaries, but it resulted in Feron's death. If Shepard assisted her in taking out the Shadow Broker, she mentions that during the time that Shepard was in Alliance custody, Cerberus managed to track down the Shadow Broker's ship. Liara and Feron loaded as much equipment as they could onto a shuttle as possible, then remotely sent the aging ship crashing into a pursuing Cerberus cruiser, resulting in the destruction of both ships. Liara notes that she has retained the crucial part of the Broker's operation, the galaxy-wide spy network.

After the events of ''Arrival'', Admiral Hackett commissioned for Liara's aid, and they both realized what little time the galaxy had left before the Reapers arrived. However, this brought her into direct conflict with the Illusive Man and Cerberus. Eventually, through a process of elimination, mixed with desperation, she discovered plans for a \"Prothean superweapon\" on Mars. However, by then the Reaper invasion has reached Earth. Liara's familiarity with Prothean artifacts as well as asari culture and history, along with the significant resources at her disposal as the Shadow Broker, means that she plays a pivotal role in ''Mass Effect 3's'' narrative and often provides additional dialogue for plot exposition purposes if she is included in the party during certain missions.<ref name=\"Companion\"/> During the war, Liara recorded a collection of intel on the Reapers and her current cycle, as well as the complete history of the species of Liara's time and their accumulated knowledge of how to fight them.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> She stores the information within Glyph, her [[Virtual intelligence|VI]] drone assistant, and stashes it away as a time capsule.<ref name=\"Lesson\"/> The time capsule represents a contingency plan if the allied races of her time are not able to defeat the Reapers in this cycle and are wiped out, ensuring the next cycle will have a better opportunity to prepare for the Reapers' arrival, and a complete set of plans to start out from.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/>

If the ''From Ashes'' DLC is installed and the Prothean [[endling]] Javik is recruited as a squad member, she is initially overjoyed to have one serving aboard the Normandy, but slowly becomes disillusioned; she admitted that she had previously imagined the Protheans as the \"keepers of wisdom and enlightenment\" of their era, only to find them to be \"cold and ruthless warlords\". Eventually, her relationship with Javik reaches a breaking point after the fall of Thessia; Liara confronts Javik at him quarters and vents her frustration at him for \"not having the answers\". If Shepard intervenes to defuse the situation instead of allowing Liara to walk away, the two will begin to respect and appreciate each other.

During the main narrative of the downloadable add-on ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel|Citadel]]'', Liara calls in a favor to find information on the gun found by Shepard after they are attacked by an unknown mercenary group during the crew's shore leave. She will later participate in the raid on the Citadel Archives with the rest of Shepard's crew to pursue the instigators behind the group's attack. The DLC also adds a number of character moments for the character, such as Liara playing the only song she knew how to on the piano located on the lower floor of Shepard's apartment, and her friendly rivalry with James Vega through debates and card games during the big party, culminating in Liara demonstrating her levitation powers on Vega while intoxicated.

====Mass Effect: Andromeda====
{{Main article|Mass Effect: Andromeda}}
Liara T'Soni makes a cameo appearance in ''Andromeda'', in the form of voice messages sent to Alex Ryder in his quarters aboard the Hyperion. Pathfinder Ryder can unlock and listen to Liara's voice messages, which were originally sent in 2182, a year before her encounter with Shepard, where she discussed her research into the Protheans and their lost empire. Eventually, Ryder will unlock a message by Liara from 2186, sent to Alec while he was in stasis on the Hyperion traveling to Andromeda, informing him that the Reapers have arrived. She mentions the Crucible but warns Alec to expect the worst, and asks him and his children to not forget the people they left behind.

===In other media===
====''Mass Effect: Redemption''====
{{Main article|Mass Effect: Redemption}}
The narrative in ''Redemption'' begins with Commander Shepard mysteriously disappearing in the Terminus Systems, out of contact with the SSV ''Normandy'' and its crew. Both the Shadow Broker and Liara T'Soni are to find and retrieve the dead body of Commander Shepard. Just as Tazzik, an agent of the Shadow Broker wants to turn over the corpse to the Collectors, Liara manages to capture it, with the help of the drell Feron, who is captured in the process, and turn it over to Cerberus, hoping that they may be able to revive Shepard.

====''Mass Effect: Paragon Lost''====
Liara appears as a minor character in the animated feature film ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]''. This marks the only instance where Ali Hillis did not reprise her role as the character.

====''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''====
Liara is the protagonist of the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', which takes place after the ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' DLC. As the new Shadow Broker, Liara desperately searches for a way to stop the [[Reaper]]s. Journeying to [[Thessia]] to examine the Prothean archives there, she is disappointed to learn how little they contain. A former colleague recommends investigating Kahje since its Prothean ruins are much more vast. Once there, Liara persuades a hanar official to allow her to visit a submerged Prothean site that had become a hanar shrine. A [[drell]] named Quoyle takes her to the shrine, but on arrival the shrine launches torpedoes at Quoyle's craft; a Cerberus [[Mass Effect 3|Phantom]] had killed the shrine's staff and activated the defenses. When the craft is hit, Liara uses her biotics to keep it from flooding while Quoyle guides it to the dock.

At the shrine, Liara encounters and kills the Phantom, using her biotics to slam a piece of debris through the Phantom's skull. Quoyle is wounded, but not mortally and tells Liara to go on to the archives. There, Liara discovers a promising lead in the form of encryption keys for other Prothean archives, but is interrupted by the Illusive Man. He insists that the Phantom is not his doing, blaming the attack on a rogue faction within Cerberus and proposes that they form an alliance against the Reapers. Liara agrees that to pool her resources with Cerberus's against the Reapers might be a mutually beneficial move, but she insists that he upload his information first. When the Illusive Man remains silent, Liara opines that either he wants to keep the information he has to himself, or that he doesn't have any information in the first place.

As Liara goes to leave, the Illusive Man insinuates that she doesn't have what it takes to be the Shadow Broker, claiming that his black market contacts think the Broker has become soft, weak and vulnerable to usurpation, insisting she needs his help; Liara retorts that he is the one trying to make a deal, advises him to send an army the next time he tries to kill her and leaves. As she helps Quoyle to the shrine's shuttle bay, she informs Admiral Hackett of her possible lead and asks for access to a top-secret facility on [[Mars]].

==Reception==
{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"Liara is conflicted.

Liara T'Soni has been well received as a character by video game journalists and fans since the inception of ''Mass Effect'' series, and 
the potential romance with her has also been of some interest. In a 2007 article written for ''GameSetWatch'', Chris Dahlen explained that while he found ''Mass Effect'' disappointing, particularly the lacklustre characterization of its NPC's, he noted that Liara was the \"less obnoxious\" of the available romance options and her explanations about the asari species well articulated.<ref name=\"GameSetWatch\"/> UGO.com included Liara in their list of the 50 sexiest female scientists.<ref name=\"Foxiest\"/> ''[[GamesRadar]]'s'' Jordan Baughman cited Liara's characterization in the first game as an example of BioWare's \"The Awkward Hottie\" character archetype, specifically a \"naive beauty who doesn’t truly understand how harsh the world/universe can be\" and who \"turns into an absolute mess when placed in social settings\".<ref name=\"Recycled\"/> IGN ranked her fourth on their list of best ''Mass Effect'' teammates published in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/05/10-best-mass-effect-teammates?page=2 |title=10 Best Mass Effect Teammates|author= Steven Hopper|date=January 11, 2012|accessdate=March 18, 2020 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> 

Following the release of ''Mass Effect 3'', various media outlets have identified Liara as one of the trilogy's best characters. Daniel Nye Griffiths from ''Forbes'' stated that Liara played a pivotal role throughout the original trilogy with assisting Shepard's struggle against the Reapers and their indoctrinated servants, noting that the time capsule Liara has prepared may still play a pivotal role in preparing future Milky Way races for the Reapers' threat if the organic races of their cycle are ultimately extinguished. He asserted that she is the real hero of the ''Mass Effect'' series.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> UGO.com ranked Liara as the second best ''Mass Effect 3'' squad member, noting that \"with a complete biotic skill set, Liara is a powerful ally against armored, shielded and barriered foes alike.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/mass-effect-3s-best-squad-members |title=Mass Effect 3's Best Squad Members|last=Basile |first=Sal |date=2012-03-13 |publisher=UGO.com |accessdate=2020-03-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313010117/http://www.ugo.com/games/mass-effect-3s-best-squad-members |archivedate=2014-04-21 }}</ref> Liara was included by ''[[Escapist Magazine]]'' in their 8 Most Badass Videogame Ladies list.<ref name=\"Escapist\">{{cite web |url=https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/galleryoftheday/10970-8-Most-Badass-Videogame-Ladies.4|title=8 Most Badass Videogame Ladies|author=SCHUYLER J.

Liara remained popular as a fan favorite after the conclusion of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy. A reader's poll published by IGN in December 2014 for their top ultimate RPG party choices placed Liara at #15 under the reserves section.<ref name=\"Poll1\">{{cite web |url= https://www.ign.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/85193/feature/the-ultimate-rpg-party-revealed|title=THE ULTIMATE RPG PARTY REVEALED|date=December 17, 2014 |work=IGN |accessdate=March 19, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217231416/https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/17/the-ultimate-rpg-party |archivedate=December 17, 2014}}</ref> Another reader's poll published by ''PC Gamer'' in 2015 reveal that Liara is the most popular love interest for Shepard, and was overall the fourth most popular ''Mass Effect'' character.<ref name=\"Poll2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/ranking-the-best-and-worst-of-the-mass-effect-games/|title=Ranking the best and worst of the Mass Effect games |author=Tyler Wilde|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2020 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> Player statistics for ''Mass Effect 3'' released by BioWare revealed that Liara T'Soni was the most popular ''Mass Effect 3'' squad member with 24.1% of the votes.<ref name=\"Guinness\">{{cite book |title=Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2015 Ebook |date=November 6, 2014 |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]], 2014 |isbn=978-1-90884-371-5}}</ref> Tim Clark from ''PC Gamer'' ranked Liara as his personal favorite Bioware companion<ref name=\"Best and Worst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/08/26/the-best-and-worst-bioware-companions |title=The best and worst BioWare companions|author=Andy Kelly |date=November 7, 2018 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>, as did Aidan Simonds from ''Playstation Lifestyle''. Clark commented that \"it's testament to the skill of BioWare's writers that she isn't reduced to just being the drippy, peace-loving, science-y one. I mean, she's all those things, but she's also more complex\", and claimed that the character motivated him \"to be a better Shepard\". Reflecting on Liara's role in the trilogy, Simmonds said Liara is a very good example of a character who benefits from a consistent narrative through the original trilogy, and that the player could witness the growth of the characters who join them on their adventure.<ref name=\"PSLS\">{{cite web |url=https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2019/04/18/our-favorite-characters-mass-effect-liara/|title=Our Favorite Characters: Saving the Galaxy with Liara in Mass Effect |author=Aidan Simonds|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=March 18, 2020 |publisher=[[CraveOnline|Playstation Lifestyle]]}}</ref> Mike Fahey from ''Kotaku'' praised Liara's freckles as a design choice, saying it gives the character \"a life I wouldn't normally expect from an alien creature in a brand-spanking new science fiction universe.\"<ref name=\"Endearing\"/> 

Liara is one of the most popular potential romance options for the ''Mass Effect'' series. A poll of video game fans held for the 2016 edition of [[Guinness World Records#Gamer's edition|''Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition'']] showed that Liara was the most popular romantic choice among respondents, with 29% of the vote.<REf>\"Guinness World Records 2016: Gamer's Edition.\" Guinness World Records.

===Controversy===
{{see also|Mass Effect (video game)#Controversy}}
A [[cutscene]] from the original ''Mass Effect'' containing partial [[nudity]] and sexual activity between Liara and Shepard, particularly if the latter is female, was among the allegedly obscene content which attracted controversy and objections from [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] media outlets.<ref name=\"Love\"/> The game was initially banned in [[Singapore]], which led to an outcry amongst the local and international gaming community<ref name=\"Gamesindustry\"/><ref name=\"Ban\"/>; censors in the country specifically blamed the lesbian encounter between a female alien (Liara) and a female Shepard was the main reason why the game was subjected to the ban.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\"/> The ban was quickly lifted after ''Mass Effect'' was issued with a M18 rating.<ref name=\"Unban\"/><ref name=\"Singapore bans ME\"/>

Like Shepard's other squad members, merchandise was made of Liara T'Soni.

'''Dr. Liara T'Soni''' is a fictional character in [[BioWare]]'s ''[[Mass Effect]]'' franchise, who serves as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]] (or \"squadmate\") in ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 3]]''. She is an asari, a [[non-binary gender]]ed sapient [[homeothermy|homeotherm]] species with a [[pansexuality|pansexual]]-[[romantic orientation|panromantic]] orientation and are naturally inclined towards biotics<ref name=\"Alien races\"/>, the ability to \"manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields through the use of electrical impulses from the brain\", allowing for telekinesis and other abilities.<ref name=\"Biotics\"/> Liara is noted for being the galactic community's foremost expert in the field of Prothean archaeology and technology, specifically evidence concerning the demise of the ancient Protheans, believed by the galactic community to be the pre-eminent civilization in the Milky Way galaxy until their sudden disappearance fifty thousands years before the events of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.

Liara is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] in the video games. Outside of the trilogy, Liara appears as the protagonist in the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' series, and the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', a comic series with individual issues on each of several ''Mass Effect 3'' squad mates prior to the Reaper invasion. Liara also has cameo appearances in ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', and in the animated feature film, ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]'', where she is voiced by [[Jamie Marchi]].

Liara has been received positively, with placements on several \"top character\" critic and fan lists, and is one of the more popular characters in the series, particularly for fan art and [[cosplay]] activities.<ref name=\"Cosplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/check-out-this-great-liara-mass-effect-cosplay/|title=Check out this great Liara Mass Effect cosplay|author=Jody Macgregor|date=September 2, 2018 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> She was the subject of some controversy in 2007 following the release of the original ''Mass Effect'', after certain media outlets reported allegations of obscenity in the sex scenes between Shepard and their squad mates, and at least one case of government scrutiny over Liara's intimate scene with a female Shepard. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' squadmates, has been released.

==Character overview==
{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"I think, especially in Mass Effect 1 before she started to evolve, that almost everything was a discovery but especially in her relationships. She was always the scientist and always absorbing and even though she was deeply emotional she was observant and very reactionary in the way she went about things. I felt that her eyes were always looking, her ears were always listening and she was very aware and almost child-like even though she was 106 years old.\"
 |source = — Ali Hillis, in an interview with ''The Gaming Liberty''<ref name=\"Interview1\"/>}}

Liara's species, the asari were the first to discover the Citadel and proposed the creation of a Council after they made first contact with the salarians.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> As part of the Council, they serve as its \"mediators and centrists\".<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> The asari have the largest economy of all the races.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Alien races\"/> The asari are perceived to have a \"[[Femininity|feminine]]\" appearance by non-asari standards. Most asari choose to use [[She (pronoun)|feminine third-person, singular personal pronouns]] as an efficient means of conversing with non-asari on terms they could understand.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> However, Liara has on at least one occasion responded to perceived [[gender bias]] and denied that she is a \"woman\", noting that her species has \"one\" gender and that the concept of [[gender binary|gender binarism]] is meaningless to the asari.<ref name=\"Gender\"/>

The asari are capable of procreating with any sentient life form, and can reproduce with any known sex, gender or species&mdash;their offspring are always asari, regardless of the species of their \"father\", which has led to in-universe claims of asari promiscuity.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Instead of trading cellular material directly like other biological organisms, asari reproduce by \"melding\": linking their nervous systems with their partner's using their biotic abilities and utilizing the electrical pattern of their partners nerve's to provide a template for half the DNA of their resulting child. <ref name=\"polygon lore\"/> Liara is the offspring of Matriarch Aethyta and Matriarch Benezia, and is \"one-quarter krogan\" on Aethyta's side. Matriarch Aethyta is first encountered in ''Mass Effect 2'' as a bartender in Illium, where Lara was based as an information broker. She later moves on to tend a bar at the Presidium in ''Mass Effect 3'', where she is revealed as Liara's other biological parent and had been spying on her all along. As a \"pureblood\", a term often used as a cruel insult for children born of two asari, Liara grew up being [[Social exclusion|socially stigmatized]] by asari society. If Shepard discusses her parentage in the original ''Mass Effect'', Liara would speculate that her parents were possibly embarrassed by the union as the asari believe that for them to improve themselves, they should mate with other species to gain new genetic properties.

Asari can live for over a thousand years<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>, and go through three stages of life: the Maiden stage, where they explore the world out of curiosity and restlessness, with many trying their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time; the Matron stage, where they begin to feel the desire to settle down to raise children; and finally the Matriarch stage, where they are often elevated as leaders of their communities, dispensing wisdom from centuries of life experience.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Their long lifespan makes them more comfortable with observation.<ref name=\"Alien races\"/> Liara is 106 years old during her first appearance, which is the equivalent to a human teenager and within the Maiden stage of asari life. While she is legally [[age of majority]] under Citadel law, she is not considered to have reached [[adult]]hood by asari standards. In spite of her culturally young age, she is depicted in the series as possessing the skills and experience of a [[computer scientist]], [[xenoarchaeology|xenoarchaeologist]], [[philology|philologist]], and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]].<ref name=\"RollingStones\"/>

Hillis liked Liara's selflessness in the first game, commenting in a 2014 interview, \"She is so pure. There’s not a mean bone in her body. I like that about her. She’s very analytical. She doesn’t seem to be out for herself in any way.\"<ref name=\"Interview2\"/> Liara is a possible romantic interest for a male and female [[Commander Shepard]] throughout the entire ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.<ref name=\"Gamesradar\"/>

The asari are a race of \"beautiful, blue aliens\" designed to add a familiar science-fiction element to the series.<ref name=\"Art\"/> 
Due to budget concerns, BioWare realized they would be unable to make both male and female versions for each of the races, which led to the creation of an all-female one.<ref name=\"Final Hours\">''The Final Hours of Mass Effect 3''.</ref> More alien-looking designs for the asari were made, but disregarded for their lack of human attractiveness. Their clothing is meant to be both \"alluring and sexy\" while keeping a sense of \"class and style\", akin to a \"[[Hollywood]] [[red carpet]] feel\".<ref name=\"Art\"/>  

The hair fins arose from the designers mainly experimenting with different shapes,<ref name=\"Origin\"/> and the scalp tentacles on the asari evoke the image of a woman \"emerging from the water with her hair swept back\".<ref name=\"Art\"/> Inspiration was drawn mainly from sports-gear, such as climbing and scuba gear, particularly its \"pliable, flexible\" qualities.<ref>''Mass Effect Limited Collector's Edition'', Bonus DVD.</ref> After the addition of the hair fins, the asari looked more aquatic, and thus their design was altered to fit with that; this also led to the writers altering the asari home climate to be more wet.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Different silhouettes of clothing were made by the design team trying to find looks that a woman would wear, which would appear both futuristic but not \"too far\", while also in-keeping with the kind of clothes that would be worn in more aquatic environments.<ref name=\"Origin\"/>

The asari's human-like faces helped the designers in making the characters distinct, and some models were used to tweak the faces.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Unlike other characters made for the game, Liara's face did not have a specific design; instead, her face was taken from the original concepts of the asari.<ref name=\"Art\"/> American actress [[Jillian Murray]]'s face and body scans provide the basis for Liara's final design.<ref name=\"Girls\">{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim.com/girls-of-maxim/jillian-murray |title=Girls of Maxim: Jillian Murray |date=October 21, 2009 |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |accessdate=October 26, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ke7vtpE1 |archivedate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> Many asari in the series use facepaints, which helps the design team with diversifying asari characters.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Liara's facial design incorporates blue-coloured freckles instead of facepaint.<ref name=\"Endearing\"/> 

Liara T'Soni was Ali Hillis' first voice acting role for a video game.<ref name=\"Interview1\"/> When she first began voicing Liara, she was unfamiliar with voicing video game characters nor did she expect much out of the character.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgsite.net/interview/2950-ali-hillis-interview |title=Ali Hillis Interview |last=Ward |first=Dave |date=August 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}</ref> To prepare for the role, particularly for a complicated character like Liara, she would try to \"find an essence, a simplicity of a character\".<ref name=\"Interview1\"/> She credited voice director [[Ginny McSwain]] for guiding her through the entire process, by explaining to her Liara's background, who she was and the different layers of her personality, noting that all she had was a still drawing of Liara to refer to.<ref name=\"Interview\"/> 

Liara's outfit from the ''[[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker]]'' DLC was chosen by BioWare as her default appearance for ''Mass Effect 3''. The white jacket is a reminder of her background in science, while the more armor-like pieces serves a reminder to the player that the galaxy is at war, and that civilians are part of the war effort where they have to arm and defend themselves.<ref name=\"Art\"/> 

==Appearances==
===In video games===
====''Mass Effect''====
{{main|Mass Effect (video game)}}
[[File:LiaraOriginal.png|thumb|right|Prior to ''Mass Effect 3'', fans were most familiar with Liara's outfit in the original ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"Art\"/> ]]
Liara is the estranged child of Matriarch Benezia, a well-respected and powerful asari biotic.<ref name=\"Benezia\"/> Following the exposure of Benezia's involvement with the disgraced Spectre Saren Arterius and their search for an artifact known as the Conduit, Shepard is given a lead to search for Liara and discover what she knows. Liara pleads with Shepard for help when they encounter her in Therum, offering to explain her circumstances and means to be freed. If Shepard pursues other leads first and significantly delays rescuing Liara, she mistakes her rescuers for figments of her own imagination as a result of being stuck for so long. Nevertheless, she humors her \"hallucinations\" and answers their questions. She only realizes Shepard's squad are real when they reappear to release her.

On her first debriefing aboard the Normandy, Liara shares her theory of cyclical extinction: the Protheans were just the latest in a long line of civilizations to reach a violent end after reaching their apex. Liara notes that there is remarkably little evidence of the Protheans' existence, and speculates that their final fate has been deliberately covered up. As Shepard obtains fragmented visions from various sources during the hunt for Saren and his agents, Liara offers her melding abilities to try and make sense of the data. She constantly exhausts herself after each encounter, prompting frequent suggestions to report to Dr. Chakwas, but collects herself together long enough to explain what she saw. Once Shepard obtains the Cipher, the Mu Relay's location, and the distress call from the Prothean Beacon on Virmire, Liara finally recognizes enough clues to deduce the lost planet of Ilos as the Conduit's true location.

====''Mass Effect 2''====
{{main|Mass Effect 2}}
Liara's role in the original trilogy is reduced in ''Mass Effect 2'', set two years after the first game. Liara has become an information broker on Illium in direct rivalry to the Shadow Broker. She initially depicts a radically changed personality due to her experience working as a black market information dealer in the two years since ''Mass Effect''; having improved her biotic abilities, she also uses threats and other intimidation tactics to extort information, mimicking Benezia's demeanour and speech tactics when confronting others. If the player imported a Shepard from the original ''Mass Effect'' that romanced Liara, she greets Shepard with a kiss. Liara's anger at the Broker stems from when he recovered Shepard's body and was prepared to sell it to the Collectors during the events of ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]''. After certain dialogue choices, the player is finally able to break through her shell and reveal the real Liara, revealing that her seemingly darker personality is nothing more than a facade. Liara took pains in getting Shepard's body from the Broker and gave it to Cerberus so they could bring Shepard back to life. Liara knew that Cerberus would use Shepard for their own uses, but still gave them Shepard's body as she cares for Shepard and could not let the Commander go. She feared that Shepard would hate her for this, and apologizes. In spite of wanting to join Shepard, she declines Shepard's offer to join the suicide mission to rescue human colonists, in order to continue her quest for revenge against the Shadow Broker. 

Liara joins Shepard's crew temporarily in the ''Mass Effect 2'' DLC ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' if the player decides to help her hunt down the Shadow Broker. Shepard gradually breaks her hardened shell after lecturing her about mindlessly running into battles, but at the same time she states that she won't stop \"to enjoy the scenery\" until she's done. After the Shadow Broker is killed, Liara takes the opportunity to usurp his now vacant role. She says she will use her position and resources to help assist Shepard's ongoing mission to fight the Reapers. It is also possible to resume the player character's romance with Liara at the end of \"Lair of the Shadow Broker\".

====Mass Effect 3====
{{Main article|Mass Effect 3}}
Liara returns  in ''Mass Effect 3'' as a mainstay of Shepard's squad. Liara becomes the Shadow Broker regardless of whether the player imports a ''Mass Effect 2'' [[saved game]]  where ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' was completed; if not, she tells Shepard that she took on the Shadow Broker with dozens of hired mercenaries, but it resulted in Feron's death. If Shepard assisted her in taking out the Shadow Broker, she mentions that during the time that Shepard was in Alliance custody, Cerberus managed to track down the Shadow Broker's ship. Liara and Feron loaded as much equipment as they could onto a shuttle as possible, then remotely sent the aging ship crashing into a pursuing Cerberus cruiser, resulting in the destruction of both ships. Liara notes that she has retained the crucial part of the Broker's operation, the galaxy-wide spy network.

After the events of ''Arrival'', Admiral Hackett commissioned for Liara's aid, and they both realized what little time the galaxy had left before the Reapers arrived. However, this brought her into direct conflict with the Illusive Man and Cerberus. Eventually, through a process of elimination, mixed with desperation, she discovered plans for a \"Prothean superweapon\" on Mars. However, by then the Reaper invasion has reached Earth. Liara's familiarity with Prothean artifacts as well as asari culture and history, along with the significant resources at her disposal as the Shadow Broker, means that she plays a pivotal role in ''Mass Effect 3's'' narrative and often provides additional dialogue for plot exposition purposes if she is included in the party during certain missions.<ref name=\"Companion\"/> During the war, Liara recorded a collection of intel on the Reapers and her current cycle, as well as the complete history of the species of Liara's time and their accumulated knowledge of how to fight them.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> She stores the information within Glyph, her [[Virtual intelligence|VI]] drone assistant, and stashes it away as a time capsule.<ref name=\"Lesson\"/> The time capsule represents a contingency plan if the allied races of her time are not able to defeat the Reapers in this cycle and are wiped out, ensuring the next cycle will have a better opportunity to prepare for the Reapers' arrival, and a complete set of plans to start out from.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/>

If the ''From Ashes'' DLC is installed and the Prothean [[endling]] Javik is recruited as a squad member, she is initially overjoyed to have one serving aboard the Normandy, but slowly becomes disillusioned; she admitted that she had previously imagined the Protheans as the \"keepers of wisdom and enlightenment\" of their era, only to find them to be \"cold and ruthless warlords\". Eventually, her relationship with Javik reaches a breaking point after the fall of Thessia; Liara confronts Javik at him quarters and vents her frustration at him for \"not having the answers\". If Shepard intervenes to defuse the situation instead of allowing Liara to walk away, the two will begin to respect and appreciate each other.

During the main narrative of the downloadable add-on ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel|Citadel]]'', Liara calls in a favor to find information on the gun found by Shepard after they are attacked by an unknown mercenary group during the crew's shore leave. She will later participate in the raid on the Citadel Archives with the rest of Shepard's crew to pursue the instigators behind the group's attack. The DLC also adds a number of character moments for the character, such as Liara playing the only song she knew how to on the piano located on the lower floor of Shepard's apartment, and her friendly rivalry with James Vega through debates and card games during the big party, culminating in Liara demonstrating her levitation powers on Vega while intoxicated.

====Mass Effect: Andromeda====
{{Main article|Mass Effect: Andromeda}}
Liara T'Soni makes a cameo appearance in ''Andromeda'', in the form of voice messages sent to Alex Ryder in his quarters aboard the Hyperion. Pathfinder Ryder can unlock and listen to Liara's voice messages, which were originally sent in 2182, a year before her encounter with Shepard, where she discussed her research into the Protheans and their lost empire. Eventually, Ryder will unlock a message by Liara from 2186, sent to Alec while he was in stasis on the Hyperion traveling to Andromeda, informing him that the Reapers have arrived. She mentions the Crucible but warns Alec to expect the worst, and asks him and his children to not forget the people they left behind.

===In other media===
====''Mass Effect: Redemption''====
{{Main article|Mass Effect: Redemption}}
The narrative in ''Redemption'' begins with Commander Shepard mysteriously disappearing in the Terminus Systems, out of contact with the SSV ''Normandy'' and its crew. Both the Shadow Broker and Liara T'Soni are to find and retrieve the dead body of Commander Shepard. Just as Tazzik, an agent of the Shadow Broker wants to turn over the corpse to the Collectors, Liara manages to capture it, with the help of the drell Feron, who is captured in the process, and turn it over to Cerberus, hoping that they may be able to revive Shepard.

====''Mass Effect: Paragon Lost''====
Liara appears as a minor character in the animated feature film ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]''. This marks the only instance where Ali Hillis did not reprise her role as the character.

====''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''====
Liara is the protagonist of the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', which takes place after the ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' DLC. As the new Shadow Broker, Liara desperately searches for a way to stop the [[Reaper]]s. Journeying to [[Thessia]] to examine the Prothean archives there, she is disappointed to learn how little they contain. A former colleague recommends investigating Kahje since its Prothean ruins are much more vast. Once there, Liara persuades a hanar official to allow her to visit a submerged Prothean site that had become a hanar shrine. A [[drell]] named Quoyle takes her to the shrine, but on arrival the shrine launches torpedoes at Quoyle's craft; a Cerberus [[Mass Effect 3|Phantom]] had killed the shrine's staff and activated the defenses. When the craft is hit, Liara uses her biotics to keep it from flooding while Quoyle guides it to the dock.

At the shrine, Liara encounters and kills the Phantom, using her biotics to slam a piece of debris through the Phantom's skull. Quoyle is wounded, but not mortally and tells Liara to go on to the archives. There, Liara discovers a promising lead in the form of encryption keys for other Prothean archives, but is interrupted by the Illusive Man. He insists that the Phantom is not his doing, blaming the attack on a rogue faction within Cerberus and proposes that they form an alliance against the Reapers. Liara agrees that to pool her resources with Cerberus's against the Reapers might be a mutually beneficial move, but she insists that he upload his information first. When the Illusive Man remains silent, Liara opines that either he wants to keep the information he has to himself, or that he doesn't have any information in the first place.

As Liara goes to leave, the Illusive Man insinuates that she doesn't have what it takes to be the Shadow Broker, claiming that his black market contacts think the Broker has become soft, weak and vulnerable to usurpation, insisting she needs his help; Liara retorts that he is the one trying to make a deal, advises him to send an army the next time he tries to kill her and leaves. As she helps Quoyle to the shrine's shuttle bay, she informs Admiral Hackett of her possible lead and asks for access to a top-secret facility on [[Mars]].

==Reception==
{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"Liara is conflicted. By her mummy issues, by her lack of romantic experience, and by her inability to lie—but those doubts are offset by the sense of wonder and hope she brings to proceedings.

Liara T'Soni has been well received as a character by video game journalists and fans since the inception of ''Mass Effect'' series, and 
the potential romance with her has also been of some interest. In a 2007 article written for ''GameSetWatch'', Chris Dahlen explained that while he found ''Mass Effect'' disappointing, particularly the lacklustre characterization of its NPC's, he noted that Liara was the \"less obnoxious\" of the available romance options and her explanations about the asari species well articulated.<ref name=\"GameSetWatch\"/> UGO.com included Liara in their list of the 50 sexiest female scientists.<ref name=\"Foxiest\"/> ''[[GamesRadar]]'s'' Jordan Baughman cited Liara's characterization in the first game as an example of BioWare's \"The Awkward Hottie\" character archetype, specifically a \"naive beauty who doesn’t truly understand how harsh the world/universe can be\" and who \"turns into an absolute mess when placed in social settings\".<ref name=\"Recycled\"/> IGN ranked her fourth on their list of best ''Mass Effect'' teammates published in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/05/10-best-mass-effect-teammates?page=2 |title=10 Best Mass Effect Teammates|author= Steven Hopper|date=January 11, 2012|accessdate=March 18, 2020 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> 

Following the release of ''Mass Effect 3'', various media outlets have identified Liara as one of the trilogy's best characters. Daniel Nye Griffiths from ''Forbes'' stated that Liara played a pivotal role throughout the original trilogy with assisting Shepard's struggle against the Reapers and their indoctrinated servants, noting that the time capsule Liara has prepared may still play a pivotal role in preparing future Milky Way races for the Reapers' threat if the organic races of their cycle are ultimately extinguished. He asserted that she is the real hero of the ''Mass Effect'' series.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> UGO.com ranked Liara as the second best ''Mass Effect 3'' squad member, noting that \"with a complete biotic skill set, Liara is a powerful ally against armored, shielded and barriered foes alike.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/mass-effect-3s-best-squad-members |title=Mass Effect 3's Best Squad Members|last=Basile |first=Sal |date=2012-03-13 |publisher=UGO.com |accessdate=2020-03-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313010117/http://www.ugo.com/games/mass-effect-3s-best-squad-members |archivedate=2014-04-21 }}</ref> Liara was included by ''[[Escapist Magazine]]'' in their 8 Most Badass Videogame Ladies list.<ref name=\"Escapist\">{{cite web |url=https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/galleryoftheday/10970-8-Most-Badass-Videogame-Ladies.4|title=8 Most Badass Videogame Ladies|author=SCHUYLER J.

Reflecting on Liara's role in the trilogy, Simmonds said Liara is a very good example of a character who benefits from a consistent narrative through the original trilogy, and that the player could witness the growth of the characters who join them on their adventure.<ref name=\"PSLS\">{{cite web |url=https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2019/04/18/our-favorite-characters-mass-effect-liara/|title=Our Favorite Characters: Saving the Galaxy with Liara in Mass Effect |author=Aidan Simonds|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=March 18, 2020 |publisher=[[CraveOnline|Playstation Lifestyle]]}}</ref> Mike Fahey from ''Kotaku'' praised Liara's freckles as a design choice, saying it gives the character \"a life I wouldn't normally expect from an alien creature in a brand-spanking new science fiction universe.\"<ref name=\"Endearing\"/> 

Liara is one of the most popular potential romance options for the ''Mass Effect'' series.

===Controversy===
{{see also|Mass Effect (video game)#Controversy}}
A [[cutscene]] from the original ''Mass Effect'' containing partial [[nudity]] and sexual activity between Liara and Shepard, particularly if the latter is female, was among the allegedly obscene content which attracted controversy and objections from [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] media outlets.<ref name=\"Love\"/> The game was initially banned in [[Singapore]], which led to an outcry amongst the local and international gaming community<ref name=\"Gamesindustry\"/><ref name=\"Ban\"/>; censors in the country specifically blamed the lesbian encounter between a female alien (Liara) and a female Shepard was the main reason why the game was subjected to the ban.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\"/> The ban was quickly lifted after ''Mass Effect'' was issued with a M18 rating.<ref name=\"Unban\"/><ref name=\"Singapore bans ME\"/>

Household models include families, [[blended families]], [[Roommate |shared housing]], [[group home]]s, [[boarding house]]s, [[house in multiple occupation |houses of multiple occupancy]] (UK), and [[single room occupancy]] (US). In [[feudalism|feudal]] societies, the [[Royal Household]] and [[medieval household]]s of the wealthy included [[Domestic worker| servants]] and other retainers.

==Government definitions==
For statistical purposes in the [[United Kingdom]], a household is defined as \"one person or a group of people who have the accommodation as their only or main residence and for a group, either share at least one [[meal]] a day or share the living accommodation, that is, a [[living room]] or sitting room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_social/FRS_Tech01-02.pdf|title=National Statistics|publisher=Statistics.gov.uk\\accessdate=2015-05-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626033347/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_social/FRS_Tech01-02.pdf|archivedate=2008-06-26}}</ref> The introduction of legislation to control houses of multiple occupation in the UK Housing Act (2004)<ref name=\"Housing Act 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/pdfs/ukpga_20040034_en.pdf|title=UK Housing Act 2004}} See section 258 on p.&nbsp;201.</ref> required a tighter definition of a single household. People can be considered a household if they are related: full- or half-blood, foster, step-parent/child, in-laws (and equivalent for unmarried couples), a married couple or unmarried but \"living as&nbsp;...\" (same- or different-sex couples).<ref name=\"www.getrentback.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.getrentback.org/guide%20hmo.html|title=Single Household: brief summary of HA 2004 definition|work=Flat Justice: Helping Tenants to Get Rent Back}}</ref>

The [[United States Census]] definition also hinges on \"separate living quarters\": \"those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_HSD310212.htm |title=Households |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427051753/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_HSD310212.htm |archivedate=2015-04-27 }}</ref> According to the U.S. census, a householder is the \"person (or one of the people) in whose name the housing unit is owned or rented (maintained)\"; if no person qualifies, any adult resident of a housing unit is considered a householder. The U.S. government formerly used \"head of the household\" and \"head of the family\", but those terms were replaced with \"householder\" in 1980.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cps/cpsdef.html |title=U.S. Census: Current Population Survey – Definitions and Explanations |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2012-03-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322222020/http://www.census.gov/population/www/cps/cpsdef.html |archivedate=2012-03-22 }}</ref> In the census definition of a household, it
{{quote|... includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit. A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.)<ref>{{cite web | title=Households, Persons Per Household, and Households with Individuals Under 18 Years, 2000 | website=Census.gov | date=2011-05-29 | url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_71061.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529012504/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_71061.htm | archive-date=2011-05-29 | url-status=dead | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>}}

On July 15, 1998, [[Statistics Canada]] said: \"A household is generally defined as being composed of a person or group of persons who co-reside in, or occupy, a dwelling.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/concepts/definitions/house-menage-eng.htm |title=Statistical unit – Household |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2012-03-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714062241/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/concepts/definitions/house-menage-eng.htm |archivedate=2011-07-14 }}</ref>

=={{anchor|Economic theories}}Economic definition==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
Although a one-income-stream economic theory simplifies modeling, it does not necessarily reflect reality. Many, if not most, households have several income-earning members. Most economic models do not equate households and traditional families, and there is not always a one-to-one relationship between households and families.

=={{anchor|Social}}Social definitions==
In [[social work]], a household is defined similarly: a residential group in which [[Homemaking|housework]] is divided and performed by householders. [[Carer|Care]] may be delivered by one householder to another, depending upon their respective needs, abilities, and (perhaps) [[Disability|disabilities]]. Household composition may affect life and health expectations and outcomes for its members.<ref>{{cite book | last = Muriuki | first = Andrew Mburu | title = The role of household environment on health outcomes for female adolescents in Kenya | publisher = University of Missouri-Columbia | date = 2007 | oclc = 183405613 }} [https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/32043/2/20_3muriuki_paper.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102230450/https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/32043/2/20_3muriuki_paper.pdf |date=2017-01-02 }}</ref><ref name=\"usyd\">{{cite book |last= Dhungel |first= Basundhara |title= A study of Nepalese families' paid and unpaid work after migration to Australia |publisher= University of Sydney |date= 14 May 2001 |oclc= 271516251 }} [http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/375/2/adt-NU20010514.11220001front.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512142939/http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/375/2/adt-NU20010514.11220001front.pdf |date=2013-05-12 }}</ref> Eligibility for [[Home care|community services]] and [[welfare]] benefits may depend upon household composition.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Pierson | first1 = John | last2 = Thomas | first2 = Martin | title = Collins dictionary of social work | publisher = HarperCollins | location = Glasgow, UK | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-00-714396-2 }}</ref>

[[Feminism]] examines how [[gender role]]s affect the division of labour in households. In ''[[The Second Shift]]'' and ''The Time Bind'', sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] presents evidence that in two-career couples men and women spend about equal amounts of time working; however, women spend more time on housework.<ref name=\"Hochschild1\">{{Cite book| last1 = Russell Hochschild | first1 = Arlie | last2 = Machung | first2 = Anne | author-link1 = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = The second shift: working families and the revolution at home | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 2003 | title-link = The Second Shift }} {{ISBN|9780142002926}}</ref><ref name=\"Hochschild2\">{{cite book | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = The time bind: when work becomes home and home becomes work | publisher = Henry Holt & Co. | location = New York | year = 2001 | title-link = Time bind }} {{ISBN|9780805066432}}</ref> [[Cathy Young]] (another feminist writer) says that in some cases, women may prevent the equal participation of men in housework and parenting.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Young | first = Cathy | authorlink = Cathy Young | title = The Mama Lion at the Gate | url = http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/ | date = 12 June 2000 | accessdate = 2008-07-08 | website = Salon.com | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120211015447/http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/ | archivedate = 11 February 2012 }}</ref>

=={{anchor|Household models}}Models==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
Household models in the [[English-speaking world]] include traditional and blended families, shared housing, and [[group home]]s for people with support needs. Other models which may meet definitions of a household include [[boarding house]]s, houses in multiple occupation (UK), and [[single room occupancy]] (US).

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
In [[feudalism|feudal]] or [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] societies, a household may include servants or retainers who derive their income from the household's principal income.

A 1961–62 National Housing Institute survey estimated that 13.8 percent of Belgian dwellings were unfit and incapable of improvement. A further 19.5 percent were unfit but had the potential to be improved, and 54 percent were considered suitable (without alteration or improvement) for modern living standards. Seventy-four percent of dwellings lacked a shower or bath, 19 percent had inadequate sewage disposal, and 3.6 percent lacked a drinking-water supply; 36.8 percent had an indoor [[Flush toilet|water closet]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Christopher John|title=Social housing policy in Belgium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDNjAAAAIAAJ|year=1971|publisher=University of Birmingham}} {{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref> According to a 1964 study, 13 percent of Belgium's housing consisted of [[slum]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/43714/1/A7457.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029175235/http://aei.pitt.edu/43714/1/A7457.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-29 }}</ref>

Between 1954 and 1973, the percentage of French homes with a shower or bath increased from 10 to 65 percent. During that period, the percentage of homes without flush toilets fell from 73 to 30 percent; homes without running water fell from 42 to 3.4 percent. A 1948 law permitted gradual, long-term rent increases for existing flats on the condition that part of the money was spent on repairs. According to [[John Ardagh]], the law, \"vigorously applied, was partly successful in its twofold aim: to encourage both repairs and new building.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ardagh|first=John|title=The New France: A Society in Transition, 1945–1977|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSAVyAEACAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Penguin}} {{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref>

These figures included kitchens when they were used for eating meals. Fifty percent of 1964 housing had three bedrooms; 1.9 percent had five or more bedrooms, 6.2 percent had four bedrooms, 10.5 percent had one bedroom or none, and 31.3&nbsp;percent had two bedrooms. A 1960 social survey estimated that 0.6 percent of households in England and Wales exceeded the statutory overcrowding standard; the 1964 percentage was 0.5 percent. In 1964, 6.9 of all households exceeded one person per room. The 1960 figure was 11 percent, with 1.75 percent having two or more bedrooms below the standard and 9.25 percent having one bedroom below the standard. This declined slightly by 1964 to 9.4 percent of households below the standard, with 8.1 percent having one bedroom below the standard and 1.3 percent having two bedrooms or more below the standard.

Household models include families, [[blended families]], [[Roommate |shared housing]], [[group home]]s, [[boarding house]]s, [[house in multiple occupation |houses of multiple occupancy]] (UK), and [[single room occupancy]] (US). In [[feudalism|feudal]] societies, the [[Royal Household]] and [[medieval household]]s of the wealthy included [[Domestic worker| servants]] and other retainers.

== Government definitions ==
For statistical purposes in the [[United Kingdom]], a household is defined as \"one person or a group of people who have the accommodation as their only or main residence and for a group, either share at least one [[meal]] a day or share the living accommodation, that is, a [[living room]] or sitting room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_social/FRS_Tech01-02.pdf|title=National Statistics|publisher=Statistics.gov.uk\\accessdate=2015-05-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626033347/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_social/FRS_Tech01-02.pdf|archivedate=2008-06-26}}</ref> The introduction of legislation to control houses of multiple occupation in the UK Housing Act (2004)<ref name=\"Housing Act 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/pdfs/ukpga_20040034_en.pdf|title=UK Housing Act 2004}} See section 258 on p.&nbsp;201.</ref> required a tighter definition of a single household. People can be considered a household if they are related: full- or half-blood, foster, step-parent/child, in-laws (and equivalent for unmarried couples), a married couple or unmarried but \"living as&nbsp;...\" (same- or different-sex couples).<ref name=\"www.getrentback.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.getrentback.org/guide%20hmo.html|title=Single Household: brief summary of HA 2004 definition|work=Flat Justice: Helping Tenants to Get Rent Back}}</ref>

The [[United States Census]] definition also hinges on \"separate living quarters\": \"those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_HSD310212.htm |title=Households |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427051753/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_HSD310212.htm |archivedate=2015-04-27 }}</ref> According to the U.S. census, a householder is the \"person (or one of the people) in whose name the housing unit is owned or rented (maintained)\"; if no person qualifies, any adult resident of a housing unit is considered a householder.

Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements.

{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
Although a one-income-stream economic theory simplifies modeling, it does not necessarily reflect reality. Many, if not most, households have several income-earning members. Most economic models do not equate households and traditional families, and there is not always a one-to-one relationship between households and families.

In [[social work]], a household is defined similarly: a residential group in which [[Homemaking|housework]] is divided and performed by householders. [[Carer|Care]] may be delivered by one householder to another, depending upon their respective needs, abilities, and (perhaps) [[Disability|disabilities]]. Household composition may affect life and health expectations and outcomes for its members.<ref>{{cite book | last = Muriuki | first = Andrew Mburu | title = The role of household environment on health outcomes for female adolescents in Kenya | publisher = University of Missouri-Columbia | date = 2007 | oclc = 183405613 }} [https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/32043/2/20_3muriuki_paper.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102230450/https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/32043/2/20_3muriuki_paper.pdf |date=2017-01-02 }}</ref><ref name=\"usyd\">{{cite book |last= Dhungel |first= Basundhara |title= A study of Nepalese families' paid and unpaid work after migration to Australia |publisher= University of Sydney |date= 14 May 2001 |oclc= 271516251 }} [http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/375/2/adt-NU20010514.11220001front.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512142939/http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/375/2/adt-NU20010514.11220001front.pdf |date=2013-05-12 }}</ref> Eligibility for [[Home care|community services]] and [[welfare]] benefits may depend upon household composition.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Pierson | first1 = John | last2 = Thomas | first2 = Martin | title = Collins dictionary of social work | publisher = HarperCollins | location = Glasgow, UK | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-00-714396-2 }}</ref>

A 1961–62 National Housing Institute survey estimated that 13.8 percent of Belgian dwellings were unfit and incapable of improvement. A further 19.5 percent were unfit but had the potential to be improved, and 54 percent were considered suitable (without alteration or improvement) for modern living standards. Seventy-four percent of dwellings lacked a shower or bath, 19 percent had inadequate sewage disposal, and 3.6 percent lacked a drinking-water supply; 36.8 percent had an indoor [[Flush toilet|water closet]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Christopher John|title=Social housing policy in Belgium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDNjAAAAIAAJ|year=1971|publisher=University of Birmingham}} {{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref> According to a 1964 study, 13 percent of Belgium's housing consisted of [[slum]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/43714/1/A7457.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029175235/http://aei.pitt.edu/43714/1/A7457.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-29 }}</ref>

=== {{anchor|Postwar housing conditions in France}}France ===
Between 1954 and 1973, the percentage of French homes with a shower or bath increased from 10 to 65 percent. During that period, the percentage of homes without flush toilets fell from 73 to 30 percent; homes without running water fell from 42 to 3.4 percent. A 1948 law permitted gradual, long-term rent increases for existing flats on the condition that part of the money was spent on repairs. According to [[John Ardagh]], the law, \"vigorously applied, was partly successful in its twofold aim: to encourage both repairs and new building.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ardagh|first=John|title=The New France: A Society in Transition, 1945–1977|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSAVyAEACAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Penguin}} {{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref>

=== {{anchor|Postwar housing conditions in the United Kingdom}}United Kingdom ===
After [[World War II]], a large percentage of British housing was single-family housing. Seventy-eight percent of housing in 1961 consisted of single-family homes, compared to 56 percent in the Netherlands, 49 percent in West Germany and 32 percent in France.<ref name=\"google4\">{{cite book|last1=Kertzer|first1=David I.|last2=Barbagli|first2=Marzio|title=Family Life in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPNWAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09494-7}}</ref> In England and Wales in 1964, 6.6 percent of housing units had two or fewer  rooms; 5.8 percent had seven or more rooms, 15.2 percent had six rooms, 35.1 percent had five rooms, 26.3 percent had four rooms, and 11.1 percent had three rooms. These figures included kitchens when they were used for eating meals. Fifty percent of 1964 housing had three bedrooms; 1.9 percent had five or more bedrooms, 6.2 percent had four bedrooms, 10.5 percent had one bedroom or none, and 31.3&nbsp;percent had two bedrooms. A 1960 social survey estimated that 0.6 percent of households in England and Wales exceeded the statutory overcrowding standard; the 1964 percentage was 0.5 percent. In 1964, 6.9 of all households exceeded one person per room. The 1960 figure was 11 percent, with 1.75 percent having two or more bedrooms below the standard and 9.25 percent having one bedroom below the standard. This declined slightly by 1964 to 9.4 percent of households below the standard, with 8.1 percent having one bedroom below the standard and 1.3 percent having two bedrooms or more below the standard. According to local authorities in 1965, five percent of the housing stock in England and Wales was unfit for habitation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holman |first=Robert |title=Socially deprived families in Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYo0AAAAMAAJ |date=1970 |publisher=Bedford Square P. of the National Council of Social Service|isbn=0-7199-0795-0 |oclc=103175 }} {{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref>

Housing conditions improved in Canada and the U.S. after World War II. In the U.S., 35.4 percent of all 1950 dwellings did not have complete plumbing facilities; the figure fell to 16.8 percent in 1960 and 8.4 percent in 1968. In Canada from 1951 to 1971, the percentage of dwellings with a bath or shower increased from 60.8 to 93.4 percent; the percentage of dwellings with hot and cold running water increased from 56.9 to 93.5 percent.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In the United States from 1950 to 1974, the percentage of housing without full plumbing fell from 34 to three percent; during that period, the percentage of housing stock considered dilapidated fell from nine percent to less than four.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Clair|title=American Standards of Living: 1918–1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ExTFM-jr0NEC&pg=PA298|year=1994|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-55786-371-3|page=298}}</ref>

A '''household''' consists of one or several persons who live in the same [[dwelling]] and share meals. It may also consist of a single [[family]] or another group of people.<ref>{{cite book|last= Haviland|first=William A.|title=Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xM9SPwAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning|isbn=978-0-534-61020-3}}</ref> The household is the basic unit of analysis in many social, [[microeconomic]] and government models, and is important to [[economics]] and [[inheritance]].<ref>{{cite book

Household models include families, [[blended families]], [[Roommate |shared housing]], [[group home]]s, [[boarding house]]s, [[house in multiple occupation |houses of multiple occupancy]] (UK), and [[single room occupancy]] (US). In [[feudalism|feudal]] societies, the [[Royal Household]] and [[medieval household]]s of the wealthy included [[Domestic worker| servants]] and other retainers.

==Government definitions==
For statistical purposes in the [[United Kingdom]], a household is defined as \"one person or a group of people who have the accommodation as their only or main residence and for a group, either share at least one [[meal]] a day or share the living accommodation, that is, a [[living room]] or sitting room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_social/FRS_Tech01-02.pdf|title=National Statistics|publisher=Statistics.gov.uk\\accessdate=2015-05-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626033347/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_social/FRS_Tech01-02.pdf|archivedate=2008-06-26}}</ref> The introduction of legislation to control houses of multiple occupation in the UK Housing Act (2004)<ref name=\"Housing Act 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/pdfs/ukpga_20040034_en.pdf|title=UK Housing Act 2004}} See section 258 on p.&nbsp;201.</ref> required a tighter definition of a single household. People can be considered a household if they are related: full- or half-blood, foster, step-parent/child, in-laws (and equivalent for unmarried couples), a married couple or unmarried but \"living as&nbsp;...\" (same- or different-sex couples).<ref name=\"www.getrentback.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.getrentback.org/guide%20hmo.html|title=Single Household: brief summary of HA 2004 definition|work=Flat Justice: Helping Tenants to Get Rent Back}}</ref>

The [[United States Census]] definition also hinges on \"separate living quarters\": \"those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_HSD310212.htm |title=Households |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427051753/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_HSD310212.htm |archivedate=2015-04-27 }}</ref> According to the U.S. census, a householder is the \"person (or one of the people) in whose name the housing unit is owned or rented (maintained)\"; if no person qualifies, any adult resident of a housing unit is considered a householder. The U.S. government formerly used \"head of the household\" and \"head of the family\", but those terms were replaced with \"householder\" in 1980.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cps/cpsdef.html |title=U.S. Census: Current Population Survey – Definitions and Explanations |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2012-03-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322222020/http://www.census.gov/population/www/cps/cpsdef.html |archivedate=2012-03-22 }}</ref> In the census definition of a household, it
{{quote|... includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit. A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.)<ref>{{cite web | title=Households, Persons Per Household, and Households with Individuals Under 18 Years, 2000 | website=Census.gov | date=2011-05-29 | url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_71061.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529012504/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_71061.htm | archive-date=2011-05-29 | url-status=dead | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>}}

On July 15, 1998, [[Statistics Canada]] said: \"A household is generally defined as being composed of a person or group of persons who co-reside in, or occupy, a dwelling.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/concepts/definitions/house-menage-eng.htm |title=Statistical unit – Household |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2012-03-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714062241/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/concepts/definitions/house-menage-eng.htm |archivedate=2011-07-14 }}</ref>

=={{anchor|Economic theories}}Economic definition==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
Although a one-income-stream economic theory simplifies modeling, it does not necessarily reflect reality. Many, if not most, households have several income-earning members. Most economic models do not equate households and traditional families, and there is not always a one-to-one relationship between households and families.

=={{anchor|Social}}Social definitions==
In [[social work]], a household is defined similarly: a residential group in which [[Homemaking|housework]] is divided and performed by householders. [[Carer|Care]] may be delivered by one householder to another, depending upon their respective needs, abilities, and (perhaps) [[Disability|disabilities]]. Household composition may affect life and health expectations and outcomes for its members.<ref>{{cite book | last = Muriuki | first = Andrew Mburu | title = The role of household environment on health outcomes for female adolescents in Kenya | publisher = University of Missouri-Columbia | date = 2007 | oclc = 183405613 }} [https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/32043/2/20_3muriuki_paper.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102230450/https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/32043/2/20_3muriuki_paper.pdf |date=2017-01-02 }}</ref><ref name=\"usyd\">{{cite book |last= Dhungel |first= Basundhara |title= A study of Nepalese families' paid and unpaid work after migration to Australia |publisher= University of Sydney |date= 14 May 2001 |oclc= 271516251 }} [http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/375/2/adt-NU20010514.11220001front.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512142939/http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/375/2/adt-NU20010514.11220001front.pdf |date=2013-05-12 }}</ref> Eligibility for [[Home care|community services]] and [[welfare]] benefits may depend upon household composition.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Pierson | first1 = John | last2 = Thomas | first2 = Martin | title = Collins dictionary of social work | publisher = HarperCollins | location = Glasgow, UK | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-00-714396-2 }}</ref>

[[Feminism]] examines how [[gender role]]s affect the division of labour in households. In ''[[The Second Shift]]'' and ''The Time Bind'', sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] presents evidence that in two-career couples men and women spend about equal amounts of time working; however, women spend more time on housework.<ref name=\"Hochschild1\">{{Cite book| last1 = Russell Hochschild | first1 = Arlie | last2 = Machung | first2 = Anne | author-link1 = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = The second shift: working families and the revolution at home | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 2003 | title-link = The Second Shift }} {{ISBN|9780142002926}}</ref><ref name=\"Hochschild2\">{{cite book | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = The time bind: when work becomes home and home becomes work | publisher = Henry Holt & Co. | location = New York | year = 2001 | title-link = Time bind }} {{ISBN|9780805066432}}</ref> [[Cathy Young]] (another feminist writer) says that in some cases, women may prevent the equal participation of men in housework and parenting.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Young | first = Cathy | authorlink = Cathy Young | title = The Mama Lion at the Gate | url = http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/ | date = 12 June 2000 | accessdate = 2008-07-08 | website = Salon.com | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120211015447/http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/ | archivedate = 11 February 2012 }}</ref>

=={{anchor|Household models}}Models==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
Household models in the [[English-speaking world]] include traditional and blended families, shared housing, and [[group home]]s for people with support needs. Other models which may meet definitions of a household include [[boarding house]]s, houses in multiple occupation (UK), and [[single room occupancy]] (US).

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
In [[feudalism|feudal]] or [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] societies, a household may include servants or retainers who derive their income from the household's principal income.

==Housing conditions==

A 1961–62 National Housing Institute survey estimated that 13.8 percent of Belgian dwellings were unfit and incapable of improvement. A further 19.5 percent were unfit but had the potential to be improved, and 54 percent were considered suitable (without alteration or improvement) for modern living standards. Seventy-four percent of dwellings lacked a shower or bath, 19 percent had inadequate sewage disposal, and 3.6 percent lacked a drinking-water supply; 36.8 percent had an indoor [[Flush toilet|water closet]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Christopher John|title=Social housing policy in Belgium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDNjAAAAIAAJ|year=1971|publisher=University of Birmingham}} {{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref> According to a 1964 study, 13 percent of Belgium's housing consisted of [[slum]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/43714/1/A7457.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029175235/http://aei.pitt.edu/43714/1/A7457.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-29 }}</ref>

==={{anchor|Postwar housing conditions in France}}France===
Between 1954 and 1973, the percentage of French homes with a shower or bath increased from 10 to 65 percent. During that period, the percentage of homes without flush toilets fell from 73 to 30 percent; homes without running water fell from 42 to 3.4 percent. A 1948 law permitted gradual, long-term rent increases for existing flats on the condition that part of the money was spent on repairs. According to [[John Ardagh]], the law, \"vigorously applied, was partly successful in its twofold aim: to encourage both repairs and new building.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ardagh|first=John|title=The New France: A Society in Transition, 1945–1977|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSAVyAEACAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Penguin}} {{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref>

Household models include families, [[blended families]], [[Roommate |shared housing]], [[group home]]s, [[boarding house]]s, [[house in multiple occupation |houses of multiple occupancy]] (UK), and [[single room occupancy]] (US). In [[feudalism|feudal]] societies, the [[Royal Household]] and [[medieval household]]s of the wealthy included [[Domestic worker| servants]] and other retainers.

== Government definitions ==
For statistical purposes in the [[United Kingdom]], a household is defined as \"one person or a group of people who have the accommodation as their only or main residence and for a group, either share at least one [[meal]] a day or share the living accommodation, that is, a [[living room]] or sitting room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_social/FRS_Tech01-02.pdf|title=National Statistics|publisher=Statistics.gov.uk\\accessdate=2015-05-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626033347/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_social/FRS_Tech01-02.pdf|archivedate=2008-06-26}}</ref> The introduction of legislation to control houses of multiple occupation in the UK Housing Act (2004)<ref name=\"Housing Act 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/pdfs/ukpga_20040034_en.pdf|title=UK Housing Act 2004}} See section 258 on p.&nbsp;201.</ref> required a tighter definition of a single household.

{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
Although a one-income-stream economic theory simplifies modeling, it does not necessarily reflect reality. Many, if not most, households have several income-earning members. Most economic models do not equate households and traditional families, and there is not always a one-to-one relationship between households and families.

In [[social work]], a household is defined similarly: a residential group in which [[Homemaking|housework]] is divided and performed by householders. [[Carer|Care]] may be delivered by one householder to another, depending upon their respective needs, abilities, and (perhaps) [[Disability|disabilities]].

A 1961–62 National Housing Institute survey estimated that 13.8 percent of Belgian dwellings were unfit and incapable of improvement. A further 19.5 percent were unfit but had the potential to be improved, and 54 percent were considered suitable (without alteration or improvement) for modern living standards. Seventy-four percent of dwellings lacked a shower or bath, 19 percent had inadequate sewage disposal, and 3.6 percent lacked a drinking-water supply; 36.8 percent had an indoor [[Flush toilet|water closet]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Christopher John|title=Social housing policy in Belgium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDNjAAAAIAAJ|year=1971|publisher=University of Birmingham}} {{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref> According to a 1964 study, 13 percent of Belgium's housing consisted of [[slum]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/43714/1/A7457.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029175235/http://aei.pitt.edu/43714/1/A7457.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-29 }}</ref>

=== {{anchor|Postwar housing conditions in France}}France ===
Between 1954 and 1973, the percentage of French homes with a shower or bath increased from 10 to 65 percent. During that period, the percentage of homes without flush toilets fell from 73 to 30 percent; homes without running water fell from 42 to 3.4 percent. A 1948 law permitted gradual, long-term rent increases for existing flats on the condition that part of the money was spent on repairs. According to [[John Ardagh]], the law, \"vigorously applied, was partly successful in its twofold aim: to encourage both repairs and new building.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ardagh|first=John|title=The New France: A Society in Transition, 1945–1977|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSAVyAEACAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Penguin}} {{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref>

After [[World War II]], a large percentage of British housing was single-family housing.

These figures included kitchens when they were used for eating meals. Fifty percent of 1964 housing had three bedrooms; 1.9 percent had five or more bedrooms, 6.2 percent had four bedrooms, 10.5 percent had one bedroom or none, and 31.3&nbsp;percent had two bedrooms. A 1960 social survey estimated that 0.6 percent of households in England and Wales exceeded the statutory overcrowding standard; the 1964 percentage was 0.5 percent. In 1964, 6.9 of all households exceeded one person per room. The 1960 figure was 11 percent, with 1.75 percent having two or more bedrooms below the standard and 9.25 percent having one bedroom below the standard. This declined slightly by 1964 to 9.4 percent of households below the standard, with 8.1 percent having one bedroom below the standard and 1.3 percent having two bedrooms or more below the standard. According to local authorities in 1965, five percent of the housing stock in England and Wales was unfit for habitation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holman |first=Robert |title=Socially deprived families in Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYo0AAAAMAAJ |date=1970 |publisher=Bedford Square P. of the National Council of Social Service|isbn=0-7199-0795-0 |oclc=103175 }} {{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref>

<!--such as what, exactly?-->

[[File:NHRA Museum.jpg|thumb|Arguably the most famous custom car in the classic style, the [[Hirohata Merc]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Kress |first=Joe |title=Lead Sleds |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9781610590631 |page=10 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IM8me68zmJwC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10 |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref>]]

A '''custom car''' is a passenger [[automobile|vehicle]] that has been either substantially altered to [[engine tuning|improve its performance]], often by altering or replacing the [[engine]] and [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]; made into a personal \"styling\" statement, using paint work and [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] accessories to make the car look unlike any car as delivered from the factory; or some combination of both. A desire among some automotive enthusiasts in the United States is to push \"styling and performance a step beyond the showroom floor - to truly craft an automobile of one's own.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ganahl |first=Pat |title=The American custom car |date=2001 |publisher=MBI |isbn=9780760309506 |url= https://archive.org/details/americancustomca0000gana |url-access=registration |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref> A custom car in British according to ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' is built to the buyer's own specifications.<ref>{{cite web |title=Custom car definition and meaning: Collins English Dictionary |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/custom-car |website=www.collinsdictionary.com |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref>

Although the two are related, custom cars are distinct from [[hot rod]]s. The extent of this difference has been the subject of debate among customizers and rodders for decades. Additionally, a [[street rod (car)|street rod]] can be considered a custom.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Custom cars are not to be confused with [[coachbuilder|coachbuilt]] automobiles, historically [[rolling chassis]] fitted with luxury bodywork by specialty body builders.

==History==
[[File:T-bucket.jpg|thumb|The iconic \"[[T-bucket]]\" custom, with characteristic exposed engine, flat windshield, headers, and open pipes. Soft top (shown) is optional. Also features chrome five-spoke wheels, dropped tube axle, transverse front [[leaf spring]], front [[disc brake]]s, open-face [[air filter|aircleaner]], Weiand [[valve cover]]s, and single [[carburetor#Multiple carburetor barrels|4-barrel]] (probably a [[Rochester Products Division|QJ]]).]]<!--And don't go taking this out & claiming you can't see it; I shot the pictures myself!-->
[[File:Rat rod flatty.jpg|thumb|\"Rat rodded\" [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model A]] with [[Edelbrock]] [[cylinder head|head]] and chrome carb hats on late-model [[Ford V8|flatty]]]]

A development of hot rodding, the change in name corresponded to the change in the [[design]] of the cars being modified. The first hot rods were pre-[[World War II]] cars, with [[running board]]s and simple fenders over the wheels. Early model cars (1929 to 1934) were modified by removing the running boards and either removing the fenders entirely or replacing them with light cycle fenders. Later models usually had fender skirts installed. The \"gow job\" morphed into the hot rod in the early to middle 1950s.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.16.</ref> Typical of builds from before World War II were 1935 Ford [[wire wheel]]s.<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.18.</ref>

Many cars were \"hopped up\" with engine modifications such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads, and dual exhausts. [[Engine swap]]s were often done, with the objective of placing the most powerful engine in the lightest possible frame and body combination.<ref name=\"Custom history\">{{cite web|url= http://www.yourcustomcar.com/custom-car-history.html |title=The evolution of custom cars |accessdate=2016-10-11}}</ref> The suspension was usually altered, initially by lowering the rear end as much as possible using lowering blocks on the rear springs. Later cars were given a rake job by either adding a dropped front axle or heating front coil springs to make the front end of the car much lower than the rear. Immediately postwar, most rods would change from mechanical to hydraulic (\"juice\") brakes and from bulb to sealed-beam headlights.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, pp.18\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, pp.18 and 20.</ref>

The mid-1950s and early 1960s custom Deuce was typically fenderless and steeply chopped, and almost all Ford (or Mercury, with the {{convert|239|cid|cc|abbr=on}} flatty, introduced in 1939<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\">Shelton, p.20.</ref>); a [[Halibrand]] quick-change rearend was also typical, and an [[Edelbrock]] [[intake manifold]] or Harman and Collins [[ignition magneto]] would not be uncommon.<ref>Shelton, pp.17-18.</ref> Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\"/> Aftermarket flatty heads were available from Barney Navarro,<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\">Shelton, p.20 caption.</ref> [[Edelbrock|Vic Edelbrock]], and [[Offenhauser]]. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a \"slingshot\" design for the flatty.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\"/> Front suspension hairpins were adapted from [[sprint car]]s, such as the [[Kurtis Kraft]]s.<ref>Shelton, p.24 and p.26 caption.</ref> The first Jimmy [[Supercharging|supercharger]] on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.<ref>Shelton, p.26 caption.</ref>

Much later, rods and customs swapped the old solid rear axle for an independent rear, often from [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]. Sometimes the grille of one make of car replaced another; the 1937 [[Buick]] grille was often used on a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the grille swap of choice was the 1953 [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]]. The original hot rods were plainly painted like the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Model A Fords]] from which they had been built up, and only slowly begun to take on colors, and eventually fancy orange-yellow flamed hoods or \"candy-like\" deep acrylic finishes in the various colors.<ref name=\"Custom history\" />

With the change in automobile design to encase the wheels in fenders and to extend the hood to the full width of the car, the former practices were no longer possible. In addition, tremendous automotive advertising raised public interest in the new models in the 1950s. Thus, custom cars came into existence, swapping [[headlamp]] rings, grilles, bumpers, [[Chrome plating|chrome]] side strips, and taillights as well as [[Frenching (automobile)|frenching]] and tunnelling head- and taillights. The bodies of the cars were changed by cutting through the sheet metal, removing bits to make the car lower, welding it back together, and adding [[lead]] to make the resulting form smooth (hence the term [[lead sled]]; [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] has since largely replaced lead.) [[Chopped and channeled#Chopping|Chopping]] made the roof lower<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/78, p.64.</ref> while [[Chopped and channeled#Sectioning|sectioning]]<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.15; ''Custom Rodder'' 1/97, p.29.</ref> made the body thinner from top to bottom. [[Chopped and channeled#Channeling|Channeling]]<ref>Jezek, George. \"The All Deuce Round-Up\", in ''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.58.</ref> was cutting notches in the floorpan where the body touches the frame to lower the whole body. Fins were often added from other cars, or made up from sheet steel. In the custom car culture, someone who merely changed the appearance without also substantially improving the performance was looked down upon. ''[[Juxtapoz Magazine]]'', founded by the artist [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], has covered [[Kustom Kulture]] art.

==Customization style==
[[File:Fuzzy dice 2.jpg|thumb|'55-7 Chevy with fuzzy dice]] <!--fuzzy dice are practically required-->
[[File:Ed Roth 'bloodshot eyeball'.jpg|thumb|[[Ed Roth|'Big Daddy' Roth]] 'bloodshot eyeball' [[shift knob]] was a 1960s craze.]]

Custom cars are distinct from cars in stock condition. Builders may adopt the visual and performance characteristics of some relevant modification styles, and combine these as desired. There are now several different custom themes, including:
* [[Rat rod]]: imitates (or exaggerates) the \"unfinished\" and amateur-built appearance of hot rods of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s
* Restomod - restored and modernized. Safety and convenience upgrades, such as disc brakes, AC, etc., but can include fuel injection and overdrive upgrades, etc. Externally might resemble a stock car with period correct mods rather than customs.
* Street machines: Typically American cars with large-displacement engines modified for speed and often appearance.
* Street rod - consist largely of period specific vehicles and components, or emulate visual characteristics of cars through the'40s vintage. There is a great deal of overlap here with [[hot rod]]s.

==Features==
===Paint===
[[File:'34 3-window flame job.JPG|thumb|'32 three-window with a classic-style flame job and [[Dean Moon|Moon]] tank, reminiscent of [[Pete Chapouris|Chapouris]]' [[The California Kid (custom car)|''California Kid'']]]]
Paint was an important concern. Once bodywork was done, the cars were painted unusual colors. Transparent but wildly colored candy-apple paint, applied atop a metallic undercoat, and [[metalflake]] paint, with aluminum glitter within candy-apple paint, appeared in the 1960s. These took many coats to produce a brilliant effect – which in hot climates had a tendency to flake off. This process and style of paint job was invented by Joe Bailon, a customizer from Northern California.

Customizers also continued the habit of adding decorative paint after the main coat was finished, of flames extending rearward from the front wheels, scallops, and hand-painted pinstripes of a contrasting color. The base color, most often a single coat, would be expected to be of a simpler paint. [[Flame job (painting technique)|Flame jobs]] later spread to the hood, encompassing the entire front end, and have progressed from traditional reds and yellows to blues and greens and body-color \"ghost\" flames. One particular style of flames, called \"crab claw flames\", which is still prevalent today, is attributed to Dean Jeffries.<ref>Hotrod magazine, 1999.</ref>

Painting has become such a part of the custom car scene that now in many custom car competitions, awards for custom paint are as highly sought after as awards for the cars themselves.

===Engine swaps===
Engine swaps have always been commonplace. Once, the [[Ford flathead V8 engine]] was the preference, supplanted by the [[Chrysler FirePower engine|early hemi]] in the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s, the [[Chevrolet small-block engine#Small block Chevrolet V8 (1955–1998)|small-block Chevy]] was the most common option, and since the 1980s, the {{convert|350|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} Chevy has been almost ubiquitous.<ref>See any issue of ''Street Rodder'', for instance.</ref> The {{convert|325|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[GM small-block engine#Generation III (1997–2007)|Chevrolet LS]] has begun replacing the 350.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Flatheads and early hemis have not entirely disappeared, but ready availability, ease of maintenance, and low cost of parts make the Chevrolet V8, in particular the first and third generation small block, the most frequent engine of choice.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Once customizing post-war cars caught on, some of the practices were extended to pre-war cars, which would have been called fendered rods, with more body work done on them. An alternate rule for disambiguation developed: hot rods had the engine behind the front suspension, while customs had the engine over the front suspension. The clearest example of this is [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]] prior to 1949 had [[Henry Ford]]'s old transverse front suspension, while 1949 models had a more modern suspension with the engine moved forward. However, an American museum has what could be the first true custom, built by [[Cletus Clobes]] in 1932, among its exhibits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | title=1932 Clobes | publisher=Wheels Through Time Museum | accessdate=2010-10-31 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928062921/http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | archivedate=2008-09-28 }}</ref> With the coming of the muscle car, and further to the high-performance luxury car, customization declined. One place where it persisted was the U.S. Southwest, where [[lowrider]]s were built similar in concept to the earlier customs, but of post-1950s cars.

As the supply of usable antique steel bodies has decreased, companies such [[Westcott Auto Restyling|Westcott's]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.44.</ref> [[Harwood Street Rods|Harwood]], [[Gibbon Fiberglass]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\">''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.&nbsp;43.</ref> and [[Speedway Motors]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\"/> have begun to fabricate new [[fiberglass]] copies,<ref>See, for instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.183.</ref> while [[Classic Manufacturing and Supply]], for one example, has been making a variety of new steel bodies since the 1970s.<ref>''Street Rodder'', 7/94, pp.132-4.</ref> California's \"junker\" (or \"crusher\") law, which pays a nominal sum to take \"gross polluters\" off the road, has been criticized by enthusiasts (and by SEMA) for accelerating this trend.<ref>See, for instance, Dick Wells column \"SRMA Update\", ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.234.</ref> Starting in the 1950s, it became popular among customizers to display their vehicles at drive-in restaurants, such as [[Johnie's Broiler]] in [[Downey, California]]. The practice continues in Southern California.

==Customizers==
Examples of notable customizers include [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]], [[Vini Bergeman]], [[Bill Cushenberry]], the [[The Alexander Brothers|Alexander Brothers]], [[Gil Ayala]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.60.</ref> [[Darryl Starbird]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\">''Street Rodder'', 1/85, p.56.</ref> [[Roy Brizio]], [[Troy Trepanier]] (of [[Rad Rides by Troy]]), [[Boyd Coddington]], [[Darryl Hollenbeck]] (working out of at Vintage Color Studios; winner of the 2016 [[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]] (AMBR) trophy with a custom Deuce)<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\"/> [[Harry Westergaard]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.55.</ref> [[Dave Stuckey]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> [[Dean Jeffries]], [[Barry Lobeck]], [[Phil Cool]] (who won the 1978 AMBR trophy with a bright orange Deuce, cover car for the July 1978 issue of ''Hot Rod''),<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.23.</ref> [[Troy Ladd]] of [[Hollywood Hot Rods]], [[Doane Spencer]] (builder of a 1940s Deuce considered the template for the hiboy),<ref>Shelton, p.29.</ref> [[Ken Fenical|\"Posie\"]],<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/85, p.5.</ref> [[Ron Clark (customizer)|Ron Clark]] and [[Bob Kaiser (customizer)|Bob Kaiser]] (of [[Clarkaiser Custom]]s),<ref>Fetherston, David, \"Detroit Dreams\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.58.</ref> [[Joe Bailon]]<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> (inventor of candy apple paint),<ref>Ganahl, Pat, \"The Candy Man\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.81.</ref> [[Gene Winfield]], [[Rick Dore]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTCkZlTKrGsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22Rick+dore%22&source=bl&ots=5Kr7TMRKmR&sig=SAqsQAkP_wAUlEwNlKsxvLkTm6w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ze8nU4CeA-jhyQGb9IGQDw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22Rick+dore%22&f=false|title=Art of the Hot Rod|first=Ken|last=Gross|date=June 19, 2012|publisher=Motorbooks|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[Joe Wilhelm]], [[Dick Megugorac|\"Magoo\"]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 12/98, p.206.</ref> [[Chip Foose]],<ref>Bishop, Mike, \"The 45th Grand National Roadster Show\", in ''American Rodder'', 6/94, p.27.</ref> and [[Pete Chapouris]].

Others, such as [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch]], are best known as custom painters. Several customizers have become famous beyond the automobile community, including Barris, Jeffries, and Coddington, thanks to their proximity to [[Hollywood]]; Barris designed TV's [[Batmobile]], while Chapouris built the [[The California Kid (custom car)|flamed '34 three-window coupé]] in the eponymous [[television film|telefilm]] \"[[The California Kid]]\". Another Barris creation, [[Ala Kart (custom car)|''Ala Kart'']] (a '29 Ford [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] roadster pickup), made numerous appearances in film (usually in the background of diner scenes and such), after taking two AMBR wins in a row. Some customizers have become well-enough known to be referred to by given name alone. These include Boyd (Coddington), Pete (Chapouris), and Jake (Jim Jacobs).

==Awards==
The highest award for customizers is the AMBR ([[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]]) trophy, presented annually at the Grand National Roadster Show since 1948 (also known within the customizer community as the Oakland Roadster Show until it was moved to Southern California in 2003). This competition has produced famous, and radical, customs.

Another is the [[Ridler Award]], presented at the [[Detroit Autorama]] since 1964 in honor of show promoter Don Ridler. With one of the most unusual of car show entry requirements, winners of the prestigious Ridler Award are selected as the most outstanding from among cars being shown for the first time. This prompts builders of many high-end roadsters to first enter the Autorama first and then the Grand National show in order to have the chance to win top honors at both shows. Few cars and owners can claim this achievement.

==Notable customs==
Some customs gained attention for winning the AMBR trophy, or for their outlandish styling. Notable among these is [[Silhouette (show car)|''Silhouette'']] and [[Ed Roth]]'s [[Mysterion (show rod)|''Mysterion'']]. Some of these more unusual projects turned into [[Hot Wheels]] cars, among them [[The Red Baron (custom car)|''The Red Baron'']].

Other custom cars became notable for appearances in film (such as ''Ala Kart'' {1958},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29 sidebar.</ref> ''The California Kid'' three-window {1973},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29.</ref> or the yellow deuce from \"[[American Graffiti]]\" {1973}) or television (such as ''The [[Monkeemobile]]'', the [[The Munsters|\"Munsters\"]] hearse, or, more recently, Boyd's full-custom [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Tool Time'']] '34, or [[Don Thelan]]'s<ref>Gingerelli, Dain. \"Jake's '34\". Written on June 23, 2005 [http://www.hotrod.com/features/history/articles/0009sr-1934-ford-three-window-coupe-milestone/ ''Hot Rod'' Magazine online] (retrieved 19 June 2015)</ref> '33 three-window, ''Eliminator'', built for the [[ZZ Top]] video<ref>{{cite web| url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/zz-top-eliminator-hot-rod.htm |title=The ZZ Top Eliminator: Profile of a Hot Rod |author=Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |date=2007-09-20 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>). Specialist vehicles, such as the [[Pontiac Trans-Am|T/A]], [[KITT]], from [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|''Knight Rider'']], are not usually considered customs, but movie or TV cars, because they retain a mostly stock exterior.

Still others exemplified a trend. One of these is the '51 Merc built by the Barris brothers for Bob Hirohata in 1953, known forever after as the [[Hirohata Merc]]. Even without an appearance in film (\"Runnin' Wild\"), it is iconic of 1950s customs, and of how to do a Merc right.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, pp.8 & 10.</ref> The same year, [[Neil Emory]] and [[Clayton Jensen]] of [[Valley Custom Shop]] built [[Polynesian (custom car)|''Polynesian'']] for Jack Stewart, starting with a '50 [[Oldsmobile 88#First generation (1949–1953)|Holiday 88 sedan]].<ref>[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)</ref> ''Polynesian'' made the cover of [[Hot Rod Magazine|''Hot Rod'']] in August, and saw 54 pages of construction details in ''[[Motor Trend]] Custom Car Annual'' in 1954.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.68.</ref>

Certain linguistic conventions are followed among rodders and customizers:
* The [[model year]] is rarely given in full,<ref>For instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, ''passim''; ''Rod Action'', 2/78, ''passim''; ''Hot Rod'', October 1987, pp,8, 10, 18, 20, & 22.</ref> except when it might be confused, so a 1934 model is a '34, while a 2005 might be an '05 or not.
** A '32 is usually a Deuce and most often a roadster, unless [[coupé]] is specified, and almost always a Ford, now commonly on [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|A]] [[chassis|frame rails]].<ref name=\"Fortier, Rob p.136\">Fortier, Rob. \"\"A Little Pinch Here, A Little Tuck There\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.136.</ref>
** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 is usually a Chevrolet.
** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 Chevrolet is often called a [[Tri-Five]].
* A 3- or 5-window is usually a Ford, unless specified.
* A flatty is a [[Ford flathead V8 engine|flathead V8]]<ref>''American Rodder'', 6/94, pp.45 & 93.</ref> (always Ford, unless specified); a late (or late model) flatty is probably a [[Mercury (automobile)|Merc]].
* A [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hemi design reintroduced|hemi]] (\"''hem'' ee\") is always a 426, unless displacement (331, 354, or 392) is specified;<ref>Geisert, Eric. \"Tom's Fun Run\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.149cap.</ref> a 426 is a hemi, unless [[Chrysler RB engine#426|Wedge]] is specified. See baby hemi.
* A 392 is an [[Chrysler FirePower engine#392|early hemi]].
** A 331 or 354 is known to be an (early) hemi, but rarely referred to as such
* A 270 \"Jimmy\" was a 270 cubic inch [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#270|GMC truck engine]] often used to replace a smaller displacement Chevrolet six cylinder.
* Units are routinely dropped, unless they are unclear, so a 426 cubic inch (in<sup>3</sup>) displacement engine is simply referred to as a 426, a 5-liter (litre) displacement engine is a 5.0 (\"five point oh\"), and a 600 [[cubic feet per minute]] (cfm) carburetor is a 600. Engine displacement can be described in cubic inches or liters (for example, a 5.7-liter engine is also known as a 350 {\"three fifty\"}); this frequently depends on which units the user is most comfortable or familiar with.<ref name=\"Freiburger, David 1993, p.45\">Freiburger, David. \"Hot Rod Dictionary\", in ''Hot Rod'', July 1993, p.45.</ref>
The \"cutoff year\" as originally promoted by the ''National Street Rod Association'' ([[National Street Rod Association|NSRA]]) is 1949. Many custom car shows will only accept 1948 and earlier models as entries, and many custom car organizations will not admit later model cars or trucks (also with some imports - this has been a gray area of what's acceptable e.g. an aircooled VW Beetle, a Big Three product manufactured overseas e.g. a [[Ford Capri]] built in the UK or a [[Holden|General Motors - Holden's]] product, not to mention [[captive imports|captives]]), and/or a vintage import automobile with an American driveline transplant but this practice is subject to change. Modern day custom car shows which allow the inclusion of [[muscle car]]s have used the 1972 model year as the cutoff since it is considered the end of the muscle car era prior to the introduction of the [[catalytic converter]]. The NSRA has announced that starting in 2011 it will switch to a shifting year method where any owner with a car 30 years or older will be allowed membership. So in 2011 the owner of a 1981 model year vehicle will qualify, then in 2012 the owner of a 1982 model year vehicle will quality, and so on. Additionally, the Goodguys car show organization has moved the year limit for its \"rod\" shows from 1949 to 1954 in recent years.

<!--such as what, exactly?-->

[[File:NHRA Museum.jpg|thumb|Arguably the most famous custom car in the classic style, the [[Hirohata Merc]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Kress |first=Joe |title=Lead Sleds |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9781610590631 |page=10 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IM8me68zmJwC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10 |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref>]]

A '''custom car''' is a passenger [[automobile|vehicle]] that has been either substantially altered to [[engine tuning|improve its performance]], often by altering or replacing the [[engine]] and [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]; made into a personal \"styling\" statement, using paint work and [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] accessories to make the car look unlike any car as delivered from the factory; or some combination of both. A desire among some automotive enthusiasts in the United States is to push \"styling and performance a step beyond the showroom floor - to truly craft an automobile of one's own.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ganahl |first=Pat |title=The American custom car |date=2001 |publisher=MBI |isbn=9780760309506 |url= https://archive.org/details/americancustomca0000gana |url-access=registration |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref> A custom car in British according to ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' is built to the buyer's own specifications.<ref>{{cite web |title=Custom car definition and meaning: Collins English Dictionary |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/custom-car |website=www.collinsdictionary.com |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref>

Although the two are related, custom cars are distinct from [[hot rod]]s. The extent of this difference has been the subject of debate among customizers and rodders for decades. Additionally, a [[street rod (car)|street rod]] can be considered a custom.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Custom cars are not to be confused with [[coachbuilder|coachbuilt]] automobiles, historically [[rolling chassis]] fitted with luxury bodywork by specialty body builders.

==History==
[[File:T-bucket.jpg|thumb|The iconic \"[[T-bucket]]\" custom, with characteristic exposed engine, flat windshield, headers, and open pipes. Soft top (shown) is optional. Also features chrome five-spoke wheels, dropped tube axle, transverse front [[leaf spring]], front [[disc brake]]s, open-face [[air filter|aircleaner]], Weiand [[valve cover]]s, and single [[carburetor#Multiple carburetor barrels|4-barrel]] (probably a [[Rochester Products Division|QJ]]).]]<!--And don't go taking this out & claiming you can't see it; I shot the pictures myself!-->
[[File:Rat rod flatty.jpg|thumb|\"Rat rodded\" [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model A]] with [[Edelbrock]] [[cylinder head|head]] and chrome carb hats on late-model [[Ford V8|flatty]]]]

A development of hot rodding, the change in name corresponded to the change in the [[design]] of the cars being modified. The first hot rods were pre-[[World War II]] cars, with [[running board]]s and simple fenders over the wheels. Early model cars (1929 to 1934) were modified by removing the running boards and either removing the fenders entirely or replacing them with light cycle fenders. Later models usually had fender skirts installed. The \"gow job\" morphed into the hot rod in the early to middle 1950s.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.16.</ref> Typical of builds from before World War II were 1935 Ford [[wire wheel]]s.<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.18.</ref>

Many cars were \"hopped up\" with engine modifications such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads, and dual exhausts. [[Engine swap]]s were often done, with the objective of placing the most powerful engine in the lightest possible frame and body combination.<ref name=\"Custom history\">{{cite web|url= http://www.yourcustomcar.com/custom-car-history.html |title=The evolution of custom cars |accessdate=2016-10-11}}</ref> The suspension was usually altered, initially by lowering the rear end as much as possible using lowering blocks on the rear springs. Later cars were given a rake job by either adding a dropped front axle or heating front coil springs to make the front end of the car much lower than the rear. Immediately postwar, most rods would change from mechanical to hydraulic (\"juice\") brakes and from bulb to sealed-beam headlights.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, pp.18\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, pp.18 and 20.</ref>

The mid-1950s and early 1960s custom Deuce was typically fenderless and steeply chopped, and almost all Ford (or Mercury, with the {{convert|239|cid|cc|abbr=on}} flatty, introduced in 1939<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\">Shelton, p.20.</ref>); a [[Halibrand]] quick-change rearend was also typical, and an [[Edelbrock]] [[intake manifold]] or Harman and Collins [[ignition magneto]] would not be uncommon.<ref>Shelton, pp.17-18.</ref> Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\"/> Aftermarket flatty heads were available from Barney Navarro,<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\">Shelton, p.20 caption.</ref> [[Edelbrock|Vic Edelbrock]], and [[Offenhauser]]. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a \"slingshot\" design for the flatty.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\"/> Front suspension hairpins were adapted from [[sprint car]]s, such as the [[Kurtis Kraft]]s.<ref>Shelton, p.24 and p.26 caption.</ref> The first Jimmy [[Supercharging|supercharger]] on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.<ref>Shelton, p.26 caption.</ref>

Much later, rods and customs swapped the old solid rear axle for an independent rear, often from [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]. Sometimes the grille of one make of car replaced another; the 1937 [[Buick]] grille was often used on a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the grille swap of choice was the 1953 [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]]. The original hot rods were plainly painted like the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Model A Fords]] from which they had been built up, and only slowly begun to take on colors, and eventually fancy orange-yellow flamed hoods or \"candy-like\" deep acrylic finishes in the various colors.<ref name=\"Custom history\" />

With the change in automobile design to encase the wheels in fenders and to extend the hood to the full width of the car, the former practices were no longer possible. In addition, tremendous automotive advertising raised public interest in the new models in the 1950s. Thus, custom cars came into existence, swapping [[headlamp]] rings, grilles, bumpers, [[Chrome plating|chrome]] side strips, and taillights as well as [[Frenching (automobile)|frenching]] and tunnelling head- and taillights. The bodies of the cars were changed by cutting through the sheet metal, removing bits to make the car lower, welding it back together, and adding [[lead]] to make the resulting form smooth (hence the term [[lead sled]]; [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] has since largely replaced lead.) [[Chopped and channeled#Chopping|Chopping]] made the roof lower<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/78, p.64.</ref> while [[Chopped and channeled#Sectioning|sectioning]]<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.15; ''Custom Rodder'' 1/97, p.29.</ref> made the body thinner from top to bottom. [[Chopped and channeled#Channeling|Channeling]]<ref>Jezek, George. \"The All Deuce Round-Up\", in ''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.58.</ref> was cutting notches in the floorpan where the body touches the frame to lower the whole body. Fins were often added from other cars, or made up from sheet steel. In the custom car culture, someone who merely changed the appearance without also substantially improving the performance was looked down upon. ''[[Juxtapoz Magazine]]'', founded by the artist [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], has covered [[Kustom Kulture]] art.

==Customization style==
[[File:Fuzzy dice 2.jpg|thumb|'55-7 Chevy with fuzzy dice]] <!--fuzzy dice are practically required-->
[[File:Ed Roth 'bloodshot eyeball'.jpg|thumb|[[Ed Roth|'Big Daddy' Roth]] 'bloodshot eyeball' [[shift knob]] was a 1960s craze.]]

Custom cars are distinct from cars in stock condition. Builders may adopt the visual and performance characteristics of some relevant modification styles, and combine these as desired. There are now several different custom themes, including:
* [[Rat rod]]: imitates (or exaggerates) the \"unfinished\" and amateur-built appearance of hot rods of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s
* Restomod - restored and modernized. Safety and convenience upgrades, such as disc brakes, AC, etc., but can include fuel injection and overdrive upgrades, etc. Externally might resemble a stock car with period correct mods rather than customs.
* Street machines: Typically American cars with large-displacement engines modified for speed and often appearance.
* Street rod - consist largely of period specific vehicles and components, or emulate visual characteristics of cars through the'40s vintage. There is a great deal of overlap here with [[hot rod]]s.

==Features==
===Paint===
[[File:'34 3-window flame job.JPG|thumb|'32 three-window with a classic-style flame job and [[Dean Moon|Moon]] tank, reminiscent of [[Pete Chapouris|Chapouris]]' [[The California Kid (custom car)|''California Kid'']]]]
Paint was an important concern. Once bodywork was done, the cars were painted unusual colors. Transparent but wildly colored candy-apple paint, applied atop a metallic undercoat, and [[metalflake]] paint, with aluminum glitter within candy-apple paint, appeared in the 1960s. These took many coats to produce a brilliant effect – which in hot climates had a tendency to flake off. This process and style of paint job was invented by Joe Bailon, a customizer from Northern California.

Customizers also continued the habit of adding decorative paint after the main coat was finished, of flames extending rearward from the front wheels, scallops, and hand-painted pinstripes of a contrasting color. The base color, most often a single coat, would be expected to be of a simpler paint. [[Flame job (painting technique)|Flame jobs]] later spread to the hood, encompassing the entire front end, and have progressed from traditional reds and yellows to blues and greens and body-color \"ghost\" flames. One particular style of flames, called \"crab claw flames\", which is still prevalent today, is attributed to Dean Jeffries.<ref>Hotrod magazine, 1999.</ref>

Painting has become such a part of the custom car scene that now in many custom car competitions, awards for custom paint are as highly sought after as awards for the cars themselves.

===Engine swaps===
Engine swaps have always been commonplace. Once, the [[Ford flathead V8 engine]] was the preference, supplanted by the [[Chrysler FirePower engine|early hemi]] in the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s, the [[Chevrolet small-block engine#Small block Chevrolet V8 (1955–1998)|small-block Chevy]] was the most common option, and since the 1980s, the {{convert|350|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} Chevy has been almost ubiquitous.<ref>See any issue of ''Street Rodder'', for instance.</ref> The {{convert|325|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[GM small-block engine#Generation III (1997–2007)|Chevrolet LS]] has begun replacing the 350.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Flatheads and early hemis have not entirely disappeared, but ready availability, ease of maintenance, and low cost of parts make the Chevrolet V8, in particular the first and third generation small block, the most frequent engine of choice.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Once customizing post-war cars caught on, some of the practices were extended to pre-war cars, which would have been called fendered rods, with more body work done on them. An alternate rule for disambiguation developed: hot rods had the engine behind the front suspension, while customs had the engine over the front suspension. The clearest example of this is [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]] prior to 1949 had [[Henry Ford]]'s old transverse front suspension, while 1949 models had a more modern suspension with the engine moved forward. However, an American museum has what could be the first true custom, built by [[Cletus Clobes]] in 1932, among its exhibits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | title=1932 Clobes | publisher=Wheels Through Time Museum | accessdate=2010-10-31 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928062921/http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | archivedate=2008-09-28 }}</ref> With the coming of the muscle car, and further to the high-performance luxury car, customization declined. One place where it persisted was the U.S. Southwest, where [[lowrider]]s were built similar in concept to the earlier customs, but of post-1950s cars.

As the supply of usable antique steel bodies has decreased, companies such [[Westcott Auto Restyling|Westcott's]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.44.</ref> [[Harwood Street Rods|Harwood]], [[Gibbon Fiberglass]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\">''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.&nbsp;43.</ref> and [[Speedway Motors]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\"/> have begun to fabricate new [[fiberglass]] copies,<ref>See, for instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.183.</ref> while [[Classic Manufacturing and Supply]], for one example, has been making a variety of new steel bodies since the 1970s.<ref>''Street Rodder'', 7/94, pp.132-4.</ref> California's \"junker\" (or \"crusher\") law, which pays a nominal sum to take \"gross polluters\" off the road, has been criticized by enthusiasts (and by SEMA) for accelerating this trend.<ref>See, for instance, Dick Wells column \"SRMA Update\", ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.234.</ref> Starting in the 1950s, it became popular among customizers to display their vehicles at drive-in restaurants, such as [[Johnie's Broiler]] in [[Downey, California]]. The practice continues in Southern California.

==Customizers==
Examples of notable customizers include [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]], [[Bill Cushenberry]], the [[The Alexander Brothers|Alexander Brothers]], [[Gil Ayala]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.60.</ref> [[Darryl Starbird]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\">''Street Rodder'', 1/85, p.56.</ref> [[Roy Brizio]], [[Troy Trepanier]] (of [[Rad Rides by Troy]]), [[Boyd Coddington]], [[Darryl Hollenbeck]] (working out of at Vintage Color Studios; winner of the 2016 [[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]] (AMBR) trophy with a custom Deuce)<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\"/> [[Harry Westergaard]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.55.</ref> [[Dave Stuckey]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> [[Dean Jeffries]], [[Barry Lobeck]], [[Phil Cool]] (who won the 1978 AMBR trophy with a bright orange Deuce, cover car for the July 1978 issue of ''Hot Rod''),<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.23.</ref> [[Troy Ladd]] of [[Hollywood Hot Rods]], [[Doane Spencer]] (builder of a 1940s Deuce considered the template for the hiboy),<ref>Shelton, p.29.</ref> [[Ken Fenical|\"Posie\"]],<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/85, p.5.</ref> [[Ron Clark (customizer)|Ron Clark]] and [[Bob Kaiser (customizer)|Bob Kaiser]] (of [[Clarkaiser Custom]]s),<ref>Fetherston, David, \"Detroit Dreams\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.58.</ref> [[Joe Bailon]]<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> (inventor of candy apple paint),<ref>Ganahl, Pat, \"The Candy Man\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.81.</ref> [[Gene Winfield]], [[Rick Dore]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTCkZlTKrGsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22Rick+dore%22&source=bl&ots=5Kr7TMRKmR&sig=SAqsQAkP_wAUlEwNlKsxvLkTm6w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ze8nU4CeA-jhyQGb9IGQDw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22Rick+dore%22&f=false|title=Art of the Hot Rod|first=Ken|last=Gross|date=June 19, 2012|publisher=Motorbooks|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[Joe Wilhelm]], [[Dick Megugorac|\"Magoo\"]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 12/98, p.206.</ref> [[Chip Foose]],<ref>Bishop, Mike, \"The 45th Grand National Roadster Show\", in ''American Rodder'', 6/94, p.27.</ref> and [[Pete Chapouris]].

Others, such as [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch]], are best known as custom painters. Several customizers have become famous beyond the automobile community, including Barris, Jeffries, and Coddington, thanks to their proximity to [[Hollywood]]; Barris designed TV's [[Batmobile]], while Chapouris built the [[The California Kid (custom car)|flamed '34 three-window coupé]] in the eponymous [[television film|telefilm]] \"[[The California Kid]]\". Another Barris creation, [[Ala Kart (custom car)|''Ala Kart'']] (a '29 Ford [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] roadster pickup), made numerous appearances in film (usually in the background of diner scenes and such), after taking two AMBR wins in a row. Some customizers have become well-enough known to be referred to by given name alone. These include Boyd (Coddington), Pete (Chapouris), and Jake (Jim Jacobs).

==Awards==
The highest award for customizers is the AMBR ([[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]]) trophy, presented annually at the Grand National Roadster Show since 1948 (also known within the customizer community as the Oakland Roadster Show until it was moved to Southern California in 2003). This competition has produced famous, and radical, customs.

Another is the [[Ridler Award]], presented at the [[Detroit Autorama]] since 1964 in honor of show promoter Don Ridler. With one of the most unusual of car show entry requirements, winners of the prestigious Ridler Award are selected as the most outstanding from among cars being shown for the first time. This prompts builders of many high-end roadsters to first enter the Autorama first and then the Grand National show in order to have the chance to win top honors at both shows. Few cars and owners can claim this achievement.

==Notable customs==
Some customs gained attention for winning the AMBR trophy, or for their outlandish styling. Notable among these is [[Silhouette (show car)|''Silhouette'']] and [[Ed Roth]]'s [[Mysterion (show rod)|''Mysterion'']]. Some of these more unusual projects turned into [[Hot Wheels]] cars, among them [[The Red Baron (custom car)|''The Red Baron'']].

Other custom cars became notable for appearances in film (such as ''Ala Kart'' {1958},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29 sidebar.</ref> ''The California Kid'' three-window {1973},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29.</ref> or the yellow deuce from \"[[American Graffiti]]\" {1973}) or television (such as ''The [[Monkeemobile]]'', the [[The Munsters|\"Munsters\"]] hearse, or, more recently, Boyd's full-custom [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Tool Time'']] '34, or [[Don Thelan]]'s<ref>Gingerelli, Dain. \"Jake's '34\". Written on June 23, 2005 [http://www.hotrod.com/features/history/articles/0009sr-1934-ford-three-window-coupe-milestone/ ''Hot Rod'' Magazine online] (retrieved 19 June 2015)</ref> '33 three-window, ''Eliminator'', built for the [[ZZ Top]] video<ref>{{cite web| url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/zz-top-eliminator-hot-rod.htm |title=The ZZ Top Eliminator: Profile of a Hot Rod |author=Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |date=2007-09-20 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>). Specialist vehicles, such as the [[Pontiac Trans-Am|T/A]], [[KITT]], from [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|''Knight Rider'']], are not usually considered customs, but movie or TV cars, because they retain a mostly stock exterior.

Still others exemplified a trend. One of these is the '51 Merc built by the Barris brothers for Bob Hirohata in 1953, known forever after as the [[Hirohata Merc]]. Even without an appearance in film (\"Runnin' Wild\"), it is iconic of 1950s customs, and of how to do a Merc right.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, pp.8 & 10.</ref> The same year, [[Neil Emory]] and [[Clayton Jensen]] of [[Valley Custom Shop]] built [[Polynesian (custom car)|''Polynesian'']] for Jack Stewart, starting with a '50 [[Oldsmobile 88#First generation (1949–1953)|Holiday 88 sedan]].<ref>[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)</ref> ''Polynesian'' made the cover of [[Hot Rod Magazine|''Hot Rod'']] in August, and saw 54 pages of construction details in ''[[Motor Trend]] Custom Car Annual'' in 1954.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.68.</ref>

Certain linguistic conventions are followed among rodders and customizers:
* The [[model year]] is rarely given in full,<ref>For instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, ''passim''; ''Rod Action'', 2/78, ''passim''; ''Hot Rod'', October 1987, pp,8, 10, 18, 20, & 22.</ref> except when it might be confused, so a 1934 model is a '34, while a 2005 might be an '05 or not.
** A '32 is usually a Deuce and most often a roadster, unless [[coupé]] is specified, and almost always a Ford, now commonly on [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|A]] [[chassis|frame rails]].<ref name=\"Fortier, Rob p.136\">Fortier, Rob. \"\"A Little Pinch Here, A Little Tuck There\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.136.</ref>
** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 is usually a Chevrolet.
** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 Chevrolet is often called a [[Tri-Five]].
* A 3- or 5-window is usually a Ford, unless specified.
* A flatty is a [[Ford flathead V8 engine|flathead V8]]<ref>''American Rodder'', 6/94, pp.45 & 93.</ref> (always Ford, unless specified); a late (or late model) flatty is probably a [[Mercury (automobile)|Merc]].
* A [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hemi design reintroduced|hemi]] (\"''hem'' ee\") is always a 426, unless displacement (331, 354, or 392) is specified;<ref>Geisert, Eric. \"Tom's Fun Run\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.149cap.</ref> a 426 is a hemi, unless [[Chrysler RB engine#426|Wedge]] is specified. See baby hemi.
* A 392 is an [[Chrysler FirePower engine#392|early hemi]].
** A 331 or 354 is known to be an (early) hemi, but rarely referred to as such
* A 270 \"Jimmy\" was a 270 cubic inch [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#270|GMC truck engine]] often used to replace a smaller displacement Chevrolet six cylinder.
* Units are routinely dropped, unless they are unclear, so a 426 cubic inch (in<sup>3</sup>) displacement engine is simply referred to as a 426, a 5-liter (litre) displacement engine is a 5.0 (\"five point oh\"), and a 600 [[cubic feet per minute]] (cfm) carburetor is a 600. Engine displacement can be described in cubic inches or liters (for example, a 5.7-liter engine is also known as a 350 {\"three fifty\"}); this frequently depends on which units the user is most comfortable or familiar with.<ref name=\"Freiburger, David 1993, p.45\">Freiburger, David. \"Hot Rod Dictionary\", in ''Hot Rod'', July 1993, p.45.</ref>
The \"cutoff year\" as originally promoted by the ''National Street Rod Association'' ([[National Street Rod Association|NSRA]]) is 1949. Many custom car shows will only accept 1948 and earlier models as entries, and many custom car organizations will not admit later model cars or trucks (also with some imports - this has been a gray area of what's acceptable e.g. an aircooled VW Beetle, a Big Three product manufactured overseas e.g. a [[Ford Capri]] built in the UK or a [[Holden|General Motors - Holden's]] product, not to mention [[captive imports|captives]]), and/or a vintage import automobile with an American driveline transplant but this practice is subject to change. Modern day custom car shows which allow the inclusion of [[muscle car]]s have used the 1972 model year as the cutoff since it is considered the end of the muscle car era prior to the introduction of the [[catalytic converter]]. The NSRA has announced that starting in 2011 it will switch to a shifting year method where any owner with a car 30 years or older will be allowed membership. So in 2011 the owner of a 1981 model year vehicle will qualify, then in 2012 the owner of a 1982 model year vehicle will quality, and so on. Additionally, the Goodguys car show organization has moved the year limit for its \"rod\" shows from 1949 to 1954 in recent years.

Trading routes dating from the ancient and early medieval periods of [[Maritime history of Somalia|Somali maritime enterprise]] were strengthened or re-established, and foreign trade and commerce in the coastal provinces flourished with ships sailing to and coming from many kingdoms and empires in [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Europe]], the [[Near East]], [[North Africa]] and [[East Africa]].<ref name=\"Shapes\">{{cite book|last=Shelley|first=Fred M.|title=Nation Shapes: The Story behind the World's Borders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5qlXatHRJtMC&pg=PA358|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-106-2|page=358}}</ref>

The sultanate left an extensive [[Somali architecture|architectural legacy]], being one of the major medieval Somali powers engaged in castle and [[fortress]] building.

As an [[hydraulic empire]], the Ajuran monopolized the [[water resources]] of the [[Shebelle River|Shebelle]] and [[Jubba river]]s. Through [[hydraulic engineering]], it also constructed many of the [[limestone]] [[Water well|wells]] and [[cistern]]s of the state that are still operative and in use today. The rulers developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the [[Horn of Africa]] as late as the 19th century.<ref name=\"His 40\"/> The rule of the later Ajuran rulers caused multiple rebellions to break out in the sultanate, and at the end of the 17th century, the [[Ajuran Sultanate#Decline and successor states|Ajuran state disintegrated]] into several successor kingdoms and states, the most prominent being the [[Geledi Sultanate]].{{sfnp|Njoku|2013|page=41}}

==Location==
The Ajuran Sultanate's sphere of influence in the [[Horn of Africa]] was one of the largest in the region.

==Origins and the House of Garen==
{{House of Gareen}}
The House of Garen was the ruling hereditary [[dynasty]] of the Ajuran Sultanate.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |first=I.

==Administration==
{{main|Somali aristocratic and court titles}}
[[File:Marka,Somalia.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The city of [[Merca]] was one of several prominent [[administrative center]]s of the Ajurans.]]
The Ajuran nobility used many of the typical [[Somali aristocratic and court titles]], with the Garen rulers styled [[Somali aristocratic and court titles#Rulers|Imam]]. These leaders were the sultanate's highest authority, and counted multiple [[Sultan]]s, [[Emir]]s, and [[Monarch|Kings]] as clients or [[vassal]]s. The Garen rulers also had seasonal palaces in [[Mareeg]], [[Kelafo|Qelafo]] and [[Merca]], which they would periodically visit to practice ''[[primae noctis]]''.<ref name=\"Crescent\" /> Other important cities in the Sultanate were Mogadishu and [[Barawa]]. The state religion was [[Islam]], and thus law was based on [[Sharia]].

==Nomadic citizens and farming communities==
[[File:Juba river downstream Jamaame.jpg|thumb|160px|left|The [[Jubba River]].]]
[[File:Afgoye, Somalia.JPG|thumb|right|225px|Farms of [[Afgooye]].]]
Through their control of the region's wells, the Garen rulers effectively held a monopoly over their [[nomadic]] subjects as they were the only [[hydraulic empire]] in Africa during their reign. Large wells made out of [[limestone]] were constructed throughout the state, which attracted [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Oromo people|Oromo]] nomads with their livestock. The centralized regulations of the wells made it easier for the nomads to settle disputes by taking their queries to government officials who would act as mediators. Long distance caravan trade, a long-time practice in the Horn of Africa, continued unchanged in Ajuran times. Today, numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia and the Horn of Africa are evidence of a once-booming inland trade network dating from the medieval period.{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=149}}

With the centralized supervision of the Ajuran, farms in [[Afgooye]], [[Kismayo]] and other areas in the [[Jubba Valley|Jubba]] and [[Shebelle Valley|Shabelle]] valleys increased their productivity. A system of irrigation ditches known locally as ''Kelliyo'' fed directly from the [[Shebelle River|Shebelle]] and [[Jubba river]]s into the plantations where [[sorghum]], [[maize]], beans, grain and cotton were grown during the ''gu'' ([[Spring (season)|Spring]] in Somali) and ''xagaa'' ([[Summer]] in Somali) seasons of the [[Somali calendar]]. This irrigation system was supported by numerous [[Levee|dikes]] and dams. To determine the average size of a farm, a land measurement system was also invented with ''moos'', ''taraab'' and ''guldeed'' being the terms used.

==Taxation==

[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|left|thumb|185px|[[Architecture of Somalia|Stone city]] of [[Gondershe]].]]
The State collected [[tribute]] from the farmers in the form of harvested products like [[durra]], sorghum and bun, and from the nomads, cattle, camels and goats. The collecting of tribute was done by a [[Vizier|wazir]]. Luxury goods imported from foreign lands were also presented as gifts to the Garen rulers by the coastal [[sultan]]s of the state.

A political device that was implemented by the Garen rulers in their realm was a form of ''[[ius primae noctis]]'',{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} which enabled them to create marriages that enforced their [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] rule over all the important groups of the empire. The rulers would also claim a large portion of the bride's wealth, which at the time was 100 camels.

For trade, the Ajuran Sultanate minted its own [[Ajuran currency]].<ref name=\"Stgi\"/> It also utilized the [[Mogadishu currency|Mogadishan currency]] originally minted by the [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], which later became incorporated into the Ajuran sultanate.<ref name=\"Cites\">{{cite book |first=Bruce |last=Stanley |chapter=Mogadishu |editor-last1=Dumper |editor-first1=Michael |editor-last2=Stanley |editor-first2=Bruce E. |title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA253|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-919-5|page=253}}</ref> Mogadishan coins have been found as far away as the present-day country of the [[United Arab Emirates]] in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=\"Ncaaroth\">{{cite book|last=Chittick|first=H.

The urban centers of [[Merca]], [[Mogadishu]], [[Barawa]], and their respective ports became profitable trade outlets for commodities originating from the interior of the State. The farming communities of the hinterland brought their products to the coastal cities, where they were sold to local merchants who maintained a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from [[Arabia]], [[India]], [[Venetian Republic|Venice]],<ref>Journal of African History pg.50 by John Donnelly Fage and Roland Anthony Oliver{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}}</ref> [[Persia]], [[Egypt]], [[Portugal]], and as far away as [[China]].

The Ajuran sultanate relied on agriculture and trade for most of its income. Major agricultural towns were located on the [[Shebelle River|Shebelle]] and [[Jubba river]]s, including [[Kismayo]] and [[Afgooye]]. Situated at the junction of some of the busiest medieval trade routes, the Ajuran and its clients were active participants in the East African [[Gold|gold trade]], the [[Silk road|Silk Road commerce]], [[Indian Ocean trade|trade in the Indian Ocean]], and commercial enterprise as far as [[East Asia]].

==Diplomacy==

With their maritime pursuits and history, the Sultanate established trading and diplomatic ties across the old world, especially in Asia – from being a close ally to the grand power of the [[Ottomans]] to having cordial ties to the mighty [[Ming Dynasty]], even having their merchants following of the greatest maritime expedition in their history as far as [[Java]] and [[Vietnam]].<ref name=\"Shelley2013\">{{cite book|author=Fred M.

The ruler of the [[Somali people|Somali]] Ajuran Empire sent ambassadors to [[China]] to establish diplomatic ties, creating the first ever recorded African community in China and the most notable [[Somali people|Somali]] ambassador in medieval China was [[Sa'id of Mogadishu]] who was the first African man to set foot in [[China]]. In return, Emperor Yongle, the third emperor of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), dispatched one of the largest fleets in history to trade with the Somali nation. The fleet, under the leadership of the famed Hui Muslim [[Zheng He]], arrived at [[Mogadishu]] the capital of Ajuran Empire while the city was at its zenith.

==Muslim migration==
[[File:Night Halt Zaman Louvre MAO1226.jpg|thumb|right|169px|Many [[Arab]] and [[Persia]]n families would call the Ajuran realm their home.]]
The late 15th and 17th centuries saw the arrival of Muslim families from [[Arabia]], [[Persia]], [[India]] and [[Spain]] to the Ajuran Sultanate, the majority of whom settled in the coastal provinces. Some migrated because of the instability in their respective regions,{{sfnp|Luling|2002|p=18}} as was the case with the [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] families from the [[Yemen]] and the Muslims from Spain fleeing the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]].<ref>The origins and development of Mogadishu pg. 34 by Ahmed Dueleh Jama</ref> Others came to conduct business or for religious purposes.

===Sofala===
[[File:Sofala1683.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Somali merchants from Mogadishu established a colony in [[Mozambique]] to extract gold from the mines in [[Sofala]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">pg 4 – The quest for an African Eldorado: Sofala, By Terry H. Elkiss</ref>]]
[[Sofala]] is located on the [[Sofala Bank]] in [[Sofala Province]] of [[Mozambique]]. It was founded by [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Maritime history of Somalia|merchants and seafarers]]. Sofala in [[Somali language|Somali]] literally means \"Go dig\". This name was given because the area is rich with resources.<ref name=\"Horizon History 143\">''The Horizon History of Africa'', vol. 1, p. 143.</ref>
 
One of the oldest harbours documented in [[Southern Africa]], medieval Sofala was erected on the edge of a wide estuary formed by the [[Buzi River (Mozambique)|Buzi River]] (called ''Rio de Sofala'' in older maps). By the [[Somali people|Somali]] merchants from Mogadishu, the capital of the [[Ajuran Empire]], established a colony in [[Mozambique]] to extract gold from the mines in Sofala.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>
 
The Buzi River connected Sofala to the internal market town of [[Manica, Mozambique|Manica]], and from there to the gold fields of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. Sometime in the 10th century, Sofala emerged as a small trading post and was incorporated into the greater global Somali trade network. In the 1180s, Sultan Suleiman Hassan of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (in present-day [[Tanzania]]) seized control of Sofala, and brought Sofala into the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] and the [[Swahili culture|Swahili]] cultural sphere.the man behind the conquest: Mogadishu merchants had long kept Sofala a secret from their Kilwan rivals, who up until then rarely sailed beyond Cape Delgado. One day, a fisherman caught a large bite off Kilwa and was dragged by the fish around Cape Delgado, through the Mozambique Channe, all the way down to the Sofala banks. The fisherman made his way back up to Kilwa to report to the Sultan Suleiman Hassan what he had seen. Hearing of the gold trade, the sultan loaded up a ship with cloth and immediately raced down there, guided by the fisherman. The Kilwan sultan offered a better deal to the Mwenemutapa, and was allowed to erect a Kilwan factory and colony on the island and nudge the Mogadishans permanently out.
<ref>Portuguese chronicler [[João de Barros]] (Dec. I, Lib. 10, Cap. 2 (p. 388 ff.) relates the fable behind the conquest: Mogadishu merchants had long kept Sofala a secret from their Kilwan rivals, who up until then rarely sailed beyond [[Cape Delgado]]. One day, a fisherman caught a large bite off Kilwa and was dragged by the fish around Cape Delgado, through the [[Mozambique Channel]], all the way down to the Sofala banks.

===Maldives Islands===
The first king of the [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] [[Hilaalee dynasty]] was proclaimed king in the year 1388 AD. [[Hilaalee dynasty]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] Dynasty. Some historical writing and some folklores reveal that this Dynasty is from [[Somali people|Somali]] descent. It seems they were travellers and traders of [[Ajuran Empire]] where they established a colony in [[Maldive]] islands. They settled in Hlhule' in Male' atoll. Some historical documents reveal that Hilali Kalo Hassan dethroned King Uthman Rasgefaan, who reveal the ruling King at that time and outcast him and all his ministers. After his Hilai Kalo Hassan started the Hilai Dynasty. The [[Hilaalee dynasty]] was a sub-dynasty of [[Garen Dynasty]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Dhivehi raajje: a portrait of Maldives By Adrian Neville pg 6</ref><ref name=\"Maldivian Links with Eastern Africa\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpamedia.com/history/maldives_east_africa/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101031957/http://www.cpamedia.com/history/maldives_east_africa/|url-status=dead|title=Maldivian Links with Eastern Africa|archivedate=1 January 2010}}</ref>
 
[[Abd al-Aziz of Mogadishu]] was a Somali governor of Maldives islands and a famous member of the [[Hilaalee dynasty]].
 
The presence and high position of Abd al-Aziz in this region highlights the close connections between [[History of the Maldives|medieval Maldives]] and the Somali seamen from [[Mogadishu]] sailing the [[Indian Ocean]]. They supplied Maldivian traders with exotic animals and [[musk]], and contributed to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Maldivian population.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Maldivian Links with Eastern Africa\"/>

[[File:Mogadishan ship.JPG|200px|thumb|right|[[Physical model|Model]] of a medieval [[Mogadishu|Mogadishan]] [[ship]].]]
The Ajuran State had a standing army with which the Garen imams and the governors ruled and protected their subjects. The bulk of the army consisted of [[mamluke]] soldiers,{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=90}} who did not have any loyalties to the traditional Somali clan system, thereby making them more reliable. The soldiers were recruited from the inter-riverine area; other recruits came from the surrounding nomadic region. [[Arab]], [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] mercenaries were at times employed as well.{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=104}}<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Welch|first=Sidney R.|title=Portuguese rule and Spanish crown in South Africa, 1581–1640|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3Q_AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA29|year=1950|publisher=Juta}}</ref>

In the early Ajuran period, the army's weapons consisted of traditional Somali weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, [[battle axe]], and [[bow (weapon)|bows]]. The Sultanate received assistance from its close ally the [[Ottoman Empire]], and with the import of [[firearms]] through the Muzzaffar port of [[Mogadishu]], the army began acquiring [[muskets]] and [[cannons]]. The Ottomans would also remain a key ally during the [[Ajuran Sultanate#Ajuran-Portuguese wars|Ajuran-Portuguese wars]]. Horses used for military purposes were also raised in the interior, and numerous stone fortifications were erected to provide shelter for the army in the coastal districts.{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=92}} In each province, the soldiers were under the supervision of a military commander known as an [[emir]],{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=90}} and the coastal areas and the [[Indian ocean]] trade were protected by a [[navy]].{{sfnp|Welch|1950|p=25}}

[[File:Ottoman fleet Indian Ocean 16th century.jpg|thumb|left|140px|The Ottomans regularly aided the Ajurans in their struggles with the Portuguese in the [[Indian Ocean]].]]
[[File:Hanno.cunha.jpg|thumb|180px|right|During the Battle of [[Barawa]], ''[[Tristão da Cunha]]'' was wounded and requested to be [[knight]]ed by [[Afonso de Albuquerque|Albuquerque]].<ref>Maritime Discovery: A History of Nautical Exploration from the Earliest Times pg 198</ref>]]
The [[Europe]]an [[Age of discovery]] brought Europe's then [[superpower]] the [[Portuguese empire]] to the coast of East Africa, which at the time enjoyed a flourishing trade with foreign nations. The wealthy southeastern city-states of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], [[Mombasa]], [[Malindi]], [[Pate Island|Pate]] and [[Lamu]] were all systematically sacked and plundered by the Portuguese. [[Tristão da Cunha]] then set his eyes on Ajuran territory, where the battle of [[Barawa]] was fought. After a long period of engagement, the Portuguese soldiers burned the city and looted it. However, fierce resistance by the local population and soldiers resulted in the failure of the Portuguese to permanently occupy the city, and the inhabitants who had fled to the interior would eventually return and rebuild the city. After Barawa, Tristão would set sail for [[Mogadishu]], which was the richest city on the East African coast. But word had spread of what had happened in Barawa, and a large troop mobilization had taken place. Many horsemen, soldiers and battleships in defense positions were now guarding the city. Nevertheless, Tristão still opted to storm and attempt to conquer the city, although every officer and soldier in his army opposed this, fearing certain defeat if they were to engage their opponents in battle. Tristão heeded their advice and sailed for [[Socotra]] instead.<ref>The History of the Portuguese, During the Reign of Emmanuel pg.287</ref> After the battle the city of Barawa quickly recovered from the attack.<ref>The book of Duarte Barbosa – Page 30</ref>

Over the next several decades Somali-[[Portugal|Portuguese]] tensions would remain high and the increased contact between Somali [[sailors]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Privateer|corsairs]] worried the Portuguese who sent a punitive expedition against Mogadishu under [[João de Sepúlveda]], which was unsuccessful.<ref>The Portuguese period in East Africa – p. 112</ref> Ottoman-Somali cooperation against the Portuguese in the [[Indian Ocean]] reached a high point in the 1580s when Ajuran clients of the Somali coastal cities began to sympathize with the [[Arabs]] and [[Swahili people|Swahilis]] under Portuguese rule and sent an envoy to the Turkish corsair [[Mir Ali Bey]] for a joint expedition against the Portuguese. He agreed and was joined by a Somali [[Naval fleet|fleet]], which began attacking Portuguese colonies in [[Swahili Coast|Southeast Africa]].{{sfnp|Welch|1950|p=25}}

The Somali-Ottoman offensive managed to drive out the Portuguese from several important cities such as [[Pate Island|Pate]], [[Mombasa]] and [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]]. However, the Portuguese governor sent envoys to [[Portuguese India]] requesting a large Portuguese fleet. This request was answered and it reversed the previous offensive of the Muslims into one of defense. The Portuguese armada managed to re-take most of the lost cities and began punishing their leaders, but they refrained from attacking Mogadishu, securing the city's autonomy in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=\"Cites\"/><ref>Four centuries of Swahili verse: a literary history and anthology – p. 11</ref> Ajuran's Somali forces would eventually militarily defeat the Portuguese.

==Oromo invasion==
{{main|Oromo migrations}}
[[File:Somali Enterprise.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[maritime history of Somalia|Somali maritime enterprise]] took a significant hit after the collapse of the Ajuran Sultanate. However, other [[Somali people|Somali]] polities such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the [[Geledi Sultanate]], the [[Majeerteen Sultanate]], the [[Dervish state]] and the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ensured its continuity.]]
In the mid-17th century, the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] Nation began expanding from its homeland around [[Lake Abaya]] in southern [[Ethiopia]] towards the southern Somali coast at the time when the Ajuran was at the height of its power.{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=114}}<ref>Cerulli, Somalia 1: 65–67</ref> The Garen rulers conducted several military expeditions known as the ''Gaal Madow'' wars against the Oromo warriors, converting those that were captured to [[Islam]]. The Ajuran military supremacy forced the Oromo conquerors to reverse their migrations towards the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonids]] and the [[Muslim]] [[Adal Sultanate|Adalites]], devastating the two warring empires in the process.

==Decline and successor states==
The Ajuran Sultanate slowly declined in power at the end of the 17th century, which paved the way for the ascendance of new Somali powers. The most prominent setbacks against the state were the dethronement of the [[Sultanate of Mogadishu|Muzzaffar]] clients in [[Mogadishu]] and other coastal cities by the [[Hawiye]] Hiraab [[King]],{{sfnp|Lewis|1988|page=37}} and the defeat of the [[Silcis|Silis Kingdom]] by a former Ajuran general, [[Ibrahim Adeer]], in the interior of the state who then established the [[Gobroon dynasty]]. Taxation and the practice of primae noctis were the main catalysts for the revolts against Ajuran rulers. The loss of port cities and fertile farms meant that much needed sources of revenue were lost to the rebels.

==Administration==

[[File:Marka,Somalia.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The city of [[Merca]] was one of several prominent [[administrative center]]s of the Ajurans.]]
The Ajuran nobility used many of the typical [[Somali aristocratic and court titles]], with the Garen rulers styled [[Somali aristocratic and court titles#Rulers|Imam]]. These leaders were the empire's highest authority, and counted multiple [[Sultan]]s, [[Emir]]s, and [[Monarch|Kings]] as clients or [[vassal]]s. The Garen rulers also had seasonal palaces in [[Mareeg]], [[Kelafo|Qelafo]] and [[Merca]], which they would periodically visit to practice ''[[primae noctis]]''.<ref name=\"Crescent\" /> Other important cities in the Empire were Mogadishu and [[Barawa]]. The state religion was [[Islam]], and thus law was based on [[Sharia]].

==Nomadic citizens and farming communities==

[[File:Afgoye, Somalia.JPG|thumb|right|225px|Farms of [[Afgooye]].]]
Through their control of the region's wells, the Garen rulers effectively held a monopoly over their [[nomadic]] subjects as they were the only [[hydraulic empire]] in Africa during their reign. Large wells made out of [[limestone]] were constructed throughout the state, which attracted [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Oromo people|Oromo]] nomads with their livestock. The centralized regulations of the wells made it easier for the nomads to settle disputes by taking their queries to government officials who would act as mediators. Long distance caravan trade, a long-time practice in the Horn of Africa, continued unchanged in Ajuran times. Today, numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia and the Horn of Africa are evidence of a once-booming inland trade network dating from the medieval period.{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=149}}

With the centralized supervision of the Ajuran, farms in [[Afgooye]], [[Kismayo]] and other areas in the [[Jubba Valley|Jubba]] and [[Shebelle Valley|Shabelle]] valleys increased their productivity. A system of irrigation ditches known locally as ''Kelliyo'' fed directly from the [[Shebelle River|Shebelle]] and [[Jubba river]]s into the plantations where [[sorghum]], [[maize]], beans, grain and cotton were grown during the ''gu'' ([[Spring (season)|Spring]] in Somali) and ''xagaa'' ([[Summer]] in Somali) seasons of the [[Somali calendar]]. This irrigation system was supported by numerous [[Levee|dikes]] and dams. To determine the average size of a farm, a land measurement system was also invented with ''moos'', ''taraab'' and ''guldeed'' being the terms used.

The State collected [[tribute]] from the farmers in the form of harvested products like [[durra]], sorghum and bun, and from the nomads, cattle, camels and goats. The collecting of tribute was done by a [[Vizier|wazir]]. Luxury goods imported from foreign lands were also presented as gifts to the Garen rulers by the coastal [[sultan]]s of the state.

A political device that was implemented by the Garen rulers in their realm was a form of ''[[ius primae noctis]]'',{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} which enabled them to create marriages that enforced their [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] rule over all the important groups of the empire. The rulers would also claim a large portion of the bride's wealth, which at the time was 100 camels.

For trade, the Ajuran Empire minted its own [[Ajuran currency]].<ref name=\"Stgi\"/> It also utilized the [[Mogadishu currency|Mogadishan currency]] originally minted by the [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], which later became incorporated into the Ajuran Empire.<ref name=\"Cites\">{{cite book |first=Bruce |last=Stanley |chapter=Mogadishu |editor-last1=Dumper |editor-first1=Michael |editor-last2=Stanley |editor-first2=Bruce E. |title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA253|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-919-5|page=253}}</ref> Mogadishan coins have been found as far away as the present-day country of the [[United Arab Emirates]] in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=\"Ncaaroth\">{{cite book|last=Chittick|first=H.

The urban centers of [[Merca]], [[Mogadishu]], [[Barawa]], and their respective ports became profitable trade outlets for commodities originating from the interior of the State. The farming communities of the hinterland brought their products to the coastal cities, where they were sold to local merchants who maintained a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from [[Arabia]], [[India]], [[Venetian Republic|Venice]],<ref>Journal of African History pg.50 by John Donnelly Fage and Roland Anthony Oliver{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}}</ref> [[Persia]], [[Egypt]], [[Portugal]], and as far away as [[China]].

The Ajuran Empire relied on agriculture and trade for most of its income. Major agricultural towns were located on the [[Shebelle River|Shebelle]] and [[Jubba river]]s, including [[Kismayo]] and [[Afgooye]]. Situated at the junction of some of the busiest medieval trade routes, the Ajuran and its clients were active participants in the East African [[Gold|gold trade]], the [[Silk road|Silk Road commerce]], [[Indian Ocean trade|trade in the Indian Ocean]], and commercial enterprise as far as [[East Asia]].

The Ajuran Empire also minted its own [[Ajuran currency]].

==Diplomacy==
[[File:ShenDuGiraffePainting.jpg|thumb|190px|The [[Ajuran Empire]] maintained commercial ties with the [[Ming dynasty]] and other kingdoms.]]
With their maritime pursuits and history, the Empire established trading and diplomatic ties across the old world, especially in Asia – from being a close ally to the grand power of the [[Ottomans]] to having cordial ties to the mighty [[Ming Dynasty]], even having their merchants following of the greatest maritime expedition in their history as far as [[Java]] and [[Vietnam]].<ref name=\"Shelley2013\">{{cite book|author=Fred M.

The ruler of the [[Somali people|Somali]] Ajuran Empire sent ambassadors to [[China]] to establish diplomatic ties, creating the first ever recorded African community in China and the most notable [[Somali people|Somali]] ambassador in medieval China was [[Sa'id of Mogadishu]] who was the first African man to set foot in [[China]]. In return, Emperor Yongle, the third emperor of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), dispatched one of the largest fleets in history to trade with the Somali nation. The fleet, under the leadership of the famed Hui Muslim [[Zheng He]], arrived at [[Mogadishu]] the capital of Ajuran Empire while the city was at its zenith.

==Major cities==
[[File:Barawa.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Medieval city of [[Barawa]].]]
The Ajuran State was an influential Somali kingdom that held sway over several cities and towns in central and southern Somalia during the Middle Ages. With the [[Ajuran Sultanate#Decline and successor states|fall of the Sultanate]], a number of these settlements continued to prosper, eventually becoming [[List of Somali cities by population|major cities]] in present-day Somalia.

The majority of the inhabitants were ethnic [[Somali people|Somali]], but there was also a [[Yemen]]i, [[Persian people|Persian]], and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] minority. The vast majority of the population also adhered to [[Sunni]] [[Islam]] with a [[Shia]] minority (mostly those of Persian descent). Somali was the most commonly used language of government and social life while [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was most prominently used for [[Madrasa|religious studies]].

==Ajuraan territories ==
===Sofala===
[[File:Sofala1683.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Somali merchants from Mogadishu established a colony in [[Mozambique]] to extract gold from the mines in [[Sofala]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">pg 4 – The quest for an African Eldorado: Sofala, By Terry H. Elkiss</ref>]]
[[Sofala]] is located on the [[Sofala Bank]] in [[Sofala Province]] of [[Mozambique]]. It was founded by [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Maritime history of Somalia|merchants and seafarers]]. Sofala in [[Somali language|Somali]] literally means \"Go dig\". This name was given because the area is rich with resources.<ref name=\"Horizon History 143\">''The Horizon History of Africa'', vol. 1, p. 143.</ref>
 
One of the oldest harbours documented in [[Southern Africa]], medieval Sofala was erected on the edge of a wide estuary formed by the [[Buzi River (Mozambique)|Buzi River]] (called ''Rio de Sofala'' in older maps). By the [[Somali people|Somali]] merchants from Mogadishu, the capital of the [[Ajuran Empire]], established a colony in [[Mozambique]] to extract gold from the mines in Sofala.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>
 
The Buzi River connected Sofala to the internal market town of [[Manica, Mozambique|Manica]], and from there to the gold fields of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. Sometime in the 10th century, Sofala emerged as a small trading post and was incorporated into the greater global Somali trade network. In the 1180s, Sultan Suleiman Hassan of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (in present-day [[Tanzania]]) seized control of Sofala, and brought Sofala into the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] and the [[Swahili culture|Swahili]] cultural sphere.the man behind the conquest: Mogadishu merchants had long kept Sofala a secret from their Kilwan rivals, who up until then rarely sailed beyond Cape Delgado. One day, a fisherman caught a large bite off Kilwa and was dragged by the fish around Cape Delgado, through the Mozambique Channe, all the way down to the Sofala banks. The fisherman made his way back up to Kilwa to report to the Sultan Suleiman Hassan what he had seen. Hearing of the gold trade, the sultan loaded up a ship with cloth and immediately raced down there, guided by the fisherman. The Kilwan sultan offered a better deal to the Mwenemutapa, and was allowed to erect a Kilwan factory and colony on the island and nudge the Mogadishans permanently out.
<ref>Portuguese chronicler [[João de Barros]] (Dec.

===Maldives Islands===
The first king of the [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] [[Hilaalee dynasty]] was proclaimed king in the year 1388 AD. [[Hilaalee dynasty]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] Dynasty. Some historical writing and some folklores reveal that this Dynasty is from [[Somali people|Somali]] descent. It seems they were travellers and traders of [[Ajuran Empire]] where they established a colony in [[Maldive]] islands. They settled in Hlhule' in Male' atoll.

[[Abd al-Aziz of Mogadishu]] was a Somali governor of Maldives islands and a famous member of the [[Hilaalee dynasty]].
 
The presence and high position of Abd al-Aziz in this region highlights the close connections between [[History of the Maldives|medieval Maldives]] and the Somali seamen from [[Mogadishu]] sailing the [[Indian Ocean]]. They supplied Maldivian traders with exotic animals and [[musk]], and contributed to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Maldivian population.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Maldivian Links with Eastern Africa\"/>
 
In 1346, Abd al-Aziz welcomed [[Ibn Battuta]] at his court and entertained him before giving him a barque to continue his journey.<ref>The voyage of François Pyrard of Laval: to the East Volume 2, Part 2 By François Pyrard pg 467</ref>

The Ajuran State had a standing army with which the Garen imams and the governors ruled and protected their subjects. The bulk of the army consisted of [[mamluke]] soldiers,{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=90}} who did not have any loyalties to the traditional Somali clan system, thereby making them more reliable. The soldiers were recruited from the inter-riverine area; other recruits came from the surrounding nomadic region. [[Arab]], [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] mercenaries were at times employed as well.{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=104}}<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Welch|first=Sidney R.|title=Portuguese rule and Spanish crown in South Africa, 1581–1640|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3Q_AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA29|year=1950|publisher=Juta}}</ref>

In the early Ajuran period, the army's weapons consisted of traditional Somali weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, [[battle axe]], and [[bow (weapon)|bows]]. The Empire received assistance from its close ally the [[Ottoman Empire]], and with the import of [[firearms]] through the Muzzaffar port of [[Mogadishu]], the army began acquiring [[muskets]] and [[cannons]]. The Ottomans would also remain a key ally during the [[Ajuran Sultanate#Ajuran-Portuguese wars|Ajuran-Portuguese wars]]. Horses used for military purposes were also raised in the interior, and numerous stone fortifications were erected to provide shelter for the army in the coastal districts.{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=92}} In each province, the soldiers were under the supervision of a military commander known as an [[emir]],{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=90}} and the coastal areas and the [[Indian ocean]] trade were protected by a [[navy]].{{sfnp|Welch|1950|p=25}}

[[File:Hanno.cunha.jpg|thumb|180px|right|During the Battle of [[Barawa]], ''[[Tristão da Cunha]]'' was wounded and requested to be [[knight]]ed by [[Afonso de Albuquerque|Albuquerque]].<ref>Maritime Discovery: A History of Nautical Exploration from the Earliest Times pg 198</ref>]]
The [[Europe]]an [[Age of discovery]] brought Europe's then [[superpower]] the [[Portuguese empire]] to the coast of East Africa, which at the time enjoyed a flourishing trade with foreign nations. The wealthy southeastern city-states of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], [[Mombasa]], [[Malindi]], [[Pate Island|Pate]] and [[Lamu]] were all systematically sacked and plundered by the Portuguese. [[Tristão da Cunha]] then set his eyes on Ajuran territory, where the battle of [[Barawa]] was fought. After a long period of engagement, the Portuguese soldiers burned the city and looted it. However, fierce resistance by the local population and soldiers resulted in the failure of the Portuguese to permanently occupy the city, and the inhabitants who had fled to the interior would eventually return and rebuild the city. After Barawa, Tristão would set sail for [[Mogadishu]], which was the richest city on the East African coast. But word had spread of what had happened in Barawa, and a large troop mobilization had taken place. Many horsemen, soldiers and battleships in defense positions were now guarding the city. Nevertheless, Tristão still opted to storm and attempt to conquer the city, although every officer and soldier in his army opposed this, fearing certain defeat if they were to engage their opponents in battle. Tristão heeded their advice and sailed for [[Socotra]] instead.<ref>The History of the Portuguese, During the Reign of Emmanuel pg.287</ref> After the battle the city of Barawa quickly recovered from the attack.<ref>The book of Duarte Barbosa – Page 30</ref>

Over the next several decades Somali-[[Portugal|Portuguese]] tensions would remain high and the increased contact between Somali [[sailors]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Privateer|corsairs]] worried the Portuguese who sent a punitive expedition against Mogadishu under [[João de Sepúlveda]], which was unsuccessful.<ref>The Portuguese period in East Africa – p. 112</ref> Ottoman-Somali cooperation against the Portuguese in the [[Indian Ocean]] reached a high point in the 1580s when Ajuran clients of the Somali coastal cities began to sympathize with the [[Arabs]] and [[Swahili people|Swahilis]] under Portuguese rule and sent an envoy to the Turkish corsair [[Mir Ali Bey]] for a joint expedition against the Portuguese. He agreed and was joined by a Somali [[Naval fleet|fleet]], which began attacking Portuguese colonies in [[Swahili Coast|Southeast Africa]].{{sfnp|Welch|1950|p=25}}

The Somali-Ottoman offensive managed to drive out the Portuguese from several important cities such as [[Pate Island|Pate]], [[Mombasa]] and [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]]. However, the Portuguese governor sent envoys to [[Portuguese India]] requesting a large Portuguese fleet. This request was answered and it reversed the previous offensive of the Muslims into one of defense. The Portuguese armada managed to re-take most of the lost cities and began punishing their leaders, but they refrained from attacking Mogadishu, securing the city's autonomy in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=\"Cites\"/><ref>Four centuries of Swahili verse: a literary history and anthology – p. 11</ref> Ajuran's Somali forces would eventually militarily defeat the Portuguese.

{{main|Oromo migrations}}
[[File:Somali Enterprise.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[maritime history of Somalia|Somali maritime enterprise]] took a significant hit after the collapse of the Ajuran Empire. However, other [[Somali people|Somali]] polities such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the [[Geledi Sultanate]], the [[Majeerteen Sultanate]], the [[Dervish state]] and the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ensured its continuity.]]
In the mid-17th century, the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] Nation began expanding from its homeland around [[Lake Abaya]] in southern [[Ethiopia]] towards the southern Somali coast at the time when the Ajuran was at the height of its power.{{sfnp|Cassanelli|1982|p=114}}<ref>Cerulli, Somalia 1: 65–67</ref> The Garen rulers conducted several military expeditions known as the ''Gaal Madow'' wars against the Oromo warriors, converting those that were captured to [[Islam]]. The Ajuran military supremacy forced the Oromo conquerors to reverse their migrations towards the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonids]] and the [[Muslim]] [[Adal Sultanate|Adalites]], devastating the two warring empires in the process.

==Decline and successor states==
The Ajuran Empire slowly declined in power at the end of the 17th century, which paved the way for the ascendance of new Somali powers. The most prominent setbacks against the state were the dethronement of the [[Sultanate of Mogadishu|Muzzaffar]] clients in [[Mogadishu]] and other coastal cities by the [[Hawiye]] Hiraab [[King]],{{sfnp|Lewis|1988|page=37}} and the defeat of the [[Silcis|Silis Kingdom]] by a former Ajuran general, [[Ibrahim Adeer]], in the interior of the state who then established the [[Gobroon dynasty]]. Taxation and the practice of primae noctis were the main catalysts for the revolts against Ajuran rulers. The loss of port cities and fertile farms meant that much needed sources of revenue were lost to the rebels.

The '''Morgan Motor Company''' is a British [[automobile|motor car]] manufacturer, owned by the Italian Investindustrial since March of 2019. It was founded in 1910 by [[H.F.S. Morgan|Henry Frederick Stanley Morgan]].

Morgan is based in [[Malvern Link]], an area of Malvern, Worcestershire, and employs approximately 220 people. Morgan has stated that they produce 850 cars per year, all assembled by hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/aboutus/|title=About Us|date=2019|website=Morgan Motor Company|accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref> The waiting list for a car is approximately six months, and has sometimes been as long as ten years.

Morgan cars are unusual because wood has been used in their construction for a century, and is still used in the 21st century for framing the body shell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/a-tour-of-morgan-motor-companys-factory/|title=Let the Wood (and Aluminum) Times Roll: A Tour of Morgan Motor Company’s Factory|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> A visitor centre and museum have exhibits about the company's history from Edwardian times until the present day, developments in automobile technology, and a display of automobiles. There are also guided tours of the factory.

[[File:Morgan Runabout (15645200332).jpg|thumb|Rear view, showing [[swingarm]] rear suspension]]

H.F.S. Morgan quit the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1904 and co-founded a motor sales and servicing garage in Malvern Link. In 1909 he designed and built a car for his own use. Previously he developed the first independent front suspension in
the engineering shop of [[Malvern College]].<ref name=\"Leng-Ward\"/> He began production a year later and the company prospered. Production of three wheelers approached 1000 by WW1 and quickly resumed with both racing and touring models. Morgan's first four wheeler came in 1935 with three wheelers phased out in 1952. Morgan continued to run it until he died at age 77 in 1959.<ref name=Motor197005>{{cite journal|first=Harold |last=Hastings |title=Sixty years old and thriving |journal=Motor |pages = 28–31 |date=30 May 1970}}</ref>

[[Peter Morgan (automaker)|Peter Morgan]], son of HFS, ran the company until a few years before his death in 2003. He was replaced as chairman by Alan Garnett, a non-family director, from 2003 to 2006. After Garnett's resignation, a four-man management team was set up.

[[Charles Morgan (automaker)|Charles Morgan]] (son of Peter), Matthew Parkin, Tim Whitworth and Steve Morris made up the new management team, and in 2010, after Parkin's resignation, Charles Morgan was named managing director. In January, 2013, Morgan was removed as managing director, replaced by Morris, but continued as strategy director until October 2013 when he was removed both as an employee and member of the board of directors.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |title=Charles Morgan describes distress at being ousted from board role |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/10389726/Charles-Morgan-describes-distress-at-being-ousted-from-board-role.html |accessdate=12 November 2013 |last=Ping Chan |first=Szu |location=London |date=18 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=BBC |title=Charles Morgan removed from world-famous UK car firm |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-24759054 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |date=31 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Mail |title=Historic British sports car maker Morgan faces backlash after ousting the founder's final family member from the board |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2464591/British-car-maker-Morgan-ousted-founders-final-family-member-board.htm |accessdate=12 November 2013 |last=Massy |first=Ray |location=London |date=17 October 2013}}</ref>

At the end of 2013, the shareholders appointed Andrew Duncan, a local solicitor, as chairman. In 2016, he resigned as chairman and company director and was replaced as chairman by a new director, Dominic Riley.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

== Early cars: three-wheelers and 4-4s ==
The early cars were two-seat or four-seat [[three-wheeler]]s, and are therefore considered to be [[cyclecar]]s. Three-wheeled vehicles avoided the British tax on cars by being classified as [[motorcycle]]s. Competition from small cars like the [[Austin 7]] and the original [[Morris Minor (1928)|Morris Minor]], with comparable economy and price and better comfort, made cyclecars less attractive.

H.F.S.

Three single-seater cars were exhibited at the 1910 Motor Show at Olympia in London. In spite of great interest being shown, only a few orders were taken, and Morgan decided a two-seater was needed to meet market demand. This was built in 1911, adding a bonnet, windscreen, wheel steering, and crank starting; it was displayed at the 1911 Motor Cycle Show.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> An agency was taken up by the [[Harrod's]] department store in London, with a selling price of [[Pound sterling|£]]65.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The Morgan became the only car ever to appear in a shop window at Harrods.<ref>{{cite web |title=Announcement Date : Feb 1 , 1911 |url=https://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/announcement/harrods/ |website=morgan-motor |publisher=Morgan Motor Company |accessdate=7 May 2019}}</ref>

Interest in his runabout led him to patent his design and begin production.

After the [[World War One|First World War]], the company introduced an easily changed rear wheel, which customers had been seeking for several years.<ref name=\"auto2\">Boddy, p.1412.</ref> The 1921 Popular, powered by an {{convert|8|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} [[JA Prestwich Industries|JAP]] and bodied in [[Populus|poplar]], sold for £150.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> It was a sales success, the price dropping to £128, and the name changing to Standard, by 1923, when a [[Blackburne (motorcycles)|Blackburne]] engine was also available.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> The Grand Prix was priced £155, and the Family (with two notional child seats behind the front bench, setting a standard [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2s]] would follow for generations) was £148 with air-cooled engine, or £158 with water-cooled engine. The [[Anzani]]-powered Aero was also available, for £148.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> MAG engines were also optional.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>

Morgan's racing efforts suffered a blow in 1924, when E. B. Ware's JAP-engined car rolled at the JCC {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} at Brooklands; Ware was seriously hurt, leading to a ban on three-wheelers competing as cars.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>

Like motorcycles, Morgans had hand throttles, Bowden-wire control mechanisms, and drip lubrication.<ref name=\"auto4\">Boddy, p.1414.</ref>

Racing Morgans included [[Harold Beart]]'s {{convert|1096|cc|cid|abbr=on}} Blackburne-engined special, with 3.33:1 top gear and a {{convert|43|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[Streamliner#Automobiles|streamlined]] body, which covered {{convert|91.48|mi|km|abbr=on}} in a one-hour trial at Brooklands, with a peak speed of over {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>

In 1925, the Standard's price had dropped to £95, and the Aero £130, compared to £149 for an [[Austin Chummy]].<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Electric lighting by [[dynamo]] became standard that year.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>

Front-wheel brakes and electric start (a £10 option) became available in 1927, while the Standard's price fell to £89, complete with a double-thickness windscreen and \"electric hooter\".<ref name=\"auto4\"/> By year's end, the Standard was even cheaper, £85, while the new Super Sports debuted, with an [[overhead valve engine|overhead valve]] JAP 10/40 water-cooled vee-twin, priced £155.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The 10/40 engine was also available in the Aero, at £132, while a more sedate air-cooled JAP-powered Aero went for £119.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The Family was priced at £102 (air-cooled) or £112 (water-cooled).<ref name=\"auto4\"/> These new, lower prices persisted through 1928.<ref>Boddy, p.1414-15.</ref> They would be lower still in 1929: the Standard and Family at £87 10[[shilling|s]], the Aero £110, and the Super Sports £145.<ref name=\"auto5\">Boddy, p.1415.</ref> In 1933, the Family was priced at only £80.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>

=== 4–4 ===
[[File:Morgan +4.jpg|thumb|1939 Morgan 4–4 Series I]]
Morgan's first four-wheeler, named the [[Morgan 4-4|4–4]] because it had a four-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] engine and four wheels, was released to the public in 1936.<ref name=\"auto6\">Boddy, p.1417.</ref> Powered by a {{convert|34|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}} {{convert|1122|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Coventry Climax]] engine, and carrying a pair of rear-mounted spare wheels, the new two-seater 4–4 sold for 185 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] (£194 5[[shilling|s]]).<ref name=\"auto6\"/> It proved popular, and a four-place model was added in 1937, joined by a £236 [[Convertible|drophead]] in 1938.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>

Coventry Climax eventually ceased making engines available, so Morgan switched to a tuned {{convert|1267|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Standard Motor Company]] [[Standard Ten|Ten]], producing {{convert|39|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>

In 1938, a 4–4 was entered at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]].<ref name=\"auto6\"/> This led to production of factory replicas, with fold-down windscreen, [[cycle fenders]], smaller-[[Engine displacement|displacement]] engine, and single spare wheels, with a price of £250.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>

=== Morgan +4 ===
[[File:Morgan Plus4 1952.JPG|thumb|1952 \"flat radiator\" +4]]
[[File:Morgan Plus4 Drophead 1963.jpg|thumb|right|1963 +4]]
{{main|Morgan +4}}
The [[Morgan +4]] was introduced in 1950 as a larger-engined (\"plus\") car than the 4/4. The +4 initially used the {{convert|2088|cc|abbr=on}} [[Standard Vanguard]] engine and at introduction sold for £625 (two-seater) or £723 (coupé).<ref name=\"auto6\"/>

The +4 used [[Triumph TR2]] (in 1953),<ref name=\"auto7\">Boddy, p.1418.</ref> [[Triumph TR3|TR3]] (1956),<ref name=\"auto7\"/> or [[Triumph TR4A|TR4A]] engines (until 1969). Plus 4 production was suspended in 1969 but brought back in 1985 with a Fiat engine (1985–1988) and then a 4-cylinder Rover engine (1988–2000). Production was again suspended and the Plus 4 returned once more in 2004 with a {{convert|155|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Ford 4-cylinder.

From October 1965 to April 1967 Morgan produced the two-seat +4 Competition, of which only 42 were built, about 11 of which survive.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

A limited edition Plus 4 was re-introduced in 2014 as the [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]] Super Sports. Only 60 cars were made available, all right-hand-drive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==== Morgan +4+ ====
{{main|Morgan +4+}}
A version of the +4, the +4+, was made from 1964 to 1967 with a fibreglass coupé body. The light weight and reduced drag improved the performance of the +4+ over the standard +4 in every aspect. However, traditional Morgan enthusiasts did not embrace this departure from Morgan custom, and mainstream enthusiasts did not embrace the seemingly archaic +4 chassis. Fifty were planned, but only 26 were built.<ref>Boddy, p.1416 caption.</ref>

=== Morgan 4/4 ===
[[File:Morgan 4 4 1974.jpg|thumb|right|1974 Morgan 4/4]]
[[File:Morgan---Ystad-2019.jpg|thumb| Morgans in [[Ystad]] 2019.]]
{{main|Morgan 4/4}}

Production of the 4-4 was halted during World War II but resumed afterwards as the 4/4. Production halted again in 1950 when the Standard engine ceased to be available, but resumed in 1955 when a suitable replacement, the side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was found, and has continued ever since.

The 4/4 now uses the +8 chassis and a Ford engine.

=== Morgan +8 ===
{{main|Morgan Plus 8}}
Faced with the decreasing availability of large four-cylinder engines for use in their +4 models, Morgan began to install the recently available [[Rover V8 engine]] in their cars in 1968, giving these cars the model designation \"+8\".

The engine displacement jumped from the 2.3&nbsp;L of the Triumph TR4 engine to 3.5&nbsp;L, then 3.9&nbsp;L (1990), 4.0 (1998–2004) with an optional 4.6L (1996–2000) all based on the same Land Rover block. However, this V-8 was no heavier than the Triumph engine. These features made the +8 accelerate much more quickly than the early +4 and also improved its road-holding capability.

Horsepower (143–204&nbsp;bhp), weight and performance varied with emission and structural laws through its history. Thus powered, the car could accelerate from 0–60 mph in 5.6 seconds. In its final form, the GEMS Land Rover V8 produced {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}}.

[[File:2006 SAG - Morgan roadster - 05.jpg|thumb|Roadster at 76e international Motorshow Geneva 2006]]

=== Roadster ===
{{main|Morgan Roadster}}
In 2004, Morgan came out with a traditional styled model to replace the departing Plus 8. The Mk I Roadsters with the Ford UK Mondeo V6 produced 223&nbsp;bhp (166&nbsp;kW, 226 PS) at 6150 rev/min. It had a [[Magna PT|Getrag]] gearbox with direct drive in 5th with a 3.08 axle ratio. Later Marks had a Ford gearbox with direct drive in 4th with a 3.73 axle ratio. The overall gearing is virtually the same. The later Roadsters were powered by a Ford UK Mondeo V6 producing {{convert|204|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 2007, the Mondeo engine was replaced by a US-specification version of the same engine in the Roadster II. In 2011–12, the engine was replaced by the 3.7 Duratec Cyclone engine and output increased to {{convert|280|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The company calls this latest model the Roadster 3.7.

=== Morgan Aero 8 (Series I-V) ===
[[File:Morgan Aero 8.jpg|thumb|A Modern Morgan Aero 8 at the [[Scarsdale Concours]]]]
{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}
In 2000, the Morgan Aero 8 was introduced and, as always, the wooden body substructure was [[Ash tree|ash]]. (Contrary to popular myth, however, the [[chassis]] is metal; [[aluminium]] for the Aero 8.) The Aero 8, with a [[BMW]] [[V8 engine]] in a car weighing less than a [[BMW Z4]] and considerably less than a [[BMW M3]], (though more than traditional Morgans) is even faster than the Plus 8, delivering what ''[[Autoweek]]'' magazine termed [[supercar]] performance. The newest Aero 8 (series V), presented in March 2015, puts out {{convert|367|hp|abbr=on}} at 6100 rpm with the company suggesting a top speed of over {{convert|170|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Due to the Aero 8's light weight it can do 0–62&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in 4.5 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2006-Morgan-Aeromax.htm |title=2006 Morgan Aeromax |publisher=Seriouswheels.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>

During its customer production lifetime (2002–2009), the Aero was configured in five official versions, (I, II, III, IV, the Aero America and V) with mild variations in styling, engines, transmissions, braking and suspension. The company canceled the model in 2009 but relaunched it in 2015 for 2016 deliveries. The year of highest production for any Aero variation was 2002.

=== Morgan AeroMax ===
[[File:Morgan-Aeromax-rear.jpg|thumb|Morgan AeroMax, showing distinct boat tail rear]]
{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}
The Aero was followed by the Aeromax, a limited edition of 100 units produced between 2008 and early 2010. The Aeromax was a coupé variation of the Aero 8. Customers have included [[Richard Hammond]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Paul O'Grady]].

=== Morgan Aero SuperSports ===
{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}
The Morgan Aero SuperSports is a [[Targa top|targa-roofed]] version of the AeroMax, sharing its bonded aluminium chassis and lower bodywork with the coupe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Morgan-Aero-Supersports-V8-Supersports-auto/251830/|title=Morgan Aero 8 Review (2017) – Autocar|website=www.autocar.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> It was launched at the 2009 Pebble Beach car show in California. Its cancellation was announced in March 2015.

=== Morgan Aero Coupé ===
{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}
The Morgan Aero Coupé is a hard top version of the Aero SuperSports, sharing its bonded aluminium chassis, bodywork, suspension and engine. It was launched at the end of 2011. It is not available in the United States. Its cancellation was announced in March 2015.

=== Morgan Aero Plus 8 ===
The new Morgan Plus 8 is a classic body version of the Aero SuperSports and Aero Coupé, sharing their bonded aluminium chassis, bodywork, suspension and engine. It was launched at the end of 2011. It is not available in the United States. In 2019, Morgan announced its cancellation.

=== Morgan Plus E ===
[[File:Morgan Plus E.jpg|thumb|Morgan Plus E]]
The Morgan Plus E is an electric version of a classical Morgan, a joint project of Morgan with [[Zytek]] and Radshape (Radshape Sheet Metal Ltd.),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1072808_morgan-plus-e-electric-roadster-modern-battery-in-classic-car|title=Morgan Plus E Electric Roadster: Modern Battery In Classic Car|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> funded by the UK government.

=== Morgan Eva GT ===
{{main|Morgan Eva GT}}
Based on the same chassis as the Aero Supersports, the Eva GT would have been a 2+2 grand tourer, and as such it would be longer in the body. The Eva GT would use [[BMW N54]] twin-turbo straight-6 producing 302&nbsp;bhp, Euro-6 emissions compliant. Shown at Pebble Beach in clay in 2010 and expected to go on sale in 2012, deposits have been taken since 2010. At the end of 2011, Morgan announced that it would use new magnesium technology for the body and therefore it would not be represented until 2014 with deliveries after that. In 2013 dealers confirmed that the EvaGT had been cancelled.

Instead of the traditional Morgan ladder frame and sliding-pillar suspension, it has a new bonded aluminium chassis and all-independent suspension design, with double wishbones at the front and a multi-link system for the rear. The Plus Six is powered by a [[BMW]] B58 turbocharged in-line six-cylinder petrol engine, producing 335 bhp, coupled to an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission.<ref name=\"autocar-plus6\">{{cite web |last1=Cropley |first1=Steve |title=Morgan Plus Six is marque's first all-new model in 19 years |url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-goodwood-festival-speed/morgan-plus-six-marques-first-all-new-model-19-years |website=Autocar |accessdate=29 December 2019 |date=4 July 2019}}</ref>

== Availability in the United States ==
[[File:Morgan door.jpg|thumb|Morgan Motor factory, main entrance]]
For part of the 1950s and 1960s, the United States provided the company with its largest market worldwide, taking up to 85% of all production.<ref>Laban, Brian. ''Morgan: First and Last of the Real Sports Cars.'' London: Virgin Books, 2000, page number not cited.</ref> This ended with the first wave of US safety and emission regulations in 1971. For many years (1974 to 1992), all Morgans imported into the United States were converted to run on propane as fuel to pass the US [[emission standard|emissions regulations]]. However, this conversion, along with bringing the cars into compliance with US vehicle safety legislation, was carried out by the dealership, and not by the factory, making the cars [[grey import vehicles|grey market vehicles]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.morgancars-usa.com/candd1.html | title=Reprint of Car & Driver article, January 1977 | website=Morgancars-usa.com | date= | accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>

However, when the [[Rover Group]] re-certified their V8 engine for use in the [[Range Rover]] [[Sport utility vehicle|4x4]] sold in the US, Morgan was able to use the same engine for a fully US-compliant stock Morgan from 1992 to 1996,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and again from 1998 to 2004.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 2005, the engine was replaced with the US-version of another traditionally shaped model (with a V6), called the Roadster.

In 2002, Morgan centralised its international compliancy development and regulatory interaction in-house.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 2005, its right to import its classic models ceased when supplies of its necessary airbag were exhausted and no replacement was developed. In 2006, a request for an airbag exemption to the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] was refused, and the import of classic Morgans ceased.<ref>http://frwebgate5.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=959721101393+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 2005, the new Morgan Aero 8 model (versions 2 and 3) received a three-year exemption from rear impact non-compliance,<ref>http://frwebgate4.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=959367106968+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> along with a separate exemption for compliance with \"advanced airbag requirements\".<ref>http://frwebgate4.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=959366106946+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The rear-impact exemption lapsed in May 2008 without further application.

In April 2012, the new Morgan 3-Wheeler was showcased at the New York International Auto Show, at the Jacob Javits Center, by Bobby Singh and Gideon Lang-Laddie of Manhattan Motorsports. This was the first time in 10 years that Morgan had had a presence at the largest of the American car shows and was the first US specification Morgan 3-Wheeler in the United States. The Morgan 3 Wheeler was voted one of the \"Hottest Cars Of The Show\" by G4TV.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hardiman|first=Paul |website=Hagerty.com |title=The New Morgan Three Wheeler|url=http://www.hagerty.com/articles-videos/Articles/2012/11/12/TheNew-2012-Morgan|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

In May 2012, Manhattan Motorsports took delivery of Charles Morgan's Superdry edition Morgan 3-Wheeler and prepared it for its first major American trial. This vehicle was driven across the States, from New York to Los Angeles by Charles Morgan and his wife, covering 3000 miles, in the [[Gumball 3000]]. At the end of the seven-day drive, the Morgan 3 Wheeler was awarded the \"Spirit of Gumball\" prize.

== General characteristics ==
[[File:MorganSuspension.jpg|thumb|Traditional Morgan [[sliding pillar suspension]]]]
In spite of their traditional design, Morgans have always had sporting or \"sports car\" performance, due to their extremely low weight.

Among their enthusiasts, Morgans are affectionately known as \"Moggies\".

=== Suspension ===
H.F.S. Morgan's 1909 runabout used [[sliding pillar suspension]], an [[independent front suspension]] system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide up and down a fixed pillar that also acts as the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tyre and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.

Morgan used developments of this suspension system throughout its existence, and it is still used on Morgan's \"classic\" line, although not on the Aero 8 or its derivatives. It has been cancelled, along with all the Morgan Classic line, in 2019. However, some \"classics\", shipped in parts to avoid the need for normal compliancy, will be shipped to the USA, and assembled there for an indefinite period.

== Motorsports ==
Morgan cars can be found in many areas of motorsport, from club and historic racing to more prominent examples, including the Le Mans 24hr race. A notable Morgan racecar was the Aero 8 GT car that campaigned in 2008 Britcar races and the 2008 Britcar 24hrs at Silverstone, prepared and run by Mark Bailey Racing.

[[Pescarolo Sport]] rebranded its [[Pescarolo 01|Le Mans Prototype]] as a Morgan for the [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans]], partly to mark the 50th anniversary of a class victory for a Morgan Plus Four Super Sports at Le Mans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wot.motortrend.com/british-sportscar-maker-morgan-to-race-lmp2-car-at-le-mans-160205.html |title=British Sportscar Maker Morgan to Race LMP2 Car at Le Mans |website=motortrend.com |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref>

The '''Morgan Motor Company''' is a British [[automobile|motor car]] manufacturer, owned by the Italian Investindustrial since March of 2019. It was founded in 1910 by [[H.F.S. Morgan|Henry Frederick Stanley Morgan]].

Morgan is based in [[Malvern Link]], an area of Malvern, Worcestershire, and employs approximately 220 people. Morgan has stated that they produce 850 cars per year, all assembled by hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/aboutus/|title=About Us|date=2019|website=Morgan Motor Company|accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref> The waiting list for a car is approximately six months, and has sometimes been as long as ten years.

Morgan cars are unusual because wood has been used in their construction for a century, and is still used in the 21st century for framing the body shell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/a-tour-of-morgan-motor-companys-factory/|title=Let the Wood (and Aluminum) Times Roll: A Tour of Morgan Motor Company’s Factory|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> A visitor centre and museum have exhibits about the company's history from Edwardian times until the present day, developments in automobile technology, and a display of automobiles. There are also guided tours of the factory.

[[File:Morgan Runabout (15645200332).jpg|thumb|Rear view, showing [[swingarm]] rear suspension]]

H.F.S. Morgan quit the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1904 and co-founded a motor sales and servicing garage in Malvern Link. In 1909 he designed and built a car for his own use. Previously he developed the first independent front suspension in
the engineering shop of [[Malvern College]].<ref name=\"Leng-Ward\"/> He began production a year later and the company prospered. Production of three wheelers approached 1000 by WW1 and quickly resumed with both racing and touring models. Morgan's first four wheeler came in 1935 with three wheelers phased out in 1952. Morgan continued to run it until he died at age 77 in 1959.<ref name=Motor197005>{{cite journal|first=Harold |last=Hastings |title=Sixty years old and thriving |journal=Motor |pages = 28–31 |date=30 May 1970}}</ref>

[[Peter Morgan (automaker)|Peter Morgan]], son of HFS, ran the company until a few years before his death in 2003. He was replaced as chairman by Alan Garnett, a non-family director, from 2003 to 2006. After Garnett's resignation, a four-man management team was set up.

[[Charles Morgan (automaker)|Charles Morgan]] (son of Peter), Matthew Parkin, Tim Whitworth and Steve Morris made up the new management team, and in 2010, after Parkin's resignation, Charles Morgan was named managing director. In January, 2013, Morgan was removed as managing director, replaced by Morris, but continued as strategy director until October 2013 when he was removed both as an employee and member of the board of directors.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |title=Charles Morgan describes distress at being ousted from board role |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/10389726/Charles-Morgan-describes-distress-at-being-ousted-from-board-role.html |accessdate=12 November 2013 |last=Ping Chan |first=Szu |location=London |date=18 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=BBC |title=Charles Morgan removed from world-famous UK car firm |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-24759054 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |date=31 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Mail |title=Historic British sports car maker Morgan faces backlash after ousting the founder's final family member from the board |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2464591/British-car-maker-Morgan-ousted-founders-final-family-member-board.htm |accessdate=12 November 2013 |last=Massy |first=Ray |location=London |date=17 October 2013}}</ref>

At the end of 2013, the shareholders appointed Andrew Duncan, a local solicitor, as chairman. In 2016, he resigned as chairman and company director and was replaced as chairman by a new director, Dominic Riley.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

== Early cars: three-wheelers and 4-4s ==
The early cars were two-seat or four-seat [[three-wheeler]]s, and are therefore considered to be [[cyclecar]]s. Three-wheeled vehicles avoided the British tax on cars by being classified as [[motorcycle]]s. Competition from small cars like the [[Austin 7]] and the original [[Morris Minor (1928)|Morris Minor]], with comparable economy and price and better comfort, made cyclecars less attractive.

H.F.S.

With financial help from his father and his wife,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> the car was put into production at premises in Pickersleigh Road,<ref>Boddy, p.1416.</ref> Malvern Link. Three single-seater cars were exhibited at the 1910 Motor Show at Olympia in London. In spite of great interest being shown, only a few orders were taken, and Morgan decided a two-seater was needed to meet market demand. This was built in 1911, adding a bonnet, windscreen, wheel steering, and crank starting; it was displayed at the 1911 Motor Cycle Show.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> An agency was taken up by the [[Harrod's]] department store in London, with a selling price of [[Pound sterling|£]]65.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The Morgan became the only car ever to appear in a shop window at Harrods.<ref>{{cite web |title=Announcement Date : Feb 1 , 1911 |url=https://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/announcement/harrods/ |website=morgan-motor |publisher=Morgan Motor Company |accessdate=7 May 2019}}</ref>

Interest in his runabout led him to patent his design and begin production. While he initially showed single-seat and two-seat versions of his runabout at the 1911 [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] Motor Exhibition, he was convinced at the exhibition that there would be greater demand for a two-seat model.<ref name=\"Morgan 3-Wheeler - History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.morgan3w.de/history/history.htm |title= How The Morgan Began |publisher=Morgan3w.de |date=29 July 1952 |accessdate=17 September 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302204530/http://www.morgan3w.de/history/history.htm|archivedate=2 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The Morgan Motor Company was registered as a [[Limited company|limited private company]] only in 1912 with H.F.S.

In 1912, Morgan set out to win the trophy offered by ''The Light Car & Cyclecar'' for greatest distance covered in an hour, at [[Brooklands]].

Morgan established its reputation via competition such as winning the 1913 Cyclecar Grand Prix at [[Amiens]] in France, driven by [[W. G.

After the [[World War One|First World War]], the company introduced an easily changed rear wheel, which customers had been seeking for several years.<ref name=\"auto2\">Boddy, p.1412.</ref> The 1921 Popular, powered by an {{convert|8|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} [[JA Prestwich Industries|JAP]] and bodied in [[Populus|poplar]], sold for £150.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> It was a sales success, the price dropping to £128, and the name changing to Standard, by 1923, when a [[Blackburne (motorcycles)|Blackburne]] engine was also available.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> The Grand Prix was priced £155, and the Family (with two notional child seats behind the front bench, setting a standard [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2s]] would follow for generations) was £148 with air-cooled engine, or £158 with water-cooled engine. The [[Anzani]]-powered Aero was also available, for £148.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> MAG engines were also optional.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>

Morgan's racing efforts suffered a blow in 1924, when E. B. Ware's JAP-engined car rolled at the JCC {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} at Brooklands; Ware was seriously hurt, leading to a ban on three-wheelers competing as cars.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>

Electric headlamps were made available in 1924, at an £8 cost.<ref name=\"auto3\">Boddy, p.1413.</ref> The Popular, powered by a {{convert|976|cc|cid|abbr=on}} engine, sold for £110, the {{convert|1098|cc|cid|0|abbr=on}} Aero for £148, and the one-seater £160.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>

Like motorcycles, Morgans had hand throttles, Bowden-wire control mechanisms, and drip lubrication.<ref name=\"auto4\">Boddy, p.1414.</ref>

Racing Morgans included [[Harold Beart]]'s {{convert|1096|cc|cid|abbr=on}} Blackburne-engined special, with 3.33:1 top gear and a {{convert|43|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[Streamliner#Automobiles|streamlined]] body, which covered {{convert|91.48|mi|km|abbr=on}} in a one-hour trial at Brooklands, with a peak speed of over {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>

In 1925, the Standard's price had dropped to £95, and the Aero £130, compared to £149 for an [[Austin Chummy]].<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Electric lighting by [[dynamo]] became standard that year.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>

Front-wheel brakes and electric start (a £10 option) became available in 1927, while the Standard's price fell to £89, complete with a double-thickness windscreen and \"electric hooter\".<ref name=\"auto4\"/> By year's end, the Standard was even cheaper, £85, while the new Super Sports debuted, with an [[overhead valve engine|overhead valve]] JAP 10/40 water-cooled vee-twin, priced £155.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The 10/40 engine was also available in the Aero, at £132, while a more sedate air-cooled JAP-powered Aero went for £119.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The Family was priced at £102 (air-cooled) or £112 (water-cooled).<ref name=\"auto4\"/> These new, lower prices persisted through 1928.<ref>Boddy, p.1414-15.</ref> They would be lower still in 1929: the Standard and Family at £87 10[[shilling|s]], the Aero £110, and the Super Sports £145.<ref name=\"auto5\">Boddy, p.1415.</ref> In 1933, the Family was priced at only £80.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>

Morgan's racing program in 1927 earned the marque eleven gold medals and three silvers from fourteen entrants at MCC's London-Edinburgh Trials alone.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The team was joined by [[Clive Lones (racing driver)|Clive Lones]] and [[C. T. Jay]], who won the 1929 Cyclecar ''Grand Prix'' at Brooklands, driving a {{convert|750|cc|cid|abbr=on}} Morgan-JAP, with an average speed of {{convert|64.7|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> And in 1930, [[Gwenda Hawkes|Gwenda Stewart]] turned in a speed of {{convert|113|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in a race-tuned Super Sports.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>

Morgan three-wheelers benefitted from an annual tax of just £4, half the tax on the [[Austin 7]],<ref>Boddy, p.1412-13.</ref> provided they remained under 8 [[Hundredweight|cwt]].<ref name=\"auto3\"/>

Morgans were also [[Licensed production|licence-built]] in France by [[Darmont]].<ref>Boddy, p.1412 caption.</ref>

By 1930, however, inexpensive four-wheeled cars were proliferating, led by the £100 [[Ford Model Y|Ford Popular]].<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Morgan, and partner [[George Goodall]], countered by putting the {{convert|8|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} {{convert|933|cc|cid|abbr=on}} and {{convert|10|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} {{convert|1172|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Ford Sidevalve engine|Ford engine]] in their own cars.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>

Morgan's last vee-twins were powered by [[Matchless]] engines displacing {{convert|990|cc|cid|abbr=on}}; they were delivered to Australia after the [[World War Two|Second World War]].<ref>Boddy, p.1415-16.</ref>

The vee-twin models were not returned to production after World War II.

The [[Morgan Club]] re-formed in 1927.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>

Coventry Climax eventually ceased making engines available, so Morgan switched to a tuned {{convert|1267|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Standard Motor Company]] [[Standard Ten|Ten]], producing {{convert|39|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>

In 1938, a 4–4 was entered at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]].<ref name=\"auto6\"/> This led to production of factory replicas, with fold-down windscreen, [[cycle fenders]], smaller-[[Engine displacement|displacement]] engine, and single spare wheels, with a price of £250.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>

{{main|Morgan +4}}
The [[Morgan +4]] was introduced in 1950 as a larger-engined (\"plus\") car than the 4/4. The +4 initially used the {{convert|2088|cc|abbr=on}} [[Standard Vanguard]] engine and at introduction sold for £625 (two-seater) or £723 (coupé).<ref name=\"auto6\"/>

The +4 used [[Triumph TR2]] (in 1953),<ref name=\"auto7\">Boddy, p.1418.</ref> [[Triumph TR3|TR3]] (1956),<ref name=\"auto7\"/> or [[Triumph TR4A|TR4A]] engines (until 1969). Plus 4 production was suspended in 1969 but brought back in 1985 with a Fiat engine (1985–1988) and then a 4-cylinder Rover engine (1988–2000). Production was again suspended and the Plus 4 returned once more in 2004 with a {{convert|155|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Ford 4-cylinder.

From October 1965 to April 1967 Morgan produced the two-seat +4 Competition, of which only 42 were built, about 11 of which survive.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

A limited edition Plus 4 was re-introduced in 2014 as the [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]] Super Sports. Only 60 cars were made available, all right-hand-drive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==== Morgan +4+ ====
{{main|Morgan +4+}}
A version of the +4, the +4+, was made from 1964 to 1967 with a fibreglass coupé body. The light weight and reduced drag improved the performance of the +4+ over the standard +4 in every aspect. However, traditional Morgan enthusiasts did not embrace this departure from Morgan custom, and mainstream enthusiasts did not embrace the seemingly archaic +4 chassis. Fifty were planned, but only 26 were built.<ref>Boddy, p.1416 caption.</ref>

=== Morgan 4/4 ===

{{main|Morgan 4/4}}

Production of the 4-4 was halted during World War II but resumed afterwards as the 4/4. Production halted again in 1950 when the Standard engine ceased to be available, but resumed in 1955 when a suitable replacement, the side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was found, and has continued ever since.

The 4/4 now uses the +8 chassis and a Ford engine.

=== Morgan +8 ===
{{main|Morgan Plus 8}}
Faced with the decreasing availability of large four-cylinder engines for use in their +4 models, Morgan began to install the recently available [[Rover V8 engine]] in their cars in 1968, giving these cars the model designation \"+8\".

The engine displacement jumped from the 2.3&nbsp;L of the Triumph TR4 engine to 3.5&nbsp;L, then 3.9&nbsp;L (1990), 4.0 (1998–2004) with an optional 4.6L (1996–2000) all based on the same Land Rover block. However, this V-8 was no heavier than the Triumph engine. These features made the +8 accelerate much more quickly than the early +4 and also improved its road-holding capability.

Horsepower (143–204&nbsp;bhp), weight and performance varied with emission and structural laws through its history. Thus powered, the car could accelerate from 0–60 mph in 5.6 seconds. In its final form, the GEMS Land Rover V8 produced {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}}.

[[File:2006 SAG - Morgan roadster - 05.jpg|thumb|Roadster at 76e international Motorshow Geneva 2006]]

=== Roadster ===
{{main|Morgan Roadster}}
In 2004, Morgan came out with a traditional styled model to replace the departing Plus 8. The Mk I Roadsters with the Ford UK Mondeo V6 produced 223&nbsp;bhp (166&nbsp;kW, 226 PS) at 6150 rev/min. It had a [[Magna PT|Getrag]] gearbox with direct drive in 5th with a 3.08 axle ratio. Later Marks had a Ford gearbox with direct drive in 4th with a 3.73 axle ratio. The overall gearing is virtually the same. The later Roadsters were powered by a Ford UK Mondeo V6 producing {{convert|204|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 2007, the Mondeo engine was replaced by a US-specification version of the same engine in the Roadster II. In 2011–12, the engine was replaced by the 3.7 Duratec Cyclone engine and output increased to {{convert|280|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The company calls this latest model the Roadster 3.7.

=== Morgan Aero 8 (Series I-V) ===
[[File:Morgan Aero 8.jpg|thumb|A Modern Morgan Aero 8 at the [[Scarsdale Concours]]]]
{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}
In 2000, the Morgan Aero 8 was introduced and, as always, the wooden body substructure was [[Ash tree|ash]]. (Contrary to popular myth, however, the [[chassis]] is metal; [[aluminium]] for the Aero 8.) The Aero 8, with a [[BMW]] [[V8 engine]] in a car weighing less than a [[BMW Z4]] and considerably less than a [[BMW M3]], (though more than traditional Morgans) is even faster than the Plus 8, delivering what ''[[Autoweek]]'' magazine termed [[supercar]] performance. The newest Aero 8 (series V), presented in March 2015, puts out {{convert|367|hp|abbr=on}} at 6100 rpm with the company suggesting a top speed of over {{convert|170|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Due to the Aero 8's light weight it can do 0–62&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in 4.5 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2006-Morgan-Aeromax.htm |title=2006 Morgan Aeromax |publisher=Seriouswheels.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>

During its customer production lifetime (2002–2009), the Aero was configured in five official versions, (I, II, III, IV, the Aero America and V) with mild variations in styling, engines, transmissions, braking and suspension. The company canceled the model in 2009 but relaunched it in 2015 for 2016 deliveries. The year of highest production for any Aero variation was 2002.

=== Morgan AeroMax ===
[[File:Morgan-Aeromax-rear.jpg|thumb|Morgan AeroMax, showing distinct boat tail rear]]
{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}
The Aero was followed by the Aeromax, a limited edition of 100 units produced between 2008 and early 2010. The Aeromax was a coupé variation of the Aero 8. Customers have included [[Richard Hammond]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Paul O'Grady]].

=== Morgan Aero SuperSports ===
{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}
The Morgan Aero SuperSports is a [[Targa top|targa-roofed]] version of the AeroMax, sharing its bonded aluminium chassis and lower bodywork with the coupe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Morgan-Aero-Supersports-V8-Supersports-auto/251830/|title=Morgan Aero 8 Review (2017) – Autocar|website=www.autocar.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> It was launched at the 2009 Pebble Beach car show in California. Its cancellation was announced in March 2015.

=== Morgan Aero Coupé ===
{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}
The Morgan Aero Coupé is a hard top version of the Aero SuperSports, sharing its bonded aluminium chassis, bodywork, suspension and engine. It was launched at the end of 2011. It is not available in the United States. Its cancellation was announced in March 2015.

=== Morgan Aero Plus 8 ===
The new Morgan Plus 8 is a classic body version of the Aero SuperSports and Aero Coupé, sharing their bonded aluminium chassis, bodywork, suspension and engine. It was launched at the end of 2011. It is not available in the United States. In 2019, Morgan announced its cancellation.

=== Morgan Plus E ===
[[File:Morgan Plus E.jpg|thumb|Morgan Plus E]]
The Morgan Plus E is an electric version of a classical Morgan, a joint project of Morgan with [[Zytek]] and Radshape (Radshape Sheet Metal Ltd.),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1072808_morgan-plus-e-electric-roadster-modern-battery-in-classic-car|title=Morgan Plus E Electric Roadster: Modern Battery In Classic Car|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> funded by the UK government. It was displayed at the 2012 [[Geneva Motor Show]].<ref>[http://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/mmc/downloads/pressreleases/plusegenevapressrelease.pdf THE NEW MORGAN PLUS E] ''morgan-motor.co.uk'', accessed 2 June 2019</ref><ref>[http://newatlas.com/something-old-something-new-the-morgan-plus-e/21736/ something-old-something-new-the-morgan-plus-e] ''newatlas.com'', accessed 2 June 2019</ref> It has never been produced and the project was abandoned.

=== Morgan Eva GT ===
{{main|Morgan Eva GT}}
Based on the same chassis as the Aero Supersports, the Eva GT would have been a 2+2 grand tourer, and as such it would be longer in the body. The Eva GT would use [[BMW N54]] twin-turbo straight-6 producing 302&nbsp;bhp, Euro-6 emissions compliant. Shown at Pebble Beach in clay in 2010 and expected to go on sale in 2012, deposits have been taken since 2010. At the end of 2011, Morgan announced that it would use new magnesium technology for the body and therefore it would not be represented until 2014 with deliveries after that. In 2013 dealers confirmed that the EvaGT had been cancelled.

=== Morgan Plus Six ===
{{main|Morgan Plus Six}}
The Morgan Plus Six was announced in March 2019 at the [[Geneva Motor Show]]. Instead of the traditional Morgan ladder frame and sliding-pillar suspension, it has a new bonded aluminium chassis and all-independent suspension design, with double wishbones at the front and a multi-link system for the rear. The Plus Six is powered by a [[BMW]] B58 turbocharged in-line six-cylinder petrol engine, producing 335 bhp, coupled to an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission.<ref name=\"autocar-plus6\">{{cite web |last1=Cropley |first1=Steve |title=Morgan Plus Six is marque's first all-new model in 19 years |url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-goodwood-festival-speed/morgan-plus-six-marques-first-all-new-model-19-years |website=Autocar |accessdate=29 December 2019 |date=4 July 2019}}</ref>

== Availability in the United States ==
[[File:Morgan door.jpg|thumb|Morgan Motor factory, main entrance]]
For part of the 1950s and 1960s, the United States provided the company with its largest market worldwide, taking up to 85% of all production.<ref>Laban, Brian. ''Morgan: First and Last of the Real Sports Cars.'' London: Virgin Books, 2000, page number not cited.</ref> This ended with the first wave of US safety and emission regulations in 1971. For many years (1974 to 1992), all Morgans imported into the United States were converted to run on propane as fuel to pass the US [[emission standard|emissions regulations]]. However, this conversion, along with bringing the cars into compliance with US vehicle safety legislation, was carried out by the dealership, and not by the factory, making the cars [[grey import vehicles|grey market vehicles]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.morgancars-usa.com/candd1.html | title=Reprint of Car & Driver article, January 1977 | website=Morgancars-usa.com | date= | accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>

However, when the [[Rover Group]] re-certified their V8 engine for use in the [[Range Rover]] [[Sport utility vehicle|4x4]] sold in the US, Morgan was able to use the same engine for a fully US-compliant stock Morgan from 1992 to 1996,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and again from 1998 to 2004.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 2005, the engine was replaced with the US-version of another traditionally shaped model (with a V6), called the Roadster.

In 2002, Morgan centralised its international compliancy development and regulatory interaction in-house.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 2005, its right to import its classic models ceased when supplies of its necessary airbag were exhausted and no replacement was developed. In 2006, a request for an airbag exemption to the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] was refused, and the import of classic Morgans ceased.<ref>http://frwebgate5.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=959721101393+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 2005, the new Morgan Aero 8 model (versions 2 and 3) received a three-year exemption from rear impact non-compliance,<ref>http://frwebgate4.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=959367106968+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> along with a separate exemption for compliance with \"advanced airbag requirements\".<ref>http://frwebgate4.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=959366106946+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The rear-impact exemption lapsed in May 2008 without further application.

In April 2012, the new Morgan 3-Wheeler was showcased at the New York International Auto Show, at the Jacob Javits Center, by Bobby Singh and Gideon Lang-Laddie of Manhattan Motorsports. This was the first time in 10 years that Morgan had had a presence at the largest of the American car shows and was the first US specification Morgan 3-Wheeler in the United States. The Morgan 3 Wheeler was voted one of the \"Hottest Cars Of The Show\" by G4TV.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hardiman|first=Paul |website=Hagerty.com |title=The New Morgan Three Wheeler|url=http://www.hagerty.com/articles-videos/Articles/2012/11/12/TheNew-2012-Morgan|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

In May 2012, Manhattan Motorsports took delivery of Charles Morgan's Superdry edition Morgan 3-Wheeler and prepared it for its first major American trial. This vehicle was driven across the States, from New York to Los Angeles by Charles Morgan and his wife, covering 3000 miles, in the [[Gumball 3000]]. At the end of the seven-day drive, the Morgan 3 Wheeler was awarded the \"Spirit of Gumball\" prize.

== General characteristics ==
[[File:MorganSuspension.jpg|thumb|Traditional Morgan [[sliding pillar suspension]]]]
In spite of their traditional design, Morgans have always had sporting or \"sports car\" performance, due to their extremely low weight.

Among their enthusiasts, Morgans are affectionately known as \"Moggies\".

=== Suspension ===
H.F.S. Morgan's 1909 runabout used [[sliding pillar suspension]], an [[independent front suspension]] system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide up and down a fixed pillar that also acts as the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tyre and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.

Morgan used developments of this suspension system throughout its existence, and it is still used on Morgan's \"classic\" line, although not on the Aero 8 or its derivatives. It has been cancelled, along with all the Morgan Classic line, in 2019. However, some \"classics\", shipped in parts to avoid the need for normal compliancy, will be shipped to the USA, and assembled there for an indefinite period.

== Motorsports ==
Morgan cars can be found in many areas of motorsport, from club and historic racing to more prominent examples, including the Le Mans 24hr race. A notable Morgan racecar was the Aero 8 GT car that campaigned in 2008 Britcar races and the 2008 Britcar 24hrs at Silverstone, prepared and run by Mark Bailey Racing.

[[Pescarolo Sport]] rebranded its [[Pescarolo 01|Le Mans Prototype]] as a Morgan for the [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans]], partly to mark the 50th anniversary of a class victory for a Morgan Plus Four Super Sports at Le Mans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wot.motortrend.com/british-sportscar-maker-morgan-to-race-lmp2-car-at-le-mans-160205.html |title=British Sportscar Maker Morgan to Race LMP2 Car at Le Mans |website=motortrend.com |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref>

On March 20, Premier Moe signed an order allowing regulations issued pursuant to the state of emergency, whether by the government or the chief medical officer, to be enforceable under provincial law.

=== Municipal orders with measures contrary to provincial measures ===
The municipal governments of [[Gravelbourg]] and Regina declared their own states of emergency with stricter restrictions than those enforced by the province. Regina announced an intent to ban all public meetings larger than 5 people or more (outside of home, workplaces, or as part of essential services), and order the closure of retail stores in specific categories to in-person shopping (including clothing, furniture, games, sporting goods, and toys) effective March 23.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6708095/regina-state-of-emergency/|title=Regina declares local state of emergency, limiting size of gatherings|website=Global News|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322203551/https://globalnews.ca/news/6708095/regina-state-of-emergency/|archive-date=March 22, 2020|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>  Gravelbourg similarly ordered that all businesses be closed to the public for 14 days (delivery and curbside pickup would still be allowed, and there were special operating requirements planned for the local [[Federated Co-operatives|Co-op]] store), and that only a maximum of five employees could be in a building at any one time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://regina.ctvnews.ca/here-s-what-the-state-of-local-emergency-in-gravelbourg-sask-means-for-residents-1.4863507|title=Here's what the state of local emergency in Gravelbourg, Sask. means for residents|last=|first=|date=2020-03-22|website=CTV News Regina|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200323135828/https://regina.ctvnews.ca/here-s-what-the-state-of-local-emergency-in-gravelbourg-sask-means-for-residents-1.4863507|archive-date=March 23, 2020|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> Mayor of Regina [[Michael Fougere]] argued that Saskatchewan's initial restrictions were not strict enough, arguing that meetings of 50 people were too large to avoid possible community transmission, and that restaurants and bars should have been ordered to close rather than limit capacity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://regina.ctvnews.ca/covid-19-mayor-of-regina-calling-for-even-stricter-regulations-1.4859506|title=COVID-19: Mayor of Regina calling for even stricter regulations|last=|first=|date=2020-03-19|website=CTV News Regina|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>

On March 20, Premier Moe signed an order allowing regulations issued pursuant to the state of emergency, whether by the government or the chief medical officer, to be enforceable under provincial law.

In early April, Restaurants Canada, an industry organisation, announced that 25,000 restaurant jobs have been lost in Saskatchewan since March 1.  It also reported that approximately 10% of restaurants in Canada have closed permanently, and estimated that another 18% would close if the situation has not changed in a month's time.

=== Municipal orders with measures contrary to provincial measures ===
The municipal governments of [[Gravelbourg]] and Regina declared their own states of emergency with stricter restrictions than those enforced by the province. Regina announced an intent to ban all public meetings larger than 5 people or more (outside of home, workplaces, or as part of essential services), and order the closure of retail stores in specific categories to in-person shopping (including clothing, furniture, games, sporting goods, and toys) effective March 23.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6708095/regina-state-of-emergency/|title=Regina declares local state of emergency, limiting size of gatherings|website=Global News|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322203551/https://globalnews.ca/news/6708095/regina-state-of-emergency/|archive-date=March 22, 2020|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>  Gravelbourg similarly ordered that all businesses be closed to the public for 14 days (delivery and curbside pickup would still be allowed, and there were special operating requirements planned for the local [[Federated Co-operatives|Co-op]] store), and that only a maximum of five employees could be in a building at any one time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://regina.ctvnews.ca/here-s-what-the-state-of-local-emergency-in-gravelbourg-sask-means-for-residents-1.4863507|title=Here's what the state of local emergency in Gravelbourg, Sask. means for residents|last=|first=|date=2020-03-22|website=CTV News Regina|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200323135828/https://regina.ctvnews.ca/here-s-what-the-state-of-local-emergency-in-gravelbourg-sask-means-for-residents-1.4863507|archive-date=March 23, 2020|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> Mayor of Regina [[Michael Fougere]] argued that Saskatchewan's initial restrictions were not strict enough, arguing that meetings of 50 people were too large to avoid possible community transmission, and that restaurants and bars should have been ordered to close rather than limit capacity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://regina.ctvnews.ca/covid-19-mayor-of-regina-calling-for-even-stricter-regulations-1.4859506|title=COVID-19: Mayor of Regina calling for even stricter regulations|last=|first=|date=2020-03-19|website=CTV News Regina|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>

'''Telford''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Telford-rev-2.ogg|ˈ|t|ɛ|l|f|ər|d}}) is a large [[new towns in the United Kingdom|new town]] in the borough of [[Telford and Wrekin]] and [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Shropshire]], England, about {{convert|13|mi|km}} east of [[Shrewsbury]], and {{convert|30|mi|km}} north west of [[Birmingham]]. With an estimated population (for the borough) of 175,271 in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.telford.gov.uk/downloads/file/7198/telford_and_wrekin_key_facts_-_december_2016|title=Telford & Wrekin Council download - Key facts sheets About my council {{!}} Facts and figures|last=Council|first=Telford & Wrekin|website=www.telford.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> and around 155,000 in Telford itself,<ref>Telford and Wrekin population estimates, 2011 https://www.telford.gov.uk/downloads/file/3825/telford_and_wrekin_population_estimates_and_projections_2011</ref> Telford is the largest town in Shropshire, and one of the fastest-growing towns in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telford.gov.uk/externalfunding/erdf/telford.html|title=Telford Town Centre|accessdate=2 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707003533/http://www.telford.gov.uk/externalfunding/erdf/telford.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 July 2007}}</ref>

It is named after [[civil engineer]] [[Thomas Telford]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Poulton-Smith|first1=Anthony|title=Shropshire Place Names|date=2009|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0-7524-4889-3|page=137}}</ref> who engineered many road and rail projects in Shropshire. The town was put together in the 1960s and 1970s as a [[new town]] on previously industrial and agricultural land and smaller towns. Like other [[New Towns in the United Kingdom|planned towns]] of the era, Telford was created from the merger of other, smaller settlements, most notably the towns of [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Oakengates]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Dawley]]. Many of the New Town's newer inhabitants were originally from [[Birmingham]] or [[Wolverhampton]].

[[Telford Shopping Centre]], a modern shopping mall, was constructed at the new town's geographical centre, along with an extensive [[Telford Town Park|Town Park]]. The [[M54 motorway]] was completed in 1983, improving the town's road links with the [[West Midlands conurbation]].

On Telford's southern boundaries is the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], a scenic tourist destination and [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The town advertises itself as \"The Birthplace of Industry\", due to it having [[Coalbrookdale]] and other places in the Ironbridge Gorge area, within its boundary.  These areas are internationally recognised as being important to the [[Industrial Revolution]], and being to a large extent constructed on the Shropshire Coalfield. Its influence was greatly used to further Birmingham’s industry through innovations as well.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:SunnycroftWellington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sunnycroft]] near Wellington]]
Early settlement in the area was thought to be on the land that sloped up from the [[Weald Moors]] (an area north of the town centre) towards the line along which the Roman [[Watling Street]] was built. Farmland surrounded three large estates in the 10th century, namely [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Wrockwardine]] and [[Lilleshall]].<ref name=\"hist\" />

From the 13th century there was urban development in Wellington and [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], where [[Wenlock Priory]] founded a new town. Six monastic houses, founded in the 11th and 12th centuries, had large interests in the area's economic growth. They collectively acquired almost half of the area, and profited from coal and ironstone mines and iron smithies on their estates.<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18062|title=History of Telford|work=British History Online|accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref>

The area was also the site of the 1821 [[Cinderloo Uprising]] which saw 3,000 people protest the lowering of wages for those working in the local coal industry. The protests resulted in the deaths of three striking colliers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Disturbances near Wellington |work=Salopian Journal |date=7 February 1821}}</ref>

===Modern history===

[[File:TelfordPlaza.JPG|thumb|right|Telford Plaza in Telford Town Centre.]]
The New Town was first designated on 16 January 1963 as '''Dawley New Town''', covering {{convert|9100|acre|km2}} of [[Dawley]], [[Much Wenlock|Wenlock]], [[Oakengates]], [[Wellington Rural District (Shropshire)|Wellington Rural District]] and [[Shifnal Rural District]].<ref>''London Gazette''. 18 January 1963.</ref> Development started, guided by the Dawley New Town Development Corporation, with the first homes on the new [[Sutton Hill]] housing estate being occupied in 1967. Initial planning and design concepts for Dawley New Town were produced by the Birmingham-based [[John Madin Design Group]].

The Minister proposed an extension of {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} in 1968 (taking in the historic area of [[Ironbridge Gorge]]), which saw objections and a public inquiry take place{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.  The ''Dawley New Town (Designation) Amendment (Telford) Order'' was made on 29 November 1968, extending the New Town area by {{convert|10143|acre|km2}} of \"land lying within the urban districts of Oakengates and Wellington and the rural districts of Shifnal and Wellington\".<ref>''London Gazette''.  13 December 1963.</ref> This Order also renamed the new town Telford, after the Scottish-born civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]] who, in 1787, became Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.

Most of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by Commission for the New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council. Telford was now 25 years old and was firmly established as one of the most important towns in the region.

In 1983, after fierce opposition and three public enquiries,<ref>{{cite news|title=30 years on - how opening of M54 brought new dawn for Shropshire|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2013/11/25/30-years-on/|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Shropshire Star|date=25 November 2013}}</ref> the [[M54 motorway]] was completed, connecting the town to the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and thence the rest of the UK's motorway network. Other major roads are the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]], [[A518 road|A518]] and [[A442 road|A442]], which is commonly known as the Eastern Primary or ''EP'', and is officially branded ''Queensway''.

Many of the new town's residents were originally from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] [[conurbation]], which includes [[Wolverhampton]], Birmingham, [[Dudley]] and [[Walsall]]. The vast majority of the [[Council housing|council house]] tenants in Telford were rehoused from inner city Birmingham. Some individuals still refuse to put Telford in their address, instead using the original local name (such as [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] or [[Dawley]]) and often citing the existence of Town Councils as support for the argument \"you can't live in a town in a town,\" e.g. Wellington (Town) Telford (Town). The new town's residents who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s earned the unwanted nickname \"overspill\" from people living in the existing towns and villages.

In 2007, a £250 million regeneration plan for the town centre was announced, which will include the pedestrianisation of the road surrounding the shopping centre, and the creation of new cafés, bars and shops which will lead to 1,750 new jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/7053156.stm|title=BBC Shropshire – Redevelopment scheme unveiled|accessdate=19 October 2007 | date=19 October 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> The reason for this expansion is that the original \"centre\" was only ever a shopping place with no real heart. Since the \"centre\" closed early evening, there was no nightlife at all in the area, the only major local entertainment areas being in Oakengates and Wellington.

The first phase of the town centre development, named Southwater, was completed in 2014.<ref name=shropshirestar-20140313>{{cite news |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2014/03/13/telfords-southwater-opening-schedule-is-unveiled/ |title=Telford's Southwater opening schedule is unveiled |newspaper=Shropshire Star |date=13 March 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> The official opening ceremony on 18 October 2014 included live music and fireworks. The area comprises a refurbished library, various chain restaurants, [[Cineworld]] IMAX Cinema, bowling alley/arcade and a new multi-storey car park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telfordshopping.co.uk/events/southwater-grand-opening |title=Southwater Grand Opening |publisher=Telford Shopping Centre |year=2014 |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:TheWrekin.jpg|thumb|[[The Wrekin]] overlooks the town]]
Telford town centre lies about {{convert|21|km|mi}} [[Boxing the compass|east/south-east]] of [[Shrewsbury]] and  {{convert|24|km|mi}} [[Boxing the compass|north-west]] of [[Wolverhampton]]. The town comprises 7,803 hectares (30.13 square miles) and its southern and eastern parts, between the [[Severn Gorge]] and [[Donnington Wood]], include the East Shropshire coalfield. North and north-west Telford lie beyond the coalfield's boundary fault on [[Bunter (geology)|sandstone beds]] which, along with other [[Triassic]] formations, prevail over much of the [[North Shropshire]] plain. The town centre stands on a watershed, with land to the south draining towards the [[River Severn]], and to the north the land slopes gently down towards the Weald Moors. The town is dominated by the [[Wrekin]], a large hill of 407&nbsp;m (1335&nbsp;ft),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.d1210.org/wrekin.html |title=Rotary Club of The Wrekin |publisher=D1210.org |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106215654/http://www.d1210.org/wrekin.html |archivedate=6 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> located south-west of Wellington, straddling the border with the unitary [[Shropshire Council]] (before the latter's creation in 2009 the borough of [[Shrewsbury and Atcham]]).<ref name=\"hist\" />

==Governance==
[[File:TelfordParishes.jpg|thumb| Ward map; Telford urban area highlighted in orange, within the [[Telford and Wrekin]] borough.]]
:''For more information on Parish divisions, see [[List of civil parishes in Shropshire#Telford and Wrekin|list of civil parishes in Shropshire]].''
Within the borough of [[Telford & Wrekin]], the town is entirely [[civil parish|parished]]. Telford has no single town council because of this, and the Mayor of the Borough of Telford and Wrekin is also ''de facto'' the town's mayor.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The town is also divided into Wards, within the [[Telford and Wrekin]] borough. These are used for electoral purposes and demographic surveys. Telford was created politically – but its attempts to make a cohesive town from the fusion of other independent, smaller towns: [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], [[Hadley, Shropshire|Hadley]], [[Oakengates]], [[Dawley]], [[Ironbridge]] and [[Donnington, Telford|Donnington]] have largely been successful. Despite this, the town has much clearer divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time. Some small settlements to the south such as a part of [[Ironbridge]] and [[Broseley]], while part of the Telford Urban Area, are administered by [[Shropshire Council]].

Telford is the only settlement within the [[Telford (UK Parliament constituency)|Telford parliamentary constituency]], which was held by [[Labour Party UK|Labour]] from its creation in 1997 until the 2015 General Election. The current MP is [[Lucy Allan (politician)|Lucy Allan]] (Conservative). Some suburbs, such as Wellington, are located in [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]], which also has varying support between the [[Conservative Party UK|Conservatives]] and Labour.  Conservative [[Mark Pritchard (politician)|Mark Pritchard]] was reelected as MP in 2015. Telford is administratively part of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands region]].

==Demography==
{{Telford area}}
In 1963 Dawley new town was intended to take 50,000 people from the [[West Midlands conurbation]]<ref>Dept. of Econ. Affairs, The W. Midlands: a regional study (1965), 3–4, 84.</ref> and so to grow to a town of 70,000 or more. By 1968 Telford was intended to take an additional 50,000 and grow to a town of 220,000 or more by 1991. By 1983, however, Telford's population was just under 108,000, and it was generally thought that it might not reach 120,000 by the late 1980s.<ref name=\"hist\" />

Telford has a younger than average population, and a higher rate of teenage pregnancy than the national average, as well as relatively high levels of income deprivation with 15% of residents living in low income households. In addition the level of statutorily homeless households in 2004/05 was above average for England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.communityhealthprofiles.info/profiles/hp2007/lo_res/00GF-HP2007.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080609153757/http://www.communityhealthprofiles.info/profiles/hp2007/lo_res/00GF%2DHP2007.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 June 2008 |title=Association of Public Health Observatories – Health Profiles |publisher=Communityhealthprofiles.info |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2009 }}</ref> The [[Telford and Wrekin]] area is a popular commuter zone, containing some relatively rural areas in the North and West of the borough. These are popular with commuters to the [[West Midlands conurbation]], due to the good transport links provided by the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]/[[M54 motorway|M54]].

Compared with the nearby West Midlands conurbation, Telford has a relatively high white population. In 2011, the town was 91.9% white (88.5% White British), 4.7% Asian, 1.2% Black, 1.9% Mixed race and 0.2% other.<ref name=\"citypopulation.de\"/> At the same census the population of the town was 142,723 and had an area of 46.2 kilometers with the population estimated to be 147,105 in 2016.

During the economic crisis of the late 1960s (with unemployment doubling nationally during the second half of the decade), unemployment in the then-new town was initially high.

However, in 1967 '''Halesfield Industrial Estate''' was founded on the south-eastern edge of the town – the first real answer to Telford's unemployment problems. Other large estates followed, in 1973 with '''Stafford Park''' just east of the [[Telford Town Centre|town centre]] and in 1979 with '''Hortonwood''', to the north, helping ease the unemployment crisis in a decade which saw an almost unbroken rise in unemployment.

In total, half a million square metres of factory space were provided between 1968 and 1983, making Telford an attractive investment area.<ref>Private inf.; Thomas, 'Telford', 36-7; Fenter, 'Bldg. Development in Telford'; Reps. of Dev. Corporations 31 March 1969, H.C. 398, pp. 469–70 (1968–69), xliii; 31 March 1983, H.C. 81, p. 317 (1982–83); Town Planning Rev. xliii. 360 n. 52.</ref>

By 1976, Telford had begun to recruit industry from the USA, Europe, and [[Japan]]. The foreign firms required larger factories, and they began to be built at Stafford Park. By 1983 over 2,000 jobs in Telford were provided by around 40 (mostly American) foreign companies.<ref>The Times, 24 November 1983 (p. 22).</ref> In contrast to industry in the [[Black Country]] at the time, these new companies focused on high-technology industries rather than the heavy and metal-finishing industries.<ref>Reps. of Dev. Corporations 31 March 1983, 309.</ref>

The new arrivals included the American company [[Unimation]] and three firms from Japan: [[Nikon]] UK Ltd., which opened a warehouse at Halesfield in 1983;<ref>T.D.C. Telford Ind. Dir. [c. 1979], 28.</ref> video tape manufacturers [[Hitachi Maxell]] at Apley Castle in 1983;<ref>	 Shropshire Star, 12 November 1983 (p. 3).</ref> and office equipment manufacturers [[Ricoh]], who took a {{convert|22|acre|m2|adj=on}} site for a factory at [[Priorslee]] next to the [[M54 motorway|M54]], and formed the first in Telford's new enterprise zone.<ref>Shropshire Star, 24 October 1983 (pp. 1, 6)</ref><ref>Shropshire Star, 16 November 1982; 2 December 1983 (p. 16)</ref>

Consequently, from the later 1970s, Telford began to attract high-technology firms and to diversify its industry, and the promotion of the Service industry also began to prosper, in the [[Telford Town Centre]] area. However, a deepening national recession meant that, despite the creation of new jobs, there were net job losses from 1979. Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster. Nevertheless, the rate of increase in unemployment was slowing down by 1983 and was making some progress against national and regional trends.<ref>N. Staffs. Jnl. Field Studies, xiii. 78; Telford Development Strategy: 6th Monitoring Rep. (T.D.C. 1983), 8–12, 22–8; B. Trinder, Hist. Salop. (1983), 121; Shropshire Star, 10 March  1982.</ref>

Unemployment in Telford was still around the 20% mark – nearly double the national average at the time – as late as 1986. The [[Lawson Boom]] of the next three years saw that figure fall dramatically by the end of the decade, only for it to rise to a similarly high figure again by 1992 as a result of the [[early 1990s recession]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk/infobyarea/region/area/areaassessment/pages/default.aspx?region=55&area=410 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217175014/http://oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk/infobyarea/region/area/areaassessment/pages/default.aspx?region=55&area=410 |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 December 2010 |title=Oneplace homepage |publisher=Oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk |date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}</ref>

Telford has attracted several large IT services companies, including [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] who support the MOD contract from the Euston Park site, as well as a vast array of clients across the world from the Plaza building. Also [[Capgemini]] and [[Fujitsu]] employ a significant number of staff in the area, mainly supporting their [[British Government|governmental]] client, [[HM Revenue & Customs|Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC)]]. The expansion in these job sectors provided a great asset to Telford's economic recovery after 1992. By August 2007, the success story of Telford's economy had seen unemployment shrink to 3.3% – a fraction of its peak 15 years earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/roots/packages/tra/tra_y07.htm |title=Shropshire Routes to Roots &#124; Transport and communication &#124; From trackways to motorways |publisher=.shropshire-cc.gov.uk |date=1 August 2007 |accessdate=29 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925200430/http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/roots/packages/tra/tra_y07.htm |archivedate=25 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

However, the [[Late 2000s recession|subsequent recession]] meant that unemployment in the area had risen to 5% by February 2011, although this was still well below the national average.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10604117 | work=BBC News | title=Economy tracker | date=17 August 2011}}</ref>

The town has three railway stations on the [[Shrewsbury to Wolverhampton Line]]: [[Wellington railway station (Shropshire)|Wellington]], [[Oakengates railway station|Oakengates]] and [[Telford Central railway station|Telford Central]]. In May 1998, [[Virgin Trains West Coast]] introduced a service from [[Shrewsbury railway station|Shrewsbury]] to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]].<ref>New Virgin through services launched with fresh nameplate design ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 1168 August 1998 page 53</ref> It was withdrawn in 2000.

Telford also hosted the [[UK Snooker Championship]], from 2007 to 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The championship moved from [[York]] in 2007 but returned to the refurbished Barbican Centre in York since 2011.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The Shropshire Golf Centre is located near [[Muxton]], to the northeast of Telford. This has three nine-hole courses, a 13-hole par three academy course and driving range.  Other courses include Horsehay Village Golf Club, The Wrekin Golf Club and Telford Golf and Country Club.

There are cricket clubs, who compete in local leagues. Wellington is where many Shropshire County matches are played.

'''Telford''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Telford-rev-2.ogg|ˈ|t|ɛ|l|f|ər|d}}) is a large [[new towns in the United Kingdom|new town]] in the borough of [[Telford and Wrekin]] and [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Shropshire]], England, about {{convert|13|mi|km}} east of [[Shrewsbury]], and {{convert|30|mi|km}} north west of [[Birmingham]]. With an estimated population (for the borough) of 175,271 in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.telford.gov.uk/downloads/file/7198/telford_and_wrekin_key_facts_-_december_2016|title=Telford & Wrekin Council download - Key facts sheets About my council {{!}} Facts and figures|last=Council|first=Telford & Wrekin|website=www.telford.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> and around 155,000 in Telford itself,<ref>Telford and Wrekin population estimates, 2011 https://www.telford.gov.uk/downloads/file/3825/telford_and_wrekin_population_estimates_and_projections_2011</ref> Telford is the largest town in Shropshire, and one of the fastest-growing towns in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telford.gov.uk/externalfunding/erdf/telford.html|title=Telford Town Centre|accessdate=2 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707003533/http://www.telford.gov.uk/externalfunding/erdf/telford.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 July 2007}}</ref>

It is named after [[civil engineer]] [[Thomas Telford]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Poulton-Smith|first1=Anthony|title=Shropshire Place Names|date=2009|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0-7524-4889-3|page=137}}</ref> who engineered many road and rail projects in Shropshire. The town was put together in the 1960s and 1970s as a [[new town]] on previously industrial and agricultural land and smaller towns. Like other [[New Towns in the United Kingdom|planned towns]] of the era, Telford was created from the merger of other, smaller settlements, most notably the towns of [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Oakengates]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Dawley]]. Many of the New Town's newer inhabitants were originally from [[Birmingham]] or [[Wolverhampton]].

[[Telford Shopping Centre]], a modern shopping mall, was constructed at the new town's geographical centre, along with an extensive [[Telford Town Park|Town Park]]. The [[M54 motorway]] was completed in 1983, improving the town's road links with the [[West Midlands conurbation]].

On Telford's southern boundaries is the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], a scenic tourist destination and [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The town advertises itself as \"The Birthplace of Industry\", due to it having [[Coalbrookdale]] and other places in the Ironbridge Gorge area, within its boundary.  These areas are internationally recognised as being important to the [[Industrial Revolution]], and being to a large extent constructed on the Shropshire Coalfield. Its influence was greatly used to further Birmingham’s industry through innovations as well.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:SunnycroftWellington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sunnycroft]] near Wellington]]
Early settlement in the area was thought to be on the land that sloped up from the [[Weald Moors]] (an area north of the town centre) towards the line along which the Roman [[Watling Street]] was built. Farmland surrounded three large estates in the 10th century, namely [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Wrockwardine]] and [[Lilleshall]].<ref name=\"hist\" />

From the 13th century there was urban development in Wellington and [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], where [[Wenlock Priory]] founded a new town. Six monastic houses, founded in the 11th and 12th centuries, had large interests in the area's economic growth. They collectively acquired almost half of the area, and profited from coal and ironstone mines and iron smithies on their estates.<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18062|title=History of Telford|work=British History Online|accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref>

The area was also the site of the 1821 [[Cinderloo Uprising]] which saw 3,000 people protest the lowering of wages for those working in the local coal industry. The protests resulted in the deaths of three striking colliers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Disturbances near Wellington |work=Salopian Journal |date=7 February 1821}}</ref>

===Modern history===

[[File:TelfordPlaza.JPG|thumb|right|Telford Plaza in Telford Town Centre.]]
The New Town was first designated on 16 January 1963 as '''Dawley New Town''', covering {{convert|9100|acre|km2}} of [[Dawley]], [[Much Wenlock|Wenlock]], [[Oakengates]], [[Wellington Rural District (Shropshire)|Wellington Rural District]] and [[Shifnal Rural District]].<ref>''London Gazette''. 18 January 1963.</ref> Development started, guided by the Dawley New Town Development Corporation, with the first homes on the new [[Sutton Hill]] housing estate being occupied in 1967. Initial planning and design concepts for Dawley New Town were produced by the Birmingham-based [[John Madin Design Group]].

The Minister proposed an extension of {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} in 1968 (taking in the historic area of [[Ironbridge Gorge]]), which saw objections and a public inquiry take place{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.  The ''Dawley New Town (Designation) Amendment (Telford) Order'' was made on 29 November 1968, extending the New Town area by {{convert|10143|acre|km2}} of \"land lying within the urban districts of Oakengates and Wellington and the rural districts of Shifnal and Wellington\".<ref>''London Gazette''.  13 December 1963.</ref> This Order also renamed the new town Telford, after the Scottish-born civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]] who, in 1787, became Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.

Most of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by Commission for the New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council. Telford was now 25 years old and was firmly established as one of the most important towns in the region.

In 1983, after fierce opposition and three public enquiries,<ref>{{cite news|title=30 years on - how opening of M54 brought new dawn for Shropshire|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2013/11/25/30-years-on/|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Shropshire Star|date=25 November 2013}}</ref> the [[M54 motorway]] was completed, connecting the town to the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and thence the rest of the UK's motorway network. Other major roads are the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]], [[A518 road|A518]] and [[A442 road|A442]], which is commonly known as the Eastern Primary or ''EP'', and is officially branded ''Queensway''.

Many of the new town's residents were originally from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] [[conurbation]], which includes [[Wolverhampton]], Birmingham, [[Dudley]] and [[Walsall]]. The vast majority of the [[Council housing|council house]] tenants in Telford were rehoused from inner city Birmingham. Some individuals still refuse to put Telford in their address, instead using the original local name (such as [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] or [[Dawley]]) and often citing the existence of Town Councils as support for the argument \"you can't live in a town in a town,\" e.g. Wellington (Town) Telford (Town). The new town's residents who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s earned the unwanted nickname \"overspill\" from people living in the existing towns and villages.

In 2007, a £250 million regeneration plan for the town centre was announced, which will include the pedestrianisation of the road surrounding the shopping centre, and the creation of new cafés, bars and shops which will lead to 1,750 new jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/7053156.stm|title=BBC Shropshire – Redevelopment scheme unveiled|accessdate=19 October 2007 | date=19 October 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> The reason for this expansion is that the original \"centre\" was only ever a shopping place with no real heart. Since the \"centre\" closed early evening, there was no nightlife at all in the area, the only major local entertainment areas being in Oakengates and Wellington.

The first phase of the town centre development, named Southwater, was completed in 2014.<ref name=shropshirestar-20140313>{{cite news |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2014/03/13/telfords-southwater-opening-schedule-is-unveiled/ |title=Telford's Southwater opening schedule is unveiled |newspaper=Shropshire Star |date=13 March 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> The official opening ceremony on 18 October 2014 included live music and fireworks. The area comprises a refurbished library, various chain restaurants, [[Cineworld]] IMAX Cinema, bowling alley/arcade and a new multi-storey car park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telfordshopping.co.uk/events/southwater-grand-opening |title=Southwater Grand Opening |publisher=Telford Shopping Centre |year=2014 |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:TheWrekin.jpg|thumb|[[The Wrekin]] overlooks the town]]
Telford town centre lies about {{convert|21|km|mi}} [[Boxing the compass|east/south-east]] of [[Shrewsbury]] and  {{convert|24|km|mi}} [[Boxing the compass|north-west]] of [[Wolverhampton]]. The town comprises 7,803 hectares (30.13 square miles) and its southern and eastern parts, between the [[Severn Gorge]] and [[Donnington Wood]], include the East Shropshire coalfield. North and north-west Telford lie beyond the coalfield's boundary fault on [[Bunter (geology)|sandstone beds]] which, along with other [[Triassic]] formations, prevail over much of the [[North Shropshire]] plain. The town centre stands on a watershed, with land to the south draining towards the [[River Severn]], and to the north the land slopes gently down towards the Weald Moors. The town is dominated by the [[Wrekin]], a large hill of 407&nbsp;m (1335&nbsp;ft),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.d1210.org/wrekin.html |title=Rotary Club of The Wrekin |publisher=D1210.org |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106215654/http://www.d1210.org/wrekin.html |archivedate=6 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> located south-west of Wellington, straddling the border with the unitary [[Shropshire Council]] (before the latter's creation in 2009 the borough of [[Shrewsbury and Atcham]]).<ref name=\"hist\" />

==Governance==
[[File:TelfordParishes.jpg|thumb| Ward map; Telford urban area highlighted in orange, within the [[Telford and Wrekin]] borough.]]
:''For more information on Parish divisions, see [[List of civil parishes in Shropshire#Telford and Wrekin|list of civil parishes in Shropshire]].''
Within the borough of [[Telford & Wrekin]], the town is entirely [[civil parish|parished]]. Telford has no single town council because of this, and the Mayor of the Borough of Telford and Wrekin is also ''de facto'' the town's mayor.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The town is also divided into Wards, within the [[Telford and Wrekin]] borough. These are used for electoral purposes and demographic surveys. Telford was created politically – but its attempts to make a cohesive town from the fusion of other independent, smaller towns: [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], [[Hadley, Shropshire|Hadley]], [[Oakengates]], [[Dawley]], [[Ironbridge]] and [[Donnington, Telford|Donnington]] have largely been successful. Despite this, the town has much clearer divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time. Some small settlements to the south such as a part of [[Ironbridge]] and [[Broseley]], while part of the Telford Urban Area, are administered by [[Shropshire Council]].

Telford is the only settlement within the [[Telford (UK Parliament constituency)|Telford parliamentary constituency]], which was held by [[Labour Party UK|Labour]] from its creation in 1997 until the 2015 General Election. The current MP is [[Lucy Allan (politician)|Lucy Allan]] (Conservative). Some suburbs, such as Wellington, are located in [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]], which also has varying support between the [[Conservative Party UK|Conservatives]] and Labour.  Conservative [[Mark Pritchard (politician)|Mark Pritchard]] was reelected as MP in 2015. Telford is administratively part of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands region]].

==Demography==
{{Telford area}}
In 1963 Dawley new town was intended to take 50,000 people from the [[West Midlands conurbation]]<ref>Dept. of Econ. Affairs, The W. Midlands: a regional study (1965), 3–4, 84.</ref> and so to grow to a town of 70,000 or more. By 1968 Telford was intended to take an additional 50,000 and grow to a town of 220,000 or more by 1991. By 1983, however, Telford's population was just under 108,000, and it was generally thought that it might not reach 120,000 by the late 1980s.<ref name=\"hist\" />

Telford has a younger than average population, and a higher rate of teenage pregnancy than the national average, as well as relatively high levels of income deprivation with 15% of residents living in low income households. In addition the level of statutorily homeless households in 2004/05 was above average for England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.communityhealthprofiles.info/profiles/hp2007/lo_res/00GF-HP2007.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080609153757/http://www.communityhealthprofiles.info/profiles/hp2007/lo_res/00GF%2DHP2007.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 June 2008 |title=Association of Public Health Observatories – Health Profiles |publisher=Communityhealthprofiles.info |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2009 }}</ref> The [[Telford and Wrekin]] area is a popular commuter zone, containing some relatively rural areas in the North and West of the borough. These are popular with commuters to the [[West Midlands conurbation]], due to the good transport links provided by the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]/[[M54 motorway|M54]].

Compared with the nearby West Midlands conurbation, Telford has a relatively high white population. In 2011, the town was 91.9% white (88.5% White British), 4.7% Asian, 1.2% Black, 1.9% Mixed race and 0.2% other.<ref name=\"citypopulation.de\"/> At the same census the population of the town was 142,723 and had an area of 46.2 kilometers with the population estimated to be 147,105 in 2016.

During the economic crisis of the late 1960s (with unemployment doubling nationally during the second half of the decade), unemployment in the then-new town was initially high.

However, in 1967 '''Halesfield Industrial Estate''' was founded on the south-eastern edge of the town – the first real answer to Telford's unemployment problems. Other large estates followed, in 1973 with '''Stafford Park''' just east of the [[Telford Town Centre|town centre]] and in 1979 with '''Hortonwood''', to the north, helping ease the unemployment crisis in a decade which saw an almost unbroken rise in unemployment.

In total, half a million square metres of factory space were provided between 1968 and 1983, making Telford an attractive investment area.<ref>Private inf.; Thomas, 'Telford', 36-7; Fenter, 'Bldg. Development in Telford'; Reps. of Dev. Corporations 31 March 1969, H.C. 398, pp. 469–70 (1968–69), xliii; 31 March 1983, H.C. 81, p. 317 (1982–83); Town Planning Rev. xliii. 360 n. 52.</ref>

By 1976, Telford had begun to recruit industry from the USA, Europe, and [[Japan]]. The foreign firms required larger factories, and they began to be built at Stafford Park. By 1983 over 2,000 jobs in Telford were provided by around 40 (mostly American) foreign companies.<ref>The Times, 24 November 1983 (p. 22).</ref> In contrast to industry in the [[Black Country]] at the time, these new companies focused on high-technology industries rather than the heavy and metal-finishing industries.<ref>Reps. of Dev. Corporations 31 March 1983, 309.</ref>

The new arrivals included the American company [[Unimation]] and three firms from Japan: [[Nikon]] UK Ltd., which opened a warehouse at Halesfield in 1983;<ref>T.D.C. Telford Ind. Dir. [c. 1979], 28.</ref> video tape manufacturers [[Hitachi Maxell]] at Apley Castle in 1983;<ref>	 Shropshire Star, 12 November 1983 (p. 3).</ref> and office equipment manufacturers [[Ricoh]], who took a {{convert|22|acre|m2|adj=on}} site for a factory at [[Priorslee]] next to the [[M54 motorway|M54]], and formed the first in Telford's new enterprise zone.<ref>Shropshire Star, 24 October 1983 (pp. 1, 6)</ref><ref>Shropshire Star, 16 November 1982; 2 December 1983 (p. 16)</ref>

Consequently, from the later 1970s, Telford began to attract high-technology firms and to diversify its industry, and the promotion of the Service industry also began to prosper, in the [[Telford Town Centre]] area. However, a deepening national recession meant that, despite the creation of new jobs, there were net job losses from 1979. Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster. Nevertheless, the rate of increase in unemployment was slowing down by 1983 and was making some progress against national and regional trends.<ref>N. Staffs. Jnl. Field Studies, xiii. 78; Telford Development Strategy: 6th Monitoring Rep. (T.D.C. 1983), 8–12, 22–8; B. Trinder, Hist. Salop. (1983), 121; Shropshire Star, 10 March  1982.</ref>

Unemployment in Telford was still around the 20% mark – nearly double the national average at the time – as late as 1986. The [[Lawson Boom]] of the next three years saw that figure fall dramatically by the end of the decade, only for it to rise to a similarly high figure again by 1992 as a result of the [[early 1990s recession]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk/infobyarea/region/area/areaassessment/pages/default.aspx?region=55&area=410 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217175014/http://oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk/infobyarea/region/area/areaassessment/pages/default.aspx?region=55&area=410 |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 December 2010 |title=Oneplace homepage |publisher=Oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk |date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}</ref>

[[File:Southwater Phase 1 - new developments at Telford Town Centre (geograph 4236071).jpg|thumb|The 2014 Southwater development just south of the shopping centre]]
Telford has attracted several large IT services companies, including [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] who support the MOD contract from the Euston Park site, as well as a vast array of clients across the world from the Plaza building. Also [[Capgemini]] and [[Fujitsu]] employ a significant number of staff in the area, mainly supporting their [[British Government|governmental]] client, [[HM Revenue & Customs|Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC)]].

[[File:Francisco Hernandez Giron 2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Francisco Hernández Girón]] was a Spanish ''encomendero'' in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] who protested the [[New Laws]] in 1553. These laws, passed in 1542, gave certain rights to indigenous peoples and protected them against abuses. Drawing by [[Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala]].]]

{{Slavery|Region}}

'''''Encomienda''''' ({{IPA-es|eŋkoˈmjenda|-|ES-pe - Encomienda.ogg}}) was a Spanish labor system that rewarded conquerors with the labor of particular groups of subject people. It was first established in Spain following the Christian recovery of their territories under Muslim rule (known as the ''[[Reconquista]]''), and it was applied on a much larger scale during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Philippines]]. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the [[Spanish monarch]]. The Crown awarded an ''encomienda'' as a grant to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the sixteenth century, the grants were considered to be a monopoly on the labor of particular groups of [[indigenous peoples]], held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the ''encomendero'', and his descendants.<ref>James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 138.</ref>

Encomiendas devolved from their original Iberian form into a form of \"communal\" slavery. In the ''encomienda'', the Spanish Crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community but did not dictate which individuals in the community would have to provide their labor. Indigenous leaders were charged with mobilizing the assessed tribute and labor. In turn, ''encomenderos'' were to ensure that the encomienda natives were given instruction in the Christian faith and Spanish language, and protect them from warring tribes or pirates; they had to suppress rebellion against Spaniards, and maintain infrastructure. In return, the natives would provide tributes in the form of metals, [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[pork]], or other agricultural products.

The abolition of the Encomienda in 1542 marks the first major movement towards the abolition of slavery in the Western world.  However, coerced labor continued in other forms throughout the Spanish colonies.

== History ==
The heart of ''encomienda'' and ''encomendero'' lies in the Spanish verb ''encomendar'', \"to entrust\". The ''encomienda'' was based on the ''[[reconquista]]'' institution in which ''[[adelantado]]s'' were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other [[peasant]]s in areas that they had conquered and resettled.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>

The ''encomienda'' system traveled to America as the result of the implantation of Castilian law over the territory. The system was created in the Middle Ages and was pivotal to allow for the repopulation and protection of frontier land during the [[reconquista]]. This system originated in the Catholic South of Spain to extract labor and tribute from Muslims (Moors) before they were exiled in 1492 after the Moors were defeated in the battle in Granada.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref> This system was a method of rewarding soldiers and moneymen who defeated the Moors.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77348-5 |pages=388}}</ref> The encomienda established a relationship similar to a feudal relationship, in which military protection was traded for certain tributes or by specific work. It was especially prevalent among military orders that were entrusted with the protection of frontier areas. The king usually intervened directly or indirectly in the bond, by guaranteeing the fairness of the agreement and intervening militarily in case of abuse.

The ''encomienda'' system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution. The ''encomenderos'' did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the ''encomendero''; native lands were to remain in the possession of their communities. This right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the [[New World]] belonged to this crown and not to the [[Catholic monarchs]] as a whole.<ref>Scott, Meredith, \"[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html The Encomienda System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218180735/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html |date=2005-12-18 }}\".</ref>

==''Encomenderos''==
[[File:Hernán_Cortés_(Meister_von_Saldana).gif|thumb|right|[[Hernán Cortés]], conqueror of the Aztecs and premier encomendero of [[New Spain]]]]
The first grantees of the ''encomienda'' or ''encomenderos'' were usually conquerors who received these grants of labor by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving ''encomiendas'' in [[New Spain]] (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.

In his study of the ''encomenderos'' of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of [[Hernán Cortés]]' original expedition, calling them \"first conquerors\", and those who were members of the later [[Pánfilo de Narváez|Narváez]] expedition, calling them \"conquerors\". The latter were incorporated into Cortes' contingent. Himmerick designated as ''pobladores antiguos'' (old settlers) a group of undetermined number of ''encomenderos'' in New Spain, men who had resided in the Caribbean region prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico.

In the New World, the Crown granted conquistadores as encomendero, which is the right to extract labor and tribute from natives who were under Spanish rule. Christopher Columbus established the encomienda system after his arrival and settlement on the island of Hispaniola requiring them to pay tributes or face brutal punishments. Tributes were required to be paid in gold however during this time gold was scarce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>

Holders of ''encomiendas'' also included women and indigenous elite. Doña Maria Jaramillo, the daughter of [[La Malinche|Doña Marina]] and conqueror Juan Jaramillo, received income from her deceased father's ''encomiendas''.<ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555'', Austin: University of Texas Press, 1991 p. 178</ref> Two of Moctezuma's daughters, Doña [[Isabel Moctezuma]] and her younger sister, Doña Leonor Moctezuma, were granted extensive ''encomiendas'' in perpetuity by Hernan Cortes. Doña Leonor Moctezuma married in succession two Spaniards, and left the ''encomiendas'' to her daughter by her second husband.<ref>Himmerich y Valencia (1991), ''The Encomenderos'', pp. 195-96</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Samora |first=Julian |author2=Patricia Vandel Simon |title=A History of the Mexican-American People |url=http://www.jsri.msu.edu/museum/pubs/MexAmHist/chapter3.html#five |accessdate=2009-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402165741/http://www.jsri.msu.edu/museum/pubs/MexAmHist/chapter3.html |archivedate=April 2, 2009 }}</ref><ref>Himmerich y Valencia (1991), 27</ref> [[Vassal]] Inca rulers appointed after the conquest also sought and were granted ''encomiendas''.

The status of humans as [[Ward (law)|wards]] of the trustees under the ''encomienda'' system served to \"define the status of the Indian population\": the natives were free men, not slaves or serfs.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} But some Spaniards treated them as poorly as slaves.

The ''encomienda'' was essential to the Spanish crown's sustaining its control over North, Central and South America in the first decades after the colonization. It was the first major organizational law instituted on the continent, which was affected by war, widespread disease epidemics caused by Eurasian diseases, and resulting turmoil.<ref>[[Inga Clendinnen|Clendinnen, Inga]]; ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatán, 1517–1570''. (p. 83) {{ISBN|0-521-37981-4}}</ref> Initially, the ''encomienda'' system was devised to meet the needs of the early agricultural economies in the Caribbean. Later it was adopted to the mining economy of [[Peru]] and [[Upper Peru]].

Philip II, enacted a law on 11 June 1594 to establish the ''encomienda'' in the [[Philippines]], where he made grants to the local nobles (''[[principalía]]''). They used the ''encomienda'' to gain ownership of large expanses of land, many of which (such as [[Makati]]) continue to be owned by affluent families.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Dr. Eric A|title=The encomienda in early Philippine colonial history|year=1976|publisher=Journal of Asian Studies|location=Quezon City|pages=27–32|url=http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-14-2-1976/anderson-encomienda-philippine-history.pdf}}</ref>

== Establishment ==
In 1501 [[Isabella of Castile|Queen Isabella]] declared Native Americans as subjects to the crown, and so, as Castilians and legal equals to Spanish Castilians. This implied that enslaving them was illegal except on very specific conditions. It also allowed the establishment of encomiendas, since the encomienda bond was a right reserved to full subjects to the crown.
In 1503, the crown began to formally grant ''encomiendas'' to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of ''encomiendas'' was aided by the crown's organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as ''[[Reductions|reducciones]]'', with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.

Each ''reducción'' had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the laborers in his community. The ''encomienda'' system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers' acquisition of land. As initially defined, the ''encomendero'' and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major crown reform in 1542, known as the [[New Laws]], encomendero families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, Spanish recipients rebelled against the crown, killing the viceroy, Don [[Blasco Núñez Vela]].

In Mexico, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] decided against implementing the reform, citing local circumstances and the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, \"I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order.\"<ref>Arthur S. Aiton, ''Antonio de Mendoza, First Viceroy of New Spain,'' Durham: Duke University Press 1972.</ref> The ''encomienda'' system was ended legally in 1720, when the crown attempted to abolish the institution. The ''encomenderos'' were then required to pay remaining ''encomienda'' laborers for their work.

The ''encomiendas'' became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepción, north of Santo Domingo, the ''[[adelantado]]'' of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=onepage&q=15%2C000&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=121| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Upon hearing this, the Adelantado captured the ''[[cacique]]s'' involved and had most of them hanged.

Later, a chieftain named [[Guarionex]] laid havoc to the countryside before an army of about 3,090 routed the [[Ciguana people]] under his leadership.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=snippet&q=three%20thousand%20islanders&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=143| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders <!-- where are we?

As noted, the change of requiring the ''encomendado'' to be returned to the crown after two generations was frequently overlooked, as the colonists did not want to give up the labor or power. The ''Codice Osuna'', one of many colonial-era [[Aztec codices]] (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in [[Nahuatl]], there is evidence that the indigenous were well aware of the distinction between indigenous communities held by individual encomenderos and those held by the crown.<ref>''Codice Osuna,'' Ediciones del Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, Mexico 1947, pp. 250-254</ref>

Once natives committed themselves to Spanish authority, Columbus, and Spanish overlords, they also were forced to get baptized and attend Catholic Church services. Religion allowed conquistadores to label the native population as barbaric and in need of saving. The encomienda system perpetuated because many conquistadores believed they were being altruistic and were doing God’s work. Religion encouraged the expansion of conquest through the encomienda system throughout the New World.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>

The phrase \"''sin indios no hay Indias''\" (without Indians, there are no Indies – i.e. America), popular in Spanish America especially in the 16th century, emphasizes the economic importance and appeal of this [[indentured labor]]. It was ranked higher than allocations of precious metals or other natural resources. Land awardees customarily complained about how \"worthless\" territory was without a population of ''encomendados''.

The native people of Mexico experienced a series of outbreaks of disease in the wake of European conquest, including a catastrophic epidemic that began in 1545 which killed an estimated 5 million to 15 million people, or up to 80% of the native population of Mexico, followed by a second epidemic from 1576 to 1578 killing an additional 2 to 2.5 million people, or about 50% of the remaining native population. Recent research suggests that these infections appear to have been aggravated by the extreme climatic conditions of the time and by the poor living conditions and harsh treatment of the native people under the encomienda system of New Spain.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Acuna-Soto | first1 = Rodolfo | last2 = Stahle | first2 = David W. | last3 = Cleaveland | first3 = Malcolm K. | last4 = Therrell | first4 = Matthew D. | year = 2002 | title = Megadrought and Megadeath in 16th Century Mexico | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730237/ | journal = Emerg Infect Dis. | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 360–362 | doi = 10.3201/eid0804.010175 }}</ref>

At such a high altitude, pneumonia was always a concern, and mercury poisoning took the lives of many involved in the refining process.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"BBC - A History of the World - About: Transcripts - Episode 80 - Pieces of eight\". |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode80/}}</ref> Some writers such as [[Eduardo Galeano]], in his work ''[[Open Veins of Latin America]]'', estimates that up to eight million have died in the Cerro Rico since the 16th century.

Noble David Cook, writing about the [[Black legend (Spain)|Black Legend]] and the [[conquest of the Americas]] wrote, \"There were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact\" and instead suggests the near total decimation of the indigenous population of Hispaniola as mostly having been caused by diseases like smallpox.<ref name=\"Cook1998\">{{cite book|author=Noble David Cook|title=Born to Die: Disease and New World Conquest, 1492–1650|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvjNyZTFrS4C|date=13 February 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62730-6 |pages=9–14}}</ref>

Since 1960 historians, such as [[Julián Juderías]], [[Woodrow Borah]] and Sheburne Cooke have challenged both the numbers and the causes offered by Raphael Lemkin. Brendan D. O'Fallona and Lars Fehren-Schmitz separately estimated a historic native mortality of about 50% loss with a quick recovery and little loss in diversity.<ref>Brendan D. O'Fallona and Lars Fehren-Schmitz. ''Native Americans experienced a strong population bottleneck coincident with European contact.'' ''Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A'' 2011; 108(51): 20444–20448.  doi:  10.1073/pnas.1112563108  {{PMID|22143784}} </ref> Rosenblat estimates a lower number for Mexico and Colombia. Acuna-Soto R, Romero LC, and Maguire JH suggested the rate of mortality from disease in native American populations at around 45%.<ref>Acuna-Soto R, Romero LC, Maguire JH. \"Large epidemics of hemorrhagic fevers in Mexico 1545-1815. ''The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene'' 62 issue 6 on pages 733-739  doi 10.4269/ajtmh.2000.62.733 </ref>

Regardless of the specific number, it is widely agreed that the peak in mortality started in 1545 and peaked some years later after the New Laws were put in place, the encomienda system was abolished, and women, and more importantly children, were allowed to migrate. What mortality of the native population did occur was mainly attributable to disease. Most scholars agree that the main culprits were European infantile diseases like smallpox, measles, and chicken pox.<ref>Francisco Guerra. Origen de las epidemias en la conquista de América</ref> Elsa Malvido suggests that the plague caused the hemorrhagic fevers described by the Spanish physicians, while a recent, controversial study recently proposed by microbiologist [[Rodolfo Acuna-Soto]] suggests that the diseases that decimated the population were actually a native hemorrhagic plague carried by rats.<ref>RODOLFO ACUNA-SOTO, LETICIA CALDERON ROMERO, AND JAMES H.

==Abolition==
===Previously===
The ''encomienda'' system was the subject of controversy in Spain and its territories almost from its start. In 1510, an [[Hispaniola]] ''encomendero'' named Valenzuela murdered a group of Native American leaders who had agreed to meet for peace talks in full confidence. The Taíno Cacique [[Enriquillo]] rebelled against the Spaniards between 1519 and 1533. In 1538, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], realizing the seriousness of the Taíno revolt, changed the laws governing the treatment of people laboring in the encomiendas.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Columbus and Las Casas: the conquest and Christianization of America, 1492–1566 | author=David M. Traboulay | url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Jmi4Wb1DdsC&pg=PA44&dq=enriquillo+revolt#v=onepage&q=enriquillo%20revolt&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=44| isbn=9780819196422 | year=1994 }}</ref> Conceding to Las Casas's viewpoint, the peace treaty between the Taínos and the ''[[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|audiencia]]'' was eventually disrupted in four to five years. The crown also actively prosecuted abuses of the ''encomienda'' system, through the Law of Burgos (1512–13) and the [[New Laws|New Law of the Indies (1542)]].

The priest of Hispaniola and former ''encomendero'' [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] underwent a profound conversion after seeing the abuse of the native people.<ref>Bartolomé de Las Casas, who arrived in the New World in 1502, averred that greed was the reason Christians \"murdered on such a vast scale,\" killing \"anyone and everyone who has shown the slightest sign of resistance,\" and subjecting \"all males to the harshest and most iniquitous and brutal slavery that man has ever devised for oppressing his fellow-men, treating them, in fact, worse than animals.\" Reséndez, Andrés. The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America (Kindle Locations 338-341). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.</ref> He dedicated his life to writing and lobbying to abolish the ''encomienda'' system, which he thought systematically enslaved the native people of the New World. Las Casas participated in an [[Valladolid debate|important debate]], where he pushed for the enactment of the New Laws and an end to the ''encomienda'' system.<ref>Benjamin Keen, ''Bartolome de las Casas in history: toward an understanding of the man and his work''. (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University, 1971), 364–365.</ref> The Laws of Burgos and the New Laws of the Indies failed in the face of colonial opposition and, in fact, the New Laws were postponed in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. When [[Blasco Núñez Vela]], the first viceroy of Peru, tried to enforce the New Laws, which provided for the gradual abolition of the ''encomienda'', many of the ''encomenderos'' were unwilling to comply with them and revolted against him.

===The New Laws of 1542===
{{Main|New Laws}}

When the news of this situation and of the abuse of the institution reached Spain, the [[New Laws]] were passed to regulate and gradually abolish the system in America, as well as to reiterate the prohibition of enslaving Native Americans. By the time the new laws were passed, 1543, the Spanish crown had acknowledged their inability to control and properly ensure compliance of traditional laws overseas, so they granted to Native Americans specific protections not even Spaniards had, such as the prohibition of enslaving them even in the case of crime or war. These extra protections were an attempt to avoid the proliferation of irregular claims to slavery.<ref>Suárez Romero. LA SITUACIÓN JURÍDICA DEL INDIO DURANTE LA CONQUISTA ESPAÑOLA EN AMÉRICA. REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE DERECHO DE MÉXICO TOMO LXVIII, Núm.270 (Enero-Abril 2018)</ref> Andrés Reséndez, however, presents a more pessimistic view that such intentions where subsequently corrupted, and shortly after the abolition tens of thousands of people<ref name=otherslaver /> continued to be worked to death in depopulated islands throughout Hispaniola, and he describes indigenous forced labor as \"a set of kaleidoscopic practices suited to different markets and regions. The Spanish crown's formal prohibition of slavery of native people in 1542 gave rise to a number of related institutions, such as encomiendas, repartimientos, the selling of convict labor, and ultimately debt peonage ... In other words, formal slavery was replaced by multiple forms of informal labor coercion and enslavement that were extremely difficult to track, let alone eradicate.\"<ref name=otherslaver />

==Repartimiento==
The ''encomienda'' system was generally replaced by the crown-managed ''[[repartimiento]]'' system throughout Spanish America after mid-sixteenth century.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Like the ''encomienda'', the new ''repartimiento'' did not include the attribution of land to anyone, rather only the allotment of native workers. But they were directly allotted to the crown, who, through a local crown official, would assign them to work for settlers for a set period of time, usually several weeks. The ''repartimiento'' was an attempt \"to reduce the abuses of forced labour\".<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> As the number of [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives declined]] and mining activities were replaced by agricultural activities in the seventeenth century, the [[hacienda]], or large landed estates in which laborers were directly employed by the hacienda owners (''hacendados''), arose because land ownership became more profitable than acquisition of forced labor.<ref>Tindall, George Brown & David E.

{{Slavery|Region}}

'''''Encomienda''''' ({{IPA-es|eŋkoˈmjenda|-|ES-pe - Encomienda.ogg}}) was a Spanish labor system that rewarded conquerors with the labor of particular groups of subject people. It was first established in Spain following the Christian recovery of their territories under Muslim rule (known as the ''[[Reconquista]]''), and it was applied on a much larger scale during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Philippines]]. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the [[Spanish monarch]]. The Crown awarded an ''encomienda'' as a grant to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the sixteenth century, the grants were considered to be a monopoly on the labor of particular groups of [[indigenous peoples]], held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the ''encomendero'', and his descendants.<ref>James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 138.</ref>

Encomiendas devolved from their original Iberian form into a form of \"communal\" slavery. In the ''encomienda'', the Spanish Crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community but did not dictate which individuals in the community would have to provide their labor. Indigenous leaders were charged with mobilizing the assessed tribute and labor. In turn, ''encomenderos'' were to ensure that the encomienda natives were given instruction in the Christian faith and Spanish language, and protect them from warring tribes or pirates; they had to suppress rebellion against Spaniards, and maintain infrastructure. In return, the natives would provide tributes in the form of metals, [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[pork]], or other agricultural products.

With the ousting of [[Christopher Columbus]], the Spanish crown sent a royal governor, Fray [[Nicolás de Ovando]], who established the formal ''encomienda'' system.<ref>Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 47</ref> In many cases natives were forced to do hard labor and subjected to extreme punishment and death if they resisted.<ref name=\"encslav\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion|page=184|volume=1|first=Junius P.|last=Rodriguez|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33272-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_kuS42BxIYC&pg=PA184}}</ref> However, Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] forbade slavery of the native population and deemed the indigenous to be \"free vassals of the crown\".<ref>Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, 143</ref> Various versions of the ''Leyes de Indias'' or [[Laws of the Indies]] from 1512 onwards attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives. Both natives and Spaniards appealed to the [[Real Audiencia]]s for relief under the ''encomienda'' system.

''Encomiendas'' had often been characterized by the geographical displacement of the enslaved and breakup of communities and family units, but in Mexico, the ''encomienda'' ruled the free vassals of the crown through existing community hierarchies, and the natives were allowed to keep in touch with their families and homes.<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule,'' Stanford, 1964.</ref> This was not true in all areas as in some parts of [[Hispaniola]],<ref name=\"otherslaver\">{{cite web|last=Trever |first=David |title=The new book 'The Other Slavery' will make you rethink American history |url=https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-native-american-slavery-20160505-snap-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620020336/https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-native-american-slavery-20160505-snap-story.html |archive-date=2019-06-20|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> [[Spanish conquest of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]],<ref name=\"churwas\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Churchill|first=Ward|date=1999|title=Genocide of native populations in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean Basin|editor=Israel W.

The abolition of the Encomienda in 1542 marks the first major movement towards the abolition of slavery in the Western world.  However, coerced labor continued in other forms throughout the Spanish colonies.

== History ==
The heart of ''encomienda'' and ''encomendero'' lies in the Spanish verb ''encomendar'', \"to entrust\". The ''encomienda'' was based on the ''[[reconquista]]'' institution in which ''[[adelantado]]s'' were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other [[peasant]]s in areas that they had conquered and resettled.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>

The ''encomienda'' system traveled to America as the result of the implantation of Castilian law over the territory. The system was created in the Middle Ages and was pivotal to allow for the repopulation and protection of frontier land during the [[reconquista]]. This system originated in the Catholic South of Spain to extract labor and tribute from Muslims (Moors) before they were exiled in 1492 after the Moors were defeated in the battle in Granada <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>. This system was a method of rewarding soldiers and moneymen who defeated the Moors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77348-5 |pages=388}}</ref>. The encomienda established a relationship similar to a feudal relationship, in which military protection was traded for certain tributes or by specific work. It was especially prevalent among military orders that were entrusted with the protection of frontier areas. The king usually intervened directly or indirectly in the bond, by guaranteeing the fairness of the agreement and intervening militarily in case of abuse.

The ''encomienda'' system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution. The ''encomenderos'' did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the ''encomendero''; native lands were to remain in the possession of their communities. This right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the [[New World]] belonged to this crown and not to the [[Catholic monarchs]] as a whole.<ref>Scott, Meredith, \"[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html The Encomienda System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218180735/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html |date=2005-12-18 }}\".</ref>

==''Encomenderos''==
[[File:Hernán_Cortés_(Meister_von_Saldana).gif|thumb|right|[[Hernán Cortés]], conqueror of the Aztecs and premier encomendero of [[New Spain]]]]
The first grantees of the ''encomienda'' or ''encomenderos'' were usually conquerors who received these grants of labor by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving ''encomiendas'' in [[New Spain]] (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.

In his study of the ''encomenderos'' of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of [[Hernán Cortés]]' original expedition, calling them \"first conquerors\", and those who were members of the later [[Pánfilo de Narváez|Narváez]] expedition, calling them \"conquerors\". The latter were incorporated into Cortes' contingent. Himmerick designated as ''pobladores antiguos'' (old settlers) a group of undetermined number of ''encomenderos'' in New Spain, men who had resided in the Caribbean region prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico.

In the New World, the Crown granted conquistadores as encomendero, which is the right to extract labor and tribute from natives who were under Spanish rule. Christopher Columbus established the encomienda system after his arrival and settlement on the island of Hispaniola requiring them to pay tributes or face brutal punishments. Tributes were required to be paid in gold however during this time gold was scarce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>

Holders of ''encomiendas'' also included women and indigenous elite. Doña Maria Jaramillo, the daughter of [[La Malinche|Doña Marina]] and conqueror Juan Jaramillo, received income from her deceased father's ''encomiendas''.<ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555'', Austin: University of Texas Press, 1991 p. 178</ref> Two of Moctezuma's daughters, Doña [[Isabel Moctezuma]] and her younger sister, Doña Leonor Moctezuma, were granted extensive ''encomiendas'' in perpetuity by Hernan Cortes. Doña Leonor Moctezuma married in succession two Spaniards, and left the ''encomiendas'' to her daughter by her second husband.<ref>Himmerich y Valencia (1991), ''The Encomenderos'', pp. 195-96</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Samora |first=Julian |author2=Patricia Vandel Simon |title=A History of the Mexican-American People |url=http://www.jsri.msu.edu/museum/pubs/MexAmHist/chapter3.html#five |accessdate=2009-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402165741/http://www.jsri.msu.edu/museum/pubs/MexAmHist/chapter3.html |archivedate=April 2, 2009 }}</ref><ref>Himmerich y Valencia (1991), 27</ref> [[Vassal]] Inca rulers appointed after the conquest also sought and were granted ''encomiendas''.

The status of humans as [[Ward (law)|wards]] of the trustees under the ''encomienda'' system served to \"define the status of the Indian population\": the natives were free men, not slaves or serfs.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} But some Spaniards treated them as poorly as slaves.

The ''encomienda'' was essential to the Spanish crown's sustaining its control over North, Central and South America in the first decades after the colonization. It was the first major organizational law instituted on the continent, which was affected by war, widespread disease epidemics caused by Eurasian diseases, and resulting turmoil.<ref>[[Inga Clendinnen|Clendinnen, Inga]]; ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatán, 1517–1570''. (p. 83) {{ISBN|0-521-37981-4}}</ref> Initially, the ''encomienda'' system was devised to meet the needs of the early agricultural economies in the Caribbean. Later it was adopted to the mining economy of [[Peru]] and [[Upper Peru]]. The ''encomienda'' lasted from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the seventeenth century.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite web|url=https://academic.eb.com/levels/collegiate/article/encomienda/32596 |title=Encomienda |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date=26 September 2008}}</ref>

Philip II, enacted a law on 11 June 1594 to establish the ''encomienda'' in the [[Philippines]], where he made grants to the local nobles (''[[principalía]]''). They used the ''encomienda'' to gain ownership of large expanses of land, many of which (such as [[Makati]]) continue to be owned by affluent families.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Dr. Eric A|title=The encomienda in early Philippine colonial history|year=1976|publisher=Journal of Asian Studies|location=Quezon City|pages=27–32|url=http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-14-2-1976/anderson-encomienda-philippine-history.pdf}}</ref>

== Establishment ==
In 1501 [[Isabella of Castile|Queen Isabella]] declared Native Americans as subjects to the crown, and so, as Castilians and legal equals to Spanish Castilians. This implied that enslaving them was illegal except on very specific conditions. It also allowed the establishment of encomiendas, since the encomienda bond was a right reserved to full subjects to the crown.
In 1503, the crown began to formally grant ''encomiendas'' to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of ''encomiendas'' was aided by the crown's organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as ''[[Reductions|reducciones]]'', with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.

Each ''reducción'' had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the laborers in his community. The ''encomienda'' system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers' acquisition of land. As initially defined, the ''encomendero'' and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major crown reform in 1542, known as the [[New Laws]], encomendero families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, Spanish recipients rebelled against the crown, killing the viceroy, Don [[Blasco Núñez Vela]].

In Mexico, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] decided against implementing the reform, citing local circumstances and the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, \"I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order.\"<ref>Arthur S. Aiton, ''Antonio de Mendoza, First Viceroy of New Spain,'' Durham: Duke University Press 1972.</ref> The ''encomienda'' system was ended legally in 1720, when the crown attempted to abolish the institution. The ''encomenderos'' were then required to pay remaining ''encomienda'' laborers for their work.

The ''encomiendas'' became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepción, north of Santo Domingo, the ''[[adelantado]]'' of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=onepage&q=15%2C000&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=121| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Upon hearing this, the Adelantado captured the ''[[cacique]]s'' involved and had most of them hanged.

Later, a chieftain named [[Guarionex]] laid havoc to the countryside before an army of about 3,090 routed the [[Ciguana people]] under his leadership.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=snippet&q=three%20thousand%20islanders&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=143| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders <!-- where are we?

As noted, the change of requiring the ''encomendado'' to be returned to the crown after two generations was frequently overlooked, as the colonists did not want to give up the labor or power. The ''Codice Osuna'', one of many colonial-era [[Aztec codices]] (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in [[Nahuatl]], there is evidence that the indigenous were well aware of the distinction between indigenous communities held by individual encomenderos and those held by the crown.<ref>''Codice Osuna,'' Ediciones del Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, Mexico 1947, pp. 250-254</ref>

Once natives committed themselves to Spanish authority, Columbus, and Spanish overlords, they also were forced to get baptized and attend Catholic Church services. Religion allowed conquistadores to label the native population as barbaric and in need of saving. The encomienda system perpetuated because many conquistadores believed they were being altruistic and were doing God’s work. Religion encouraged the expansion of conquest through the encomienda system throughout the New World.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>  

The phrase \"''sin indios no hay Indias''\" (without Indians, there are no Indies – i.e. America), popular in Spanish America especially in the 16th century, emphasizes the economic importance and appeal of this [[indentured labor]]. It was ranked higher than allocations of precious metals or other natural resources. Land awardees customarily complained about how \"worthless\" territory was without a population of ''encomendados''.

[[Raphael Lemkin]] (coiner of the term [[genocide]]) considers Spain's abuses of the native population of the Americas to constitute cultural and even outright [[genocide]] including the abuses of the Encomienda system. He described slavery as \"cultural genocide par excellence\" noting \"it is the most effective and thorough method of destroying culture, of desocializing human beings.\" He considers colonist guilty due to failing to halt the abuses of the system despite royal orders.

The native people of Mexico experienced a series of outbreaks of disease in the wake of European conquest, including a catastrophic epidemic that began in 1545 which killed an estimated 5 million to 15 million people, or up to 80% of the native population of Mexico, followed by a second epidemic from 1576 to 1578 killing an additional 2 to 2.5 million people, or about 50% of the remaining native population. Recent research suggests that these infections appear to have been aggravated by the extreme climatic conditions of the time and by the poor living conditions and harsh treatment of the native people under the encomienda system of New Spain.<ref>Rodolfo Acuna-Soto, David W.

Peru was a hotspot for native labor due to its large silver reserves.

Since 1960 historians, such as [[Julián Juderías]], [[Woodrow Borah]] and Sheburne Cooke have challenged both the numbers and the causes offered by Raphael Lemkin. Brendan D.

Large epidemics of hemorrhagic fevers in Mexico 1545-1815.</ref>

Regardless of the specific number, it is widely agreed that the peak in mortality started in 1545 and peaked some years later after the New Laws were put in place, the encomienda system was abolished, and women, and more importantly children, were allowed to migrate. What mortality of the native population did occur was mainly attributable to disease. Most scholars agree that the main culprits were European infantile diseases like smallpox, measles, and chicken pox.<ref>Francisco Guerra. Origen de las epidemias en la conquista de América</ref> Elsa Malvido suggests that the plague caused the hemorrhagic fevers described by the Spanish physicians, while a recent, controversial study recently proposed by microbiologist [[Rodolfo Acuna-Soto]] suggests that the diseases that decimated the population were actually a native hemorrhagic plague carried by rats.<ref>RODOLFO ACUNA-SOTO, LETICIA CALDERON ROMERO, AND JAMES H.

The ''encomienda'' system was the subject of controversy in Spain and its territories almost from its start. In 1510, an [[Hispaniola]] ''encomendero'' named Valenzuela murdered a group of Native American leaders who had agreed to meet for peace talks in full confidence. The Taíno Cacique [[Enriquillo]] rebelled against the Spaniards between 1519 and 1533. In 1538, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], realizing the seriousness of the Taíno revolt, changed the laws governing the treatment of people laboring in the encomiendas.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Columbus and Las Casas: the conquest and Christianization of America, 1492–1566 | author=David M.

The crown also actively prosecuted abuses of the ''encomienda'' system, through the Law of Burgos (1512–13) and the [[New Laws|New Law of the Indies (1542)]].

The priest of Hispaniola and former ''encomendero'' [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] underwent a profound conversion after seeing the abuse of the native people.<ref>Bartolomé de Las Casas, who arrived in the New World in 1502, averred that greed was the reason Christians “murdered on such a vast scale,” killing “anyone and everyone who has shown the slightest sign of resistance,” and subjecting “all males to the harshest and most iniquitous and brutal slavery that man has ever devised for oppressing his fellow-men, treating them, in fact, worse than animals.” Reséndez, Andrés. The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America (Kindle Locations 338-341). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.</ref> He dedicated his life to writing and lobbying to abolish the ''encomienda'' system, which he thought systematically enslaved the native people of the New World. Las Casas participated in an [[Valladolid debate|important debate]], where he pushed for the enactment of the New Laws and an end to the ''encomienda'' system.<ref>Benjamin Keen, ''Bartolome de las Casas in history: toward an understanding of the man and his work''. (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University, 1971), 364–365.</ref> The Laws of Burgos and the New Laws of the Indies failed in the face of colonial opposition and, in fact, the New Laws were postponed in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. When [[Blasco Núñez Vela]], the first viceroy of Peru, tried to enforce the New Laws, which provided for the gradual abolition of the ''encomienda'', many of the ''encomenderos'' were unwilling to comply with them and revolted against him.

===The New Laws of 1542===
{{Main|New Laws}}

When the news of this situation and of the abuse of the institution reached Spain, the [[New Laws]] were passed to regulate and gradually abolish the system in America, as well as to reiterate the prohibition of enslaving Native Americans. By the time the new laws were passed, 1543, the Spanish crown had acknowledged their inability to control and properly ensure compliance of traditional laws overseas, so they granted to Native Americans specific protections not even Spaniards had, such as the prohibition of enslaving them even in the case of crime or war. These extra protections were an attempt to avoid the proliferation of irregular claims to slavery.<ref>Suárez Romero. LA SITUACIÓN JURÍDICA DEL INDIO DURANTE LA CONQUISTA ESPAÑOLA EN AMÉRICA. REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE DERECHO DE MÉXICO TOMO LXVIII, Núm.270 (Enero-Abril 2018)</ref> Andrés Reséndez, however, presents a more pessimistic view that such intentions where subsequently corrupted, and shortly after the abolition tens of thousands of people<ref name=otherslaver /> continued to be worked to death in depopulated islands throughout Hispaniola, and he describes indigenous forced labor as \"a set of kaleidoscopic practices suited to different markets and regions. The Spanish crown's formal prohibition of slavery of native people in 1542 gave rise to a number of related institutions, such as encomiendas, repartimientos, the selling of convict labor, and ultimately debt peonage ... In other words, formal slavery was replaced by multiple forms of informal labor coercion and enslavement that were extremely difficult to track, let alone eradicate.\"<ref name=otherslaver />

==Repartimiento==
The ''encomienda'' system was generally replaced by the crown-managed ''[[repartimiento]]'' system throughout Spanish America after mid-sixteenth century.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Like the ''encomienda'', the new ''repartimiento'' did not include the attribution of land to anyone, rather only the allotment of native workers. But they were directly allotted to the crown, who, through a local crown official, would assign them to work for settlers for a set period of time, usually several weeks. The ''repartimiento'' was an attempt \"to reduce the abuses of forced labour\".<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> As the number of [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives declined]] and mining activities were replaced by agricultural activities in the seventeenth century, the [[hacienda]], or large landed estates in which laborers were directly employed by the hacienda owners (''hacendados''), arose because land ownership became more profitable than acquisition of forced labor.<ref>Tindall, George Brown & David E.

[[File:Fayum-34.jpg|thumb|Mummy portrait of a young woman, 3rd century, [[Louvre]], [[Paris]].]]
[[Image:Fayum-35.jpg|thumb|upright|This heavily gilt portrait was found in winter 1905/06 by French Archaeologist Alfred Gayet,and sold to the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin|Berlin, Egyptian Museum.]] in 1907.]]
'''Mummy portraits''' or '''Fayum mummy portraits''' (also '''Faiyum mummy portraits''') are a type of naturalistic painted [[portrait]] on wooden boards attached to [[Upper Class|Upper class]] [[mummy|mummies]] from [[Roman Egypt]]. They belong to the tradition of [[panel painting]], one of the most highly regarded forms of art in the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]]. The Fayum portraits are the only large body of art from that tradition to have survived. They were formerly, and incorrectly, called Coptic portraits.

Mummy portraits have been found across [[Egypt]], but are most common in the [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum Basin]], particularly from [[Hawara]] in the Fayum Basin and the [[Hadrian]]ic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city [[Antinoopolis]]. \"Faiyum Portraits\" is generally used as a stylistic, rather than a geographic, description. While painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases date back to pharaonic times, the Faiyum mummy portraits were an innovation dating to the time of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule in Egypt]].<ref>Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. <cite>Arts of Ancient Egypt</cite>. p.193. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}</ref>

The portraits date to the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman era]], from the late 1st century BC or the early 1st century AD onwards. It is not clear when their production ended, but recent research suggests the middle of the 3rd century. They are among the largest groups among the very few survivors of the [[panel painting]] tradition of the classical world, which was continued into [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and Western traditions in the post-classical world, including the local tradition of [[Coptic art|Coptic iconography]] in Egypt.

The portraits covered the faces of bodies that were mummified for burial. Extant examples indicate that they were mounted into the bands of cloth that were used to wrap the bodies. Almost all have now been detached from the mummies.<ref>Examples still attached are in the [[Egyptian Museum]], [[Cairo]] and the British Museum</ref> They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] [[Ancient Roman art|artistic traditions]] than [[Ancient Egyptian art|Egyptian ones]].<ref>Oakes, Lorna. Gahlin, Lucia. <cite>Ancient Egypt: An Illustrated Reference to the Myths, Religions, Pyramids and Temples of the Land of the Pharaohs</cite>. p.236 Hermes House. 2002. {{ISBN|1-84477-008-7}}</ref>

Two groups of portraits can be distinguished by technique: one of [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) paintings, the other in [[tempera]]. The former are usually of higher quality.

About 900 mummy portraits are known at present.<ref>Corpus of all known specimens: {{cite book|author=Klaus Parlasca|title=Ritratti di mummie|series=Repertorio d'arte dell'Egitto greco-romano Serie B, v. 1-4|location=Rome|publication-date=1969–2003}}<br />– A further specimen discovered since: {{cite book|author=B.

Due to the hot dry Egyptian climate, the paintings are frequently very well preserved, often retaining their brilliant colours seemingly unfaded by time.

== History of research ==

===Pre-19th century===
[[Image:Engraving of finding mummies in Sakkara by Pietro Della Valle.gif|thumb|upright| Mummies' discovery by Pietro Della Valle]]
The Italian explorer [[Pietro della Valle]], on a visit to [[Saqqara]]-[[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in 1615, was the first European to discover and describe mummy portraits. He transported some mummies with portraits to Europe, which are now in the [[Albertinum]] ([[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden]]).<ref name=\"Borg 10\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 10f.</ref>

===19th-century collectors===
Although interest in Ancient Egypt steadily increased after that period, further finds of mummy portraits did not become known before the early 19th century. The provenance of these first new finds is unclear; they may come from [[Saqqara]] as well, or perhaps from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. In 1820, the Baron of Minotuli acquired several mummy portraits for a German collector, but they became part of a whole shipload of Egyptian artifacts lost in the [[North Sea]]. In 1827, Léon de Laborde brought two portraits, supposedly found in Memphis, to Europe, one of which can today be seen at the [[Louvre]], the other in the [[British Museum]]. [[Ippolito Rosellini]], a member of [[Jean-François Champollion]]'s 1828/29 expedition to Egypt, brought a further portrait back to [[Florence]]. It is so similar to de Laborde's specimens that it is thought to be from the same source.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/> During the 1820s, the British [[Consul General]] to Egypt, [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], sent several further portraits to [[Paris]] and [[London]]. Some of them were long considered portraits of the family of the Theban [[Archon]] Pollios Soter, a historical character known from written sources, but this has turned out to be incorrect.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/>

Once again, a long period elapsed before more mummy portraits came to light. In 1887, Daniel Marie Fouquet heard of the discovery of numerous portrait mummies in a cave. He set off to inspect them some days later, but arrived too late, as the finders had used the painted plaques for firewood during the three previous cold desert nights. Fouquet acquired the remaining two of what had originally been fifty portraits. While the exact location of this find is unclear, the likely source is from er-Rubayat.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/> At that location, not long after Fouquet's visit, the Viennese art trader Theodor Graf found several further images, which he tried to sell as profitably as possible. He engaged the famous [[Leipzig]]-based [[Egyptologist]] [[Georg Ebers]] to publish his finds. He produced presentation folders to advertise his individual finds throughout Europe. Although little was known about their archaeological find contexts, Graf went as far as to ascribe the portraits to known [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] pharaohs by analogy with other works of art, mainly coin portraits. None of these associations were particularly well argued or convincing, but they gained him much attention, not least because he gained the support of well-known scholars like [[Rudolf Virchow]]. As a result, mummy portraits became the centre of much attention.<ref name=\"Barbara Borg 1998\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 13f., 34ff.</ref> By the late 19th century, their very specific aesthetic made them sought-after collection pieces, distributed by the global arts trade.

===Archaeological study: Flinders Petrie===
[[Image:Fayum-07.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Detail of a portrait within its mummy wrappings, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1911.]]
In parallel, more scientific engagement with the portraits was beginning. In 1887, the British archaeologist [[Flinders Petrie]] started [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] at [[Hawara]]. He discovered a Roman [[necropolis]] which yielded 81 portrait mummies in the first year of excavation. At an exhibition in London, these portraits drew large crowds. In the following year, Petrie continued excavations at the same location but now suffered from the competition of a German and an Egyptian art dealer. Petrie returned in the winter of 1910/11 and excavated a further 70 portrait mummies, some of them quite badly preserved.{{sfnp|Petrie|1911|p=1}} With very few exceptions, Petrie's studies still provide the only examples of mummy portraits so far found as the result of systematic excavation and published properly. Although the published studies are not entirely up to modern standards, they remain the most important source for the find contexts of portrait mummies.

===Late-19th- and early-20th-century collectors===
In 1892, the German archaeologist von Kaufmann discovered the so-called \"[[Tomb of Aline]]\", which held three mummy portraits; among the most famous today. Other important sources of such finds are at [[Antinopolis|Antinoöpolis]] and [[Akhmim]]. The French archaeologist Albert Gayet worked at Antinoöpolis and found much relevant material, but his work, like that of many of his contemporaries, does not satisfy modern standards. His documentation is incomplete, many of his finds remain without context.

===Museums===
Today, mummy portraits are represented in all important archaeological museums of the world. Many have fine examples on display, notably the [[British Museum]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Louvre]] in Paris.<ref name=\"Hoesch\">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienporträts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=464}}</ref> Because they were mostly recovered through inappropriate and unprofessional means, virtually all are without archaeological context, a fact which consistently lowers the quality of archaeological and culture-historical information they provide. As a result, their overall significance as well as their specific interpretations remain controversial.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/>

== Materials and techniques ==
A majority of images show a formal portrait of a single figure, facing and looking toward the viewer, from an angle that is usually slightly turned from full face. The figures are presented as busts against a monochrome background which in some instances are decorated. The individuals are both male and female and range in age from childhood to old age.

</gallery>
The majority of preserved mummy portraits were painted on boards or panels, made from different imported hardwoods, including [[oak]], [[Lime tree|lime]], [[sycamore]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[cypress]], [[ficus|fig]], and [[citrus]].<ref>Wrede, LÄ IV, 218</ref> The wood was cut into thin rectangular panels and made smooth. The finished panels were set into layers of wrapping that enclosed the body and were surrounded by bands of cloth, giving the effect of a window-like opening through which the face of the deceased could be seen. Portraits were sometimes painted directly onto the canvas or rags of the mummy wrapping ([[cartonnage]] painting).

===Painting techniques===

The wooden surface was sometimes primed for painting with a layer of plaster. In some cases the primed layer reveals a preparatory drawing.
Two painting techniques were employed: [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) painting and animal glue [[tempera]].  The encaustic images are striking because of the  contrast between vivid and rich colours, and comparatively large brush-strokes, producing an \"[[Impressionistic]]\" effect. The tempera paintings have a finer gradation of tones and chalkier colours, giving a more restrained appearance.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> In some cases, [[gold leaf]] was used to depict jewellery and wreaths. There also are examples of hybrid techniques or of variations from the main techniques.

The Fayum portraits reveal a wide range of painterly expertise and skill in presenting a lifelike appearance. The naturalism of the portraits is often revealed in knowledge of anatomic structure and in skilled modelling of the form by the use of light and shade, which gives an appearance of three-dimensionality to most of the figures. The graded flesh tones are enhanced with shadows and highlights indicative of directional lighting.

===People of Fayum===
Under Greco-Roman rule, Egypt hosted several [[Greeks|Greek]] settlements, mostly concentrated in [[Alexandria]], but also in a few other cities, where Greek settlers lived alongside some seven to ten million native [[Egyptians]].<ref name=\"Adams p. 39\">{{cite book|last=Adams |first=Winthrope L. |editor-last=Bugh |editor-first=Glenn Richard |chapter=The Hellenistic Kingdoms |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Hellenistic World |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2006 |p=39}}</ref> Faiyum's earliest Greek inhabitants were soldier-veterans and ''cleruchs'' (elite military officials) who were settled by the Ptolemaic kings on reclaimed lands.<ref name=\"Adams p. 39\"/><ref>Stanwick, Paul Edmund.

Austin: University of Texas Press. 2003, p. 23</ref> Native Egyptians also came to settle in Faiyum from all over the country, notably the [[Nile Delta]], [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Upper Egypt]], [[Oxyrhynchus]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], to undertake the labor involved in the land reclamation process, as attested by personal names, local cults and recovered [[papyrus|papyri]].<ref name=\"Bagnall p. 27\">{{cite book|last=Bagnall|first=R.S.|editor=Susan Walker|title=Ancient Faces: Mummy Portraits in Roman Egypt|series=Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|date=2000|p=27|ref=harv}}</ref> It is estimated that as much as 30 percent of the population of Faiyum was Greek during the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] period, with the rest being native Egyptians.<ref name=\"Bagnall p. 27\"/> By the Roman period, much of the \"Greek\" population of Faiyum was made-up of either Hellenized Egyptians or people of mixed Egyptian-Greek origins.{{sfnp|Bagnall|2000|pp=28–29}} Later, in the Roman Period, many veterans of the Roman army, who, initially at least, were not Egyptian but people from disparate cultural backgrounds, settled in the area after the completion of their service, and formed social relations and intermarried with local populations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alston|first1=R.|title=Soldier and Society in Roman Egypt: A Social History|date=1995|location=New York}}</ref>

===Age profile of those depicted===
Most of the portraits depict the deceased at a relatively young age, and many show children. According to Walker, [[Computed tomography|C.A.T.]] scans  reveal a correspondence of age and sex between mummy and image. He concludes that the age distribution reflects the low life expectancy at the time. It was often believed that the wax portraits were completed during the life of the individual and displayed in their home, a custom that belonged to the traditions of [[Greek art]],<ref>''Encyclopedia Of Ancient Greece'', Nigel Guy, Routledge Taylor and Francis group, p. 601</ref> but this view is no longer widely held given the evidence suggested by the C.A.T. scans of the Faiyum mummies, as well as Roman census returns. In addition, some portraits were painted directly onto the coffin; for example, on a shroud or another part.

===Social status===
The patrons of the portraits apparently belonged to the affluent upper class of military personnel, civil servants and religious dignitaries. Not everyone could afford a mummy portrait; many mummies were found without one. Flinders Petrie states that only one or two per cent of the mummies he excavated were embellished with portraits.<ref name=\"Borg 58\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 58</ref> The rates for mummy portraits do not survive, but it can be assumed that the material caused higher costs than the labour, since in antiquity, painters were appreciated as craftsmen rather than as artists.<ref name=\"Borg 58\"/> The situation from the \"[[Tomb of Aline]]\" is interesting in this regard. It contained four mummies: those of Aline, of two children and of her husband. Unlike his wife and children, the latter was not equipped with a portrait but with a gilt three-dimensional mask. Perhaps plaster masks were preferred if they could be afforded.

[[Image:FuneraryMasksRomanEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Three-dimensional funerary masks of painted plaster from Faiyum (1st century), [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]].]]

Based on literary, archaeological and genetic studies, it appears that those depicted were native Egyptians, who had adopted the dominant Greco-Roman culture.<ref name=Verena>{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999}}</ref> The name of some of those portrayed are known from inscriptions; they are predominantly Greek. Hairstyles and clothing are always influenced by Roman fashion. Women and children are often depicted wearing valuable ornaments and fine garments, men often wearing specific and elaborate outfits. Greek inscriptions of names are relatively common, sometimes they include professions. It is not known whether such inscriptions always reflect reality, or whether they may state ideal conditions or aspirations rather than true conditions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienporträts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=465}}</ref> One single inscription is known to definitely indicate the deceased's profession (a shipowner) correctly. The mummy of a woman named Hermione also included the term ''grammatike'' (γραμματική). For a long time, it was assumed that this indicated that she was a teacher by profession (for this reason, Flinders Petrie donated the portrait to [[Girton College]], [[Cambridge]], the first residential college for women in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]), but today, it is assumed that the term indicates her level of education. Some portraits of men show sword-belts or even pommels, suggesting that they were members of the Roman military.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 53–55</ref>

== Culture-historical context ==

===Changes in burial habits===
[[File:Gold-glass portrait of a woman (Turin).jpg|thumb|[[Gold glass]] [[miniature portrait]] of a woman, probably 3rd century. One of a small group of such portraits, some probably made in [[Alexandria]]]]
The burial habits of [[Ptolemaic Dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Egyptians mostly followed ancient traditions. The bodies of members of the upper classes were [[mummy|mummified]], equipped with a decorated coffin and a mummy mask to cover the head. The [[Greeks]] who entered Egypt at that time mostly followed their own habits. There is evidence from [[Alexandria]] and other sites indicating that they practised the Greek tradition of [[cremation]]. This broadly reflects the general situation in [[Hellenistic]] Egypt, its rulers proclaiming themselves to be [[pharaoh]]s but otherwise living in an entirely Hellenistic world, incorporating only very few local elements. Conversely, the Egyptians only slowly developed an interest in the Greek-Hellenic culture that dominated the [[East Mediterranean]] since the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. This situation changed substantially with the arrival of the Romans. Within a few generations, all Egyptian elements disappeared from everyday life. Cities like [[Karanis]] or [[Oxyrhynchus]] are largely Graeco-Roman places. There is clear evidence that this resulted from a mixing of different ethnicities in the ruling classes of Roman Egypt.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 40–56</ref>{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=17–20}}

===Religious continuity===
Only in the sphere of religion is there evidence for a continuation of Egyptian traditions. Egyptian temples were erected as late as the 2nd century. In terms of burial habits, Egyptian and Hellenistic elements now mixed. Coffins became increasingly unpopular and went entirely out of use by the 2nd century. In contrast, mummification appears to have been practised by large parts of the population. The mummy mask, originally an Egyptian concept, grew more and more Graeco-Roman in style, Egyptian motifs became ever rarer. The adoption of Roman portrait painting into Egyptian burial cult belongs into this general context.<ref>summarised in: Judith A. Corbelli: ''The Art of Death in Graeco-Roman Egypt'', Princes Risborough 2006 {{ISBN|0-7478-0647-0}}</ref>

===Link with Roman funeral masks?===
Some authors suggest that the idea of such portraits may be related to the custom among the [[nobiles|Roman nobility]] of displaying ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|imagines]]'', images of their ancestors, in the [[domus|atrium of their house]]. In funeral processions, these wax masks were worn by professional mourners to emphasize the continuity of an illustrious family line, but originally perhaps to represent a deeper evocation of the presence of the dead. [[Roman festivals]] such as the [[Parentalia]] as well as [[Religion in ancient Rome#Domestic and private cult|everyday domestic rituals]] cultivated ancestral spirits (see also [[veneration of the dead]]). The development of mummy portraiture may represent a combination of Egyptian and [[Roman funerals and burial|Roman funerary tradition]], since it appears only after Egypt was established as a [[Roman province]].<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 78</ref>

===\"Salon paintings\"?===
The images depict the heads or busts of men, women and children. They probably date from c. 30 BC to the 3rd century.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienporträts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=464}} Other scholars, e.g. Barbara Borg, suggest that they start under [[Tiberius]].</ref> To the modern eye, the portraits appear highly individualistic. Therefore, it has been assumed for a long time that they were produced during the lifetime of their subjects and displayed as \"salon paintings\" within their houses, to be added to their mummy wrapping after their death. Newer research rather suggests that they were only painted after death,<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> an idea perhaps contradicted by the multiple paintings on some specimens and the (suggested) change of specific details on others. The individualism of those depicted was actually created by variations in some specific details, within a largely unvaried general scheme.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> The habit of depicting the deceased was not a new one, but the painted images gradually replaced the earlier Egyptian masks, although the latter continued in use for some time, often occurring directly adjacent to portrait mummies, sometimes even in the same graves.

===Realism and convention===

Together with the painted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan tombs]], the [[Lucanians|Lucanian]] tombs and the [[Tomb of the Diver]] in [[Paestum]], the frescoes from [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and the [[Greek vase]]s, they are the best preserved paintings from ancient times and are renowned for their remarkable [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]]. It is, however, debatable whether the portraits depict the subjects as they really were. Analyses have shown that the painters depicted faces according to conventions in a repetitive and formulaic way, albeit with a variety of hairstyles and beards. They appear to have worked from a number of standard types without making detailed observations of the unique facial proportions of specific individuals which give each face its own personality.

===Style===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}

The combination of naturalistic Greek portrait of the deceased with Egyptian-form deities, symbols, and frame was primarily phenomenon of funerary art from the chora, or countryside, in Roman Egypt. Combining Egyptian and Greek pictorial forms or motifs was not restricted to funerary art, however: the public and highly visible portraits of Ptolemaic dynasts and Roman emperors grafted iconography developed for a ruler’s Greek or Roman images onto Egyptian statues in the dress and posture of Egyptian kings and queens. The possible combinations of Greek and Egyptian elements can be elucidated by imposing a (somewhat artificial) distinction between form and content, where ‘form’ is taken as the system of representation, and ‘content’ as the symbol, concept, or figure being portrayed.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Christina Riggs |title=The Beautiful Burial in Roman Egypt: Art, Identity, and Funerary Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2005 |p=11 |ISBN=9780191534874}}</ref>

==Coexistence with other burial habits==
The religious meaning of mummy portraits has not, so far, been fully explained, nor have associated grave rites. There is some indication that it developed from genuine Egyptian funerary rites, adapted by a multi-cultural ruling class.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> The tradition of mummy portraits occurred from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] to [[Nubia]], but it is striking that other funerary habits prevailed over portrait mummies at all sites except those in the Faiyum (and there especially Hawara and Achmim) and Antinoopolis. In most sites, different forms of burial coexisted. The choice of grave type may have been determined to a large extent by the financial means and status of the deceased, modified by local customs. Portrait mummies have been found both in rock-cut tombs and in freestanding built grave complexes, but also in shallow pits. It is striking that they are virtually never accompanied by any grave offerings, with the exception of occasional pots or sprays of flowers.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 31</ref>

==End of the mummy portrait tradition==

For a long time, it was assumed that the latest portraits belong to the end of the 4th century, but recent research has modified this view considerably, suggesting that the last wooden portraits belong to the middle, the last directly painted mummy wrappings to the second half of the 3rd century. It is commonly accepted that production reduced considerably since the beginning of the 3rd century. Several reasons for the decline of the mummy portrait have been suggested; no single reason should probably be isolated, rather, they should be seen as operating together.

*In the 3rd century the Roman Empire underwent a severe economic crisis, severely limiting the financial abilities of the upper classes. Although they continued to lavishly spend money on representation, they favoured public appearances, like games and festivals, over the production of portraits. However, other elements of sepulchral representation, like [[sarcophagi]], did continue.
*There is evidence of a religious crisis at the same time. This may not be as closely connected with the rise of Christianity as previously assumed. (The earlier suggestion of a 4th-century end to the portraits would coincide with the widespread distribution of Christianity in Egypt. Christianity also never banned mummification.) An increasing neglect of Egyptian temples is noticeable during the Roman imperial period, leading to a general drop in interest in all ancient religions.
*The [[Constitutio Antoniniana]], i.e. the granting of Roman citizenship to all free subjects changed the social structures of Egypt. For the first time, the individual cities gained a degree of self-administration. At the same time, the provincial upper classes changed in terms of both composition and inter-relations.
Thus, a combination of several factors appears to have led to changes of fashion and ritual. No clear causality can be asserted.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 88–101</ref>

Considering the limited nature of the current understanding of portrait mummies, it remains distinctly possible that future research will considerably modify the image presented here. For example, some scholars suspect that the centre of production of such finds, and thus the centre of the distinctive funerary tradition they represent, may have been located at Alexandria. New finds from [[Marina el-Alamein]] strongly support such a  view.<ref name=\"Barbara Borg 1998\"/> In view of the near-total loss of Greek and Roman paintings, mummy portraits are today considered to be among the very rare examples of ancient art that can be seen to reflect \"Great paintings\" and especially Roman portrait painting.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/>

==Mummy portraits as sources on provincial Roman fashion==

===Provincial fashions===
Mummy portraits depict a variety of different hairstyles. They are one of the main aids in dating the paintings. The majority of the deceased were depicted with hairstyles then in fashion. They are frequently similar to those depicted in [[sculpture]]. As part of Roman propaganda, such sculptures, especially those depicting the imperial family, were often displayed throughout the empire. Thus, they had a direct influence on the development of fashion. Nevertheless, the mummy portraits, as well as other finds, suggest that fashions lasted longer in the provinces than in the imperial court, or at least that diverse styles might coexist.

===Hairstyles===
<gallery heights=200px widths=140px>

</gallery>
Since Roman men tended to wear short-cropped hair, female hairstyles are a better source of evidence for changes in fashion. The female portraits suggest a coarse chronological scheme: Simple hairstyles with a central parting in the [[Tiberius|Tiberian]] period are followed by more complex ringlet hairstyles, nested plaits and [[toupee|curly toupées]] over the forehead in the late 1st century. Small oval nested plaits dominate the time of the [[Antonines]], simple central-parting hairstyles with a hairknot in the neck occur in the second half of the 2nd century. The time of [[Septimius Severus]] was characterised by [[toupée]]-like fluffy as well as strict, straight styles, followed by looped plaits on the crown of the head. The latter belong to the very final phase of mummy portraits, and have only been noted on a few mummy wrappings. It seems to be the case that curly hairstyles were especially popular in Egypt.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 45–49</ref>

===Clothing===
Like the hairstyles, the clothing depicted also follows the general fashions of the Roman Empire, as known from statues and busts. Both men and women tend to wear a thin [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] as an undergarment. Above it, both sexes tend to wear a cloak, laid across the shoulders or wound around the torso. The males wear virtually exclusively white, while female clothing is often red or pink, but can also be yellow, white, blue or purple. The chiton often bears a decorative line (''[[laticlave|clavus]]''), occasionally light red or light green, also sometimes gold, but normally in dark colours. Some painted mummy wrappings from Antinoopolis depict garments with long sleeves and very wide ''clavi''. So far, not a single portrait has been definitely shown to depict the [[toga]], a key symbol of Roman citizenship. It should, however, be kept in mind that Greek cloaks and togas are draped very similarly on depictions of the 1st and early 2nd centuries. In the late 2nd and 3rd centuries, togas should be distinguishable, but fail to occur.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 49–51</ref>

===Jewelry===
Apart from the gold [[wreath]]s worn by many men, with very few exceptions, only women are depicted with jewellery. This generally accords with the common jewellery types of the Graeco-Roman East. Especially the Antinoopolis portraits depict simple gold link chains and massive gold rings. There are also depictions of [[precious stone|precious]] or [[semi-precious stones]] like [[emerald]], [[carnelian]], [[garnet]], [[agate]] or [[amethyst]], rarely also of [[pearl]]s. The stones were normally ground into cylindrical or spherical beads. Some portraits depict elaborate [[collier (necklace)|colliers]], with precious stones set in gold.

The gold wreath was apparently rarely, if ever, worn in life, but a number have been found in graves from much earlier periods. Based on the plant wreaths given as prizes in contests, the idea was apparently to celebrate the achievements of the deceased in life.

There are three basic shapes of ear ornaments: Especially common in the 1st century are circular or drop-shaped pendants. Archaeological finds indicate that these were fully or semi-spherical. Later tastes favoured S-shaped hooks of gold wire, on which up to five beads of different colours and materials could be strung. The third shape are elaborate pendants with a horizontal bar from which two or three, occasionally four, vertical rods are suspended, usually each decorated with a white bead or pearl at the bottom. Other common ornaments include gold hairpins, often decorated with pearls, fine [[diadem (personal wear)|diadems]], and, especially at Antinoopolis, gold [[hairnet]]s. Many portraits also depict [[amulet]]s and [[pendant]]s, perhaps with magical functions.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''„Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ....“ Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 51–52</ref>

== Art-historical significance ==
[[Image:Septimusseverustondo.jpg|thumb|Tondo with images of Septimius Severus and his family. [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].]]
The mummy portraits have immense art-historical importance. Ancient sources indicate that [[panel painting]] (rather than [[wall painting]]), i.e. painting on wood or other mobile surfaces was held in high regard. But very few ancient panel paintings
survive. One of the few examples besides the mummy portraits is the [[Severan Tondo]], also from Egypt (around 200), which, like the mummy portraits, is believed to represent a provincial version of contemporary style.{{refn|1=Other examples: a framed portrait from Hawara,{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=121–122, Nr. 117}} the image of a man flanked by two deities from the same site,{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=123–124, Nr. 119}} or the 6th century BC panels from Pitsa in Greece.<ref>[https://www.sikyon.com/sicyon/Painting/spainting_eg.html]</ref>}}
Some aspects of the mummy portraits, especially their frontal perspective and their concentration on key facial features, strongly resemble later [[icon painting]]. A direct link has been suggested, but it should be kept in mind that the mummy portraits represent only a small part of a much wider Graeco-Roman tradition, the whole of which later bore an influence on [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] and [[Byzantine Art]]. A pair of panel \"icons\" of [[Serapis]] and [[Isis]] of comparable date (3rd century) and style are in the [[Getty Museum]] at [[Malibu, California|Malibu]];<ref>[https://www.aisthesis.de/wbock/bilder/4-9si.gif image]</ref> as with the cult of [[Mithras]], earlier examples of cult images were sculptures or pottery figurines, but from the 3rd century reliefs and then painted images are found.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Kurt Weitzmann]] |title=The Icon |date=1982 |publisher=Evans Brothers Ltd |location=London |p=3 |others=(trans of Le Icone, Montadori 1981) |ISBN=0-237-45645-1}}</ref>

'''Mummy portraits''' or '''Fayum mummy portraits''' (also '''Faiyum mummy portraits''') are a type of naturalistic painted [[portrait]] on wooden boards attached to [[Upper Class|Upper class]] [[mummy|mummies]] from [[Roman Egypt]]. They belong to the tradition of [[panel painting]], one of the most highly regarded forms of art in the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]]. The Fayum portraits are the only large body of art from that tradition to have survived. They were formerly, and incorrectly, called Coptic portraits.

Mummy portraits have been found across [[Egypt]], but are most common in the [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum Basin]], particularly from [[Hawara]] in the Fayum Basin and the [[Hadrian]]ic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city [[Antinoopolis]]. \"Faiyum Portraits\" is generally used as a stylistic, rather than a geographic, description. While painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases date back to pharaonic times, the Faiyum mummy portraits were an innovation dating to the time of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule in Egypt]].<ref>Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. <cite>Arts of Ancient Egypt</cite>. p.193. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}</ref>

The portraits date to the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman era]], from the late 1st century BC or the early 1st century AD onwards. It is not clear when their production ended, but recent research suggests the middle of the 3rd century. They are among the largest groups among the very few survivors of the [[panel painting]] tradition of the classical world, which was continued into [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and Western traditions in the post-classical world, including the local tradition of [[Coptic art|Coptic iconography]] in Egypt.

The portraits covered the faces of bodies that were mummified for burial. Extant examples indicate that they were mounted into the bands of cloth that were used to wrap the bodies. Almost all have now been detached from the mummies.<ref>Examples still attached are in the [[Egyptian Museum]], [[Cairo]] and the British Museum</ref> They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] [[Ancient Roman art|artistic traditions]] than [[Ancient Egyptian art|Egyptian ones]].<ref>Oakes, Lorna. Gahlin, Lucia. <cite>Ancient Egypt: An Illustrated Reference to the Myths, Religions, Pyramids and Temples of the Land of the Pharaohs</cite>. p.236 Hermes House. 2002. {{ISBN|1-84477-008-7}}</ref>

Two groups of portraits can be distinguished by technique: one of [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) paintings, the other in [[tempera]]. The former are usually of higher quality.

About 900 mummy portraits are known at present.<ref>Corpus of all known specimens: {{cite book|author=Klaus Parlasca|title=Ritratti di mummie|series=Repertorio d'arte dell'Egitto greco-romano Serie B, v. 1-4|location=Rome|publication-date=1969–2003}}<br />– A further specimen discovered since: {{cite book|author=B.

Due to the hot dry Egyptian climate, the paintings are frequently very well preserved, often retaining their brilliant colours seemingly unfaded by time.

== History of research ==

===Pre-19th century===
[[Image:Engraving of finding mummies in Sakkara by Pietro Della Valle.gif|thumb|upright| Mummies' discovery by Pietro Della Valle]]
The Italian explorer [[Pietro della Valle]], on a visit to [[Saqqara]]-[[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in 1615, was the first European to discover and describe mummy portraits. He transported some mummies with portraits to Europe, which are now in the [[Albertinum]] ([[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden]]).<ref name=\"Borg 10\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 10f.</ref>

===19th-century collectors===
Although interest in Ancient Egypt steadily increased after that period, further finds of mummy portraits did not become known before the early 19th century. The provenance of these first new finds is unclear; they may come from [[Saqqara]] as well, or perhaps from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. In 1820, the Baron of Minotuli acquired several mummy portraits for a German collector, but they became part of a whole shipload of Egyptian artifacts lost in the [[North Sea]]. In 1827, Léon de Laborde brought two portraits, supposedly found in Memphis, to Europe, one of which can today be seen at the [[Louvre]], the other in the [[British Museum]]. [[Ippolito Rosellini]], a member of [[Jean-François Champollion]]'s 1828/29 expedition to Egypt, brought a further portrait back to [[Florence]]. It is so similar to de Laborde's specimens that it is thought to be from the same source.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/> During the 1820s, the British [[Consul General]] to Egypt, [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], sent several further portraits to [[Paris]] and [[London]]. Some of them were long considered portraits of the family of the Theban [[Archon]] Pollios Soter, a historical character known from written sources, but this has turned out to be incorrect.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/>

Once again, a long period elapsed before more mummy portraits came to light. In 1887, Daniel Marie Fouquet heard of the discovery of numerous portrait mummies in a cave. He set off to inspect them some days later, but arrived too late, as the finders had used the painted plaques for firewood during the three previous cold desert nights. Fouquet acquired the remaining two of what had originally been fifty portraits. While the exact location of this find is unclear, the likely source is from er-Rubayat.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/> At that location, not long after Fouquet's visit, the Viennese art trader Theodor Graf found several further images, which he tried to sell as profitably as possible. He engaged the famous [[Leipzig]]-based [[Egyptologist]] [[Georg Ebers]] to publish his finds. He produced presentation folders to advertise his individual finds throughout Europe. Although little was known about their archaeological find contexts, Graf went as far as to ascribe the portraits to known [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] pharaohs by analogy with other works of art, mainly coin portraits. None of these associations were particularly well argued or convincing, but they gained him much attention, not least because he gained the support of well-known scholars like [[Rudolf Virchow]]. As a result, mummy portraits became the centre of much attention.<ref name=\"Barbara Borg 1998\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 13f., 34ff.</ref> By the late 19th century, their very specific aesthetic made them sought-after collection pieces, distributed by the global arts trade.

===Archaeological study: Flinders Petrie===
[[Image:Fayum-07.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Detail of a portrait within its mummy wrappings, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1911.]]
In parallel, more scientific engagement with the portraits was beginning. In 1887, the British archaeologist [[Flinders Petrie]] started [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] at [[Hawara]]. He discovered a Roman [[necropolis]] which yielded 81 portrait mummies in the first year of excavation. At an exhibition in London, these portraits drew large crowds. In the following year, Petrie continued excavations at the same location but now suffered from the competition of a German and an Egyptian art dealer. Petrie returned in the winter of 1910/11 and excavated a further 70 portrait mummies, some of them quite badly preserved.{{sfnp|Petrie|1911|p=1}} With very few exceptions, Petrie's studies still provide the only examples of mummy portraits so far found as the result of systematic excavation and published properly. Although the published studies are not entirely up to modern standards, they remain the most important source for the find contexts of portrait mummies.

===Late-19th- and early-20th-century collectors===
In 1892, the German archaeologist von Kaufmann discovered the so-called \"[[Tomb of Aline]]\", which held three mummy portraits; among the most famous today. Other important sources of such finds are at [[Antinopolis|Antinoöpolis]] and [[Akhmim]]. The French archaeologist Albert Gayet worked at Antinoöpolis and found much relevant material, but his work, like that of many of his contemporaries, does not satisfy modern standards. His documentation is incomplete, many of his finds remain without context.

===Museums===
Today, mummy portraits are represented in all important archaeological museums of the world. Many have fine examples on display, notably the [[British Museum]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Louvre]] in Paris.<ref name=\"Hoesch\">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienporträts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=464}}</ref> Because they were mostly recovered through inappropriate and unprofessional means, virtually all are without archaeological context, a fact which consistently lowers the quality of archaeological and culture-historical information they provide. As a result, their overall significance as well as their specific interpretations remain controversial.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/>

== Materials and techniques ==
A majority of images show a formal portrait of a single figure, facing and looking toward the viewer, from an angle that is usually slightly turned from full face. The figures are presented as busts against a monochrome background which in some instances are decorated. The individuals are both male and female and range in age from childhood to old age.

The majority of preserved mummy portraits were painted on boards or panels, made from different imported hardwoods, including [[oak]], [[Lime tree|lime]], [[sycamore]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[cypress]], [[ficus|fig]], and [[citrus]].<ref>Wrede, LÄ IV, 218</ref> The wood was cut into thin rectangular panels and made smooth. The finished panels were set into layers of wrapping that enclosed the body and were surrounded by bands of cloth, giving the effect of a window-like opening through which the face of the deceased could be seen. Portraits were sometimes painted directly onto the canvas or rags of the mummy wrapping ([[cartonnage]] painting).

===Painting techniques===

The wooden surface was sometimes primed for painting with a layer of plaster. In some cases the primed layer reveals a preparatory drawing.
Two painting techniques were employed: [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) painting and animal glue [[tempera]].  The encaustic images are striking because of the  contrast between vivid and rich colours, and comparatively large brush-strokes, producing an \"[[Impressionistic]]\" effect. The tempera paintings have a finer gradation of tones and chalkier colours, giving a more restrained appearance.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> In some cases, [[gold leaf]] was used to depict jewellery and wreaths. There also are examples of hybrid techniques or of variations from the main techniques.

The Fayum portraits reveal a wide range of painterly expertise and skill in presenting a lifelike appearance. The naturalism of the portraits is often revealed in knowledge of anatomic structure and in skilled modelling of the form by the use of light and shade, which gives an appearance of three-dimensionality to most of the figures. The graded flesh tones are enhanced with shadows and highlights indicative of directional lighting.

===People of Fayum===
Under Greco-Roman rule, Egypt hosted several [[Greeks|Greek]] settlements, mostly concentrated in [[Alexandria]], but also in a few other cities, where Greek settlers lived alongside some seven to ten million native [[Egyptians]].<ref name=\"Adams p. 39\">{{cite book|last=Adams |first=Winthrope L. |editor-last=Bugh |editor-first=Glenn Richard |chapter=The Hellenistic Kingdoms |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Hellenistic World |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2006 |p=39}}</ref> Faiyum's earliest Greek inhabitants were soldier-veterans and ''cleruchs'' (elite military officials) who were settled by the Ptolemaic kings on reclaimed lands.<ref name=\"Adams p. 39\"/><ref>Stanwick, Paul Edmund.

===Age profile of those depicted===
Most of the portraits depict the deceased at a relatively young age, and many show children. According to Walker, [[Computed tomography|C.A.T.]] scans  reveal a correspondence of age and sex between mummy and image. He concludes that the age distribution reflects the low life expectancy at the time. It was often believed that the wax portraits were completed during the life of the individual and displayed in their home, a custom that belonged to the traditions of [[Greek art]],<ref>''Encyclopedia Of Ancient Greece'', Nigel Guy, Routledge Taylor and Francis group, p. 601</ref> but this view is no longer widely held given the evidence suggested by the C.A.T. scans of the Faiyum mummies, as well as Roman census returns. In addition, some portraits were painted directly onto the coffin; for example, on a shroud or another part.

===Social status===
The patrons of the portraits apparently belonged to the affluent upper class of military personnel, civil servants and religious dignitaries. Not everyone could afford a mummy portrait; many mummies were found without one. Flinders Petrie states that only one or two per cent of the mummies he excavated were embellished with portraits.<ref name=\"Borg 58\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 58</ref> The rates for mummy portraits do not survive, but it can be assumed that the material caused higher costs than the labour, since in antiquity, painters were appreciated as craftsmen rather than as artists.<ref name=\"Borg 58\"/> The situation from the \"[[Tomb of Aline]]\" is interesting in this regard. It contained four mummies: those of Aline, of two children and of her husband. Unlike his wife and children, the latter was not equipped with a portrait but with a gilt three-dimensional mask. Perhaps plaster masks were preferred if they could be afforded.

Based on literary, archaeological and genetic studies, it appears that those depicted were native Egyptians, who had adopted the dominant Greco-Roman culture.<ref name=Verena>{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999}}</ref> The name of some of those portrayed are known from inscriptions; they are predominantly Greek. Hairstyles and clothing are always influenced by Roman fashion. Women and children are often depicted wearing valuable ornaments and fine garments, men often wearing specific and elaborate outfits. Greek inscriptions of names are relatively common, sometimes they include professions. It is not known whether such inscriptions always reflect reality, or whether they may state ideal conditions or aspirations rather than true conditions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienporträts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=465}}</ref> One single inscription is known to definitely indicate the deceased's profession (a shipowner) correctly. The mummy of a woman named Hermione also included the term ''grammatike'' (γραμματική). For a long time, it was assumed that this indicated that she was a teacher by profession (for this reason, Flinders Petrie donated the portrait to [[Girton College]], [[Cambridge]], the first residential college for women in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]), but today, it is assumed that the term indicates her level of education. Some portraits of men show sword-belts or even pommels, suggesting that they were members of the Roman military.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 53–55</ref>

== Culture-historical context ==

===Changes in burial habits===
[[File:Gold-glass portrait of a woman (Turin).jpg|thumb|[[Gold glass]] [[miniature portrait]] of a woman, probably 3rd century. One of a small group of such portraits, some probably made in [[Alexandria]]]]
The burial habits of [[Ptolemaic Dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Egyptians mostly followed ancient traditions. The bodies of members of the upper classes were [[mummy|mummified]], equipped with a decorated coffin and a mummy mask to cover the head. The [[Greeks]] who entered Egypt at that time mostly followed their own habits. There is evidence from [[Alexandria]] and other sites indicating that they practised the Greek tradition of [[cremation]]. This broadly reflects the general situation in [[Hellenistic]] Egypt, its rulers proclaiming themselves to be [[pharaoh]]s but otherwise living in an entirely Hellenistic world, incorporating only very few local elements. Conversely, the Egyptians only slowly developed an interest in the Greek-Hellenic culture that dominated the [[East Mediterranean]] since the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. This situation changed substantially with the arrival of the Romans. Within a few generations, all Egyptian elements disappeared from everyday life. Cities like [[Karanis]] or [[Oxyrhynchus]] are largely Graeco-Roman places. There is clear evidence that this resulted from a mixing of different ethnicities in the ruling classes of Roman Egypt.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 40–56</ref>{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=17–20}}

===Religious continuity===
Only in the sphere of religion is there evidence for a continuation of Egyptian traditions. Egyptian temples were erected as late as the 2nd century. In terms of burial habits, Egyptian and Hellenistic elements now mixed. Coffins became increasingly unpopular and went entirely out of use by the 2nd century. In contrast, mummification appears to have been practised by large parts of the population. The mummy mask, originally an Egyptian concept, grew more and more Graeco-Roman in style, Egyptian motifs became ever rarer. The adoption of Roman portrait painting into Egyptian burial cult belongs into this general context.<ref>summarised in: Judith A. Corbelli: ''The Art of Death in Graeco-Roman Egypt'', Princes Risborough 2006 {{ISBN|0-7478-0647-0}}</ref>

===Link with Roman funeral masks?===
Some authors suggest that the idea of such portraits may be related to the custom among the [[nobiles|Roman nobility]] of displaying ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|imagines]]'', images of their ancestors, in the [[domus|atrium of their house]]. In funeral processions, these wax masks were worn by professional mourners to emphasize the continuity of an illustrious family line, but originally perhaps to represent a deeper evocation of the presence of the dead. [[Roman festivals]] such as the [[Parentalia]] as well as [[Religion in ancient Rome#Domestic and private cult|everyday domestic rituals]] cultivated ancestral spirits (see also [[veneration of the dead]]). The development of mummy portraiture may represent a combination of Egyptian and [[Roman funerals and burial|Roman funerary tradition]], since it appears only after Egypt was established as a [[Roman province]].<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 78</ref>

===\"Salon paintings\"?===
The images depict the heads or busts of men, women and children. They probably date from c. 30 BC to the 3rd century.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienporträts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=464}} Other scholars, e.g. Barbara Borg, suggest that they start under [[Tiberius]].</ref> To the modern eye, the portraits appear highly individualistic. Therefore, it has been assumed for a long time that they were produced during the lifetime of their subjects and displayed as \"salon paintings\" within their houses, to be added to their mummy wrapping after their death. Newer research rather suggests that they were only painted after death,<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> an idea perhaps contradicted by the multiple paintings on some specimens and the (suggested) change of specific details on others. The individualism of those depicted was actually created by variations in some specific details, within a largely unvaried general scheme.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> The habit of depicting the deceased was not a new one, but the painted images gradually replaced the earlier Egyptian masks, although the latter continued in use for some time, often occurring directly adjacent to portrait mummies, sometimes even in the same graves.

===Realism and convention===

Together with the painted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan tombs]], the [[Lucanians|Lucanian]] tombs and the [[Tomb of the Diver]] in [[Paestum]], the frescoes from [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and the [[Greek vase]]s, they are the best preserved paintings from ancient times and are renowned for their remarkable [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]]. It is, however, debatable whether the portraits depict the subjects as they really were. Analyses have shown that the painters depicted faces according to conventions in a repetitive and formulaic way, albeit with a variety of hairstyles and beards. They appear to have worked from a number of standard types without making detailed observations of the unique facial proportions of specific individuals which give each face its own personality.

===Style===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}

The combination of naturalistic Greek portrait of the deceased with Egyptian-form deities, symbols, and frame was primarily phenomenon of funerary art from the chora, or countryside, in Roman Egypt. Combining Egyptian and Greek pictorial forms or motifs was not restricted to funerary art, however: the public and highly visible portraits of Ptolemaic dynasts and Roman emperors grafted iconography developed for a ruler’s Greek or Roman images onto Egyptian statues in the dress and posture of Egyptian kings and queens. The possible combinations of Greek and Egyptian elements can be elucidated by imposing a (somewhat artificial) distinction between form and content, where ‘form’ is taken as the system of representation, and ‘content’ as the symbol, concept, or figure being portrayed.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Christina Riggs |title=The Beautiful Burial in Roman Egypt: Art, Identity, and Funerary Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2005 |p=11 |ISBN=9780191534874}}</ref>

==Coexistence with other burial habits==
The religious meaning of mummy portraits has not, so far, been fully explained, nor have associated grave rites. There is some indication that it developed from genuine Egyptian funerary rites, adapted by a multi-cultural ruling class.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> The tradition of mummy portraits occurred from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] to [[Nubia]], but it is striking that other funerary habits prevailed over portrait mummies at all sites except those in the Faiyum (and there especially Hawara and Achmim) and Antinoopolis. In most sites, different forms of burial coexisted. The choice of grave type may have been determined to a large extent by the financial means and status of the deceased, modified by local customs. Portrait mummies have been found both in rock-cut tombs and in freestanding built grave complexes, but also in shallow pits. It is striking that they are virtually never accompanied by any grave offerings, with the exception of occasional pots or sprays of flowers.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 31</ref>

==End of the mummy portrait tradition==

</gallery>
For a long time, it was assumed that the latest portraits belong to the end of the 4th century, but recent research has modified this view considerably, suggesting that the last wooden portraits belong to the middle, the last directly painted mummy wrappings to the second half of the 3rd century. It is commonly accepted that production reduced considerably since the beginning of the 3rd century. Several reasons for the decline of the mummy portrait have been suggested; no single reason should probably be isolated, rather, they should be seen as operating together.

*In the 3rd century the Roman Empire underwent a severe economic crisis, severely limiting the financial abilities of the upper classes. Although they continued to lavishly spend money on representation, they favoured public appearances, like games and festivals, over the production of portraits. However, other elements of sepulchral representation, like [[sarcophagi]], did continue.
*There is evidence of a religious crisis at the same time. This may not be as closely connected with the rise of Christianity as previously assumed. (The earlier suggestion of a 4th-century end to the portraits would coincide with the widespread distribution of Christianity in Egypt. Christianity also never banned mummification.) An increasing neglect of Egyptian temples is noticeable during the Roman imperial period, leading to a general drop in interest in all ancient religions.
*The [[Constitutio Antoniniana]], i.e. the granting of Roman citizenship to all free subjects changed the social structures of Egypt. For the first time, the individual cities gained a degree of self-administration. At the same time, the provincial upper classes changed in terms of both composition and inter-relations.
Thus, a combination of several factors appears to have led to changes of fashion and ritual. No clear causality can be asserted.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 88–101</ref>

Considering the limited nature of the current understanding of portrait mummies, it remains distinctly possible that future research will considerably modify the image presented here. For example, some scholars suspect that the centre of production of such finds, and thus the centre of the distinctive funerary tradition they represent, may have been located at Alexandria. New finds from [[Marina el-Alamein]] strongly support such a  view.<ref name=\"Barbara Borg 1998\"/> In view of the near-total loss of Greek and Roman paintings, mummy portraits are today considered to be among the very rare examples of ancient art that can be seen to reflect \"Great paintings\" and especially Roman portrait painting.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/>

==Mummy portraits as sources on provincial Roman fashion==

===Provincial fashions===
Mummy portraits depict a variety of different hairstyles. They are one of the main aids in dating the paintings. The majority of the deceased were depicted with hairstyles then in fashion. They are frequently similar to those depicted in [[sculpture]]. As part of Roman propaganda, such sculptures, especially those depicting the imperial family, were often displayed throughout the empire. Thus, they had a direct influence on the development of fashion. Nevertheless, the mummy portraits, as well as other finds, suggest that fashions lasted longer in the provinces than in the imperial court, or at least that diverse styles might coexist.

===Hairstyles===
<gallery heights=200px widths=140px>

</gallery>
Since Roman men tended to wear short-cropped hair, female hairstyles are a better source of evidence for changes in fashion. The female portraits suggest a coarse chronological scheme: Simple hairstyles with a central parting in the [[Tiberius|Tiberian]] period are followed by more complex ringlet hairstyles, nested plaits and [[toupee|curly toupées]] over the forehead in the late 1st century. Small oval nested plaits dominate the time of the [[Antonines]], simple central-parting hairstyles with a hairknot in the neck occur in the second half of the 2nd century. The time of [[Septimius Severus]] was characterised by [[toupée]]-like fluffy as well as strict, straight styles, followed by looped plaits on the crown of the head. The latter belong to the very final phase of mummy portraits, and have only been noted on a few mummy wrappings. It seems to be the case that curly hairstyles were especially popular in Egypt.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 45–49</ref>

===Clothing===
Like the hairstyles, the clothing depicted also follows the general fashions of the Roman Empire, as known from statues and busts. Both men and women tend to wear a thin [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] as an undergarment. Above it, both sexes tend to wear a cloak, laid across the shoulders or wound around the torso. The males wear virtually exclusively white, while female clothing is often red or pink, but can also be yellow, white, blue or purple. The chiton often bears a decorative line (''[[laticlave|clavus]]''), occasionally light red or light green, also sometimes gold, but normally in dark colours. Some painted mummy wrappings from Antinoopolis depict garments with long sleeves and very wide ''clavi''. So far, not a single portrait has been definitely shown to depict the [[toga]], a key symbol of Roman citizenship. It should, however, be kept in mind that Greek cloaks and togas are draped very similarly on depictions of the 1st and early 2nd centuries. In the late 2nd and 3rd centuries, togas should be distinguishable, but fail to occur.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 49–51</ref>

===Jewelry===
Apart from the gold [[wreath]]s worn by many men, with very few exceptions, only women are depicted with jewellery. This generally accords with the common jewellery types of the Graeco-Roman East. Especially the Antinoopolis portraits depict simple gold link chains and massive gold rings. There are also depictions of [[precious stone|precious]] or [[semi-precious stones]] like [[emerald]], [[carnelian]], [[garnet]], [[agate]] or [[amethyst]], rarely also of [[pearl]]s. The stones were normally ground into cylindrical or spherical beads. Some portraits depict elaborate [[collier (necklace)|colliers]], with precious stones set in gold.

The gold wreath was apparently rarely, if ever, worn in life, but a number have been found in graves from much earlier periods. Based on the plant wreaths given as prizes in contests, the idea was apparently to celebrate the achievements of the deceased in life.

There are three basic shapes of ear ornaments: Especially common in the 1st century are circular or drop-shaped pendants. Archaeological finds indicate that these were fully or semi-spherical. Later tastes favoured S-shaped hooks of gold wire, on which up to five beads of different colours and materials could be strung. The third shape are elaborate pendants with a horizontal bar from which two or three, occasionally four, vertical rods are suspended, usually each decorated with a white bead or pearl at the bottom. Other common ornaments include gold hairpins, often decorated with pearls, fine [[diadem (personal wear)|diadems]], and, especially at Antinoopolis, gold [[hairnet]]s. Many portraits also depict [[amulet]]s and [[pendant]]s, perhaps with magical functions.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''„Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ....“ Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 51–52</ref>

== Art-historical significance ==
[[Image:Septimusseverustondo.jpg|thumb|Tondo with images of Septimius Severus and his family. [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].]]
The mummy portraits have immense art-historical importance. Ancient sources indicate that [[panel painting]] (rather than [[wall painting]]), i.e. painting on wood or other mobile surfaces was held in high regard. But very few ancient panel paintings
survive. One of the few examples besides the mummy portraits is the [[Severan Tondo]], also from Egypt (around 200), which, like the mummy portraits, is believed to represent a provincial version of contemporary style.{{refn|1=Other examples: a framed portrait from Hawara,{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=121–122, Nr. 117}} the image of a man flanked by two deities from the same site,{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=123–124, Nr. 119}} or the 6th century BC panels from Pitsa in Greece.<ref>[https://www.sikyon.com/sicyon/Painting/spainting_eg.html]</ref>}}
Some aspects of the mummy portraits, especially their frontal perspective and their concentration on key facial features, strongly resemble later [[icon painting]]. A direct link has been suggested, but it should be kept in mind that the mummy portraits represent only a small part of a much wider Graeco-Roman tradition, the whole of which later bore an influence on [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] and [[Byzantine Art]]. A pair of panel \"icons\" of [[Serapis]] and [[Isis]] of comparable date (3rd century) and style are in the [[Getty Museum]] at [[Malibu, California|Malibu]];<ref>[https://www.aisthesis.de/wbock/bilder/4-9si.gif image]</ref> as with the cult of [[Mithras]], earlier examples of cult images were sculptures or pottery figurines, but from the 3rd century reliefs and then painted images are found.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Kurt Weitzmann]] |title=The Icon |date=1982 |publisher=Evans Brothers Ltd |location=London |p=3 |others=(trans of Le Icone, Montadori 1981) |ISBN=0-237-45645-1}}</ref>

The '''Burma campaign''' in the [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|South-East Asian Theatre]] of [[World War II]] was fought primarily by [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Chinese]] and [[United States]] forces<ref>{{cite video |year=1944 |title=Video: Campaign in Burma, 1944/04/24 (1944) |url=https://archive.org/details/1944-04-24_Campaign_in_Burma |publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]] |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref> against the forces of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], who were assisted to some degree by [[Thailand]], the [[Burmese National Army]] and the [[Indian National Army]]. The British Commonwealth land forces were drawn primarily from the [[United Kingdom]], [[British Raj|British India]] and [[Africa]].

Partly because [[monsoon]] rains made effective campaigning possible only for about half of the year, the Burma campaign was almost the longest campaign of the war. During the campaigning season of 1942, the Japanese had conquered Burma, driving British, Indian and Chinese forces from the country and forcing the British administration to flee into India. After scoring some defensive successes during 1943, they then attempted to forestall Allied offensives in 1944 by launching an invasion of India ([[Operation U-Go]]). This failed with disastrous losses.

During the next campaigning season beginning in December 1944, the Allies launched several offensives into Burma. American and Chinese forces advancing from northernmost Burma linked up with armies of the Chinese Republic advancing into [[Yunnan]], which allowed the Allies to complete the [[Burma Road]] in the last months of the war. In the coastal province of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], Allied amphibious landings secured vital offshore islands and inflicted heavy casualties, although the Japanese maintained some positions until the end of the campaign. In Central Burma however, the Allies crossed the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]] and defeated the main Japanese armies in the theatre. Allied formations then followed up with an advance on [[Yangon|Rangoon]], the capital and principal port. Japanese rearguards delayed them until the monsoon struck but an Allied airborne and amphibious attack secured the city, which the Japanese had abandoned.

In a final operation just before the end of the war, Japanese forces which had been isolated in Southern Burma attempted to [[Battle of the Sittang Bend|escape across]] the [[Sittang River]], suffering heavy casualties.

==Background==

===Allied plans===
As the monsoon rains ended late in 1944, the Allies were preparing to launch large-scale offensives into Japanese-occupied Burma. The main Allied headquarters for the British, Indians and Americans in the theatre of war was [[South East Asia Command]], based at [[Kandy]] in [[Ceylon]] and commanded by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]]. The command had considered three major plans as far back as July 1944.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=368–369}}
* Plan \"X\": The main effort was to be made by the American-led [[Northern Combat Area Command]], with support from the British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]]. Starting from [[Mogaung]] and [[Myitkyina]] which had been captured in mid-1944, the NCAC would link up with the [[Republic of China|Chinese]] [[National Revolutionary Army]] attacking from [[Yunnan]] province under General [[Wei Lihuang]] about [[Lashio]]. The aim was to complete the [[Ledo Road]], which would link [[Assam]] in north-east India with Yunnan, supplementing [[The Hump]] airlift which delivered aid and war material to China.
* Plan \"Y\": The major effort was to be made by Fourteenth Army, across the [[Chindwin River]] into Central Burma, with the aim of capturing Mandalay and linking up with the NCAC and Yunnan Chinese around [[Maymyo]], about {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Mandalay
* Plan \"Z\": Under this plan, which would later be developed into [[Operation Dracula]], the main effort would be an amphibious and airborne attack on [[Rangoon]], the capital and principal port of Burma. If successful, this would isolate the Japanese in Burma from their lines of communication and force them to evacuate the country.

When these plans were studied, it was found that the resources required for Plan \"Z\" (landing craft, [[aircraft carrier]] groups etc.) would probably not be made available until the war in Europe was won. Mountbatten nevertheless proposed to attempt Plans \"Y\" and \"Z\" simultaneously but Plan \"Y\" was adopted and renamed [[Operation Capital]]. Under this, Fourteenth Army (supported by 221 Group RAF) would make the major offensive into Central Burma, where the terrain and road network favoured the British and Indian armoured and motorised formations. The NCAC and Yunnan Chinese (supported by the United States [[10th Air Force#World War II|Tenth]] and [[14th Air Force#Fourteenth Air Force|Fourteenth]] Air Forces) would make subsidiary advances to Lashio, while the [[XV Corps (British India)|XV Corps]] (supported by 224 Group RAF) would seize the coastal province of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], securing or constructing airfields which could be used to supply Fourteenth Army.{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=368}}

===Japanese plans===
[[File:Burma topo en.jpg|thumb|Geography of Burma]]
In the aftermath of their defeats the previous year, the Japanese had made major changes in their command. The most important was the appointment of Lieutenant General [[Hyotaro Kimura]] to command [[Burma Area Army]], succeeding General [[Masakazu Kawabe]]. Kimura was primarily a logistician who had previously been [[List of Japanese government and military commanders of World War II#Vice-Minister of War|Vice-Minister of War]] and it was hoped that he could use the natural and industrial resources of Burma to make his army self-sufficient. Nevertheless, the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]], which had overall control of all Japanese land forces in Southern Asia and much of the Pacific Ocean and was commanded by Field Marshal [[Hisaichi Terauchi]], found 60,000 reinforcements for Kimura's army, with equipment for three infantry divisions and 500 lorries and 2000 pack animals for the lines of communication. Allied air attacks strangled the Japanese communications via the [[Burma Railway]] and the port of [[Yangon|Rangoon]] and only 30,000 of the intended reinforcements reached Burma. Under pressure of events in the Pacific, Terauchi even withdrew some units from Burma during the campaign.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=391}}

Although the Allies expected that the Japanese would fight as far forward as possible, on the Chindwin, Kimura recognised that most of the Japanese units in Burma were weakened by heavy casualties during the previous year and were short of equipment. To avoid fighting at a disadvantage on the Chindwin or in the [[Shwebo]] plain between the Chindwin and [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]] where the terrain provided comparatively few obstacles to the British and Indian armoured and motorised units, he withdrew [[Fifteenth Army (Japan)|Fifteenth Army]] behind the Irrawaddy, which they would defend against the British Fourteenth Army (Operation BAN). The [[Twenty-Eighth Army (Japan)|Twenty-Eighth Army]] was to continue to defend the Arakan and lower Irrawaddy valley (Operation KAN), while [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|Thirty-Third Army]] would attempt to prevent the completion of the new road link between India and China by defending the cities of [[Bhamo]] and [[Lashio]] and mounting guerilla raids (Operation DAN).{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=392}}

===Burma===
Another factor which was to become significant during the campaign was the changing attitude of the Burmese population. During the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]] in 1942, many of the majority [[Bamar]] population had actively aided the Japanese Army. Although the Japanese had established a nominally independent Burmese government (the [[State of Burma]]) under [[Ba Maw]] and formed a [[Burma National Army]] under [[Aung San]], they remained in effective control of the country. Their strict control, along with wartime privations, turned the Burmese against them.

Aung San had sought an alliance with [[Thakin Soe]], who was leading a Communist insurgency in southern Arakan, as early as 1943. They formed the [[Anti-Fascist Organisation]] and intended turning against the Japanese at some stage but Thakin Soe dissuaded Aung San from openly rebelling until Allied forces had established permanent footholds in Burma. In early 1945, Aung San sought the aid of the Allied liaison organisation [[Force 136]], which was already aiding resistance movements among the minority [[Karen people|Karen]] population. Although there was some debate among the Allies, Mountbatten eventually decided that Aung San should be supported. Force 136 was now to abet the defection of the entire Burma National Army to the Allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Bayly|Harper|2005|pp=429–432}}</ref>

Another force nominally under Japanese control was the [[Indian National Army]], a force mainly composed of former [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and volunteers from the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian expatriate]] communities in [[British Malaya]] and Burma. Its commander in chief was [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. During the 1945 campaign, some INA units fought stoutly against the Allies but others deserted or capitulated readily. The Japanese had alienated many of the INA by denying them equipment and supplies, or by using them as labourers and carriers rather than as fighting troops. Their morale was also affected in some units by the obvious turn of fortune against the Japanese.

==Southern front==
[[File:Royal Marines land Ramree Burma.jpg|thumb|Royal Marines land on [[Ramree Island]]]]
The Japanese Twenty-eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shozo Sakurai]], defended the coastal [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] region and the lower Irrawaddy valley. The Japanese [[54th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|54th Division]] defended the [[Mayu Peninsula]] and [[Kaladan River]] valley, the Japanese [[55th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|55th Division]] garrisoned several ports and part of southern Burma (with a regiment on [[Mount Popa]]) and the 72nd Independent Mixed Brigade was stationed around the oilfields at [[Yenangyaung]] on the Irrawaddy.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=456}}

The Allied forces in Arakan were controlled by the XV Indian Corps under Lieutenant General [[Philip Christison]]. The Corps' first major objective was [[Sittwe|Akyab Island]], at the end of the Mayu Peninsula. The island held a port and an important airfield which the Allies planned to use as a base from which to deliver supplies by air to the troops in Central Burma. An attempt to capture the island in 1943 had been defeated, a second attempt in early 1944 gained some ground but was abandoned because of monsoon rains and lack of resources.

As the monsoon ended in late 1944, XV Corps resumed the advance on Akyab for the third year in succession. The [[25th Infantry Division (India)|25th Indian Division]] advanced on [[Foul Point]] and [[Rathedaung]] at the end of the Mayu Peninsula, being supplied by landing craft over beaches to avoid the risk of Japanese attacks against their lines of communication. The [[82nd (West Africa) Division]] cleared the valley of the Kalapanzin River before crossing a mountain range into the Kaladan River valley, while the [[81st (West Africa) Division]] advanced down the Kaladan River, repeating the move it had made in early 1944. The two African divisions converged on [[Mrauk U|Myohaung]] near the mouth of the Kaladan River, cutting the supply lines of the Japanese troops in the Mayu Peninsula. The Japanese evacuated Akyab Island on 31 December 1944. It was occupied by XV Corps without resistance two days later.

The 82nd Division next attacked south along the coastal plain, while the 25th Indian Division, with [[3 Commando Brigade]] under command, made amphibious landings further south to catch the Japanese in a pincer movement. First ashore was [[42 Commando|No. 42 (Royal Marine) Commando]] on the south-eastern face of the [[Myebon]] Peninsula on 12 January 1945. Over the next few days the commandos and a brigade of 25th Division cleared the peninsula and denied the Japanese the use of the many waterways along the Arakan coast.

{{see also|Battle of Hill 170}}
On 22 January, 3 Commando Brigade landed on the beaches at [[Daingbon Chaung]] led this time by [[No. 1 Commando]]. Having secured the beaches they moved inland and became involved in very heavy fighting with the Japanese. The following night a brigade of the 25th Division was landed in support. The fighting around the beachhead involved hand-to-hand fighting as the Japanese realised the danger of encirclement and threw all their available troops into the fight. The commandos and Indian troops managed to turn the tide of the battle and take the village of Kangaw only on 29 January. Meanwhile, the forces on the Myebon Peninsula linked up with the 82nd Division fighting its way overland towards Kangaw. Caught between the 82nd Division and the forces already in Kangaw, the Japanese were forced to scatter, leaving behind thousands of dead and most of their heavy equipment.

With the coastal area secured, the Allies were free to build airbases which could be supplied by sea on the two offshore islands, [[Ramree Island]] and [[Cheduba Island]]. Cheduba, the smaller of the two islands, had no Japanese garrison but the [[Battle of Ramree Island]] lasted for six weeks after the initial landings on 21 January by the [[26th Indian Infantry Division|26th Indian Division]] before the survivors of the small but tenacious Japanese garrison withdrew from the island,<ref>{{harvnb|Slim|1956|pp=461–462}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedops.com/No%205%20Commando.htm |work=Combined Operations |title=No 5 Commando |accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref> suffering heavy casualties to disease, starvation, Allied [[Motor Launch]]es and other naval vessels and (allegedly) crocodiles.{{sfn|McLynn|2011|pp=13–15, 459}}

Following these actions, XV Corps' operations were curtailed to release transport aircraft to support Fourteenth Army. The 81st Division and the [[50th Indian Tank Brigade]] were withdrawn to India. Outflanking moves by the 82nd Division and 26th Indian Division through the hills around [[Ann, Burma|An]] and [[Toungup|Taungup]] were abandoned or cancelled and the Corps' divisions were withdrawn to the coast. The Japanese successfully defended the port of Taungup and the An and Taungup passes across the Arakan hills until very late in the campaign.

==Northern front==
[[File:Opening the Burma Road October 1944 - January 1945.jpg|thumb|Northern Combat Area Command's operations]]
The Japanese Thirty-third Army, led by Lieutenant General [[Masaki Honda]], defended Northern Burma against attacks from both Northern India and the Chinese province of Yunnan. The Japanese [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th Division]] faced the American and Chinese [[Northern Combat Area Command]] (NCAC) under Lieutenant General [[Daniel Isom Sultan]] advancing south from [[Siege of Myitkyina|Myitkyina]] and [[Battle of Mogaung|Mogaung]] which the Allies had secured in 1944, while the Japanese [[56th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|56th Division]] faced the large Chinese Yunnan armies led by [[Wei Lihuang]].

Although Thirty-third Army had been forced to relinquish most of the reinforcements it had received the previous year, the operations of the NCAC were limited from late 1944 onwards as many of its troops were withdrawn by air to face Japanese attacks in China. In [[The Hump#Operation Grubworm|Operation Grubworm]], the Chinese 14th and 22nd divisions were flown via Myitkyina to defend the airfields around [[Kunming]], vital to the airlift of aid to China, nicknamed [[The Hump]]. Nevertheless, the command resumed its advance.

On the right flank of the command, the British [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Division]], which had been assigned to the command in July 1944 to replace the [[Chindits]], advanced south down the \"Railway Valley\" from Mogaung to [[Indaw]]. It made contact with the [[19th Infantry Division (India)|19th Indian Division]] near Indaw on 10 December 1944 and Fourteenth Army and NCAC now had a continuous front. On Sultan's left, the Chinese [[New 1st Army|New First Army]] (the 30th Division and 38th Division) advanced from Myitkyina to Bhamo. The Japanese resisted for several weeks but Bhamo fell on 15 December. The Chinese [[New 6th Army|New Sixth Army]] (commanded by [[Liao Yaoxiang]] and consisting of the 50th Division) infiltrated through the difficult terrain between these two wings to threaten the Japanese lines of communication. An American force (the 5334th Composite Unit, known as the \"Mars Brigade\", commanded by Brigadier General J. P. Willey, which had replaced [[Merrill's Marauders]] and consisted of 475th United States Infantry Regiment, 124th United States Cavalry Regiment and a Chinese regiment), acted independently, though mainly in support of the New First Army.

The New First Army made contact with Wei Lihuang's armies advancing from Yunnan near [[Hsipaw]] on 21 January 1945 and the Ledo road could finally be completed. The first truck convoy from India arrived in Kunming on 4 February{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=455}} but by this point in the war the value of the Ledo road was uncertain, as it would not now affect the military situation in China.

To the annoyance of the British and Americans, Chinese leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] ordered Sultan to halt his advance at Lashio, which was captured on 7 March. The British and Americans generally refused to understand that Chiang had to balance the needs of China as a whole against fighting the Japanese in a British colony.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Japanese had already withdrawn most of their divisions from the northern front, to face the Fourteenth Army in central Burma. On 12 March, the Thirty-third Army HQ was also dispatched there, leaving only the 56th Division to hold the northern front.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=450}} This division was also withdrawn in late March and early April.

From 1 April, NCAC's operations stopped and its units returned to China. The British 36th Division moved to Mandalay, which had been captured in March and was subsequently withdrawn to India. A US-led guerrilla force, [[OSS Detachment 101]], took over the military responsibilities of NCAC,{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=455}} while British civil affairs and other units such as the Civil Affairs Service (Burma) stepped in to take over its other responsibilities. Northern Burma was partitioned into Line-of-Communication areas by the military authorities.

==Central front==
{{Main|Battles of Meiktila and Mandalay}}
[[File:Indian troops among pagodas on Mandalay.jpg|thumb|Troops of the 19th Indian Division in Mandalay]]
The Japanese Fifteenth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shihachi Katamura]], held the central part of the front. The army was falling back behind the Irrawaddy, deploying rearguards to delay the Allied advance. A bridgehead was retained in the [[Sagaing]] hills.

The Fifteenth Army consisted of the Japanese [[15th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|15th Division]], [[31st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|31st Division]] and the [[33rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|33rd Division]]. The [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|53rd Division]] provided a reserve, although it was controlled directly by the Burma Area Army. During the campaign, the headquarters of the Japanese Thirty-third Army and parts of the [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Division]] and the [[49th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|49th Division]] reinforced the forces on the central part of the front.

The British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] under Lieutenant General [[William Slim]] made the main Allied thrust, codenamed Operation Capital, into central Burma. It consisted of [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Frank Messervy]] and [[XXXIII Corps (British India)|XXXIII Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Montagu Stopford]], together controlling six infantry divisions, two armoured brigades and three independent infantry brigades. The main constraint on the number of forces the Fourteenth Army could deploy was supply. A carefully designed system involving large amounts of air transport was introduced and major construction projects were undertaken to improve the land route from India into Burma and make use of river transport.

Units of both corps of the Fourteenth Army crossed the Chindwin and attacked into the Shwebo plain, IV Corps on the left and XXXIII Corps on the right. After a few days, when it was realised that the Japanese had fallen back behind the Irrawaddy River, the plan was hastily changed. Now, only XXXIII Corps was to continue the attack into the Shwebo Plain, reinforced by the one division of IV Corps which had been committed across the Chindwin, while the main body of IV Corps was switched to the right flank, changing its axis of advance to the Gangaw Valley west of the Chindwin. It aimed to cross the Irrawaddy close to [[Pakokku]] and then capture the main Japanese line of communication centre of [[Meiktila]]. Diversionary measures (such as dummy radio traffic) were made to persuade the Japanese that both corps were still aimed at Mandalay. The new plan was a success. Allied air superiority and the thin Japanese presence on the ground meant that the Japanese were unaware of the strength of the force moving on Pakokku.

During January and February, the XXXIII Corps (consisting of the British [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]], 19th Indian Division, [[20th Infantry Division (India)|20th Indian Division]], [[268th Indian Infantry Brigade|268th Indian Brigade]] and the [[254th Indian Tank Brigade]]) cleared the Shwebo plain and established bridgeheads over the Irrawaddy River near Mandalay. There was heavy fighting, which attracted Japanese reserves and fixed their attention. Late in February, the [[7th Indian Infantry Division|7th Indian Division]], leading IV Corps, seized crossings at [[Nyaung-U|Nyaungu]] and [[Bagan|Pagan]] near Pakokku. While the 28th (East Africa) Infantry Brigade maintained diversionary pressure against Yenangyaung on the west bank of the river, the [[17th Infantry Division (India)|17th Indian Division]] and the [[255th Indian Tank Brigade|255th Indian Armoured brigade]] crossed through 7th Indian Division's bridgeheads and began advancing to Meiktila.

===Meiktila===
In the dry season, central Burma is largely an open plain with sandy soil and there is also a good road network. The [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]] 17th Indian Division and the armoured brigade could move rapidly and unhindered in this open terrain, apparently taking the staffs at the various Japanese headquarters by surprise with this [[blitzkrieg]] manoeuvre. Reinforced by the third brigade of the 17th Indian Division which flew in to a captured airstrip, they struck Meiktila on 1 March and captured it in four days, despite resistance to the last man. In an oft-recounted incident, some Japanese soldiers crouched in trenches with aircraft bombs, with orders to detonate them when an enemy tank loomed over the trench.

Japanese reinforcements arrived too late to relieve the garrison but they besieged the town in an attempt to recapture it and destroy the 17th Indian Division. Although eight Japanese regiments were eventually involved, they were mostly weak in numbers and drawn from five divisions, so their efforts were not coordinated. The Japanese Thirty-third Army HQ (re-titled The Army of the Decisive Battle) was assigned to take command in this vital sector but was unable to establish proper control.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=450}} The 17th Indian Division had been reinforced by a brigade of the [[Indian 5th Infantry Division|5th Indian Division]] landed by air. British tank-infantry forces sallied out of Meiktila to break up Japanese concentrations and by the end of the month the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties and had lost most of their artillery, their chief anti-tank weapon. The Japanese broke off the attack and retreated to Pyawbwe.

While the capture and siege of Meiktila took place, the 7th Indian Division, reinforced by a mechanised brigade of the 5th Indian Division, secured the Irrawaddy bridgehead, captured the important river port at [[Myingyan]] and began clearing the lines of communication to Meiktila.

===Mandalay===
While the Japanese were distracted by events at Meiktila, XXXIII Corps had renewed its attack on Mandalay. It fell to the 19th Indian Division on 20 March, though the Japanese held the former citadel, which the British called [[Mandalay Palace|Fort Dufferin]], for another week. Many of the historically and culturally significant areas of Mandalay, including the old royal palace, were burned to the ground. A great deal was lost by the Japanese choice to make a last stand in the city itself. The other divisions of XXXIII Corps simultaneously attacked from their bridgeheads across the Irrawaddy. The Japanese Fifteenth Army was reduced to small detachments and parties of stragglers making their way south, or east into the Shan States. With the fall of Mandalay (and of [[Pyin U Lwin|Maymyo]] to its east), the Japanese communications to the front in the north of Burma were cut and the Allied road link between India and China was therefore finally secured, though far too late to affect the course of the war in China.

The fall of Mandalay also precipitated the change of sides by the Burma National Army and open rebellion against the Japanese by other underground movements belonging to the Anti-Fascist Organisation.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=573}} In the last week of March Aung San, commander-in-chief of the Burma National Army, appeared in public in Burmese native dress instead of Japanese uniform.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=582}} Shortly afterwards, most of the Burma National Army paraded in Rangoon and then marched out of the city as if going to the front in Central Burma. They then rebelled against the Japanese on 27 March.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=584}}

==Race for Rangoon==
[[File:IND 004652 Stuart tank advancing on Rangoon.jpg|thumb|A [[Stuart light tank]] of an Indian cavalry regiment during the advance on Rangoon]]
Though the Allied force had advanced successfully into central Burma, it was vital to capture the port of Rangoon before the monsoon rains began. The temporarily upgraded overland routes from India would disintegrate under heavy rain, which would also curtail flying and reduce the amount of supplies which could be delivered by air. Furthermore, South East Asia Command had been notified that many of the American transport aircraft allocated to the theatre would be withdrawn in June at the latest. The use of Rangoon would be necessary to meet the needs of the large army force and (as importantly) the food needs of the civilian population in the areas liberated.

The British 2nd Division and British 36th Division, both of which were understrength and could not readily be reinforced, were withdrawn to India to reduce the demand for supplies. (The 36th Division also exchanged the Indian battalions in one of its brigades for the depleted British battalions in the 20th Indian Division). The Indian XXXIII Corps, consisting of the 7th Indian Division and 20th Indian Division, mounted the Fourteenth Army's secondary drive down the Irrawaddy River valley, against the Japanese Twenty-Eighth Army. The IV Corps, of the 5th, 17th and 19th Indian divisions, made the main attack down the [[Sittang River]] valley.

The 17th Indian Division and 255th Armoured Brigade began the IV Corps advance on 6 April by striking from all sides at the delaying position held by the remnants of the Japanese Thirty-third Army at [[Pyawbwe Township|Pyawbwe]], while a flanking column (nicknamed \"Claudcol\") of tanks and mechanised infantry cut the main road behind them and attacked their rear.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=461}} This column was initially delayed by the remnants of the Japanese 49th Division defending a village but bypassed them to defeat the remnants of the Japanese 53rd Division and destroy the last tanks remaining to the Japanese 14th Tank regiment. As they then turned north against the town of Pyawbwe itself, they attacked Lieutenant General Honda's headquarters but were not aware of the presence of an army headquarters and broke off to capture the town instead.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=465–466}}

From this point, the advance down the main road to Rangoon faced little organised opposition. At [[Pyinmana]], the town and the bridge were seized on 19 April before the Japanese could organise their defence. The Japanese Thirty-third Army headquarters was present in Pyinmana. From reports by agents, the Allies were aware this time of Honda's presence and his headquarters was attacked by tanks and aircraft. Lieutenant-General Honda and his staff escaped at night on foot but they now had little means of controlling the remnants of their formations.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=468–471}}

[[File:IND 004723.jpg|thumb|British [[3-inch mortar]] detachments support the 19th Indian Division advance along the Mawchi road, east of [[Toungoo]] (1944)]]
Some units of the Japanese Fifteenth Army had reorganised in the Shan States and were reinforced by the Japanese 56th Division, which had been transferred from the northern front. They were ordered to move to [[Toungoo]] to block the road to Rangoon but a general uprising by Karen forces who had been organised and equipped by Force 136 delayed them long enough for the 5th Indian Division to reach the town first on 23 April. The Japanese briefly recaptured Toungoo once the 5th Indian Division had passed through but the 19th Indian Division, which was following up the leading units of IV Corps, captured the town again and slowly drove the Japanese back towards [[Mawchi]] to the east.

The 17th Indian Division resumed the lead of the advance and met a Japanese blocking force north of [[Pegu]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} north of Rangoon, on 25 April. The various line of communication troops, naval personnel and even Japanese civilians in Rangoon had been formed into the Japanese 105 Independent Mixed Brigade. This scratch formation used anti-tank mines improvised from aircraft bombs, anti-aircraft guns and suicide attacks with pole charges to delay the 17th Indian Division and then defended Pegu until 30 April, when it withdrew into the hills west of Pegu. The monsoon broke as the division resumed its advance on Rangoon and floods slowed the division.

==Operation Dracula==
{{Main|Operation Dracula}}
In the original conception of the plan to re-take Burma, it had been intended that the XV Indian Corps would make an amphibious assault codenamed [[Operation Dracula]] on Rangoon long before Fourteenth Army reached the capital, in order to ease supply problems. Lack of resources meant that ''Dracula'' was postponed and the operation was subsequently dropped in favour of a planned assault on [[Phuket Island]] off the [[Kra Isthmus]].

Slim feared that the Japanese would defend Rangoon to the last man through the monsoon, which would put the Fourteenth Army in a disastrous supply situation. In late March, he therefore asked for ''Dracula'' to be reinstated at short notice. However, Kimura had ordered Rangoon to be evacuated, starting on 22 April. Many troops were evacuated by sea, although British destroyers claimed several ships. Kimura's own HQ and the establishments of Ba Maw and Subhas Bose left by land, covered by the action of 105 Mixed Brigade at Pegu and proceeded to [[Mawlamyine|Moulmein]].

On 1 May, a Gurkha parachute battalion was dropped on [[Battle of Elephant Point|Elephant Point]] and cleared Japanese coastal defence batteries at the mouth of the [[Rangoon River]]. The 26th Indian Division started to land the next day as the monsoon began and took over Rangoon, which had seen an orgy of looting and lawlessness since the Japanese had left. The leading troops of the 17th and 26th Indian divisions met at Hlegu, {{convert|28|mi|km}} north of Rangoon, on 6 May.

==Final operations==
{{Main|Battle of the Sittang Bend|}}
Following the capture of Rangoon, a new [[British Twelfth Army|Twelfth Army]] headquarters, commanded by Lieutenant General Stopford, was created from the XXXIII Indian Corps HQ to take control of the allied formations which were to remain in Burma, including IV Corps.

The remnants of the Japanese Burma Area Army remained in control of [[Tanintharyi Region|Tenasserim]] province. The Japanese Twenty-eighth Army, which had withdrawn from [[Arakan Province|Arakan]] and unsuccessfully resisted XXXIII Corps in the Irrawaddy valley, and the 105 Independent Brigade, were cut off in the [[Pegu Yomas]], a range of low jungle-covered hills between the Irrawaddy and Sittang rivers. They planned to break out and rejoin Burma Area Army. To cover this break-out, Kimura ordered Honda's Thirty-third Army to mount a diversionary offensive across the Sittang, although the entire army could muster the strength of barely a regiment. On 3 July, Honda's troops attacked British positions in the \"Sittang Bend\". On 10 July, after a battle for country which was almost entirely under chest-high water, both the Japanese and the 89th Indian Brigade withdrew.

Honda, pressed by Kimura and his chief of staff, Tanaka, had attacked too early. Sakurai's Twenty-eighth Army was not ready to start the break-out until 17 July. The break-out was a disaster. The British had captured the Japanese plans from an officer killed making a final reconnaissance,{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=506–507}} and had placed ambushes or artillery concentrations on the routes they were to use. Hundreds of men drowned trying to cross the swollen Sittang on improvised bamboo floats and rafts. Burmese guerrillas and bandits killed stragglers east of the river. The break-out cost the Japanese nearly 10,000 men, half the strength of Twenty-eighth Army. Some units of 105 Independent Brigade were almost entirely wiped out.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=524–525}} British and Indian casualties were minimal.

Fourteenth Army (now commanded by Lieutenant General [[Miles Dempsey]]) and XV Corps had returned to India to plan the next stage of the campaign to re-take south east Asia. A new corps, the [[Indian XXXIV Corps|XXXIV Corps]] under Lieutenant-General [[Ouvry Lindfield Roberts]], was raised and assigned to Fourteenth Army for further operations.

The next intended operation was to be an amphibious assault on the western coast of Malaya, codenamed [[Operation Zipper]]. The dropping of the atomic bombs forestalled ''Zipper'' but the operation was undertaken post-war as the quickest way of getting occupation troops into Malaya.

The '''Burma campaign''' in the [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|South-East Asian Theatre]] of [[World War II]] was fought primarily by [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Chinese]] and [[United States]] forces<ref>{{cite video |year=1944 |title=Video: Campaign in Burma, 1944/04/24 (1944) |url=https://archive.org/details/1944-04-24_Campaign_in_Burma |publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]] |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref> against the forces of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], who were assisted to some degree by [[Thailand]], the [[Burmese National Army]] and the [[Indian National Army]]. The British Commonwealth land forces were drawn primarily from the [[United Kingdom]], [[British Raj|British India]] and [[Africa]].

Partly because [[monsoon]] rains made effective campaigning possible only for about half of the year, the Burma campaign was almost the longest campaign of the war. During the campaigning season of 1942, the Japanese had conquered Burma, driving British, Indian and Chinese forces from the country and forcing the British administration to flee into India. After scoring some defensive successes during 1943, they then attempted to forestall Allied offensives in 1944 by launching an invasion of India ([[Operation U-Go]]). This failed with disastrous losses.

During the next campaigning season beginning in December 1944, the Allies launched several offensives into Burma. American and Chinese forces advancing from northernmost Burma linked up with armies of the Chinese Republic advancing into [[Yunnan]], which allowed the Allies to complete the [[Burma Road]] in the last months of the war. In the coastal province of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], Allied amphibious landings secured vital offshore islands and inflicted heavy casualties, although the Japanese maintained some positions until the end of the campaign. In Central Burma however, the Allies crossed the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]] and defeated the main Japanese armies in the theatre. Allied formations then followed up with an advance on [[Yangon|Rangoon]], the capital and principal port. Japanese rearguards delayed them until the monsoon struck but an Allied airborne and amphibious attack secured the city, which the Japanese had abandoned.

In a final operation just before the end of the war, Japanese forces which had been isolated in Southern Burma attempted to [[Battle of the Sittang Bend|escape across]] the [[Sittang River]], suffering heavy casualties.

==Background==

===Allied plans===
As the monsoon rains ended late in 1944, the Allies were preparing to launch large-scale offensives into Japanese-occupied Burma. The main Allied headquarters for the British, Indians and Americans in the theatre of war was [[South East Asia Command]], based at [[Kandy]] in [[Ceylon]] and commanded by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]]. The command had considered three major plans as far back as July 1944.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=368–369}}
* Plan \"X\": The main effort was to be made by the American-led [[Northern Combat Area Command]], with support from the British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]]. Starting from [[Mogaung]] and [[Myitkyina]] which had been captured in mid-1944, the NCAC would link up with the [[Republic of China|Chinese]] [[National Revolutionary Army]] attacking from [[Yunnan]] province under General [[Wei Lihuang]] about [[Lashio]]. The aim was to complete the [[Ledo Road]], which would link [[Assam]] in north-east India with Yunnan, supplementing [[The Hump]] airlift which delivered aid and war material to China.
* Plan \"Y\": The major effort was to be made by Fourteenth Army, across the [[Chindwin River]] into Central Burma, with the aim of capturing Mandalay and linking up with the NCAC and Yunnan Chinese around [[Maymyo]], about {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Mandalay
* Plan \"Z\": Under this plan, which would later be developed into [[Operation Dracula]], the main effort would be an amphibious and airborne attack on [[Rangoon]], the capital and principal port of Burma. If successful, this would isolate the Japanese in Burma from their lines of communication and force them to evacuate the country.

When these plans were studied, it was found that the resources required for Plan \"Z\" (landing craft, [[aircraft carrier]] groups etc.) would probably not be made available until the war in Europe was won. Mountbatten nevertheless proposed to attempt Plans \"Y\" and \"Z\" simultaneously but Plan \"Y\" was adopted and renamed [[Operation Capital]]. Under this, Fourteenth Army (supported by 221 Group RAF) would make the major offensive into Central Burma, where the terrain and road network favoured the British and Indian armoured and motorised formations. The NCAC and Yunnan Chinese (supported by the United States [[10th Air Force#World War II|Tenth]] and [[14th Air Force#Fourteenth Air Force|Fourteenth]] Air Forces) would make subsidiary advances to Lashio, while the [[XV Corps (British India)|XV Corps]] (supported by 224 Group RAF) would seize the coastal province of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], securing or constructing airfields which could be used to supply Fourteenth Army.{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=368}}

===Japanese plans===
[[File:Burma topo en.jpg|thumb|Geography of Burma]]
In the aftermath of their defeats the previous year, the Japanese had made major changes in their command. The most important was the appointment of Lieutenant General [[Hyotaro Kimura]] to command [[Burma Area Army]], succeeding General [[Masakazu Kawabe]]. Kimura was primarily a logistician who had previously been [[List of Japanese government and military commanders of World War II#Vice-Minister of War|Vice-Minister of War]] and it was hoped that he could use the natural and industrial resources of Burma to make his army self-sufficient. Nevertheless, the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]], which had overall control of all Japanese land forces in Southern Asia and much of the Pacific Ocean and was commanded by Field Marshal [[Hisaichi Terauchi]], found 60,000 reinforcements for Kimura's army, with equipment for three infantry divisions and 500 lorries and 2000 pack animals for the lines of communication. Allied air attacks strangled the Japanese communications via the [[Burma Railway]] and the port of [[Yangon|Rangoon]] and only 30,000 of the intended reinforcements reached Burma. Under pressure of events in the Pacific, Terauchi even withdrew some units from Burma during the campaign.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=391}}

Although the Allies expected that the Japanese would fight as far forward as possible, on the Chindwin, Kimura recognised that most of the Japanese units in Burma were weakened by heavy casualties during the previous year and were short of equipment. To avoid fighting at a disadvantage on the Chindwin or in the [[Shwebo]] plain between the Chindwin and [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]] where the terrain provided comparatively few obstacles to the British and Indian armoured and motorised units, he withdrew [[Fifteenth Army (Japan)|Fifteenth Army]] behind the Irrawaddy, which they would defend against the British Fourteenth Army (Operation BAN). The [[Twenty-Eighth Army (Japan)|Twenty-Eighth Army]] was to continue to defend the Arakan and lower Irrawaddy valley (Operation KAN), while [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|Thirty-Third Army]] would attempt to prevent the completion of the new road link between India and China by defending the cities of [[Bhamo]] and [[Lashio]] and mounting guerilla raids (Operation DAN).{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=392}}

===Burma===
Another factor which was to become significant during the campaign was the changing attitude of the Burmese population. During the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]] in 1942, many of the majority [[Bamar]] population had actively aided the Japanese Army. Although the Japanese had established a nominally independent Burmese government (the [[State of Burma]]) under [[Ba Maw]] and formed a [[Burma National Army]] under [[Aung San]], they remained in effective control of the country. Their strict control, along with wartime privations, turned the Burmese against them.

Aung San had sought an alliance with [[Thakin Soe]], who was leading a Communist insurgency in southern Arakan, as early as 1943. They formed the [[Anti-Fascist Organisation]] and intended turning against the Japanese at some stage but Thakin Soe dissuaded Aung San from openly rebelling until Allied forces had established permanent footholds in Burma. In early 1945, Aung San sought the aid of the Allied liaison organisation [[Force 136]], which was already aiding resistance movements among the minority [[Karen people|Karen]] population. Although there was some debate among the Allies, Mountbatten eventually decided that Aung San should be supported. Force 136 was now to abet the defection of the entire Burma National Army to the Allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Bayly|Harper|2005|pp=429–432}}</ref>

Another force nominally under Japanese control was the [[Indian National Army]], a force mainly composed of former [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and volunteers from the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian expatriate]] communities in [[British Malaya]] and Burma. Its commander in chief was [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. During the 1945 campaign, some INA units fought stoutly against the Allies but others deserted or capitulated readily. The Japanese had alienated many of the INA by denying them equipment and supplies, or by using them as labourers and carriers rather than as fighting troops. Their morale was also affected in some units by the obvious turn of fortune against the Japanese.

==Southern front==
[[File:Royal Marines land Ramree Burma.jpg|thumb|Royal Marines land on [[Ramree Island]]]]
The Japanese Twenty-eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shozo Sakurai]], defended the coastal [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] region and the lower Irrawaddy valley. The Japanese [[54th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|54th Division]] defended the [[Mayu Peninsula]] and [[Kaladan River]] valley, the Japanese [[55th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|55th Division]] garrisoned several ports and part of southern Burma (with a regiment on [[Mount Popa]]) and the 72nd Independent Mixed Brigade was stationed around the oilfields at [[Yenangyaung]] on the Irrawaddy.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=456}}

The Allied forces in Arakan were controlled by the XV Indian Corps under Lieutenant General [[Philip Christison]]. The Corps' first major objective was [[Sittwe|Akyab Island]], at the end of the Mayu Peninsula. The island held a port and an important airfield which the Allies planned to use as a base from which to deliver supplies by air to the troops in Central Burma. An attempt to capture the island in 1943 had been defeated, a second attempt in early 1944 gained some ground but was abandoned because of monsoon rains and lack of resources.

As the monsoon ended in late 1944, XV Corps resumed the advance on Akyab for the third year in succession. The [[25th Infantry Division (India)|25th Indian Division]] advanced on [[Foul Point]] and [[Rathedaung]] at the end of the Mayu Peninsula, being supplied by landing craft over beaches to avoid the risk of Japanese attacks against their lines of communication. The [[82nd (West Africa) Division]] cleared the valley of the Kalapanzin River before crossing a mountain range into the Kaladan River valley, while the [[81st (West Africa) Division]] advanced down the Kaladan River, repeating the move it had made in early 1944. The two African divisions converged on [[Mrauk U|Myohaung]] near the mouth of the Kaladan River, cutting the supply lines of the Japanese troops in the Mayu Peninsula. The Japanese evacuated Akyab Island on 31 December 1944. It was occupied by XV Corps without resistance two days later.

The 82nd Division next attacked south along the coastal plain, while the 25th Indian Division, with [[3 Commando Brigade]] under command, made amphibious landings further south to catch the Japanese in a pincer movement. First ashore was [[42 Commando|No. 42 (Royal Marine) Commando]] on the south-eastern face of the [[Myebon]] Peninsula on 12 January 1945. Over the next few days the commandos and a brigade of 25th Division cleared the peninsula and denied the Japanese the use of the many waterways along the Arakan coast.

{{see also|Battle of Hill 170}}
On 22 January, 3 Commando Brigade landed on the beaches at [[Daingbon Chaung]] led this time by [[No. 1 Commando]]. Having secured the beaches they moved inland and became involved in very heavy fighting with the Japanese. The following night a brigade of the 25th Division was landed in support. The fighting around the beachhead involved hand-to-hand fighting as the Japanese realised the danger of encirclement and threw all their available troops into the fight. The commandos and Indian troops managed to turn the tide of the battle and take the village of Kangaw only on 29 January. Meanwhile, the forces on the Myebon Peninsula linked up with the 82nd Division fighting its way overland towards Kangaw. Caught between the 82nd Division and the forces already in Kangaw, the Japanese were forced to scatter, leaving behind thousands of dead and most of their heavy equipment.

With the coastal area secured, the Allies were free to build airbases which could be supplied by sea on the two offshore islands, [[Ramree Island]] and [[Cheduba Island]]. Cheduba, the smaller of the two islands, had no Japanese garrison but the [[Battle of Ramree Island]] lasted for six weeks after the initial landings on 21 January by the [[26th Indian Infantry Division|26th Indian Division]] before the survivors of the small but tenacious Japanese garrison withdrew from the island,<ref>{{harvnb|Slim|1956|pp=461–462}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedops.com/No%205%20Commando.htm |work=Combined Operations |title=No 5 Commando |accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref> suffering heavy casualties to disease, starvation, Allied [[Motor Launch]]es and other naval vessels and (allegedly) crocodiles.{{sfn|McLynn|2011|pp=13–15, 459}}

Following these actions, XV Corps' operations were curtailed to release transport aircraft to support Fourteenth Army. The 81st Division and the [[50th Indian Tank Brigade]] were withdrawn to India. Outflanking moves by the 82nd Division and 26th Indian Division through the hills around [[Ann, Burma|An]] and [[Toungup|Taungup]] were abandoned or cancelled and the Corps' divisions were withdrawn to the coast. The Japanese successfully defended the port of Taungup and the An and Taungup passes across the Arakan hills until very late in the campaign.

==Northern front==
[[File:Opening the Burma Road October 1944 - January 1945.jpg|thumb|Northern Combat Area Command's operations]]
The Japanese Thirty-third Army, led by Lieutenant General [[Masaki Honda]], defended Northern Burma against attacks from both Northern India and the Chinese province of Yunnan. The Japanese [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th Division]] faced the American and Chinese [[Northern Combat Area Command]] (NCAC) under Lieutenant General [[Daniel Isom Sultan]] advancing south from [[Myitkyina]] and [[Mogaung]] which the Allies had secured in 1944, while the Japanese [[56th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|56th Division]] faced the large Chinese Yunnan armies led by [[Wei Lihuang]].

Although Thirty-third Army had been forced to relinquish most of the reinforcements it had received the previous year, the operations of the NCAC were limited from late 1944 onwards as many of its troops were withdrawn by air to face Japanese attacks in China. In [[The Hump#Operation Grubworm|Operation Grubworm]], the Chinese 14th and 22nd divisions were flown via Myitkyina to defend the airfields around [[Kunming]], vital to the airlift of aid to China, nicknamed [[The Hump]]. Nevertheless, the command resumed its advance.

On the right flank of the command, the British [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Division]], which had been assigned to the command in July 1944 to replace the [[Chindits]], advanced south down the \"Railway Valley\" from Mogaung to [[Indaw]]. It made contact with the [[19th Infantry Division (India)|19th Indian Division]] near Indaw on 10 December 1944 and Fourteenth Army and NCAC now had a continuous front. On Sultan's left, the Chinese [[New 1st Army|New First Army]] (the 30th Division and 38th Division) advanced from Myitkyina to Bhamo. The Japanese resisted for several weeks but Bhamo fell on 15 December. The Chinese [[New 6th Army|New Sixth Army]] (commanded by [[Liao Yaoxiang]] and consisting of the 50th Division) infiltrated through the difficult terrain between these two wings to threaten the Japanese lines of communication. An American force (the 5334th Composite Unit, known as the \"Mars Brigade\", commanded by Brigadier General J. P. Willey, which had replaced [[Merrill's Marauders]] and consisted of 475th United States Infantry Regiment, 124th United States Cavalry Regiment and a Chinese regiment), acted independently, though mainly in support of the New First Army.

The New First Army made contact with Wei Lihuang's armies advancing from Yunnan near [[Hsipaw]] on 21 January 1945 and the Ledo road could finally be completed. The first truck convoy from India arrived in Kunming on 4 February{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=455}} but by this point in the war the value of the Ledo road was uncertain, as it would not now affect the military situation in China.

To the annoyance of the British and Americans, Chinese leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] ordered Sultan to halt his advance at Lashio, which was captured on 7 March. The British and Americans generally refused to understand that Chiang had to balance the needs of China as a whole against fighting the Japanese in a British colony.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Japanese had already withdrawn most of their divisions from the northern front, to face the Fourteenth Army in central Burma. On 12 March, the Thirty-third Army HQ was also dispatched there, leaving only the 56th Division to hold the northern front.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=450}} This division was also withdrawn in late March and early April.

From 1 April, NCAC's operations stopped and its units returned to China. The British 36th Division moved to Mandalay, which had been captured in March and was subsequently withdrawn to India. A US-led guerrilla force, [[OSS Detachment 101]], took over the military responsibilities of NCAC,{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=455}} while British civil affairs and other units such as the Civil Affairs Service (Burma) stepped in to take over its other responsibilities. Northern Burma was partitioned into Line-of-Communication areas by the military authorities.

==Central front==
{{Main|Battles of Meiktila and Mandalay}}
[[File:Indian troops among pagodas on Mandalay.jpg|thumb|Troops of the 19th Indian Division in Mandalay]]
The Japanese Fifteenth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shihachi Katamura]], held the central part of the front. The army was falling back behind the Irrawaddy, deploying rearguards to delay the Allied advance. A bridgehead was retained in the [[Sagaing]] hills.

The Fifteenth Army consisted of the Japanese [[15th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|15th Division]], [[31st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|31st Division]] and the [[33rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|33rd Division]]. The [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|53rd Division]] provided a reserve, although it was controlled directly by the Burma Area Army. During the campaign, the headquarters of the Japanese Thirty-third Army and parts of the [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Division]] and the [[49th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|49th Division]] reinforced the forces on the central part of the front.

The British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] under Lieutenant General [[William Slim]] made the main Allied thrust, codenamed Operation Capital, into central Burma. It consisted of [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Frank Messervy]] and [[XXXIII Corps (British India)|XXXIII Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Montagu Stopford]], together controlling six infantry divisions, two armoured brigades and three independent infantry brigades. The main constraint on the number of forces the Fourteenth Army could deploy was supply. A carefully designed system involving large amounts of air transport was introduced and major construction projects were undertaken to improve the land route from India into Burma and make use of river transport.

Units of both corps of the Fourteenth Army crossed the Chindwin and attacked into the Shwebo plain, IV Corps on the left and XXXIII Corps on the right. After a few days, when it was realised that the Japanese had fallen back behind the Irrawaddy River, the plan was hastily changed. Now, only XXXIII Corps was to continue the attack into the Shwebo Plain, reinforced by the one division of IV Corps which had been committed across the Chindwin, while the main body of IV Corps was switched to the right flank, changing its axis of advance to the Gangaw Valley west of the Chindwin. It aimed to cross the Irrawaddy close to [[Pakokku]] and then capture the main Japanese line of communication centre of [[Meiktila]]. Diversionary measures (such as dummy radio traffic) were made to persuade the Japanese that both corps were still aimed at Mandalay. The new plan was a success. Allied air superiority and the thin Japanese presence on the ground meant that the Japanese were unaware of the strength of the force moving on Pakokku.

During January and February, the XXXIII Corps (consisting of the British [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]], 19th Indian Division, [[20th Infantry Division (India)|20th Indian Division]], [[268th Indian Infantry Brigade|268th Indian Brigade]] and the [[254th Indian Tank Brigade]]) cleared the Shwebo plain and established bridgeheads over the Irrawaddy River near Mandalay. There was heavy fighting, which attracted Japanese reserves and fixed their attention. Late in February, the [[7th Indian Infantry Division|7th Indian Division]], leading IV Corps, seized crossings at [[Nyaung-U|Nyaungu]] and [[Bagan|Pagan]] near Pakokku. While the 28th (East Africa) Infantry Brigade maintained diversionary pressure against Yenangyaung on the west bank of the river, the [[17th Infantry Division (India)|17th Indian Division]] and the [[255th Indian Tank Brigade|255th Indian Armoured brigade]] crossed through 7th Indian Division's bridgeheads and began advancing to Meiktila.

===Meiktila===
In the dry season, central Burma is largely an open plain with sandy soil and there is also a good road network. The [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]] 17th Indian Division and the armoured brigade could move rapidly and unhindered in this open terrain, apparently taking the staffs at the various Japanese headquarters by surprise with this [[blitzkrieg]] manoeuvre. Reinforced by the third brigade of the 17th Indian Division which flew in to a captured airstrip, they struck Meiktila on 1 March and captured it in four days, despite resistance to the last man. In an oft-recounted incident, some Japanese soldiers crouched in trenches with aircraft bombs, with orders to detonate them when an enemy tank loomed over the trench.

Japanese reinforcements arrived too late to relieve the garrison but they besieged the town in an attempt to recapture it and destroy the 17th Indian Division. Although eight Japanese regiments were eventually involved, they were mostly weak in numbers and drawn from five divisions, so their efforts were not coordinated. The Japanese Thirty-third Army HQ (re-titled The Army of the Decisive Battle) was assigned to take command in this vital sector but was unable to establish proper control.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=450}} The 17th Indian Division had been reinforced by a brigade of the [[Indian 5th Infantry Division|5th Indian Division]] landed by air. British tank-infantry forces sallied out of Meiktila to break up Japanese concentrations and by the end of the month the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties and had lost most of their artillery, their chief anti-tank weapon. The Japanese broke off the attack and retreated to Pyawbwe.

While the capture and siege of Meiktila took place, the 7th Indian Division, reinforced by a mechanised brigade of the 5th Indian Division, secured the Irrawaddy bridgehead, captured the important river port at [[Myingyan]] and began clearing the lines of communication to Meiktila.

===Mandalay===
While the Japanese were distracted by events at Meiktila, XXXIII Corps had renewed its attack on Mandalay. It fell to the 19th Indian Division on 20 March, though the Japanese held the former citadel, which the British called [[Mandalay Palace|Fort Dufferin]], for another week. Many of the historically and culturally significant areas of Mandalay, including the old royal palace, were burned to the ground. A great deal was lost by the Japanese choice to make a last stand in the city itself. The other divisions of XXXIII Corps simultaneously attacked from their bridgeheads across the Irrawaddy. The Japanese Fifteenth Army was reduced to small detachments and parties of stragglers making their way south, or east into the Shan States. With the fall of Mandalay (and of [[Pyin U Lwin|Maymyo]] to its east), the Japanese communications to the front in the north of Burma were cut and the Allied road link between India and China was therefore finally secured, though far too late to affect the course of the war in China.

The fall of Mandalay also precipitated the change of sides by the Burma National Army and open rebellion against the Japanese by other underground movements belonging to the Anti-Fascist Organisation.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=573}} In the last week of March Aung San, commander-in-chief of the Burma National Army, appeared in public in Burmese native dress instead of Japanese uniform.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=582}} Shortly afterwards, most of the Burma National Army paraded in Rangoon and then marched out of the city as if going to the front in Central Burma. They then rebelled against the Japanese on 27 March.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=584}}

==Race for Rangoon==
[[File:IND 004652 Stuart tank advancing on Rangoon.jpg|thumb|A [[Stuart light tank]] of an Indian cavalry regiment during the advance on Rangoon]]
Though the Allied force had advanced successfully into central Burma, it was vital to capture the port of Rangoon before the monsoon rains began. The temporarily upgraded overland routes from India would disintegrate under heavy rain, which would also curtail flying and reduce the amount of supplies which could be delivered by air. Furthermore, South East Asia Command had been notified that many of the American transport aircraft allocated to the theatre would be withdrawn in June at the latest. The use of Rangoon would be necessary to meet the needs of the large army force and (as importantly) the food needs of the civilian population in the areas liberated.

The British 2nd Division and British 36th Division, both of which were understrength and could not readily be reinforced, were withdrawn to India to reduce the demand for supplies. (The 36th Division also exchanged the Indian battalions in one of its brigades for the depleted British battalions in the 20th Indian Division). The Indian XXXIII Corps, consisting of the 7th Indian Division and 20th Indian Division, mounted the Fourteenth Army's secondary drive down the Irrawaddy River valley, against the Japanese Twenty-Eighth Army. The IV Corps, of the 5th, 17th and 19th Indian divisions, made the main attack down the [[Sittang River]] valley.

The 17th Indian Division and 255th Armoured Brigade began the IV Corps advance on 6 April by striking from all sides at the delaying position held by the remnants of the Japanese Thirty-third Army at [[Pyawbwe Township|Pyawbwe]], while a flanking column (nicknamed \"Claudcol\") of tanks and mechanised infantry cut the main road behind them and attacked their rear.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=461}} This column was initially delayed by the remnants of the Japanese 49th Division defending a village but bypassed them to defeat the remnants of the Japanese 53rd Division and destroy the last tanks remaining to the Japanese 14th Tank regiment. As they then turned north against the town of Pyawbwe itself, they attacked Lieutenant General Honda's headquarters but were not aware of the presence of an army headquarters and broke off to capture the town instead.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=465–466}}

From this point, the advance down the main road to Rangoon faced little organised opposition. At [[Pyinmana]], the town and the bridge were seized on 19 April before the Japanese could organise their defence. The Japanese Thirty-third Army headquarters was present in Pyinmana. From reports by agents, the Allies were aware this time of Honda's presence and his headquarters was attacked by tanks and aircraft. Lieutenant-General Honda and his staff escaped at night on foot but they now had little means of controlling the remnants of their formations.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=468–471}}

[[File:IND 004723.jpg|thumb|British [[3-inch mortar]] detachments support the 19th Indian Division advance along the Mawchi road, east of [[Toungoo]] (1944)]]
Some units of the Japanese Fifteenth Army had reorganised in the Shan States and were reinforced by the Japanese 56th Division, which had been transferred from the northern front. They were ordered to move to [[Toungoo]] to block the road to Rangoon but a general uprising by Karen forces who had been organised and equipped by Force 136 delayed them long enough for the 5th Indian Division to reach the town first on 23 April. The Japanese briefly recaptured Toungoo once the 5th Indian Division had passed through but the 19th Indian Division, which was following up the leading units of IV Corps, captured the town again and slowly drove the Japanese back towards [[Mawchi]] to the east.

The 17th Indian Division resumed the lead of the advance and met a Japanese blocking force north of [[Pegu]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} north of Rangoon, on 25 April. The various line of communication troops, naval personnel and even Japanese civilians in Rangoon had been formed into the Japanese 105 Independent Mixed Brigade. This scratch formation used anti-tank mines improvised from aircraft bombs, anti-aircraft guns and suicide attacks with pole charges to delay the 17th Indian Division and then defended Pegu until 30 April, when it withdrew into the hills west of Pegu. The monsoon broke as the division resumed its advance on Rangoon and floods slowed the division.

==Operation Dracula==
{{Main|Operation Dracula}}
In the original conception of the plan to re-take Burma, it had been intended that the XV Indian Corps would make an amphibious assault codenamed [[Operation Dracula]] on Rangoon long before Fourteenth Army reached the capital, in order to ease supply problems. Lack of resources meant that ''Dracula'' was postponed and the operation was subsequently dropped in favour of a planned assault on [[Phuket Island]] off the [[Kra Isthmus]].

Slim feared that the Japanese would defend Rangoon to the last man through the monsoon, which would put the Fourteenth Army in a disastrous supply situation. In late March, he therefore asked for ''Dracula'' to be reinstated at short notice. However, Kimura had ordered Rangoon to be evacuated, starting on 22 April. Many troops were evacuated by sea, although British destroyers claimed several ships. Kimura's own HQ and the establishments of Ba Maw and Subhas Bose left by land, covered by the action of 105 Mixed Brigade at Pegu and proceeded to [[Mawlamyine|Moulmein]].

On 1 May, a Gurkha parachute battalion was dropped on [[Battle of Elephant Point|Elephant Point]] and cleared Japanese coastal defence batteries at the mouth of the [[Rangoon River]]. The 26th Indian Division started to land the next day as the monsoon began and took over Rangoon, which had seen an orgy of looting and lawlessness since the Japanese had left. The leading troops of the 17th and 26th Indian divisions met at Hlegu, {{convert|28|mi|km}} north of Rangoon, on 6 May.

==Final operations==
{{Main|Battle of the Sittang Bend|}}
Following the capture of Rangoon, a new [[British Twelfth Army|Twelfth Army]] headquarters, commanded by Lieutenant General Stopford, was created from the XXXIII Indian Corps HQ to take control of the allied formations which were to remain in Burma, including IV Corps.

The remnants of the Japanese Burma Area Army remained in control of [[Tanintharyi Region|Tenasserim]] province. The Japanese Twenty-eighth Army, which had withdrawn from [[Arakan Province|Arakan]] and unsuccessfully resisted XXXIII Corps in the Irrawaddy valley, and the 105 Independent Brigade, were cut off in the [[Pegu Yomas]], a range of low jungle-covered hills between the Irrawaddy and Sittang rivers. They planned to break out and rejoin Burma Area Army. To cover this break-out, Kimura ordered Honda's Thirty-third Army to mount a diversionary offensive across the Sittang, although the entire army could muster the strength of barely a regiment. On 3 July, Honda's troops attacked British positions in the \"Sittang Bend\". On 10 July, after a battle for country which was almost entirely under chest-high water, both the Japanese and the 89th Indian Brigade withdrew.

Honda, pressed by Kimura and his chief of staff, Tanaka, had attacked too early. Sakurai's Twenty-eighth Army was not ready to start the break-out until 17 July. The break-out was a disaster. The British had captured the Japanese plans from an officer killed making a final reconnaissance,{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=506–507}} and had placed ambushes or artillery concentrations on the routes they were to use. Hundreds of men drowned trying to cross the swollen Sittang on improvised bamboo floats and rafts. Burmese guerrillas and bandits killed stragglers east of the river. The break-out cost the Japanese nearly 10,000 men, half the strength of Twenty-eighth Army. Some units of 105 Independent Brigade were almost entirely wiped out.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=524–525}} British and Indian casualties were minimal.

Fourteenth Army (now commanded by Lieutenant General [[Miles Dempsey]]) and XV Corps had returned to India to plan the next stage of the campaign to re-take south east Asia. A new corps, the [[Indian XXXIV Corps|XXXIV Corps]] under Lieutenant-General [[Ouvry Lindfield Roberts]], was raised and assigned to Fourteenth Army for further operations.

The next intended operation was to be an amphibious assault on the western coast of Malaya, codenamed [[Operation Zipper]]. The dropping of the atomic bombs forestalled ''Zipper'' but the operation was undertaken post-war as the quickest way of getting occupation troops into Malaya.
