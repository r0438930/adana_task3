They played in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], [[New Hampshire]], at the [[Verizon Wireless Arena]]. They were the AHL affiliate of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) [[Los Angeles Kings]] during the team's entire existence. For the [[2015\u201316 AHL season|2015\u201316 season]], the Monarchs traded places with the Kings' affiliate in the [[ECHL]], the [[Ontario Reign (ECHL)|Ontario Reign]]; the AHL franchise moved to [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], [[California]], and play at [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] where they became the new [[Ontario Reign (AHL)|Ontario Reign]], while the ECHL team moved to New Hampshire retaining the [[Manchester Monarchs (ECHL)|Manchester Monarchs]] name.\n\nThe Monarchs won their only [[Calder Cup]] in their final AHL season.\n\n==History==\nIn 1999,<ref name=\"bizapedia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bizapedia.com/de/MANCHESTER-HOCKEY-GROUP-LLC.html|title=Manchester Hockey Group, L.L.C. in Wilmington, DE - Bizapedia|publisher=bizapedia.com|accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> [[Howard Baldwin]] founded Manchester Hockey Group LLC, while in the process of moving a dormant AHL franchise to New Hampshire to start play in 2001.

The Monarchs played their first game on October 6, 2001, against the [[Lowell Lock Monsters]], losing 6\u20133. Their first win was a week later, on October 13, against the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]]. The team has been competitive within the division every year of its existence. They won their first Atlantic Division title in [[2004\u201305 AHL season|2004\u201305]], but lost in the first round to the [[Providence Bruins]]. This continued the streak of first round playoff exits, which the team had experienced in every year of existence, and would come to include the [[2005\u201306 AHL season|2005\u201306 season]].\n\nThe [[2006\u201307 AHL season|2006\u201307 campaign]] was the team's best season prior to [[2014\u201315 AHL season|2014\u201315]], the season in which the team won its only [[Calder Cup]] championship. With rookie head coach [[Mark Morris (ice hockey)|Mark Morris]], leading scorers [[Matt Moulson]] and [[Noah Clarke]], and former League MVP [[Jason LaBarbera]] in goal, the team had their best-ever finish, winning the Atlantic Division title with the second-best points total in the League.\n\nHeading into the playoffs, there were doubts within the team, as goaltender LaBarbera had ended the season injured. The team faced the [[Worcester Sharks]] in the first round. With LaBarbera coming back by Game 2, the Monarchs defeated the Sharks in six games, including double-overtime thrillers in Games 2 and 6. The second round brought the Providence Bruins, who put up as much, if not more, of a fight. The Monarchs found a way, however, and defeated the Bruins in six games. This brought the Monarchs to their first ever Eastern Conference Finals, but they were swept by the defending champions, the [[Hershey Bears]], in four games.\n\nFollowing their run in 2007, the Monarchs looked to have holes to fill, as Jason LaBarbera was called up to the Kings, along with several other players. The [[2007\u201308 AHL season|2007\u201308 season]] was an up-and-down one, which ended following a sweep by the Providence Bruins in the first round of the playoffs. The [[2008\u201309 AHL season|2008\u201309 season]] was a landmark year for the franchise, but not in the way they would hope. Despite a late surge, the team finished fifth, five points out of the playoffs, for the first time in franchise history.\n\nThe first half of the [[2009\u201310 AHL season|2009\u201310 season]] proved to be successful for the Monarchs squad. Several players were promoted to Los Angeles, including [[Richard Clune]] and [[Alec Martinez]]. The Monarchs won their home opener of the [[2010\u201311 AHL season|2010\u201311 season]], as [[David Meckler]] scored the game-winning goal in front of 9,035 fans at the Verizon Wireless Arena on October 16, 2010. The game was also noteworthy as left wing [[Brandon Kozun]] and center [[Justin Azevedo]] were awarded penalty shots, the first time in franchise history that two players were awarded penalty shots in the same game.\n\nThe Manchester Monarchs have made it to the playoffs all but one season since coming into existence, winning their first Calder Cup following the 2014\u201315 season.\n\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, the Monarchs ditched the purple and gold colors of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (and former Los Angeles Kings' colors) that had been with the team since its inception, and adopted the same black and silver color scheme that the Kings have used since 2011.\n\nOn January 29, 2015, it was confirmed by the AHL via press conference that the Monarchs would relocate from Manchester, New Hampshire, to Ontario, California. In return, the [[Ontario Reign (ECHL)|Ontario Reign]] of the [[ECHL]] would move to Manchester to become the new ECHL [[Manchester Monarchs (ECHL)|Manchester Monarchs]], the first ECHL team to play in [[New England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150131/SPORTS0702/150139900 |title=Manchester team will join ECHL, signs lease extension.  |publisher=Manchester Union-Leader |date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> The Monarchs finished the regular season winning the [[Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy]] with the best regular season record of the AHL<ref>[http://theahl.com/monarchs-wrap-up-kilpatrick-trophy-p197360 Monarchs wrap up Kilpatrick Trophy]</ref> and [[Brian O'Neill (ice hockey, born 1988)|Brian O'Neill]] receiving the [[Les Cunningham Award]] as Most Valuable Player.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theahl.com/monarchs-o-neill-voted-ahl-mvp-p197471 |title=Monarchs' O'Neill voted AHL MVP |publisher=AHL |date=April 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418012224/http://theahl.com/monarchs-o-neill-voted-ahl-mvp-p197471 |archivedate=April 18, 2015 }}</ref> The playoffs saw the Monarchs losing only three games among the Eastern teams, leading to the team's first [[Richard F.

The team, to play in the still under construction [[Verizon Wireless Arena]], was baptized Manchester Monarchs on November 13.<ref name=\"manchestermonarchs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestermonarchs.com/about/history/|title=manchestermonarchs.com: History|publisher=manchestermonarchs.com|accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the first game, two members of the Kings organization, [[Garnet Bailey]] and [[Mark Bavis]], were killed in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]] as they were going home back to Los Angeles after a scouting trip. The Monarchs played their first game on October 6, 2001, against the [[Lowell Lock Monsters]], losing 6\u20133. Their first win was a week later, on October 13, against the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]]. The team has been competitive within the division every year of its existence. They won their first Atlantic Division title in [[2004\u201305 AHL season|2004\u201305]], but lost in the first round to the [[Providence Bruins]]. This continued the streak of first round playoff exits, which the team had experienced in every year of existence, and would come to include the [[2005\u201306 AHL season|2005\u201306 season]].\n\nThe [[2006\u201307 AHL season|2006\u201307 campaign]] was the team's best season prior to [[2014\u201315 AHL season|2014\u201315]], the season in which the team won its only [[Calder Cup]] championship. With rookie head coach [[Mark Morris (ice hockey)|Mark Morris]], leading scorers [[Matt Moulson]] and [[Noah Clarke]], and former League MVP [[Jason LaBarbera]] in goal, the team had their best-ever finish, winning the Atlantic Division title with the second-best points total in the League.\n\nHeading into the playoffs, there were doubts within the team, as goaltender LaBarbera had ended the season injured. The team faced the [[Worcester Sharks]] in the first round. With LaBarbera coming back by Game 2, the Monarchs defeated the Sharks in six games, including double-overtime thrillers in Games 2 and 6. The second round brought the Providence Bruins, who put up as much, if not more, of a fight. The Monarchs found a way, however, and defeated the Bruins in six games. This brought the Monarchs to their first ever Eastern Conference Finals, but they were swept by the defending champions, the [[Hershey Bears]], in four games.\n\nFollowing their run in 2007, the Monarchs looked to have holes to fill, as Jason LaBarbera was called up to the Kings, along with several other players. The [[2007\u201308 AHL season|2007\u201308 season]] was an up-and-down one, which ended following a sweep by the Providence Bruins in the first round of the playoffs. The [[2008\u201309 AHL season|2008\u201309 season]] was a landmark year for the franchise, but not in the way they would hope. Despite a late surge, the team finished fifth, five points out of the playoffs, for the first time in franchise history.\n\nThe first half of the [[2009\u201310 AHL season|2009\u201310 season]] proved to be successful for the Monarchs squad. Several players were promoted to Los Angeles, including [[Richard Clune]] and [[Alec Martinez]]. The Monarchs won their home opener of the [[2010\u201311 AHL season|2010\u201311 season]], as [[David Meckler]] scored the game-winning goal in front of 9,035 fans at the Verizon Wireless Arena on October 16, 2010. The game was also noteworthy as left wing [[Brandon Kozun]] and center [[Justin Azevedo]] were awarded penalty shots, the first time in franchise history that two players were awarded penalty shots in the same game.\n\nThe Manchester Monarchs have made it to the playoffs all but one season since coming into existence, winning their first Calder Cup following the 2014\u201315 season.\n\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, the Monarchs ditched the purple and gold colors of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (and former Los Angeles Kings' colors) that had been with the team since its inception, and adopted the same black and silver color scheme that the Kings have used since 2011.\n\nOn January 29, 2015, it was confirmed by the AHL via press conference that the Monarchs would relocate from Manchester, New Hampshire, to Ontario, California. In return, the [[Ontario Reign (ECHL)|Ontario Reign]] of the [[ECHL]] would move to Manchester to become the new ECHL [[Manchester Monarchs (ECHL)|Manchester Monarchs]], the first ECHL team to play in [[New England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150131/SPORTS0702/150139900 |title=Manchester team will join ECHL, signs lease extension.  |publisher=Manchester Union-Leader |date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> The Monarchs finished the regular season winning the [[Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy]] with the best regular season record of the AHL<ref>[http://theahl.com/monarchs-wrap-up-kilpatrick-trophy-p197360 Monarchs wrap up Kilpatrick Trophy]</ref> and [[Brian O'Neill (ice hockey, born 1988)|Brian O'Neill]] receiving the [[Les Cunningham Award]] as Most Valuable Player.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theahl.com/monarchs-o-neill-voted-ahl-mvp-p197471 |title=Monarchs' O'Neill voted AHL MVP |publisher=AHL |date=April 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418012224/http://theahl.com/monarchs-o-neill-voted-ahl-mvp-p197471 |archivedate=April 18, 2015 }}</ref> The playoffs saw the Monarchs losing only three games among the Eastern teams, leading to the team's first [[Richard F.
