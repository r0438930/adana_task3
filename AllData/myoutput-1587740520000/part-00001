It was written by [[Alex Borstein]] and directed by Greg Colton. Appalled at parking charges introduced by [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]], [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] decides to expose the corruption of the Mayor, despite the prospect of potentially destroying [[Meg Griffin|Meg]]'s new career as the Mayor's intern. Meanwhile, Peter and Lois decide to participate in the Quahog community talent show with a [[folk music|folk singing]] act, as they did in the 1980s, but the couple becomes largely reliant on [[marijuana]] for inspiration and eventually fail the competition for their poor performance, despite their beliefs they were singing well when under the influence of the drugs.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074gbk|title=Deep Throats|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Meg Griffin|Meg]] is employed as an intern for [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] after doing an interview with him. The family is impressed by this news, and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] feels pressured that he is becoming the \"new Meg\" due to him not having a job. Brian decides to become a [[taxicab driver]], but soon becomes intent on exposing the corruption of Mayor West after receiving a $400 parking ticket for parking his taxi in a handicapped zone. When discussing his corruption beliefs with Meg, she argues that Mayor West is a nice person and that Brian should drop it. [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], after learning of Brian's intentions, decides to help. After meeting in a parking lot with a whistleblower, [[Kermit the Frog]], Brian discovers where Mayor West will be that night, and follows him to a motel with Stewie.\n\nSpying on West through the motel wall, they discover he's in a romantic relationship with Meg. Seeing this as an ideal opportunity to take West down, Brian photographs the two together in romantic scenes and threatens to reveal them to the press. After Meg finds out, she confronts West, who says he and Meg should separate due to the negative press which will follow - because even though he's used to it, he does not want Meg's life to be ruined, stating how much he really cares about her. They separate, with Mayor West telling Meg that even though he's leaving her, he'll always love her. Brian, having secretly heard this, realizes he has made a mistake, destroys the images, and apologizes to Meg that he lost sight of what was really important. His taxicab, however, is destroyed by [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]], believing Brian refused to give him a ride.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter and Lois decide to participate in a community [[talent show]] with a [[folk music|folk-singing]] act they did in the 1980s. They have a hard time, however, writing new songs and start to smoke [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] for inspiration, annoying the family. At one point, Peter eats a piece of his guitar, and him and Lois lie on the sofa naked in front of Brian and Stewie. At the show, they initially appear to wow the entire crowd with their performance, but, later, they realize that they lost. [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] explains that they were completely high and they just shouted \"Aah!\" to the crowd while plodding chords on the guitar and he then preaches the dangers of marijuana to Lois and Peter.\n\n==Production==\nIt was originally intended for [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] to beat Meg up when she is applying for a job within his office, but the scene was never used.<ref name=\"Colton\">{{cite video | people=Colton, Greg|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The clay cars sketch was not animated by the regular show producers, rather it was drawn by Eileen Colehep, a woman who attended college with show producer [[Seth MacFarlane]].<ref name=\"MacFarlane\">{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The voice of [[List of Family Guy characters#Citizens of Quahog|Bruce the performance artist]] was performed by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], and was originally scheduled to last longer,<ref name=\"Borstein\">{{cite video | people=Borstein, Alex|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name=\"Kunis\">{{cite video | people=Kunis, Mila|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> but it was reduced for unknown reasons.<ref name=\"Colton\"/> The concept behind the storyline of Peter and Lois performing in [[Public house|pubs]] when they were younger relates to MacFarlane's father, who used to do stage performances in bars. When he was performing, the woman who was to be MacFarlane's mother, came into the bar and tracked his father down, asking for guitar lessons once she had found him.<ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/> The song which Peter and Lois were singing when remembering their performances they hosted in their earlier years was created by Alec Sulkin and Patrick Megan, producers of ''Family Guy''.<ref name=\"Borstein\"/> [[Alex Borstein]], voice actor of [[Lois Griffin]] had originally wanted Meg to be wearing a business outfit in the episode during her employment by Mayor West, but it was not used.<ref name=\"Borstein\"/><ref name=\"Kunis\"/>\n\n[[File:Alex Borstein by Gage Skidmore 4 (retouched).jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=A woman with black hair laughs, as she is speaking into a microphone.|Alex Borstein wrote the episode.]]\nThe episode marks the first time in the series that Stewie has expressed an attraction for Brian.<ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kunis\"/> The name of Peter and Lois' band was originally intended to be \"[[Fellatio|Mouthful of Peter]],\" but broadcasting standards insisted that the show producers change the name to \"[[Handjob|Handful of Peter]].\"<ref name=\"Colton\"/><ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/> In response to this, MacFarlane comments that \"a handjob is more acceptable than a blowjob.\"<ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/> When performing for the Quahog Talent Competition, one of the lyrics to Peter and Lois' song was scheduled to be \"God would do her from behind, even do it a second time,\" but it was never used.<ref name=\"Colton\"/><ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/> Sound mixer Patrick Clark organized the format of the credits, which were different from the regular set.<ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Clark\">{{cite video | people=Clark, patrick|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nPeter singing [https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162718/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQyib5ZQZY \"Ding Fries are Done\"] was shortened for the televised version of the episode, with an extended version on the DVD.<ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/> [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] sticking his middle finger up to Brian after he fails to stop in his taxi was allowed on the televised version of the episode.

Should I let him in?\" was censored from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] airings, as it is a reference to [[anal sex]],<ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/> but remains intact on ''Adult Swim'' and ''TBS'' airings.\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, voice actors [[H. Jon Benjamin]] and [[Frank Welker]], and actress [[Kate Jackson]] guest starred in the episode. Recurring voice actors [[Lori Alan]], [[Ralph Garman]], and [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], writers [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]], [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], and John Viener, and actor [[Adam West]], who portrays [[Mayor West|an exaggerated version of himself]], also made minor appearances.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe episode takes its title from a scene when an anonymous informant (later revealed to be [[Kermit the Frog]]) secretly meets Brian in an underground parking lot. Brian calls the informant \"Deep Throat,\" in a reference to the anonymous informant [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]. The meeting itself is a reference to the meeting with Deep Throat or to the [[1976 in film|1976]] film ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]''. The part-time job Peter had wherein he sings a song \"Ding Fries are Done,\" was based on a song that was popularized by [[Doctor Demento]] in the 1990s concerning [[Burger King]],<ref name=\"Colton\"/><ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/> and is a parody of the popular Christmas song \"[[Carol of the Bells]]\".<ref>[http://carols.co/carol-of-the-bells/ Carol of the Bells] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622145354/http://carols.net/carol-of-the-bells |date=2013-06-22 }}, Sean Spurr, Carols.co.</ref><ref>http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2011/12/ding_fries_are_done_funny_chri.html</ref> The [[Noid]] attempting to ruin Mayor West's pizza is a reference to the Noid from former [[Domino's Pizza]] television advertisements. The scene where Cleveland runs off as a black panther when he notices Meg and Brian looking at him as he destroys Brian's cab with a crowbar is a reference to [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Black or White]]\" second ending known as the Black or White Panther Dance. Stewie references his cousin, [[Tom Cruise|Stewie Cruise]], showing him jumping up and down on [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]]'s couch while shouting \"I'm in love with [[Katie Holmes]]! I'm not gay!\" When Lois mentions to Peter that it would be fun to be in the community talent show, Stewie says \"You know what else is fun? Watching ''[[Mr. Belvedere]]'' without people talking so loudly!\". He then proceeds to sing the theme song loudly. When Peter is being driven around by Brian, he refers to him as Bitterman, a reference to the chauffeur in the 1981 film ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]''. The song Mayor West and Meg are listening to in the hotel together is the theme song to ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' from the 1987 series. In the DVD version of the episode, Stewie and Brian bump into [[Scooby-Doo]] and the gang from ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?]]''. [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] and Stewie argue about who got to City Hall first, but then Stewie sends them off by humming a familiar tune.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Family_Guy/Season_4#Deep_Throats_.5B4.23.5D|Deep Throats}}\n{{Portal|Television}}\n*{{imdb episode|0789409}}\n*{{tv.com episode|family-guy/deep-throats-664905}}\n\n{{Family Guy (season 4)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deep Throats}}\n[[Category:2006 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television episodes about cannabis]]\n[[Category:Family Guy (season 4) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Deep Throat (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title        =Deep Throats\n| series       =Family Guy\n| image        =\n| caption      = \n| season       =4\n| episode      =23\n| airdate      =April 9, 2006\n| production   =4ACX26\n| writer       =[[Alex Borstein]]\n| director     =Greg Colton\n| guests       =*[[H.
