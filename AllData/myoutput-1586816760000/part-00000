Each circuit comprises several congregations in a geographical area. These are held either in Assembly Halls owned by Jehovah's Witnesses, or in rented facilities, such as public auditoriums. Once a year, Jehovah's Witnesses gather at larger assemblies called \"Regional Conventions\" which are usually three days long (Friday to Sunday). These conventions consist primarily of Bible-based sermons, including demonstrations and experiences of their preaching work. They also often feature video presentations and live, full-costume dramatic plays re-enacting biblical accounts\u2014such as [[Moses]] and the [[Plagues of Egypt]], and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]\u2014or contemporary settings based on biblical principles. Every few years, \"International Conventions\" are held in selected cities, with visiting delegates from other countries.

Between 1924 and 1957, the organization operated a radio station, WBBR, from New York. Since 2011, the Witnesses have engaged in \"public witnessing\" in metropolitan districts and fairs using tables, carts, and literature displays.

Their primary journal, ''The Watchtower'' <!---and ''Awake!'', are--->is published simultaneously in nearly two hundred languages and, along with ''Awake!'', available in audio and electronic formats.

He said they typically spoke of their conversion experience as a steady progression of mental states in which Witnesses \"'work for' their conversion by a methodical confrontation with intellectual obstacles and by a deliberate programme of self-reform. Conversion is not represented as something which ''happened'' to them; it is framed as something that they ''achieved''.\" Beckford noted that those he interviewed regarded sudden, emotional upheavals in religious consciousness as suspect: \"Experiences which smack of sudden or idiosyncratic illumination/revelation cannot be reconcilable with either the tenor of God's historical practice or the nature of his special covenant with the Watchtower Society.\"\n\nHe also found a striking contrast with other churches in the common attribution of responsibility for conversion to \"a spiritual guide ... the person who acted as the intermediary with the Watchtower movement and who supervised the initial process of learning and reforming\". Beckford cited an interview \"representative of many\" in which a convert recalled initially resisting the Watch Tower Society's teachings until he was \"talked into making a serious study of the scriptures ... I had plenty of objections and was sure the Witnesses were wrong, but (the Witness leading the personal Bible study sessions) showed me how the facts of the Bible could not be faulted\".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Beckford | first = James A. |  title = Accounting for Conversion | journal = British Journal of Sociology | volume = 29 | issue = June 1978 | pages =251\u2013256 | publisher = London School of Economics and Political Science | location = London | date = June 1978 |  jstor =589892 }}</ref>\n\n==Ministers and ordination==\nJehovah's Witnesses consider as \"[[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]]\" all adherents who have been approved to engage in formal evangelizing.

These conventions consist primarily of Bible-based sermons, including demonstrations and experiences of their preaching work.

He said they typically spoke of their conversion experience as a steady progression of mental states in which Witnesses \"'work for' their conversion by a methodical confrontation with intellectual obstacles and by a deliberate programme of self-reform. Conversion is not represented as something which ''happened'' to them; it is framed as something that they ''achieved''.\" Beckford noted that those he interviewed regarded sudden, emotional upheavals in religious consciousness as suspect: \"Experiences which smack of sudden or idiosyncratic illumination/revelation cannot be reconcilable with either the tenor of God's historical practice or the nature of his special covenant with the Watchtower Society.\"\n\nHe also found a striking contrast with other churches in the common attribution of responsibility for conversion to \"a spiritual guide ... the person who acted as the intermediary with the Watchtower movement and who supervised the initial process of learning and reforming\". Beckford cited an interview \"representative of many\" in which a convert recalled initially resisting the Watch Tower Society's teachings until he was \"talked into making a serious study of the scriptures ... I had plenty of objections and was sure the Witnesses were wrong, but (the Witness leading the personal Bible study sessions) showed me how the facts of the Bible could not be faulted\".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Beckford | first = James A. |  title = Accounting for Conversion | journal = British Journal of Sociology | volume = 29 | issue = June 1978 | pages =251\u2013256 | publisher = London School of Economics and Political Science | location = London | date = June 1978 |  jstor =589892 }}</ref>\n\n==Ministers and ordination==\nJehovah's Witnesses consider as \"[[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]]\" all adherents who have been approved to engage in formal evangelizing.

If the sin is known generally by the entire congregation or the community, an announcement is made informing the congregation that the person has been reproved. Later, without disclosing names or private details, one of the elders gives a separate talk ensuring that the congregation understands the sin, its dangers, and how to avoid it.<ref>\u201cRepentance Leading Back to God\u201d, ''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1981, p. 27 par. 30.</ref> Reproved individuals have some congregation privileges restricted, until the elders decide that the member has regained \"spiritual strength.\"<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'', March 1975, p. 4.</ref><ref>\"Reproofs Are the Way of Life\", ''The Watchtower'', November 15, 1977 p. 691.</ref> Restrictions may include not sharing in meeting parts, not commenting at meeting parts, and not praying for a group.

He should not hurt or mistreat his family in any way. The father should be hard-working in providing necessities to his family. He must also provide for them in a spiritual capacity. This includes religious instruction for the family, and taking the lead in preaching activities. Parental discipline for children should not be in a harsh, cruel way. Children are instructed to obey their parents.\n\nMarried couples are encouraged to speak with local elders if they are having problems.

Donation boxes labeled for several purposes are located in Kingdom Halls and other meeting facilities. Generally there are contribution boxes for local operating expenses, a Kingdom Hall fund for helping Witnesses around the world to build Kingdom Halls, and a general fund for the \"Worldwide Work\", which includes the printing of literature, organization of conventions, supporting missionaries and disaster relief, and other operating expenses of the organization.<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, December 2003, p. 7</ref><ref>\u201cA New Program for Kingdom Hall Construction\u201d, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, September 1983, p. 4-5.</ref>\n\nThe accounts (including donations) and the financial operation of the local congregation are reviewed monthly and posted on a congregation notice board.
