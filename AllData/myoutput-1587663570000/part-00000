Some focus on [[porting]] games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do software development work in addition to games.\n\nMost [[video game publisher]]s maintain development studios (such as [[Electronic Arts]]'s [[EA Canada]], [[Square Enix]]'s studios, [[Activision]]'s [[Radical Entertainment]], [[Nintendo EAD]] and Sony's [[Polyphony Digital]] and [[Naughty Dog]]). However, since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as \"publishers\" rather than \"developers\". Developers may be private as well (such as how [[Bungie]] was, the company which developed the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]] exclusive to Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]).\n\n==Types==\n\n===First-party developer===\nIn the [[video game industry]], a first-party developer is part of a company which manufactures a [[video game console]] and develops exclusively for it. First-party developers may use the name of the company itself (such as [[Nintendo]]), have a specific division name (such as [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony's]] [[Polyphony Digital]]) or have been an independent studio before being acquired by the console manufacturer (such as [[Rare (company)|Rare]] or [[Naughty Dog]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Ahmed|first=Shahed |title=Naughty Dog discusses being acquired by Sony|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-discusses-being-acquired-by-sony/1100-2677654/|website=GameSpot}}</ref> Whether by purchasing an independent studio or by founding a new team, the acquisition of a first-party developer involves a huge [[financial investment]] on the part of the console manufacturer, which is wasted if the developer fails to produce a hit game in a timely manner.<ref name=NGen30>{{cite magazine |title=Is Your Favorite Game Company Ripping You Off? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997|pages=39\u201340 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n40}}</ref> However, using first-party developers saves the cost of having to make royalty payments on a game's profits.<ref name=NGen30/>\n\n===Second-party developer===\nSecond-party developer is a colloquial term often used by gaming enthusiasts and media to describe game studios who take development contracts from platform holders and produce games exclusive to that platform.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Second Party|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=40}}</ref> As a balance to not being able to release their game for other platforms, second-party developers are usually offered higher royalty rates than third-party developers.<ref name=NGen30/> These studios may have exclusive publishing agreements (or other business relationships) with the platform holder, but maintain independence so upon completion or termination of their contracts are able to continue developing games. Examples are [[Insomniac Games]] (originally a 2nd party for Sony), [[Remedy Entertainment]] (originally a 2nd party for Microsoft) and [[Game Freak]] (a 2nd party for Nintendo).\n\n===Third-party developers===\n{{Anchor|Third-party developers|3rd-party developers}}\n{{see also|Third-party software component}}\n\nA third-party developer may also publish games, or work for a video game publisher to develop a title. Both publisher and developer have considerable input in the game's [[Game design|design]] and content. However, the publisher's wishes generally override those of the developer.\n\nThe business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a [[contract]], which specifies a list of [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] intended to be delivered over a period of time. By updating its milestones, the publisher verifies that work is progressing quickly enough to meet its deadline and can direct the developer if the game is not meeting expectations. When each milestone is completed (and accepted), the publisher pays the developer an advance on [[royalties]]. Successful developers may maintain several teams working on different games for different publishers. Generally, however, third-party developers tend to be small, close-knit teams. Third-party game development is a volatile sector, since small developers may be dependent on income from a single publisher; one canceled game may be devastating to a small developer. Because of this, many small development companies are short-lived.\n\nA common [[exit strategy]] for a successful video-game developer is to sell the company to a publisher, becoming an in-house developer. In-house development teams tend to have more freedom in the design and content of a game compared to third-party developers. One reason is that since the developers are employees of the publisher, their interests are aligned with those of the publisher; the publisher may spend less effort ensuring that the developer's decisions do not enrich the developer at the publisher's expense.\n\n[[Activision]] in 1979 became the first third-party video game developer,<ref name=\"mj19821226\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nwsdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QX8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3635%2C1989311 | title=Stream of video games is endless | work=Milwaukee Journal | date=1982-12-26 | accessdate=10 January 2015 | pages=Business 1}}</ref> where the term \"second-party\" originally referred to the consumers.\n\nIn recent years, larger publishers have acquired several third-party developers. While these development teams are now technically \"in-house\", they often continue to operate in an autonomous manner (with their own culture and work practices). For example, Activision acquired [[Raven Software|Raven]] (1997); [[Neversoft]] (1999), which merged with [[Infinity Ward]] in 2014; [[Z-Axis]] (2001); [[Treyarch]] (2001); [[Luxoflux]] (2002); [[Shaba Games|Shaba]] (2002); [[Infinity Ward]] (2003) and [[Vicarious Visions]] (2005). All these developers continue operating much as they did before acquisition, the primary differences being exclusivity and financial details. Publishers tend to be more forgiving of their own development teams going over budget (or missing deadlines) than third-party developers.\n\nA developer may not be the primary entity creating a piece of software, usually providing an external software tool which helps organize (or use) information for the primary software product. Such tools may be a [[database]], [[Voice over IP]], or add-in [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] software; this is also known as [[middleware]]. Examples of this include [[SpeedTree]] and [[Havok (software)|Havoc]].\n\n===Indie game developers===\n{{See also|Indie game|Independent video game development}}\nIndependents are software developers which are not owned by (or dependent on) a single publisher. Some of these developers self-publish their games, relying on the [[Internet]] and word of mouth for publicity. Without the large marketing budgets of mainstream publishers, their products may receive less recognition than those of larger publishers such as Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo. With the advent of digital distribution of inexpensive games on game consoles, it is now possible for indie game developers to forge agreements with console manufacturers for broad distribution of their games.\n\nOther indie game developers create game software for a number of video-game publishers on several gaming platforms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In recent years this model has been in decline; larger publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision, increasingly turn to internal studios (usually former independent developers acquired for their development needs).<ref>https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130449/the_end_game_how_top_developers_.php</ref>\n\n==Quality of life==\nVideo game development is usually conducted in a casual business environment, with T-shirts and sandals common work attire.

The creative rewards of work in the entertainment business attracts [[Workforce|labor]] to the industry, creating a competitive [[labor market]] which demands a high level of commitment and performance from employees. Industry communities, such as the [[International Game Developers Association]] (IGDA), are conducting increasing discussions about the problem; they are concerned that working conditions in the industry cause significant deterioration in its employees' quality of life.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.igda.org/articles/erobinson_crunch.php |title = Why Crunch Mode Doesn't Work: Six Lessons|website = [[IGDA]]|last = Robinson|first = Evan|date = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://push.cx/2009/the-game-industry|title = The Game Industry |website= Push.cox|last = Harkins|first = Peter Bhat|date = 5 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n===\"Crunch time\"===\n{{anchor|Crunch time}}\nSome video game developers (such as [[Electronic Arts]]) have been accused of the excessive invocation of \"crunch time\".<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cnet.com/news/no-fun-for-game-developers/|title = No fun for game developers?|work= [[CNet News]]|last = Frauenheim|first =Ed|date = 11 November 2004}}</ref> \"Crunch time\" is the point at which the team is thought to be failing to achieve milestones needed to launch a game on schedule.

Some focus on [[porting]] games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do software development work in addition to games.\n\nMost [[video game publisher]]s maintain development studios (such as [[Electronic Arts]]'s [[EA Canada]], [[Square Enix]]'s studios, [[Activision]]'s [[Radical Entertainment]], [[Nintendo EAD]] and Sony's [[Polyphony Digital]] and [[Naughty Dog]]). However, since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as \"publishers\" rather than \"developers\". Developers may be private as well (such as how [[Bungie]] was, the company which developed the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]] exclusive to Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]).\n\n==Types==\n\n===First-party developer===\nIn the [[video game industry]], a first-party developer is part of a company which manufactures a [[video game console]] and develops exclusively for it. First-party developers may use the name of the company itself (such as [[Nintendo]]), have a specific division name (such as [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony's]] [[Polyphony Digital]]) or have been an independent studio before being acquired by the console manufacturer (such as [[Rare (company)|Rare]] or [[Naughty Dog]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Ahmed|first=Shahed |title=Naughty Dog discusses being acquired by Sony|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-discusses-being-acquired-by-sony/1100-2677654/|website=GameSpot}}</ref> Whether by purchasing an independent studio or by founding a new team, the acquisition of a first-party developer involves a huge [[financial investment]] on the part of the console manufacturer, which is wasted if the developer fails to produce a hit game in a timely manner.<ref name=NGen30>{{cite magazine |title=Is Your Favorite Game Company Ripping You Off? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997|pages=39\u201340 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n40}}</ref> However, using first-party developers saves the cost of having to make royalty payments on a game's profits.<ref name=NGen30/>\n\n===Second-party developer===\nSecond-party developer is a colloquial term often used by gaming enthusiasts and media to describe game studios who take development contracts from platform holders and produce games exclusive to that platform.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Second Party|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=40}}</ref> As a balance to not being able to release their game for other platforms, second-party developers are usually offered higher royalty rates than third-party developers.<ref name=NGen30/> These studios may have exclusive publishing agreements (or other business relationships) with the platform holder, but maintain independence so upon completion or termination of their contracts are able to continue developing games. Examples are [[Insomniac Games]] (originally a 2nd party for Sony), [[Remedy Entertainment]] (originally a 2nd party for Microsoft) and [[Game Freak]] (a 2nd party for Nintendo).\n\n===Third-party developers===\n{{Anchor|Third-party developers|3rd-party developers}}\n{{see also|Third-party software component}}\n\nA third-party developer may also publish games, or work for a video game publisher to develop a title. Both publisher and developer have considerable input in the game's [[Game design|design]] and content. However, the publisher's wishes generally override those of the developer.\n\nThe business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a [[contract]], which specifies a list of [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] intended to be delivered over a period of time. By updating its milestones, the publisher verifies that work is progressing quickly enough to meet its deadline and can direct the developer if the game is not meeting expectations. When each milestone is completed (and accepted), the publisher pays the developer an advance on [[royalties]]. Successful developers may maintain several teams working on different games for different publishers. Generally, however, third-party developers tend to be small, close-knit teams. Third-party game development is a volatile sector, since small developers may be dependent on income from a single publisher; one canceled game may be devastating to a small developer. Because of this, many small development companies are short-lived.\n\nA common [[exit strategy]] for a successful video-game developer is to sell the company to a publisher, becoming an in-house developer. In-house development teams tend to have more freedom in the design and content of a game compared to third-party developers. One reason is that since the developers are employees of the publisher, their interests are aligned with those of the publisher; the publisher may spend less effort ensuring that the developer's decisions do not enrich the developer at the publisher's expense.\n\n[[Activision]] in 1979 became the first third-party video game developer,<ref name=\"mj19821226\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nwsdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QX8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3635%2C1989311 | title=Stream of video games is endless | work=Milwaukee Journal | date=1982-12-26 | accessdate=10 January 2015 | pages=Business 1}}</ref> where the term \"second-party\" originally referred to the consumers.\n\nIn recent years, larger publishers have acquired several third-party developers. While these development teams are now technically \"in-house\", they often continue to operate in an autonomous manner (with their own culture and work practices). For example, Activision acquired [[Raven Software|Raven]] (1997); [[Neversoft]] (1999), which merged with [[Infinity Ward]] in 2014; [[Z-Axis]] (2001); [[Treyarch]] (2001); [[Luxoflux]] (2002); [[Shaba Games|Shaba]] (2002); [[Infinity Ward]] (2003) and [[Vicarious Visions]] (2005). All these developers continue operating much as they did before acquisition, the primary differences being exclusivity and financial details. Publishers tend to be more forgiving of their own development teams going over budget (or missing deadlines) than third-party developers.\n\nA developer may not be the primary entity creating a piece of software, usually providing an external software tool which helps organize (or use) information for the primary software product. Such tools may be a [[database]], [[Voice over IP]], or add-in [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] software; this is also known as [[middleware]]. Examples of this include [[SpeedTree]] and [[Havok (software)|Havoc]].\n\n===Indie game developers===\n{{See also|Indie game|Independent video game development}}\nIndependents are software developers which are not owned by (or dependent on) a single publisher. Some of these developers self-publish their games, relying on the [[Internet]] and word of mouth for publicity. Without the large marketing budgets of mainstream publishers, their products may receive less recognition than those of larger publishers such as Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo. With the advent of digital distribution of inexpensive games on game consoles, it is now possible for indie game developers to forge agreements with console manufacturers for broad distribution of their games.\n\nOther indie game developers create game software for a number of video-game publishers on several gaming platforms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In recent years this model has been in decline; larger publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision, increasingly turn to internal studios (usually former independent developers acquired for their development needs).<ref>https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130449/the_end_game_how_top_developers_.php</ref>\n\n==Quality of life==\nVideo game development is usually conducted in a casual business environment, with T-shirts and sandals common work attire.

The creative rewards of work in the entertainment business attracts [[Workforce|labor]] to the industry, creating a competitive [[labor market]] which demands a high level of commitment and performance from employees.
