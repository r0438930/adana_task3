An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].\n\nAfter war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. \n\nHis death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    \n\nA reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}\n\n==Biographical==\n[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]\nJohn Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  \n\nThe Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}\n\nIn 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children.

It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  \n[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]\nHe financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} \n\nRather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us?

''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9\u201316</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.\n\n===Committee work===\nDuring these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.\n\nWhen the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).\n\n===Short Parliament===\nIn the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.\n\n===Long Parliament===\nIn the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.\n\nHampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.\n\n===Debate on episcopacy===\n[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]\n\nThere was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.\n\nNo serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:\n*an attack upon religion and\n*an attack upon the fundamental laws.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.\n\n==English Civil War==\n\nWhen the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642\u20131644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.\n\nBut it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]\n\nOn the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\".

Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford.

During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265.

him a national figure. An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].\n\nAfter war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. \n\nHis death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    \n\nA reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}\n\n==Biographical==\n[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]\nJohn Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  \n\nThe Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}\n\nIn 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children. Seven survived into adulthood Ann (1616-1701), Elizabeth (1619-1643), John (1621-1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628-1687), Mary (1630-1689), and [[Richard_Hampden|Richard]] (1631-1695), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[William III of England|William III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hampden |url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Hampden-Patriae-Pater/6000000003266399664 |website=Geni.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591-1666); they had no children.   \n\n==Career==\nIn 1610, he graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; as legal training was then considered part of a gentleman's education, he attended the [[Inner Temple]] from 1613 to 1615. \n\nThe Hampden family were [[Puritan]]s, a term then used for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the [[Church of England]]. It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  \n[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]\nHe financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} \n\nRather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us? If he be no papist, papists are friends and kindred to him.\"{{sfn|Keeler|Janssen Cole|1997|pp=121-122}}}} The two published [[sermons]], supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]; although censured for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]].{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} \n\nand in 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640\n\nIn April 1640 he was elected MP for [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] in the [[Short Parliament]] and was re-elected MP for Buckinghamshire for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229\u2013239}}</ref> He sat until his death in 1643.\n\nIn the early days of his parliamentary career, he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], as in its later days he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Pym]] and to be commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].\n\n\n\n===Views on ship money===\nSomething of Hampden's fame no doubt is owing to the position which he took up as the opponent of [[ship money]].<ref>Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9\u201316</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.\n\n===Committee work===\nDuring these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.\n\nWhen the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).\n\n===Short Parliament===\nIn the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.\n\n===Long Parliament===\nIn the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.\n\nHampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.\n\n===Debate on episcopacy===\n[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]\n\nThere was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.\n\nNo serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:\n*an attack upon religion and\n*an attack upon the fundamental laws.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.\n\n==English Civil War==\n\nWhen the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642\u20131644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.\n\nBut it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]\n\nOn the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\".

Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford.

During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265.
