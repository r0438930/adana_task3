Although Judaism as a religion first appears in Greek records during the [[Hellenistic period]] (323 BCE \u2013 31 BCE) and the earliest mention of [[Israelites|Israel]] is inscribed on the [[Merneptah Stele]] dated 1213\u20131203 BCE, religious literature tells the story of Israelites going back at least as far as c. 1500 BCE. The [[Jewish diaspora]] began with the [[Assyrian captivity]] and continued on a much larger scale with the [[Babylonian captivity]]. Jews were also widespread throughout the [[Roman Empire]], and this carried on to a lesser extent in the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule in the central and eastern [[Mediterranean]]. In 638 CE the Byzantine Empire lost control of the Levant. The Arab [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] under [[Caliph Omar]] conquered [[Jerusalem]] and the lands of [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Syria|Syria]], Palestine and Egypt. The [[Golden Age of Jewish culture in Spain]] coincided with the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, a period of [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] throughout much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. During that time, Jews were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed.\n\nDuring the Classical Ottoman period (1300\u20131600), the Jews, together with most other communities of the empire, enjoyed a certain level of prosperity. In the 17th century, there were many significant Jewish populations in Western Europe. During the period of the [[European Renaissance]] and Enlightenment, significant changes occurred within the Jewish community. Jews began in the 18th century to campaign for emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider European society. During the 1870s and 1880s the Jewish population in Europe began to more actively discuss emigration back to Israel and the re-establishment of the Jewish Nation in its national homeland. The Zionist movement was founded officially in 1897. Meanwhile, the Jews of Europe and the United States gained success in the fields of science, culture and the economy. Among those generally considered the most famous were scientist [[Albert Einstein]] and philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Many [[Nobel Prize]] winners at this time were Jewish, as is still the case.<ref name=\"Jewish Nobel Prize Winners\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Nobel_Prizes.html|title=Jewish Nobel Prize Winners|publisher=jinfo.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1933, with the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], the Jewish situation became more severe. Economic crises, racial [[Antisemitism in Europe#The Holocaust|anti-Semitic laws]], and a fear of an upcoming war led many Jews to flee from Europe to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], to the United States and to the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1939 [[World War II]] began and until 1941 Hitler [[German-occupied Europe|occupied almost all of Europe]], including [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Poland]]\u2014where millions of Jews were living at that time\u2014and [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|France]]. In 1941, following the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the Soviet Union, the [[Final Solution]] began, an extensive organized operation on an unprecedented scale, aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people, and resulting in the persecution and murder of Jews in political Europe, inclusive of European [[North Africa]] ([[French protectorate in Morocco|pro-Nazi]] [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-[[French protectorate of Tunisia|North]] [[French Algeria|Africa]] and [[Italian Libya]]). This [[genocide]], in which approximately six million Jews were methodically exterminated, is known as [[the Holocaust]] or ''Shoah'' (Hebrew term). In Poland, three million Jews were killed in [[gas chambers]] in all concentration camps combined, with one million at the [[Auschwitz]] camp complex alone.\n\nIn 1945 the Jewish resistance organizations in Palestine unified and established the Jewish Resistance Movement, which attacked the British authorities. David Ben-Gurion proclaimed on May 14, 1948, the establishment of a [[Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel]] to be known as the [[State of Israel]]. Immediately afterwards all neighbouring Arab states attacked, yet the newly formed IDF resisted. In 1949 the war ended and the state of Israel started building the state and absorbing massive waves of hundreds of thousands of Jews from all over the world. Today (2019), [[Israel]] is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with a population of over 9 million people, of whom about 7 million are [[Israeli Jews|Jewish]]. The largest Jewish communities are in Israel and the [[American Jews|United States]], with major communities in France, Argentina, Russia, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and [[History of the Jews in Germany|Germany]]. For statistics related to modern Jewish demographics see ''[[Jewish population]]''.\n\n==Time periods in Jewish history==\nThe history of the Jews and Judaism can be divided into five periods: (1) ancient Israel before Judaism, from the beginnings to 586 BCE; (2) the beginning of Judaism in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE;{{clarify|reason=This looks like accidentally poor wording. As written, the entirety of the Second Temple period is left out of this timeline.|date=June 2017}} (3) the formation of [[rabbinic Judaism]] after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE; (4) the age of rabbinic Judaism, from the ascension of [[Christianity]] to political power under the [[emperor Constantine the Great]] in 312 CE to the end of the political hegemony of Christianity in the 18th century; and (5), the age of diverse Judaisms, from the French and American Revolutions to the present.{{sfn|Neusner|1992|p=4}}\n\n<imagemap>\nFile:Chronology of Israel eng.png|center|760px\ndefault [[#Time periods in Jewish history|Jewish history]]\nrect 658 156 833 176 [[Aliyah|Periods of massive immigration to the land of Israel]]\nrect 564 156 647 175 [[Jewish diaspora|Periods in which the majority of Jews lived in exile]]\nrect 460 156 554 175 [[Land of Israel|Periods in which the majority of Jews lived in the land of Israel, with full or partial independence]]\nrect 314 156 452 175 [[Temple in Jerusalem|Periods in which a Jewish Temple existed]]\nrect 196 156 309 175 [[#Time periods in Jewish history|Jewish history]]\nrect 26 102 134 122 [[Book of Judges|Shoftim]]\nrect 134 102 265 121 [[Books of Kings|Melakhim]]\nrect 146 83 266 104 [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]]\nrect 286 83 418 103 [[Second Temple of Jerusalem|Second Temple]]\nrect 341 103 392 121 [[Zugot]]\nrect 393 103 453 121 [[Tannaim]]\nrect 452 102 534 221 [[Amoraim]]\nrect 534 102 560 121 [[Savoraim]]\nrect 559 103 691 121 [[Geonim]]\nrect 691 102 825 121 [[Rishonim]]\nrect 825 100 940 120 [[Acharonim]]\nrect 939 94 959 120 [[Aliyah|Aliyot]]\nrect 957 65 975 121 [[Israel]]\nrect 940 62 958 94 [[The Holocaust]]\nrect 825 62 941 100 [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]]\nrect 808 61 825 101 [[Alhambra decree|Expulsion from Spain]]\nrect 428 62 808 103 [[Dispersion of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Roman exile]]\npoly 226 82 410 82 410 92 428 92 428 61 226 62 [[Ten Lost Tribes|Assyrian Exile (Ten Lost Tribes)]]\nrect 264 82 284 122 [[Babylonian captivity]]\nrect 283 103 341 121 [[Second Temple of Jerusalem|Second Temple period]]\npoly 26 121 17 121 17 63 225 63 226 81 145 82 145 101 26 101 [[Chronology of the Bible|Ancient Jewish History]]\nrect 58 136 375 146 [[Chronology of the Bible]]\nrect 356 122 373 135 [[Common Era]]\ndesc none\n</imagemap>\n\n==Ancient Jewish history (c. 1500 BCE \u2013 63 BCE)==\n{{Main|Origins of Judaism}}\n\n===Ancient Israelites (until c. 586 BCE)===\n{{Main|The Exodus|Conquest of Canaan|History of ancient Israel and Judah}}\n{{Religious text primary|date=May 2010}}\n[[File:Map Israel Judea 926 BC-fr.svg|thumb|200px|Kingdoms of Israel and Judah in 926 BCE]]\n\nThe history of the early Jews, and their neighbors, centers on the [[Fertile Crescent]] and east coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It begins among those people who occupied the area lying between the river [[Nile]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Surrounded by ancient seats of culture in [[Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]], by the deserts of [[Arabia]], and by the highlands of [[Asia Minor]], the land of [[Canaan]] (roughly corresponding to modern Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Jordan and Lebanon) was a meeting place of civilizations.\n\nAccording to the [[Hebrew Bible]], Jews descend from the [[Israelites|ancient people of Israel]] who settled in the land of Canaan between the eastern coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Jordan River]]. The Hebrew Bible refers to the \"Children of Israel\" as Israelite descendants of a common ancestor [[Jacob]].<ref>http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/children-of-israel/</ref> It also suggests that the nomadic travels of the [[Hebrews]] centered on [[Hebron]] in the first centuries of the second millennium BCE, leading to the establishment of the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] as their burial site in Hebron. The Children of Israel, in this account, consisted of twelve tribes, each descended from one of Jacob's twelve sons, [[Reuven]], [[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Shimon]], [[Levi]], [[Judah (Bible)|Yehuda]], [[Yissachar]], [[Zevulun]], [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]], [[Naftali]], [[Asher]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Yosef]], and [[Benjamin|Benyamin]].\n\n[[File:Figurine from Egypt of semitic slave (2).jpg|thumb|An alleged Semitic slave.

According to the Bible, the Hebrews miraculously emigrated out of [[Egypt]] (an event known as [[the Exodus]]), and returned to their ancestral homeland in Canaan. According to the Bible, after their emancipation from Egyptian slavery, the people of Israel wandered around and lived in the [[Sinai desert]] for a span of forty years before conquering Canaan in 1400 BCE under the command of [[Joshua]]. While living in the desert, according to the Biblical writings, the nation of Israel received the [[Ten Commandments]] at [[Mount Sinai]] from [[YHWH]] via Moses. After entering Canaan, portions of the land were given to each of the twelve tribes of Israel.\n\nHowever, archaeology reveals a different story of the origins of the Jewish people: they did not necessarily leave the Levant.

[...] Israel is first textually attested as a political entity in Egyptian texts of the late 13th century BC and the Egyptologist Donald Redford argues that the Israelites must have been emerging as a distinct group within the Canaanite culture during the century or so prior to this. It has been suggested that the early Israelites were an oppressed rural group of Canaanites who rebelled against the more urbanized coastal Canaanites (Gottwald 1979). Alternatively, it has been argued that the Israelites were survivors of the decline in the fortunes of Canaan who established themselves in the highlands at the end of the late Bronze Age (Ahlstrom 1986: 27). Redford, however, makes a good case for equating the very earliest Israelites with a semi-nomadic people in the highlands of central Palestine whom the Egyptians called Shasu (Redford 1992:2689-80; although see Stager 1985 for strong arguments against the identification with the Shasu). These Shasu were a persistent thorn in the side of the Ramessid pharaohs' empire in Syria-Palestine, well-attested in Egytian texts, but their pastoral lifestyle has left scant traces in the archaeological record. By the end of the 13th century BC, however, the Shasu/Israelites were beginning to establish small settlements in the uplands, the architecture of which closely resembles contemporary Canaanite villages.}}</ref> The culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, their cult-objects are those of the Canaanite god [[El (deity)|El]], the pottery remains in the local Canaanite tradition, and the alphabet used is early Canaanite. Almost the sole marker distinguishing the \"Israelite\" villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of pig bones, although whether this can be taken as an ethnic marker or is due to other factors remains a matter of dispute.<ref>{{cite book |title= Biblical Peoples and Ethnicity: An Archeological Study of Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines, and Early Israel, 1300\u20131100 B.C.E. |last= Killebrew |first= Ann E. |year= 2005 |publisher= Society of Biblical Literature |location= Atlanta |isbn= 978-1-58983-097-4 |page= 176 |accessdate= August 12, 2012 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VtAmmwapfVAC | quote = Much has been made of the scarcity of pig bones at highland sites. Since small quantities of pig bones do appear in Late Bronze Age assemblages, some archaeologists have interpreted this to indicate that the ethnic identity of the highland inhabitants was distinct from Late Bronze Age indigenous peoples (see Finkelstein 1997, 227\u2013230). Brian Hesse and Paula Wapnish (1997) advise caution, however, since the lack of pig bones at Iron I highland settlements could be a result of other factors that have little to do with ethnicity.}}</ref>\n\nFor several hundred years, the [[Land of Israel]] was organized into a confederacy of twelve tribes ruled by a series of [[Biblical judges|Judges]].

The first Jewish communities in Babylonia started with the exile of the Tribe of Judah to Babylon by [[Jehoiachin]] in 597 BCE as well as after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 586 BCE.<ref name=\"Translation 1981, pg. 95\"/> Many more Jews migrated to Babylon in 135 CE after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] and in the centuries after.<ref name=\"Translation 1981, pg. 95\"/> Babylonia, where some of the largest and most prominent Jewish cities and communities were established, became the center of Jewish life all the way up to the 13th century. By the first century, Babylonia already held a speedily growing<ref name=\"Translation 1981, pg. 95\"/> population of an estimated 1,000,000 Jews, which increased to an estimated 2 million<ref name=\"Solomon Gryazel p. 137\"/> between the years 200 CE and 500 CE, both by natural growth and by immigration of more Jews from the Land of Israel, making up about 1/6 of the world Jewish population at that era.<ref name=\"Solomon Gryazel p. 137\"/> It was there that they would write the Babylonian [[Talmud]] in the languages used by the Jews of ancient Babylonia: [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]]. The Jews established [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], also known as the Geonic Academies (\"Geonim\" meaning \"splendour\" in Biblical Hebrew or \"geniuses\"), which became the center for Jewish scholarship and the development of Jewish law in Babylonia from roughly 500 CE to 1038 CE. The two most famous academies were the [[Pumbedita Academy]] and the [[Sura Academy]]. Major yeshivot were also located at [[Nehardea]] and Mahuza. The Talmudic [[Yeshiva]] Academies became a main part of Jewish culture and education, and Jews continued on establishing Yeshiva Academies in Western and Eastern Europe, North Africa, and in the centuries later on to America and other countries around the world where Jews lived in the Diaspora. Talmudic study in [[Yeshiva]] academies continue today with the establishment of many Yeshiva academies, most of them located in The United States and [[State of Israel|Israel]].\n\nThese Talmudic [[Yeshiva]] academies of Babylonia followed the era of the [[Amoraim]] (\"expounders\")\u2014the sages of the Talmud who were active (both in the [[Land of Israel]] and in Babylon) during the end of the era of the sealing of the [[Mishnah]] and until the times of the sealing of the Talmud (220CE \u2013 500CE), and following the [[Savoraim]] (\"reasoners\")\u2014the sages of Beth midrash (Torah study places) in Babylon from the end of the era of the Amoraim (5th century) and until the beginning of the era of the [[Geonim]]. The Geonim (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd) were the presidents of the two great rabbinical colleges of Sura and Pumbedita, and were the generally accepted spiritual leaders of the worldwide Jewish community in the early medieval era, in contrast to the [[Resh Galuta]] (Exilarch) who wielded secular authority over the Jews in Islamic lands. According to traditions, the [[Resh Galuta]] were descendants of Judean kings, which is why the kings of [[Parthia]] would treat them with much honour.<ref>[\u05de\u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05e0\u05d3 \u05d5\u05d1\u05e6\u05dc\u05d0\u05dc \u05e1. \u05e8\u05d5\u05ea\u05ea \"\u05e2\u05dd \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u2013 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea 4000 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u2013 \u05de\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d7\u05d5\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd\", \u05e2\"\u05de 97. (Translation: Mordechai Vermebrand and Betzalel S. Ruth ''The People of Israel: The History of 4,000 Years, from the Days of the Forefathers to the Peace Treaty'', 1981, p. 97)</ref>\n\nFor the Jews of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the yeshivot of Babylonia served much the same function as the ancient [[Sanhedrin]]. That is, as a council of Jewish religious authorities. The academies were founded in pre-Islamic Babylonia under the Zoroastrian Sassanid dynasty and were located not far from the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, which at that time was the largest city in the world. After the conquest of Persia in the 7th century, the academies subsequently operated for four hundred years under the Islamic caliphate. The first gaon of Sura, according to [[Sherira Gaon]], was Mar bar Rab Chanan, who assumed office in 609. The last gaon of [[Sura]] was [[Samuel ben Hofni]], who died in 1034; the last gaon of Pumbedita was [[Hezekiah Gaon]], who was tortured to death in 1040; hence the activity of the Geonim covers a period of nearly 450 years.\n\nOne of principal seats of Babylonian Judaism was [[Nehardea]], which was then a very large city made up mostly of Jews.<ref name=\"Translation 1981, pg. 95\"/> A very ancient synagogue, built, it was believed, by King Jehoiachin, existed in Nehardea. At Huzal, near Nehardea, there was another synagogue, not far from which could be seen the ruins of Ezra's academy. In the period before Hadrian, Akiba, on his arrival at Nehardea on a mission from the Sanhedrin, entered into a discussion with a resident scholar on a point of matrimonial law (Mishnah Yeb., end). At the same time there was at Nisibis (northern [[Mesopotamia]]), an excelling Jewish college, at the head of which stood Judah ben Bathyra, and in which many Judean scholars found refuge at the time of the persecutions. A certain temporary importance was also attained by a school at Nehar-Pe\u1e33od, founded by the Judean immigrant Hananiah, nephew of [[Joshua ben Hananiah]], which school might have been the cause of a schism between the Jews of Babylonia and those of Judea-Israel, had not the Judean authorities promptly checked Hananiah's ambition.\n\n===Byzantine period (324\u2013638 CE)===\n{{Main|Jews of Byzantium}}\nJews were also widespread throughout the Roman Empire, and this carried on to a lesser extent in the period of Byzantine rule in the central and eastern Mediterranean. The militant and exclusive Christianity and [[caesaropapism]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] did not treat Jews well, and the condition and influence of diaspora Jews in the Empire declined dramatically.\n\nIt was official Christian policy to convert Jews to [[Christianity]], and the Christian leadership used the official power of Rome in their attempts. In 351 CE the Jews revolted against the added pressures of their Governor, [[Constantius Gallus]]. Gallus put down the revolt and destroyed the major cities in the Galilee area where the revolt had started. Tzippori and Lydda (site of two of the major legal academies) never recovered.\n\nIn this period, the Nasi in Tiberias, Hillel II, created an official calendar, which needed no monthly sightings of the moon. The months were set, and the calendar needed no further authority from Judea. At about the same time, the Jewish academy at Tiberius began to collate the combined Mishnah, [[braitot]], explanations, and interpretations developed by generations of scholars who studied after the death of [[Judah HaNasi]]. The text was organized according to the order of the Mishna: each paragraph of Mishnah was followed by a compilation of all of the interpretations, stories, and responses associated with that Mishnah. This text is called the ''[[Jerusalem Talmud]].''\n\nThe Jews of Judea received a brief respite from official persecution during the rule of the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. Julian's policy was to return the kingdom to Hellenism and he encouraged the Jews to rebuild Jerusalem. As Julian's rule lasted briefly from 361 to 363, the Jews could not rebuild sufficiently before Roman Christian rule was restored over the Empire. Beginning in 398 with the consecration of [[St. John Chrysostom]] as [[Patriarch]], the Christian rhetoric against Jews continued to rise; he preached sermons with titles such as \"Against the Jews\" and \"On the Statues, Homily 17,\" in which John preaches against \"the Jewish sickness\".<ref>Wendy Mayer and [[Pauline Allen]], ''John Chrysostom: The Early Church Fathers'' (London, 2000), p. 113, 146.</ref> Such heated language contributed to a climate of Christian distrust and hate toward the large Jewish settlements, such as those in [[Antioch]] and [[Constantinople]].\n\nIn the beginning of the 5th century, the [[Emperor Theodosius]] issued a set of decrees establishing official persecution against Jews. Jews were not allowed to own slaves, build new synagogues, hold public office or try cases between a Jew and a non-Jew. Intermarriage between Jew and non-Jew was made a capital offense, as was a Christian converting to Judaism. Theodosius did away with the [[Sanhedrin]] and abolished the post of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]. Under the [[Emperor Justinian]], the authorities further restricted the civil rights of Jews,<ref>Cod., I., v. 12</ref> and threatened their religious privileges.<ref>Procopius, ''Historia Arcana'', 28</ref> The emperor interfered in the internal affairs of the synagogue,<ref>Nov., cxlvi., Feb. 8, 553</ref> and forbade, for instance, the use of the Hebrew language in divine worship. Those who disobeyed the restrictions were threatened with corporal penalties, exile, and loss of property. The Jews at Borium, not far from Syrtis Major, who resisted the Byzantine General [[Belisarius]] in his campaign against the [[Vandals]], were forced to embrace Christianity, and their synagogue was converted to a church.<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', vi. 2</ref>\n\nJustinian and his successors had concerns outside the province of Judea, and he had insufficient troops to enforce these regulations. As a result, the 5th century was a period when a wave of new synagogues were built, many with beautiful mosaic floors. Jews adopted the rich art forms of the Byzantine culture. Jewish mosaics of the period portray people, animals, menorahs, zodiacs, and Biblical characters. Excellent examples of these synagogue floors have been found at Beit Alpha (which includes the scene of Abraham sacrificing a ram instead of his son Isaac along with a zodiac), Tiberius, Beit Shean, and Tzippori.\n\nThe precarious existence of Jews under Byzantine rule did not long endure, largely for the explosion of the Muslim religion out of the remote Arabian peninsula (where large populations of Jews resided, see [[History of the Jews under Muslim Rule]] for more). The [[Muslim]] [[Caliphate]] ejected the Byzantines from the Holy Land (or the [[Levant]], defined as modern Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) within a few years of their victory at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636. Numerous Jews fled the remaining Byzantine territories in favour of residence in the Caliphate over the subsequent centuries.\n\nThe size of the Jewish community in the Byzantine Empire was not affected by attempts by some emperors (most notably Justinian) to forcibly convert the Jews of Anatolia to Christianity, as these attempts met with very little success.<ref>[[George Alexandrovi\u010d Ostrogorsky|G.

During that time, [[Jews]] were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed.\n\nA period of tolerance thus dawned for the Jews of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest. Especially after 912, during the reign of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] and his son, [[Al-Hakam II]], the Jews prospered, devoting themselves to the service of the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]], to the study of the sciences, and to commerce and industry, especially to trading in silk and slaves, in this way promoting the prosperity of the country.

The Jews were living in the middle of Christian lands and felt this danger acutely.<ref>{{cite book|author=Abraham Malamat|title=A History of the Jewish People|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofjewishp00harv|url-access=registration|year=1976|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-39731-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofjewishp00harv/page/416 416]\u2013}}</ref> This massacre is seen as the first in a sequence of anti-Semitic events which culminated in the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Nirenberg|editor=Gerd Althoff|others=Johannes Fried|title=Medieval Concepts of the Past: Ritual, Memory, Historiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxS6-pQZzGsC&pg=PA279|date=31 January 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78066-7|pages=279\u2013}}</ref> Jewish populations felt that they had been abandoned by their Christian neighbors and rulers during the massacres and lost faith in all promises and charters.<ref>{{cite book|author=Abraham Malamat|title=A History of the Jewish People|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofjewishp00harv|url-access=registration|year=1976|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-39731-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofjewishp00harv/page/419 419]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMany Jews chose self-defence. But their means of self-defence were limited and their casualties only increased. Most of the forced conversions proved ineffective. Many Jews reverted to their original faith later.

The Jews had preserved their faith from social pressure, now they had to preserve it at sword point. The massacres during the crusades strengthened the Jewry from within spiritually.

When the city fell, the Crusaders gathered many Jews in a synagogue and set it on fire.<ref name=\"Abraham Malamat 1976 413\"/> In Haifa, the Jews almost single-handedly defended the town against the Crusaders, holding out for a month, (June\u2013July 1099).<ref name=SKatz/> At this time there were Jewish communities scattered all over the country, including Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. As Jews were not allowed to hold land during the Crusader period, they worked at trades and commerce in the coastal towns during times of quiescence. Most were artisans: glassblowers in [[Sidon]], furriers and dyers in Jerusalem.<ref name=SKatz/>\n\nDuring this period, the [[Masoretes]] of Tiberias established the ''[[niqqud]]'', a system of [[diacritic]]al signs used to represent vowels or distinguish between alternative pronunciations of letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]].

He started on the rough route overland. He was met along the way by Jews in [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and [[Damascus]]. Jewish legend relates that as he came near Jerusalem, overpowered by the sight of the Holy City, he sang his most beautiful elegy, the celebrated \"Zionide\" (''Zion ha-lo Tish'ali'').

The period was characterized by war, uprisings, bloodshed and destruction. Jews suffered persecution and humiliation, but the surviving records note at least 30 Jewish urban and rural communities at the opening of the 16th century.\n\n[[Nahmanides]] is recorded as settling in the Old City of Jerusalem in 1267. He moved to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], where he was active in spreading Jewish learning, which was at that time neglected in the Holy Land. He gathered a circle of pupils around him, and people came in crowds, even from the district of the Euphrates, to hear him. [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] were said to have attended his lectures, among them Aaron ben Joseph the Elder. He later became one of the greatest [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaite]] authorities. Shortly after Nahmanides' arrival in Jerusalem, he addressed a letter to his son Nahman, in which he described the desolation of the Holy City. At the time, it had only two Jewish inhabitants\u2014two brothers, dyers by trade. In a later letter from Acre, Nahmanides counsels his son to cultivate humility, which he considers to be the first of virtues. In another, addressed to his second son, who occupied an official position at the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] court, Nahmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality. Nahmanides died after reaching seventy-six, and his remains were interred at [[Haifa]], by the grave of [[Yechiel of Paris]].\n\nYechiel had [[aliyah|emigrated]] to Acre in 1260, along with his son and a large group of followers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/places/acco.html |title=Jewish Zionist Education |publisher=Jafi.org.il |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013142810/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/places/acco.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lookstein.org/resources/bionotes.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502035808/http://www.lookstein.org/resources/bionotes.pdf |archive-date=May 2, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There he established the Tamudic academy ''Midrash haGadol d'Paris''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishhistory.com/jh.php?id=AdditionalReadings&content=content/segal_ch17 |title=Section III: The Biblical Age: Chapter Seventeen: Awaiting the Messiah |author=Benjamin J.

Before the Church became fully organized as an institution with an increasing array of rules, early medieval society was tolerant. Between 800 and 1100, an estimated 1.5 million Jews lived in Christian Europe. As they were not Christians, they were not included as a [[Estates of the realm|division]] of the feudal system of clergy, knights and serfs. This means that they did not have to satisfy the oppressive demands for labor and military conscription that Christian commoners suffered. In relations with the Christian society, the Jews were protected by kings, princes and bishops, because of the crucial services they provided in three areas: finance, administration and medicine.<ref name=\"Cantor\"/> The lack of political strengths did leave Jews vulnerable to exploitation through extreme taxation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ebenhard Isenmann|editor=Richard Bonney|title=The Rise of the Fiscal State in Europe c.1200\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U24lRLy_qT8C&pg=PA259|date=2 September 1999|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-154220-6|pages=259\u2013}}</ref>\n\nChristian scholars interested in the Bible consulted with Talmudic rabbis. As the Roman Catholic Church strengthened as an institution, the Franciscan and Dominican preaching orders were founded, and there was a rise of competitive middle-class, town-dwelling Christians. By 1300, the friars and local priests staged the Passion Plays during Holy Week, which depicted Jews (in contemporary dress) killing Christ, according to Gospel accounts. From this period, persecution of Jews and deportations became endemic. Around 1500, Jews found relative security and a renewal of prosperity in present-day [[Poland]].<ref name=\"Cantor\">Norman F.

Europe's Jewry was mainly urban and literate. The Christians were inclined to regard Jews as obstinate deniers of the truth because in their view the Jews were expected to know of the truth of the Christian doctrines from their knowledge of the Jewish scriptures.

Christian rulers gradually saw the advantage of having such a class of people who could supply capital for their use without being liable to excommunication.

But, in almost every instance when Jews acquired large amounts through banking transactions, during their lives or upon their deaths, the king would take it over.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5764-england \"England\" [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] (1906)]</ref> Jews became imperial {{-\"}}''servi camer\u00e6''{{-\"}}, the property of the King, who might present them and their possessions to princes or cities.\n\nJews were frequently massacred and exiled from various European countries. The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[People's Crusade]] (1096) flourishing Jewish communities on the Rhine and the Danube were utterly destroyed. In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in France were subject to frequent massacres. They were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]].

A common approach has been to view the process through the lens of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as Jews faced the promise and the challenges posed by political emancipation. Scholars that use this approach have focused on two social types as paradigms for the decline of Jewish tradition and as agents of the sea changes in Jewish culture that led to the collapse of the [[ghetto]]. The first of these two social types is the [[Court Jew]] who is portrayed as a forerunner of the modern Jew, having achieved integration with and participation in the proto-capitalist economy and court society of central European states such as the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. In contrast to the cosmopolitan Court Jew, the second social type presented by historians of modern Jewry is the ''maskil'', (learned person), a proponent of the [[Haskalah]] (Enlightenment). This narrative sees the maskil's pursuit of secular scholarship and his rationalistic critiques of rabbinic tradition as laying a durable intellectual foundation for the secularization of Jewish society and culture. The established paradigm has been one in which Ashkenazic Jews entered modernity through a self-conscious process of westernization led by \"highly atypical, Germanized Jewish intellectuals\". Haskalah gave birth to the Reform and Conservative movements and planted the seeds of [[Zionism]] while at the same time encouraging cultural assimilation into the countries in which Jews resided.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reframing Jewish History |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10513 |accessdate=2011-05-24}}</ref>\nAt around the same time that Haskalah was developing, [[Hasidic Judaism]] was spreading as a movement that preached a world view almost opposed to the Haskalah.\n\nIn the 1990s, the concept of the \"[[Port Jew]]\" has been suggested as an \"alternate path to modernity\" that was distinct from the European [[Haskalah]]. In contrast to the focus on Ashkenazic Germanized Jews, the concept of the Port Jew focused on the Sephardi conversos who fled the Inquisition and resettled in European port towns on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and the Eastern seaboard of the United States.<ref name=HelenFry>{{cite journal |title=Port Jews: Jewish Communities in Cosmopolitan Maritime Trading Centres, 1550\u20131950 |first=Helen P. |last=Fry|journal=European Judaism |volume= 36 |publisher=Frank Cass Publishers |year=2002 |ISBN=978-0-7146-8286-0|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5002650793 |quote=Port Jews were a social type, usually those who were involved in seafaring and maritime trade, who (like Court Jews) could be seen as the earliest modern Jews.

'Their Diaspora connections and accumulated expertise lay in exactly the areas of overseas expansion that were then of interest to mercantilist governments.'}}</ref>\n\n===Court Jew===\n{{main|Court Jew|shtadlan}}\n[[Court Jew]]s were [[Jew]]ish [[banker]]s or businessmen who lent money and handled the finances of some of the [[Christians|Christian]] [[Europe]]an noble houses. Corresponding historical terms are ''Jewish [[bailiff]]'' and ''[[shtadlan]]''.\n\nExamples of what would be later called court Jews emerged when local rulers used services of Jewish bankers for short-term loans. They lent money to nobles and in the process gained social influence. Noble patrons of court Jews employed them as [[financier]]s, suppliers, [[diplomat]]s and [[trade delegate]]s. Court Jews could use their family connections, and connections between each other, to provision their sponsors with, among other things, food, arms, ammunition and precious metals. In return for their services, court Jews gained social privileges, including up to noble status for themselves, and could live outside the Jewish ghettos. Some nobles wanted to keep their bankers in their own courts. And because they were under noble protection, they were exempted from [[rabbi]]nical jurisdiction.\n\nFrom medieval times, court Jews could amass personal fortunes and gained political and social influence. Sometimes they were also prominent people in the local Jewish community and could use their influence to protect and influence their brethren. Sometimes they were the only Jews who could interact with the local high society and present petitions of the Jews to the ruler. However, the court Jew had social connections and influence in the Christian world mainly through his Christian patrons. Due to the precarious position of Jews, some nobles could just ignore their debts. If the sponsoring noble died, his Jewish financier could face exile or execution.{{Citation needed| date=February 2012}}\n\n===Spain and Portugal===\nSignificant repression of Spain's numerous community occurred during the 14th century, notably a [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacres and mass conversions of 1391|major pogrom in 1391]] which resulted in the majority of Spain's 300,000 Jews converting to Catholicism. With the [[Granada War|conquest of the Muslim Kingdom of Granada]] in 1492, the Catholic monarchs issued the [[Alhambra Decree]] whereby Spain's remaining 100,000 Jews were forced to choose between conversion and exile. As a result, an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 Jews left Spain, the remainder joining Spain's already numerous Converso community. Perhaps a quarter of a million Conversos thus were gradually absorbed by the dominant Catholic culture, although those among them who secretly practiced Judaism were subject to 40 years of intense repression by the Spanish Inquisition. This was particularly the case up until 1530, after which the trials of Conversos by the Inquisition dropped to 3% of the total. Similar expulsions of Sephardic Jews occurred 1493 in [[Sicily]] (37,000 Jews) and Portugal in 1496. The expelled Spanish Jews fled mainly to the Ottoman Empire and North Africa and Portugal. A small number also settled in Holland and England.\n\n===Port Jew===\n{{main|Port Jew}}\n\nThe [[Port Jew]] describes Jews who were involved in the seafaring and maritime economy of Europe, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries. Helen Fry suggests that they could be considered to have been \"the earliest modern Jews\". According to Fry, Port Jews often arrived as \"refugees from the Inquisition\" and the expulsion of Jews from Iberia. They were allowed to settle in port cities as merchants granted permission to trade in ports such as Amsterdam, London, Trieste and Hamburg. Fry notes that their connections with the [[Jewish Diaspora]] and their expertise in maritime trade made them of particular interest to the mercantilist governments of Europe.<ref name=HelenFry /> Lois Dubin describes Port Jews as Jewish merchants who were \"valued for their engagement in the international maritime trade upon which such cities thrived\".<ref>Dubin p. 47</ref> Sorkin and others have characterized the socio-cultural profile of these men as marked by a flexibility towards religion and a \"reluctant cosmopolitanism that was alien to both traditional and 'enlightened' Jewish identities\".\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n{{Main|History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire}}\n\nDuring the Classical Ottoman period (1300\u20131600), the Jews, together with most other communities of the empire, enjoyed a certain level of prosperity. Compared with other Ottoman subjects, they were the predominant power in commerce and trade as well in diplomacy and other high offices. In the 16th century especially, the Jews were the most prominent under the ''millets'', the apogee of Jewish influence could arguably be the appointment of [[Joseph Nasi]] to [[Sanjak-bey]] (''governor'', a rank usually only bestowed upon Muslims) of the island of [[Naxos Island|Naxos]].<ref>Charles Issawi & Dmitri Gondicas; ''Ottoman Greeks in the Age of Nationalism'', Princeton, (1999)</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[Battle of Yarmuk]] when the [[Levant]] passed under Muslim Rule, thirty Jewish communities existed in Haifa, Sh\u2019chem, Hebron, Ramleh, Gaza, Jerusalem, and many in the north. Safed became a spiritual centre for the Jews and the [[Shulchan Aruch]] was compiled there as well as many Kabbalistic texts. The first Hebrew printing press, and the first printing in Western Asia began in 1577.\n\nJews lived in the geographic area of Asia Minor (modern Turkey, but more geographically either Anatolia or Asia Minor) for more than 2,400 years. Initial prosperity in Hellenistic times had faded under Christian Byzantine rule, but recovered somewhat under the rule of the various Muslim governments that displaced and succeeded rule from Constantinople. For much of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, Turkey was a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, and it continues to have a small Jewish population today. The situation where Jews both enjoyed cultural and economical prosperity at times but were widely persecuted at other times was summarised by G.E. Von Grunebaum :\n\n<blockquote>It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizeable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.<ref>G.E. Von Grunebaum, ''Eastern Jewry Under Islam'', 1971, p. 369.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Poland-Lithuania===\n{{Further|History of Jews in Poland}}\n\nIn the 17th century, there were many significant Jewish populations in Western Europe. The relatively tolerant Poland had the largest Jewish population in Europe that dated back to 13th century and enjoyed relative prosperity and freedom for nearly four hundred years; however the calm situation there ended when Polish and Lithuanian Jews were slaughtered in the hundreds of thousands by the cossacks during [[Chmielnicki uprising]] (1648) and by the [[Swedish wars]] (1655). Driven by these and other persecutions, Jews moved back to Western Europe in the 17th century. The last ban on Jews (by the English) was revoked in 1654, but periodic expulsions from individual cities still occurred, and Jews were often restricted from land ownership, or forced to live in [[ghettos]].\n\nWith the [[Partition of Poland]] in the late 18th century, the Jewish population was split between the [[Russian Empire]], [[Austro-Hungary]], and [[Prussia]], which divided [[Poland]] for themselves.\n\n===The European Enlightenment and Haskalah (18th century)===\nDuring the period of the [[European Renaissance]] and Enlightenment, significant changes occurred within the Jewish community. The [[Haskalah]] movement paralleled the wider Enlightenment, as Jews in the 18th century began to campaign for emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider European society. Secular and scientific education was added to the traditional religious instruction received by students, and interest in a national Jewish identity, including a revival in the study of Jewish history and Hebrew, started to grow. Haskalah gave birth to the Reform and Conservative movements and planted the seeds of [[Zionism]] while at the same time encouraging cultural assimilation into the countries in which Jews resided. At around the same time another movement was born, one preaching almost the opposite of Haskalah, [[Hasidic Judaism]]. Hasidic Judaism began in the 18th century by [[Baal Shem Tov|Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov]], and quickly gained a following with its more exuberant, mystical approach to religion. These two movements, and the traditional orthodox approach to Judaism from which they spring, formed the basis for the modern divisions within Jewish observance.\n\nAt the same time, the outside world was changing, and debates began over the potential emancipation of the Jews (granting them equal rights). The first country to do so was France, during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. Even so, Jews were expected to assimilate, not continue their traditions. This ambivalence is demonstrated in the famous speech of [[Clermont-Tonnerre]] before the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in 1789:\n\n<blockquote>We must refuse everything to the Jews as a nation and accord everything to Jews as individuals. We must withdraw recognition from their judges; they should only have our judges. We must refuse legal protection to the maintenance of the so-called laws of their Judaic organization; they should not be allowed to form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to me, they do not want to be citizens. Well then! If they do not want to be citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them.

Hasidism comprises part of contemporary [[Haredi|Ultra-Orthodox]] Judaism, alongside the previous Talmudic [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian-Yeshiva]] approach and the Oriental [[Sephardi Judaism|Sephardi]] tradition.\n\nIt was founded in 18th-century [[Eastern Europe]] by Rabbi Israel [[Baal Shem Tov]] as a reaction against overly [[Talmud|legalistic]] Judaism. Opposite to this, Hasidic teachings cherished the sincerity and concealed holiness of the unlettered common folk, and their equality with the scholarly elite. The emphasis on the [[Divine immanence|Immanent]] Divine presence in everything gave new value to prayer and deeds of kindness, alongside Rabbinic supremacy of [[Torah study|study]], and replaced historical [[Kabbalah|mystical (kabbalistic)]] and [[Musar literature|ethical (musar)]] [[Asceticism in Judaism|asceticism]] and [[Maggid|admonishment]] with optimism, encouragement, and daily [[Deveikut|fervour]]. This populist emotional revival accompanied the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical Divine [[Panentheism]], through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of mystical thought. The adjustment of Jewish values sought to add to required standards of ritual [[Halacha|observance]], while relaxing others where inspiration predominated. Its communal gatherings celebrate soulful [[Nigun|song]] and [[Yiddish literature#Hasidic and Haskalah literature|storytelling]] as forms of mystical devotion.{{Citation needed| date=February 2012}}\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Napoleon stellt den israelitischen Kult wieder her, 30. Mai 1806.jpg|thumb|right|275px|An 1806 French print depicts [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] emancipating the Jews.]]\nThough persecution still existed, emancipation spread throughout Europe in the 19th century. [[Napoleon]] invited Jews to leave the [[Jewish ghettos in Europe]] and seek refuge in the newly created tolerant political regimes that offered equality under Napoleonic Law (see [[Napoleon and the Jews]]). By 1871, with Germany's emancipation of Jews, every European country except Russia had emancipated its Jews.\n\nDespite increasing integration of the Jews with secular society, a new form of anti-Semitism emerged, based on the ideas of race and nationhood rather than the religious hatred of the Middle Ages. This form of anti-Semitism held that Jews were a separate and inferior race from the [[Aryan]] people of Western Europe, and led to the emergence of political parties in France, Germany, and Austria-Hungary that campaigned on a platform of rolling back emancipation. This form of anti-Semitism emerged frequently in European culture, most famously in the [[Dreyfus Trial]] in France. These persecutions, along with state-sponsored [[pogrom]]s in Russia in the late 19th century, led a number of Jews to believe that they would only be safe in their own nation. See [[Theodor Herzl]] and [[History of Zionism]].\n\nDuring this period, Jewish migration to the [[United States]] (see [[American Jews]]) created a large new community mostly freed of the restrictions of Europe. Over 2 million Jews arrived in the United States between 1890 and 1924, most from Russia and Eastern Europe. A similar case occurred in the southern tip of the continent, specifically in the countries of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]].\n\n==20th century==\n\n===Modern Zionism===\n{{Main|History of Zionism}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Herzl-balcony.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Theodor Herzl]], visionary of the Jewish State, in 1901.]]\nDuring the 1870s and 1880s the Jewish population in Europe began to more actively discuss immigration back to Israel and the re-establishment of the Jewish Nation in its national homeland, fulfilling the biblical prophecies relating to [[Shivat tzion|Shivat Tzion]]. In 1882 the first Zionist settlement\u2014[[Rishon LeZion]]\u2014was founded by immigrants who belonged to the \"[[Hovevei Zion]]\" movement. Later on, the \"[[Bilu]]\" movement established many other settlements in the land of Israel.\n\nThe Zionist movement was founded officially after the [[Kattowitz convention]] (1884) and the [[World Zionist Congress]] (1897), and it was [[Theodor Herzl]] who began the struggle to establish a state for the Jews.\n\nAfter the [[First World War]], it seemed that the conditions to establish such a state had arrived: The United Kingdom captured [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the Jews received the promise of a \"National Home\" from the British in the form of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], given to [[Chaim Weizmann]].\n\nIn 1920 the British Mandate of Palestine began and the pro-Jewish [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] was appointed High Commissioner in Palestine, the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] was established and several big Jewish immigration waves to Palestine occurred. The Arab co-inhabitants of Palestine were hostile to increasing Jewish immigration however, and began to oppose Jewish settlement and the pro-Jewish policy of the British government by violent means.\n\nArab gangs began performing violent acts and murders on convoys and on the Jewish population. After the 1920 [[1920 Palestine riots|Arab riots]] and 1921 [[Jaffa riots]], the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British had no desire to confront local Arab gangs over their attacks on Palestinian Jews. Believing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs, the Jewish leadership created the Haganah organization to protect their farms and Kibbutzim.\n\nMajor riots occurred during the [[1929 Palestine riots]] and the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine]].\n\nDue to the increasing violence the United Kingdom gradually started to backtrack from the original idea of a Jewish state and to speculate on a [[binational solution]] or an Arab state that would have a Jewish minority.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jews of Europe and the United States gained success in the fields of the science, culture and the economy. Among those generally considered the most famous were scientist [[Albert Einstein]] and philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. A disproportionate number of [[Nobel Prize]] winners at this time were Jewish, as is still the case.<ref name=\"Jewish Nobel Prize Winners\"/> In Russia, many Jews were involved in the [[October Revolution]] and belonged to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].\n\n===The Holocaust===\n{{Main|History of the Jews during World War II|The Holocaust}}\n[[File:Razzia in een getto (detail).jpg|110px|thumb|A boy raises his hands when the Jews leave the bunkers after the submission of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]]]\n[[File:Rows of bodies of dead inmates fill the yard of Lager Nordhausen, a Gestapo concentration camp.jpg|left|thumb|Bodies of inmates of the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] Nazi concentration camp who died during British [[Bombing of Nordhausen in World War II|bombing raids]] on April 3 and 4, 1945]]\nIn 1933, with the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi party]] in Germany, the Jewish situation became more severe. Economic crises, racial [[Anti-Jewish laws]], and a fear of an upcoming war led many Jews to flee from Europe to Palestine, to the United States and to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1939 [[World War II]] began and until 1941 [[Hitler]] occupied almost all of Europe, including Poland\u2014where millions of Jews were living at that time\u2014and France. In 1941, following the invasion of the Soviet Union, the [[Final Solution]] began, an extensive organized operation on an unprecedented scale, aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people, and resulting in the persecution and murder of Jews in political Europe, inclusive of European North Africa (pro-Nazi Vichy-North Africa and Italian Libya). This [[genocide]], in which approximately six million Jews were murdered methodically and with horrifying cruelty, is known as [[The Holocaust]] or ''Shoah'' (Hebrew term). In Poland, one million Jews were murdered in [[gas chambers]] at the [[Auschwitz]] camp complex  alone.\n\nThe massive scale of the Holocaust, and the horrors that happened during it, heavily affected the Jewish nation and world public opinion, which only understood the dimensions of the Holocaust after the war. Efforts were then increased to establish a Jewish state in Palestine.\n\n===The establishment of the State of Israel===\n{{Main|History of Israel}}\n{{See also|Israel|Declaration of Independence (Israel)}}\n{{History of Israel}}\nIn 1945 the Jewish resistance organizations in Palestine unified and established the Jewish Resistance Movement. The movement began attacking the British authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/resist.html |title=The Jewish Resistance Movement |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref> Following the [[King David Hotel bombing]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], president of the [[WZO]] appealed to the movement to cease all further military activity until a decision would be reached by the [[Jewish Agency]]. The Jewish Agency backed Weizmann's recommendation to cease activities, a decision reluctantly accepted by the Haganah, but not by the Irgun and the Lehi. The JRM was dismantled and each of the founding groups continued operating according to their own policy.<ref>Horne, Edward (1982).

But remained permanently uncooperative.</ref>\n\nThe Jewish leadership decided to center the struggle in the illegal immigration to Palestine and began organizing a massive number of Jewish war refugees from Europe, without the approval of the British authorities. This immigration contributed a great deal to the Jewish settlements in Israel in the world public opinion and the British authorities decided to let the United Nations decide upon the fate of Palestine.{{Citation needed| date=February 2012}}\n\nOn November 29, 1947, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted [[Resolution 181]](II) recommending partitioning Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish leadership accepted the decision but the Arab League and the leadership of Palestinian Arabs opposed it. Following a period of [[1947\u20131948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] started.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn the middle of the war, after the last soldiers of the British mandate left Palestine, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed on May 14, 1948, the establishment of a [[Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel]] to be known as the [[State of Israel]]. In 1949 the war ended and the state of Israel started building the state and absorbing massive waves of hundreds of thousands of Jews from all over the world.\n\nSince 1948, Israel has been involved in a series of major military conflicts, including the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], 1967 [[Six-Day War]], 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], [[1982 Lebanon War]], and [[2006 Lebanon War]], as well as a nearly constant series of ongoing minor conflicts.\n\nSince 1977, an ongoing and largely unsuccessful series of diplomatic efforts have been initiated by Israel, Palestinian organisations, their neighbours, and other parties, including the United States and the European Union, to bring about a [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process|peace process]] to resolve conflicts between Israel and its neighbors, mostly over the fate of the Palestinian people.\n\n==21st century==\n[[Israel]] is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with a population of over 8 million people, of whom about 6 million are [[Israeli Jews|Jewish]]. The largest Jewish communities are in Israel and the [[American Jews|United States]], with major communities in France, Argentina, Russia, England, and Canada.

Although Judaism as a religion first appears in Greek records during the [[Hellenistic period]] (323 BCE \u2013 31 BCE) and the earliest mention of [[Israelites|Israel]] is inscribed on the [[Merneptah Stele]] dated 1213\u20131203 BCE, religious literature tells the story of Israelites going back at least as far as c. 1500 BCE. The [[Jewish diaspora]] began with the [[Assyrian captivity]] and continued on a much larger scale with the [[Babylonian captivity]]. Jews were also widespread throughout the [[Roman Empire]], and this carried on to a lesser extent in the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule in the central and eastern [[Mediterranean]]. In 638 CE the Byzantine Empire lost control of the Levant. The Arab [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] under [[Caliph Omar]] conquered [[Jerusalem]] and the lands of [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Syria|Syria]], Palestine and Egypt. The [[Golden Age of Jewish culture in Spain]] coincided with the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, a period of [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] throughout much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. During that time, Jews were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed.\n\nDuring the Classical Ottoman period (1300\u20131600), the Jews, together with most other communities of the empire, enjoyed a certain level of prosperity. In the 17th century, there were many significant Jewish populations in Western Europe. During the period of the [[European Renaissance]] and Enlightenment, significant changes occurred within the Jewish community. Jews began in the 18th century to campaign for emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider European society. During the 1870s and 1880s the Jewish population in Europe began to more actively discuss emigration back to Israel and the re-establishment of the Jewish Nation in its national homeland. The Zionist movement was founded officially in 1897. Meanwhile, the Jews of Europe and the United States gained success in the fields of science, culture and the economy. Among those generally considered the most famous were scientist [[Albert Einstein]] and philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Many [[Nobel Prize]] winners at this time were Jewish, as is still the case.<ref name=\"Jewish Nobel Prize Winners\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Nobel_Prizes.html|title=Jewish Nobel Prize Winners|publisher=jinfo.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1933, with the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], the Jewish situation became more severe. Economic crises, racial [[Antisemitism in Europe#The Holocaust|anti-Semitic laws]], and a fear of an upcoming war led many Jews to flee from Europe to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], to the United States and to the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1939 [[World War II]] began and until 1941 Hitler [[German-occupied Europe|occupied almost all of Europe]], including [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Poland]]\u2014where millions of Jews were living at that time\u2014and [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|France]]. In 1941, following the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the Soviet Union, the [[Final Solution]] began, an extensive organized operation on an unprecedented scale, aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people, and resulting in the persecution and murder of Jews in political Europe, inclusive of European [[North Africa]] ([[French protectorate in Morocco|pro-Nazi]] [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-[[French protectorate of Tunisia|North]] [[French Algeria|Africa]] and [[Italian Libya]]). This [[genocide]], in which approximately six million Jews were methodically exterminated, is known as [[the Holocaust]] or ''Shoah'' (Hebrew term). In Poland, three million Jews were killed in [[gas chambers]] in all concentration camps combined, with one million at the [[Auschwitz]] camp complex alone.\n\nIn 1945 the Jewish resistance organizations in Palestine unified and established the Jewish Resistance Movement, which attacked the British authorities. David Ben-Gurion proclaimed on May 14, 1948, the establishment of a [[Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel]] to be known as the [[State of Israel]]. Immediately afterwards all neighbouring Arab states attacked, yet the newly formed IDF resisted. In 1949 the war ended and the state of Israel started building the state and absorbing massive waves of hundreds of thousands of Jews from all over the world. Today (2019), [[Israel]] is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with a population of over 9 million people, of whom about 7 million are [[Israeli Jews|Jewish]]. The largest Jewish communities are in Israel and the [[American Jews|United States]], with major communities in France, Argentina, Russia, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and [[History of the Jews in Germany|Germany]].

It begins among those people who occupied the area lying between the river [[Nile]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Surrounded by ancient seats of culture in [[Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]], by the deserts of [[Arabia]], and by the highlands of [[Asia Minor]], the land of [[Canaan]] (roughly corresponding to modern Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Jordan and Lebanon) was a meeting place of civilizations.\n\nAccording to the [[Hebrew Bible]], Jews descend from the [[Israelites|ancient people of Israel]] who settled in the land of Canaan between the eastern coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Jordan River]]. The Hebrew Bible refers to the \"Children of Israel\" as Israelite descendants of a common ancestor [[Jacob]].<ref>http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/children-of-israel/</ref> It also suggests that the nomadic travels of the [[Hebrews]] centered on [[Hebron]] in the first centuries of the second millennium BCE, leading to the establishment of the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] as their burial site in Hebron. The Children of Israel, in this account, consisted of twelve tribes, each descended from one of Jacob's twelve sons, [[Reuven]], [[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Shimon]], [[Levi]], [[Judah (Bible)|Yehuda]], [[Yissachar]], [[Zevulun]], [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]], [[Naftali]], [[Asher]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Yosef]], and [[Benjamin|Benyamin]].\n\n[[File:Figurine from Egypt of semitic slave (2).jpg|thumb|An alleged Semitic slave.

According to the Bible, the Hebrews miraculously emigrated out of [[Egypt]] (an event known as [[the Exodus]]), and returned to their ancestral homeland in Canaan. According to the Bible, after their emancipation from Egyptian slavery, the people of Israel wandered around and lived in the [[Sinai desert]] for a span of forty years before conquering Canaan in 1400 BCE under the command of [[Joshua]]. While living in the desert, according to the Biblical writings, the nation of Israel received the [[Ten Commandments]] at [[Mount Sinai]] from [[YHWH]] via Moses. After entering Canaan, portions of the land were given to each of the twelve tribes of Israel.\n\nHowever, archaeology reveals a different story of the origins of the Jewish people: they did not necessarily leave the Levant.

[...] Israel is first textually attested as a political entity in Egyptian texts of the late 13th century BC and the Egyptologist Donald Redford argues that the Israelites must have been emerging as a distinct group within the Canaanite culture during the century or so prior to this. It has been suggested that the early Israelites were an oppressed rural group of Canaanites who rebelled against the more urbanized coastal Canaanites (Gottwald 1979). Alternatively, it has been argued that the Israelites were survivors of the decline in the fortunes of Canaan who established themselves in the highlands at the end of the late Bronze Age (Ahlstrom 1986: 27). Redford, however, makes a good case for equating the very earliest Israelites with a semi-nomadic people in the highlands of central Palestine whom the Egyptians called Shasu (Redford 1992:2689-80; although see Stager 1985 for strong arguments against the identification with the Shasu). These Shasu were a persistent thorn in the side of the Ramessid pharaohs' empire in Syria-Palestine, well-attested in Egytian texts, but their pastoral lifestyle has left scant traces in the archaeological record. By the end of the 13th century BC, however, the Shasu/Israelites were beginning to establish small settlements in the uplands, the architecture of which closely resembles contemporary Canaanite villages.}}</ref> The culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, their cult-objects are those of the Canaanite god [[El (deity)|El]], the pottery remains in the local Canaanite tradition, and the alphabet used is early Canaanite. Almost the sole marker distinguishing the \"Israelite\" villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of pig bones, although whether this can be taken as an ethnic marker or is due to other factors remains a matter of dispute.<ref>{{cite book |title= Biblical Peoples and Ethnicity: An Archeological Study of Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines, and Early Israel, 1300\u20131100 B.C.E. |last= Killebrew |first= Ann E. |year= 2005 |publisher= Society of Biblical Literature |location= Atlanta |isbn= 978-1-58983-097-4 |page= 176 |accessdate= August 12, 2012 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VtAmmwapfVAC | quote = Much has been made of the scarcity of pig bones at highland sites. Since small quantities of pig bones do appear in Late Bronze Age assemblages, some archaeologists have interpreted this to indicate that the ethnic identity of the highland inhabitants was distinct from Late Bronze Age indigenous peoples (see Finkelstein 1997, 227\u2013230). Brian Hesse and Paula Wapnish (1997) advise caution, however, since the lack of pig bones at Iron I highland settlements could be a result of other factors that have little to do with ethnicity.}}</ref>\n\nFor several hundred years, the [[Land of Israel]] was organized into a confederacy of twelve tribes ruled by a series of [[Biblical judges|Judges]].

The first Jewish communities in Babylonia started with the exile of the Tribe of Judah to Babylon by [[Jehoiachin]] in 597 BCE as well as after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 586 BCE.<ref name=\"Translation 1981, pg. 95\"/> Many more Jews migrated to Babylon in 135 CE after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] and in the centuries after.<ref name=\"Translation 1981, pg. 95\"/> Babylonia, where some of the largest and most prominent Jewish cities and communities were established, became the center of Jewish life all the way up to the 13th century. By the first century, Babylonia already held a speedily growing<ref name=\"Translation 1981, pg. 95\"/> population of an estimated 1,000,000 Jews, which increased to an estimated 2 million<ref name=\"Solomon Gryazel p. 137\"/> between the years 200 CE and 500 CE, both by natural growth and by immigration of more Jews from the Land of Israel, making up about 1/6 of the world Jewish population at that era.<ref name=\"Solomon Gryazel p. 137\"/> It was there that they would write the Babylonian [[Talmud]] in the languages used by the Jews of ancient Babylonia: [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]]. The Jews established [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], also known as the Geonic Academies (\"Geonim\" meaning \"splendour\" in Biblical Hebrew or \"geniuses\"), which became the center for Jewish scholarship and the development of Jewish law in Babylonia from roughly 500 CE to 1038 CE. The two most famous academies were the [[Pumbedita Academy]] and the [[Sura Academy]]. Major yeshivot were also located at [[Nehardea]] and Mahuza. The Talmudic [[Yeshiva]] Academies became a main part of Jewish culture and education, and Jews continued on establishing Yeshiva Academies in Western and Eastern Europe, North Africa, and in the centuries later on to America and other countries around the world where Jews lived in the Diaspora. Talmudic study in [[Yeshiva]] academies continue today with the establishment of many Yeshiva academies, most of them located in The United States and [[State of Israel|Israel]].\n\nThese Talmudic [[Yeshiva]] academies of Babylonia followed the era of the [[Amoraim]] (\"expounders\")\u2014the sages of the Talmud who were active (both in the [[Land of Israel]] and in Babylon) during the end of the era of the sealing of the [[Mishnah]] and until the times of the sealing of the Talmud (220CE \u2013 500CE), and following the [[Savoraim]] (\"reasoners\")\u2014the sages of Beth midrash (Torah study places) in Babylon from the end of the era of the Amoraim (5th century) and until the beginning of the era of the [[Geonim]]. The Geonim (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd) were the presidents of the two great rabbinical colleges of Sura and Pumbedita, and were the generally accepted spiritual leaders of the worldwide Jewish community in the early medieval era, in contrast to the [[Resh Galuta]] (Exilarch) who wielded secular authority over the Jews in Islamic lands. According to traditions, the [[Resh Galuta]] were descendants of Judean kings, which is why the kings of [[Parthia]] would treat them with much honour.<ref>[\u05de\u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05e0\u05d3 \u05d5\u05d1\u05e6\u05dc\u05d0\u05dc \u05e1. \u05e8\u05d5\u05ea\u05ea \"\u05e2\u05dd \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u2013 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea 4000 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u2013 \u05de\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d7\u05d5\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd\", \u05e2\"\u05de 97.

Ruth ''The People of Israel: The History of 4,000 Years, from the Days of the Forefathers to the Peace Treaty'', 1981, p. 97)</ref>\n\nFor the Jews of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the yeshivot of Babylonia served much the same function as the ancient [[Sanhedrin]]. That is, as a council of Jewish religious authorities. The academies were founded in pre-Islamic Babylonia under the Zoroastrian Sassanid dynasty and were located not far from the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, which at that time was the largest city in the world. After the conquest of Persia in the 7th century, the academies subsequently operated for four hundred years under the Islamic caliphate. The first gaon of Sura, according to [[Sherira Gaon]], was Mar bar Rab Chanan, who assumed office in 609. The last gaon of [[Sura]] was [[Samuel ben Hofni]], who died in 1034; the last gaon of Pumbedita was [[Hezekiah Gaon]], who was tortured to death in 1040; hence the activity of the Geonim covers a period of nearly 450 years.\n\nOne of principal seats of Babylonian Judaism was [[Nehardea]], which was then a very large city made up mostly of Jews.<ref name=\"Translation 1981, pg. 95\"/> A very ancient synagogue, built, it was believed, by King Jehoiachin, existed in Nehardea. At Huzal, near Nehardea, there was another synagogue, not far from which could be seen the ruins of Ezra's academy. In the period before Hadrian, Akiba, on his arrival at Nehardea on a mission from the Sanhedrin, entered into a discussion with a resident scholar on a point of matrimonial law (Mishnah Yeb., end). At the same time there was at Nisibis (northern [[Mesopotamia]]), an excelling Jewish college, at the head of which stood Judah ben Bathyra, and in which many Judean scholars found refuge at the time of the persecutions. A certain temporary importance was also attained by a school at Nehar-Pe\u1e33od, founded by the Judean immigrant Hananiah, nephew of [[Joshua ben Hananiah]], which school might have been the cause of a schism between the Jews of Babylonia and those of Judea-Israel, had not the Judean authorities promptly checked Hananiah's ambition.\n\n===Byzantine period (324\u2013638 CE)===\n{{Main|Jews of Byzantium}}\nJews were also widespread throughout the Roman Empire, and this carried on to a lesser extent in the period of Byzantine rule in the central and eastern Mediterranean. The militant and exclusive Christianity and [[caesaropapism]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] did not treat Jews well, and the condition and influence of diaspora Jews in the Empire declined dramatically.\n\nIt was official Christian policy to convert Jews to [[Christianity]], and the Christian leadership used the official power of Rome in their attempts. In 351 CE the Jews revolted against the added pressures of their Governor, [[Constantius Gallus]]. Gallus put down the revolt and destroyed the major cities in the Galilee area where the revolt had started. Tzippori and Lydda (site of two of the major legal academies) never recovered.\n\nIn this period, the Nasi in Tiberias, Hillel II, created an official calendar, which needed no monthly sightings of the moon. The months were set, and the calendar needed no further authority from Judea. At about the same time, the Jewish academy at Tiberius began to collate the combined Mishnah, [[braitot]], explanations, and interpretations developed by generations of scholars who studied after the death of [[Judah HaNasi]]. The text was organized according to the order of the Mishna: each paragraph of Mishnah was followed by a compilation of all of the interpretations, stories, and responses associated with that Mishnah. This text is called the ''[[Jerusalem Talmud]].''\n\nThe Jews of Judea received a brief respite from official persecution during the rule of the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. Julian's policy was to return the kingdom to Hellenism and he encouraged the Jews to rebuild Jerusalem. As Julian's rule lasted briefly from 361 to 363, the Jews could not rebuild sufficiently before Roman Christian rule was restored over the Empire. Beginning in 398 with the consecration of [[St. John Chrysostom]] as [[Patriarch]], the Christian rhetoric against Jews continued to rise; he preached sermons with titles such as \"Against the Jews\" and \"On the Statues, Homily 17,\" in which John preaches against \"the Jewish sickness\".<ref>Wendy Mayer and [[Pauline Allen]], ''John Chrysostom: The Early Church Fathers'' (London, 2000), p. 113, 146.</ref> Such heated language contributed to a climate of Christian distrust and hate toward the large Jewish settlements, such as those in [[Antioch]] and [[Constantinople]].\n\nIn the beginning of the 5th century, the [[Emperor Theodosius]] issued a set of decrees establishing official persecution against Jews. Jews were not allowed to own slaves, build new synagogues, hold public office or try cases between a Jew and a non-Jew. Intermarriage between Jew and non-Jew was made a capital offense, as was a Christian converting to Judaism. Theodosius did away with the [[Sanhedrin]] and abolished the post of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]. Under the [[Emperor Justinian]], the authorities further restricted the civil rights of Jews,<ref>Cod., I., v. 12</ref> and threatened their religious privileges.<ref>Procopius, ''Historia Arcana'', 28</ref> The emperor interfered in the internal affairs of the synagogue,<ref>Nov., cxlvi., Feb. 8, 553</ref> and forbade, for instance, the use of the Hebrew language in divine worship. Those who disobeyed the restrictions were threatened with corporal penalties, exile, and loss of property. The Jews at Borium, not far from Syrtis Major, who resisted the Byzantine General [[Belisarius]] in his campaign against the [[Vandals]], were forced to embrace Christianity, and their synagogue was converted to a church.<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', vi. 2</ref>\n\nJustinian and his successors had concerns outside the province of Judea, and he had insufficient troops to enforce these regulations. As a result, the 5th century was a period when a wave of new synagogues were built, many with beautiful mosaic floors. Jews adopted the rich art forms of the Byzantine culture. Jewish mosaics of the period portray people, animals, menorahs, zodiacs, and Biblical characters. Excellent examples of these synagogue floors have been found at Beit Alpha (which includes the scene of Abraham sacrificing a ram instead of his son Isaac along with a zodiac), Tiberius, Beit Shean, and Tzippori.\n\nThe precarious existence of Jews under Byzantine rule did not long endure, largely for the explosion of the Muslim religion out of the remote Arabian peninsula (where large populations of Jews resided, see [[History of the Jews under Muslim Rule]] for more). The [[Muslim]] [[Caliphate]] ejected the Byzantines from the Holy Land (or the [[Levant]], defined as modern Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) within a few years of their victory at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636. Numerous Jews fled the remaining Byzantine territories in favour of residence in the Caliphate over the subsequent centuries.\n\nThe size of the Jewish community in the Byzantine Empire was not affected by attempts by some emperors (most notably Justinian) to forcibly convert the Jews of Anatolia to Christianity, as these attempts met with very little success.<ref>[[George Alexandrovi\u010d Ostrogorsky|G.

Jenkins ''Byzantium''; Averil Cameron, \"Byzantines and Jews: Recent Work on Early Byzantium\", ''Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies'' 20 (1996)).

During that time, [[Jews]] were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed.\n\nA period of tolerance thus dawned for the Jews of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest. Especially after 912, during the reign of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] and his son, [[Al-Hakam II]], the Jews prospered, devoting themselves to the service of the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]], to the study of the sciences, and to commerce and industry, especially to trading in silk and slaves, in this way promoting the prosperity of the country. Jewish economic expansion was unparalleled. In [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the [[Romance languages]], as well as translating Greek and Hebrew texts into Arabic.

[[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] were said to have attended his lectures, among them Aaron ben Joseph the Elder. He later became one of the greatest [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaite]] authorities. Shortly after Nahmanides' arrival in Jerusalem, he addressed a letter to his son Nahman, in which he described the desolation of the Holy City. At the time, it had only two Jewish inhabitants\u2014two brothers, dyers by trade. In a later letter from Acre, Nahmanides counsels his son to cultivate humility, which he considers to be the first of virtues. In another, addressed to his second son, who occupied an official position at the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] court, Nahmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality. Nahmanides died after reaching seventy-six, and his remains were interred at [[Haifa]], by the grave of [[Yechiel of Paris]].\n\nYechiel had [[aliyah|emigrated]] to Acre in 1260, along with his son and a large group of followers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/places/acco.html |title=Jewish Zionist Education |publisher=Jafi.org.il |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013142810/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/places/acco.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lookstein.org/resources/bionotes.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502035808/http://www.lookstein.org/resources/bionotes.pdf |archive-date=May 2, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There he established the Tamudic academy ''Midrash haGadol d'Paris''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishhistory.com/jh.php?id=AdditionalReadings&content=content/segal_ch17 |title=Section III: The Biblical Age: Chapter Seventeen: Awaiting the Messiah |author=Benjamin J.

Before the Church became fully organized as an institution with an increasing array of rules, early medieval society was tolerant. Between 800 and 1100, an estimated 1.5 million Jews lived in Christian Europe. As they were not Christians, they were not included as a [[Estates of the realm|division]] of the feudal system of clergy, knights and serfs. This means that they did not have to satisfy the oppressive demands for labor and military conscription that Christian commoners suffered. In relations with the Christian society, the Jews were protected by kings, princes and bishops, because of the crucial services they provided in three areas: finance, administration and medicine.<ref name=\"Cantor\"/> The lack of political strengths did leave Jews vulnerable to exploitation through extreme taxation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ebenhard Isenmann|editor=Richard Bonney|title=The Rise of the Fiscal State in Europe c.1200\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U24lRLy_qT8C&pg=PA259|date=2 September 1999|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-154220-6|pages=259\u2013}}</ref>\n\nChristian scholars interested in the Bible consulted with Talmudic rabbis. As the Roman Catholic Church strengthened as an institution, the Franciscan and Dominican preaching orders were founded, and there was a rise of competitive middle-class, town-dwelling Christians. By 1300, the friars and local priests staged the Passion Plays during Holy Week, which depicted Jews (in contemporary dress) killing Christ, according to Gospel accounts. From this period, persecution of Jews and deportations became endemic. Around 1500, Jews found relative security and a renewal of prosperity in present-day [[Poland]].<ref name=\"Cantor\">Norman F.

Europe's Jewry was mainly urban and literate. The Christians were inclined to regard Jews as obstinate deniers of the truth because in their view the Jews were expected to know of the truth of the Christian doctrines from their knowledge of the Jewish scriptures.

A common approach has been to view the process through the lens of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as Jews faced the promise and the challenges posed by political emancipation. Scholars that use this approach have focused on two social types as paradigms for the decline of Jewish tradition and as agents of the sea changes in Jewish culture that led to the collapse of the [[ghetto]]. The first of these two social types is the [[Court Jew]] who is portrayed as a forerunner of the modern Jew, having achieved integration with and participation in the proto-capitalist economy and court society of central European states such as the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. In contrast to the cosmopolitan Court Jew, the second social type presented by historians of modern Jewry is the ''maskil'', (learned person), a proponent of the [[Haskalah]] (Enlightenment). This narrative sees the maskil's pursuit of secular scholarship and his rationalistic critiques of rabbinic tradition as laying a durable intellectual foundation for the secularization of Jewish society and culture. The established paradigm has been one in which Ashkenazic Jews entered modernity through a self-conscious process of westernization led by \"highly atypical, Germanized Jewish intellectuals\". Haskalah gave birth to the Reform and Conservative movements and planted the seeds of [[Zionism]] while at the same time encouraging cultural assimilation into the countries in which Jews resided.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reframing Jewish History |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10513 |accessdate=2011-05-24}}</ref>\nAt around the same time that Haskalah was developing, [[Hasidic Judaism]] was spreading as a movement that preached a world view almost opposed to the Haskalah.\n\nIn the 1990s, the concept of the \"[[Port Jew]]\" has been suggested as an \"alternate path to modernity\" that was distinct from the European [[Haskalah]]. In contrast to the focus on Ashkenazic Germanized Jews, the concept of the Port Jew focused on the Sephardi conversos who fled the Inquisition and resettled in European port towns on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and the Eastern seaboard of the United States.<ref name=HelenFry>{{cite journal |title=Port Jews: Jewish Communities in Cosmopolitan Maritime Trading Centres, 1550\u20131950 |first=Helen P. |last=Fry|journal=European Judaism |volume= 36 |publisher=Frank Cass Publishers |year=2002 |ISBN=978-0-7146-8286-0|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5002650793 |quote=Port Jews were a social type, usually those who were involved in seafaring and maritime trade, who (like Court Jews) could be seen as the earliest modern Jews.

'Their Diaspora connections and accumulated expertise lay in exactly the areas of overseas expansion that were then of interest to mercantilist governments.'}}</ref>\n\n===Court Jew===\n{{main|Court Jew|shtadlan}}\n[[Court Jew]]s were [[Jew]]ish [[banker]]s or businessmen who lent money and handled the finances of some of the [[Christians|Christian]] [[Europe]]an noble houses. Corresponding historical terms are ''Jewish [[bailiff]]'' and ''[[shtadlan]]''.\n\nExamples of what would be later called court Jews emerged when local rulers used services of Jewish bankers for short-term loans. They lent money to nobles and in the process gained social influence. Noble patrons of court Jews employed them as [[financier]]s, suppliers, [[diplomat]]s and [[trade delegate]]s. Court Jews could use their family connections, and connections between each other, to provision their sponsors with, among other things, food, arms, ammunition and precious metals. In return for their services, court Jews gained social privileges, including up to noble status for themselves, and could live outside the Jewish ghettos. Some nobles wanted to keep their bankers in their own courts. And because they were under noble protection, they were exempted from [[rabbi]]nical jurisdiction.\n\nFrom medieval times, court Jews could amass personal fortunes and gained political and social influence. Sometimes they were also prominent people in the local Jewish community and could use their influence to protect and influence their brethren. Sometimes they were the only Jews who could interact with the local high society and present petitions of the Jews to the ruler. However, the court Jew had social connections and influence in the Christian world mainly through his Christian patrons. Due to the precarious position of Jews, some nobles could just ignore their debts. If the sponsoring noble died, his Jewish financier could face exile or execution.{{Citation needed| date=February 2012}}\n\n===Spain and Portugal===\nSignificant repression of Spain's numerous community occurred during the 14th century, notably a [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacres and mass conversions of 1391|major pogrom in 1391]] which resulted in the majority of Spain's 300,000 Jews converting to Catholicism. With the [[Granada War|conquest of the Muslim Kingdom of Granada]] in 1492, the Catholic monarchs issued the [[Alhambra Decree]] whereby Spain's remaining 100,000 Jews were forced to choose between conversion and exile. As a result, an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 Jews left Spain, the remainder joining Spain's already numerous Converso community. Perhaps a quarter of a million Conversos thus were gradually absorbed by the dominant Catholic culture, although those among them who secretly practiced Judaism were subject to 40 years of intense repression by the Spanish Inquisition. This was particularly the case up until 1530, after which the trials of Conversos by the Inquisition dropped to 3% of the total. Similar expulsions of Sephardic Jews occurred 1493 in [[Sicily]] (37,000 Jews) and Portugal in 1496. The expelled Spanish Jews fled mainly to the Ottoman Empire and North Africa and Portugal. A small number also settled in Holland and England.\n\n===Port Jew===\n{{main|Port Jew}}\n\nThe [[Port Jew]] describes Jews who were involved in the seafaring and maritime economy of Europe, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries. Helen Fry suggests that they could be considered to have been \"the earliest modern Jews\". According to Fry, Port Jews often arrived as \"refugees from the Inquisition\" and the expulsion of Jews from Iberia. They were allowed to settle in port cities as merchants granted permission to trade in ports such as Amsterdam, London, Trieste and Hamburg. Fry notes that their connections with the [[Jewish Diaspora]] and their expertise in maritime trade made them of particular interest to the mercantilist governments of Europe.<ref name=HelenFry /> Lois Dubin describes Port Jews as Jewish merchants who were \"valued for their engagement in the international maritime trade upon which such cities thrived\".<ref>Dubin p. 47</ref> Sorkin and others have characterized the socio-cultural profile of these men as marked by a flexibility towards religion and a \"reluctant cosmopolitanism that was alien to both traditional and 'enlightened' Jewish identities\".\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n{{Main|History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire}}\n\nDuring the Classical Ottoman period (1300\u20131600), the Jews, together with most other communities of the empire, enjoyed a certain level of prosperity. Compared with other Ottoman subjects, they were the predominant power in commerce and trade as well in diplomacy and other high offices. In the 16th century especially, the Jews were the most prominent under the ''millets'', the apogee of Jewish influence could arguably be the appointment of [[Joseph Nasi]] to [[Sanjak-bey]] (''governor'', a rank usually only bestowed upon Muslims) of the island of [[Naxos Island|Naxos]].<ref>Charles Issawi & Dmitri Gondicas; ''Ottoman Greeks in the Age of Nationalism'', Princeton, (1999)</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[Battle of Yarmuk]] when the [[Levant]] passed under Muslim Rule, thirty Jewish communities existed in Haifa, Sh\u2019chem, Hebron, Ramleh, Gaza, Jerusalem, and many in the north. Safed became a spiritual centre for the Jews and the [[Shulchan Aruch]] was compiled there as well as many Kabbalistic texts. The first Hebrew printing press, and the first printing in Western Asia began in 1577.\n\nJews lived in the geographic area of Asia Minor (modern Turkey, but more geographically either Anatolia or Asia Minor) for more than 2,400 years. Initial prosperity in Hellenistic times had faded under Christian Byzantine rule, but recovered somewhat under the rule of the various Muslim governments that displaced and succeeded rule from Constantinople. For much of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, Turkey was a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, and it continues to have a small Jewish population today. The situation where Jews both enjoyed cultural and economical prosperity at times but were widely persecuted at other times was summarised by G.E. Von Grunebaum :\n\n<blockquote>It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizeable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.<ref>G.E. Von Grunebaum, ''Eastern Jewry Under Islam'', 1971, p. 369.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Poland-Lithuania===\n{{Further|History of Jews in Poland}}\n\nIn the 17th century, there were many significant Jewish populations in Western Europe. The relatively tolerant Poland had the largest Jewish population in Europe that dated back to 13th century and enjoyed relative prosperity and freedom for nearly four hundred years; however the calm situation there ended when Polish and Lithuanian Jews were slaughtered in the hundreds of thousands by the cossacks during [[Chmielnicki uprising]] (1648) and by the [[Swedish wars]] (1655). Driven by these and other persecutions, Jews moved back to Western Europe in the 17th century. The last ban on Jews (by the English) was revoked in 1654, but periodic expulsions from individual cities still occurred, and Jews were often restricted from land ownership, or forced to live in [[ghettos]].\n\nWith the [[Partition of Poland]] in the late 18th century, the Jewish population was split between the [[Russian Empire]], [[Austro-Hungary]], and [[Prussia]], which divided [[Poland]] for themselves.\n\n===The European Enlightenment and Haskalah (18th century)===\nDuring the period of the [[European Renaissance]] and Enlightenment, significant changes occurred within the Jewish community. The [[Haskalah]] movement paralleled the wider Enlightenment, as Jews in the 18th century began to campaign for emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider European society. Secular and scientific education was added to the traditional religious instruction received by students, and interest in a national Jewish identity, including a revival in the study of Jewish history and Hebrew, started to grow. Haskalah gave birth to the Reform and Conservative movements and planted the seeds of [[Zionism]] while at the same time encouraging cultural assimilation into the countries in which Jews resided. At around the same time another movement was born, one preaching almost the opposite of Haskalah, [[Hasidic Judaism]]. Hasidic Judaism began in the 18th century by [[Baal Shem Tov|Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov]], and quickly gained a following with its more exuberant, mystical approach to religion. These two movements, and the traditional orthodox approach to Judaism from which they spring, formed the basis for the modern divisions within Jewish observance.\n\nAt the same time, the outside world was changing, and debates began over the potential emancipation of the Jews (granting them equal rights). The first country to do so was France, during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. Even so, Jews were expected to assimilate, not continue their traditions. This ambivalence is demonstrated in the famous speech of [[Clermont-Tonnerre]] before the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in 1789:\n\n<blockquote>We must refuse everything to the Jews as a nation and accord everything to Jews as individuals. We must withdraw recognition from their judges; they should only have our judges. We must refuse legal protection to the maintenance of the so-called laws of their Judaic organization; they should not be allowed to form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to me, they do not want to be citizens. Well then! If they do not want to be citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them. It is repugnant to have in the state an association of non-citizens, and a nation within the nation...</blockquote>\n\n===Hasidic Judaism===\n{{see also|Mitnagdim}}\n[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Hasidic Jews praying in the synagogue on [[Yom Kippur]], by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]]]]\n\n[[Hasidic Judaism]] is a branch of [[Orthodox Judaism]] that promotes spirituality and joy through the popularisation and internalisation of [[Jewish mysticism]] as the fundamental aspects of the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]]. Hasidism comprises part of contemporary [[Haredi|Ultra-Orthodox]] Judaism, alongside the previous Talmudic [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian-Yeshiva]] approach and the Oriental [[Sephardi Judaism|Sephardi]] tradition.\n\nIt was founded in 18th-century [[Eastern Europe]] by Rabbi Israel [[Baal Shem Tov]] as a reaction against overly [[Talmud|legalistic]] Judaism. Opposite to this, Hasidic teachings cherished the sincerity and concealed holiness of the unlettered common folk, and their equality with the scholarly elite. The emphasis on the [[Divine immanence|Immanent]] Divine presence in everything gave new value to prayer and deeds of kindness, alongside Rabbinic supremacy of [[Torah study|study]], and replaced historical [[Kabbalah|mystical (kabbalistic)]] and [[Musar literature|ethical (musar)]] [[Asceticism in Judaism|asceticism]] and [[Maggid|admonishment]] with optimism, encouragement, and daily [[Deveikut|fervour]]. This populist emotional revival accompanied the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical Divine [[Panentheism]], through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of mystical thought. The adjustment of Jewish values sought to add to required standards of ritual [[Halacha|observance]], while relaxing others where inspiration predominated. Its communal gatherings celebrate soulful [[Nigun|song]] and [[Yiddish literature#Hasidic and Haskalah literature|storytelling]] as forms of mystical devotion.{{Citation needed| date=February 2012}}\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Napoleon stellt den israelitischen Kult wieder her, 30. Mai 1806.jpg|thumb|right|275px|An 1806 French print depicts [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] emancipating the Jews.]]\nThough persecution still existed, emancipation spread throughout Europe in the 19th century. [[Napoleon]] invited Jews to leave the [[Jewish ghettos in Europe]] and seek refuge in the newly created tolerant political regimes that offered equality under Napoleonic Law (see [[Napoleon and the Jews]]). By 1871, with Germany's emancipation of Jews, every European country except Russia had emancipated its Jews.\n\nDespite increasing integration of the Jews with secular society, a new form of anti-Semitism emerged, based on the ideas of race and nationhood rather than the religious hatred of the Middle Ages. This form of anti-Semitism held that Jews were a separate and inferior race from the [[Aryan]] people of Western Europe, and led to the emergence of political parties in France, Germany, and Austria-Hungary that campaigned on a platform of rolling back emancipation. This form of anti-Semitism emerged frequently in European culture, most famously in the [[Dreyfus Trial]] in France. These persecutions, along with state-sponsored [[pogrom]]s in Russia in the late 19th century, led a number of Jews to believe that they would only be safe in their own nation. See [[Theodor Herzl]] and [[History of Zionism]].\n\nDuring this period, Jewish migration to the [[United States]] (see [[American Jews]]) created a large new community mostly freed of the restrictions of Europe. Over 2 million Jews arrived in the United States between 1890 and 1924, most from Russia and Eastern Europe.

Later on, the \"[[Bilu]]\" movement established many other settlements in the land of Israel.\n\nThe Zionist movement was founded officially after the [[Kattowitz convention]] (1884) and the [[World Zionist Congress]] (1897), and it was [[Theodor Herzl]] who began the struggle to establish a state for the Jews.\n\nAfter the [[First World War]], it seemed that the conditions to establish such a state had arrived: The United Kingdom captured [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the Jews received the promise of a \"National Home\" from the British in the form of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], given to [[Chaim Weizmann]].\n\nIn 1920 the British Mandate of Palestine began and the pro-Jewish [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] was appointed High Commissioner in Palestine, the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] was established and several big Jewish immigration waves to Palestine occurred. The Arab co-inhabitants of Palestine were hostile to increasing Jewish immigration however, and began to oppose Jewish settlement and the pro-Jewish policy of the British government by violent means.\n\nArab gangs began performing violent acts and murders on convoys and on the Jewish population. After the 1920 [[1920 Palestine riots|Arab riots]] and 1921 [[Jaffa riots]], the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British had no desire to confront local Arab gangs over their attacks on Palestinian Jews. Believing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs, the Jewish leadership created the Haganah organization to protect their farms and Kibbutzim.\n\nMajor riots occurred during the [[1929 Palestine riots]] and the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine]].\n\nDue to the increasing violence the United Kingdom gradually started to backtrack from the original idea of a Jewish state and to speculate on a [[binational solution]] or an Arab state that would have a Jewish minority.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jews of Europe and the United States gained success in the fields of the science, culture and the economy. Among those generally considered the most famous were scientist [[Albert Einstein]] and philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. A disproportionate number of [[Nobel Prize]] winners at this time were Jewish, as is still the case.<ref name=\"Jewish Nobel Prize Winners\"/> In Russia, many Jews were involved in the [[October Revolution]] and belonged to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].\n\n===The Holocaust===\n{{Main|History of the Jews during World War II|The Holocaust}}\n[[File:Razzia in een getto (detail).jpg|110px|thumb|A boy raises his hands when the Jews leave the bunkers after the submission of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]]]\n[[File:Rows of bodies of dead inmates fill the yard of Lager Nordhausen, a Gestapo concentration camp.jpg|left|thumb|Bodies of inmates of the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] Nazi concentration camp who died during British [[Bombing of Nordhausen in World War II|bombing raids]] on April 3 and 4, 1945]]\nIn 1933, with the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi party]] in Germany, the Jewish situation became more severe. Economic crises, racial [[Anti-Jewish laws]], and a fear of an upcoming war led many Jews to flee from Europe to Palestine, to the United States and to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1939 [[World War II]] began and until 1941 [[Hitler]] occupied almost all of Europe, including Poland\u2014where millions of Jews were living at that time\u2014and France. In 1941, following the invasion of the Soviet Union, the [[Final Solution]] began, an extensive organized operation on an unprecedented scale, aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people, and resulting in the persecution and murder of Jews in political Europe, inclusive of European North Africa (pro-Nazi Vichy-North Africa and Italian Libya). This [[genocide]], in which approximately six million Jews were murdered methodically and with horrifying cruelty, is known as [[The Holocaust]] or ''Shoah'' (Hebrew term). In Poland, one million Jews were murdered in [[gas chambers]] at the [[Auschwitz]] camp complex  alone.\n\nThe massive scale of the Holocaust, and the horrors that happened during it, heavily affected the Jewish nation and world public opinion, which only understood the dimensions of the Holocaust after the war. Efforts were then increased to establish a Jewish state in Palestine.\n\n===The establishment of the State of Israel===\n{{Main|History of Israel}}\n{{See also|Israel|Declaration of Independence (Israel)}}\n{{History of Israel}}\nIn 1945 the Jewish resistance organizations in Palestine unified and established the Jewish Resistance Movement. The movement began attacking the British authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/resist.html |title=The Jewish Resistance Movement |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref> Following the [[King David Hotel bombing]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], president of the [[WZO]] appealed to the movement to cease all further military activity until a decision would be reached by the [[Jewish Agency]]. The Jewish Agency backed Weizmann's recommendation to cease activities, a decision reluctantly accepted by the Haganah, but not by the Irgun and the Lehi. The JRM was dismantled and each of the founding groups continued operating according to their own policy.<ref>Horne, Edward (1982).

But remained permanently uncooperative.</ref>\n\nThe Jewish leadership decided to center the struggle in the illegal immigration to Palestine and began organizing a massive number of Jewish war refugees from Europe, without the approval of the British authorities. This immigration contributed a great deal to the Jewish settlements in Israel in the world public opinion and the British authorities decided to let the United Nations decide upon the fate of Palestine.{{Citation needed| date=February 2012}}\n\nOn November 29, 1947, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted [[Resolution 181]](II) recommending partitioning Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish leadership accepted the decision but the Arab League and the leadership of Palestinian Arabs opposed it. Following a period of [[1947\u20131948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] started.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn the middle of the war, after the last soldiers of the British mandate left Palestine, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed on May 14, 1948, the establishment of a [[Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel]] to be known as the [[State of Israel]]. In 1949 the war ended and the state of Israel started building the state and absorbing massive waves of hundreds of thousands of Jews from all over the world.\n\nSince 1948, Israel has been involved in a series of major military conflicts, including the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], 1967 [[Six-Day War]], 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], [[1982 Lebanon War]], and [[2006 Lebanon War]], as well as a nearly constant series of ongoing minor conflicts.\n\nSince 1977, an ongoing and largely unsuccessful series of diplomatic efforts have been initiated by Israel, Palestinian organisations, their neighbours, and other parties, including the United States and the European Union, to bring about a [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process|peace process]] to resolve conflicts between Israel and its neighbors, mostly over the fate of the Palestinian people.\n\n==21st century==\n[[Israel]] is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with a population of over 8 million people, of whom about 6 million are [[Israeli Jews|Jewish]]. The largest Jewish communities are in Israel and the [[American Jews|United States]], with major communities in France, Argentina, Russia, England, and Canada. For statistics related to modern Jewish demographics see ''[[Jewish population]]''.\n\nThe [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], created during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, continues to be an [[autonomous oblast]] of the Russian state.<ref>Fishkoff, Sue (October 8, 2008).
