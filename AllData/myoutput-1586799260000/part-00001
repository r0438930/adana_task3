The headquarters are in [[Wald-Michelbach]], [[Germany]]. The team currently competes in the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] as '''Mazda Team Joest''' under a works contract with [[Mazda]].\n\n==Early years==\nAs a combined driver/team owner, Reinhold Joest first began to race a [[Porsche 908|Porsche 908/3]] in the [[European Sportscar Championship]], winning the driver's title. He then switched to [[Porsche 935]]s, winning the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1980. The team won the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft|DRM]] back to back with driver [[Bob Wollek]], in 1982 and 1983. During the 1982 season, whilst the [[Porsche 956]] was only available to the works team, Joest adapted a roof onto a [[Porsche 936]] to enter the [[Group C]] [[World Sportscar Championship|World Endurance Championship]]. They would race the car into the 1983 season until they took delivery of their 956 prior to Le Mans.\n\n==Le Mans successes==\nIn [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|1984]], in absence of the works team, Joest Racing would score the first of their thirteen wins at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], with [[Klaus Ludwig]] and [[Henri Pescarolo]] driving their \"lucky #7\" car a Porsche 956, chassis number 117. In [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans|1985]], the works team returned, and despite having little factory support, they defended their title with Ludwig, [[Paolo Barilla]] and incognito German businessman \"[[Louis Krages|John Winter]]\" driving the #7 chassis number 117 again. This would make them the second team to score back to back wins with the same car, the other being [[John Wyer|JW Automotive]] whose [[Ford GT40|Ford GT40 Mk.I]] won in [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]] and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]].\n\nIn 1986, 1988, and 1989 Joest won the [[Supercup]] title for teams and Wollek winning the drivers cup in 1989. They also took the [[Interserie]] title for drivers with Winter in 1985 and [[Bernd Schneider (racecar driver)|Bernd Schneider]] in 1991, and the teams title in 1991.\n[[Image:962 Joest 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Joest Racing's [[Porsche 962]] which they used in the [[IMSA GT Championship]].]]\nIn 1989, [[FIA]] introduced the new 3.5 litre [[Formula One]] engine rule to Group C, which not many teams were happy about, because few, if any, such engines were available to privateer teams like Joest. The previous fuel economy based rules were gradually phased out in favour of short races with cars that were virtually two-seater Formula 1 cars; existing Group C cars such as Joest's Porsche 962s were given higher weights and lower fuel allocation to make them less competitive. The team would instead compete in the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[IMSA GT Championship|GTP category]] beginning in 1990, winning the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1991 with Wollek, Pescarolo, [[Frank Jelinski]], \"Winter\" and [[Hurley Haywood]]. With their [[Porsche 962]] now being outmoded by the [[Nissan]]s, [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]s and [[Toyota]]s, the team would not score any more victories. In 1993, the Nissan and [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing|TWR]] [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] team had withdrawn, and the [[All American Racers|AAR Eagle]] [[Toyota]] would continue to dominate the series final year. Joest managed to score the car's last IMSA victory at the [[Road America 500]], due to Toyota's absence.\n\n==Joest and Opel==\nIn the 1990s, the team also had a successful career developing and racing an [[Opel Calibra]] in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (DTM). They first won the ITR Gold Cup at the [[Donington Park]] round in 1994 with [[Manuel Reuter]] driving, when the leading [[Alfa Romeo]] of [[Alessandro Nannini]] was disqualified for running out of fuel. They would continue to have a successful career there by the time the series became a full-fledged international championship (ITC), winning the title for the final year in 1996 for [[Opel]].\n\n==Return to Le Mans==\n[[Image:Porsche LMP1 '98 - WSC-002 No. 8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|WSC-95 chassis #002 on display in its 1998 Porsche LMP1-98 guise.]]\nIn late 1995, [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] were commissioned by Porsche to produce a [[World Sportscar Championship|WSC]] car to compete in the 1996 Daytona 24-hour race. The resulting [[Porsche WSC-95]] was based on the TWR's 1991  [[Jaguar XJR-14]] chassis, with the roof removed and a flat-six Porsche engine fitted. The car was withdrawn because of a sudden rule change. For 1996 the concept was revived and Joest were chosen to run the WSC-95s at [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] as backup for Porsche's own team of works [[Porsche 911 GT1|911 GT1s]]. Joest won the race with [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]], [[Manuel Reuter]], and [[Alexander Wurz]]. They returned in [[1997 24 Hours of Le Mans|1997]], this time without works support, but again with the same car wearing #7. The winning pilots were by [[Michele Alboreto]], [[Stefan Johansson]] and [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], the latter scoring the first of his nine wins. As with the #7 956 of the 1980s, Joest attempted for a third straight win, although without success, as neither car finished, while Porsche itself prevailed in the [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans|1998 race]].\n\n==Audi Sport Team Joest==\n[[File:Audi Sport Team Joest Tent Sebring 2012.jpg|thumb|left|The Joest Racing team at work on their cars before dawn for the [[2012 12 Hours of Sebring]].]]\n[[Image:Audi R8 LeMans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Joest's successful Audi R8, winner three years in a row.]]\nIn 1998, after being associated with Porsche for many years, the team signed a works contract with [[Audi]] (its CEO being [[Ferdinand Piech]], a grandson of Porsche) to support them for the [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Joest helped them build and develop the [[Audi R8R]]. Audi, not being sure which concept was the better one, also supported an LM-GTP entry, the R8C, developed by [[Racing Technology Norfolk|RTN]]. While the British R8Cs never worked properly, the two Joest R8R were reliable, yet too slow to finish better than 3rd and 4th against one of the works [[BMW V12 LMR]] and a [[Toyota GT-One]].\n\nAudi and Joest went back to develop the highly successful R8, winning its maiden race at the [[2000 12 Hours of Sebring]], and going on the win at [[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]]. Between 2000 and 2002, the R8 cars took a hat-trick of wins at Le Mans, Sebring, and [[Petit Le Mans]], as well as [[American Le Mans Series]] titles in each year.\n\nAudi scaled their sports car racing operation down at the end of 2002, preferring to focus their attention on the [[Bentley Speed 8]] for a year, allowing it to win in 2003 (with support by Joest mechanics).  In 2004, Audi returned to [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] [[touring car racing]], now officially backing up the [[Abt Sportsline]] effort which had been called \"private\" since 2000. Joest and Abt fielded [[Audi A4]]s in the series.\n\nIn 2006, Joest began racing the new [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered [[Audi R10]] sports car. They began the 2006 season with a win at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], and took also the [[2006 24 Hours of Le Mans]], replicating that performance [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans|a year later]] and again in 2008, both times against Peugeot's diesel [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|908 HDi FAP]] coupe.\n\nIn 2009, Joest and Audi introduced the [[Audi R15]] sports car, the replacement for the R10. However, reliability issues allowed Peugeot to finish first and second at the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with their 908 HDi FAP which had been perfected over its three-year history.\n\nIn an answer to the 2009 issues, Audi reworked the R15 for 2010 (under the '''R15 TDI plus''' designation) with a higher reliability factor; unexpected Peugeot reliability issues of the 908 HDi FAP forced all four cars (including one by [[Oreca]]) to retire before the end of the race and resulted in a clean sweep of the podium in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with all three cars running farther than the former {{24hLM|1971}} race record, despite that the R15s were not using the V10 [[Turbo Direct Injection|TDI]] engines at full and were not running faster than the four 908s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&sprache=e |title=Audi achieves record victory at Le Mans with new technology |work=joest-racing.de; [[Audi#Motorsports|Audi Sport]] |publisher=Joest Racing |date=2010-06-13 |accessdate=2010-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719050259/http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&sprache=e |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the [[Audi R18]] TDI won the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] despite the loss of 2 cars and a ferocious pace from the opposing Peugeots. The R18s failed to win any of the other races in the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] that year, however, handing the team and drive titles to Peugeot.\n\nFor the first part of 2012, with the collapse of the Peugeot racing program, Audi has run near-unopposed in the first races of the 2012 [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The R18 TDI won the [[2012 12 Hours of Sebring]] in its last race and its successor, the Audi R18 Ultra, won the [[2012 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps]] with the related R18 E-Tron Quattro finishing in 2nd place. In the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans, Joest Racing Audis won the top 3 positions with two R18 E-Tron Quattros finishing 1st and 2nd and one Audi R18 Ultra taking 3rd.\n\nAfter Le Mans, Audi won 2 further rounds of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], the [[2012 6 Hours of Silverstone]] and the [[2012 6 Hours of Bahrain]]. While handing the other three rounds to Toyota, Audi would win the LMP1 Manufacturer Championship 2012 and helped Andre Lotterer, Bernoit Treleuyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler to become Driver World Endurance Champions 2012.\n\nIn late 2016, [[Audi Sport]] announced that they would leave the FIA World Endurance Championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/126838|title=Audi WEC Team confirms that they will not be returning to the World Endurance Championship for the 2017 Season.|last=|first=|date=11 November 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=11 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==GT3==\nAudi Sport Team Joest entered a pair of [[Audi R8#Motorsport|Audi R8 LMS GT3's]] in the [[2011 Armor All Bathurst 12 Hour|2011 Bathurst 12 Hour]] held at the [[Mount Panorama Circuit]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Australia]] on 6 February. Both cars qualified on the front row with the team of Marc Basseng, Christopher Mies and [[Darryl O'Young]] leading home Australian team mates Mark Eddy, [[Craig Lowndes]] and [[Warren Luff]] in a 1-2 finish. With both cars on the same lap racing for the win, the margin was only 0.7141 between the two at the end of 12 hours of racing. The Joest Racing R8's finished one lap in front of the VIP Pet Foods Racing [[Porsche 997|Porsche 997 GT3 Cup R]] of [[Craig Baird]] and father and son pairing Tony and Klark Quinn.\n\nIt was Joest's 2nd win in Australia in two starts having previously won the ALMS [[Race of a Thousand Years]] on 31 December 2000 with [[Rinaldo Capello|Dindo Capello]] and [[Allan McNish]] winning in an [[Audi R8 (LMP)|Audi R8]] [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]] on the old [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Grand Prix circuit]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. Capello easily put the R8 on pole position, while McNish was actually laid up with a bad back after he put it out when stepping out of his [[Kilt]] after a pre-event photo shoot. They also had to drive a repaired car after Capello put the crocodile liveried car into the tyre barriers in the race morning warm up session. Despite his troubles, McNish started the race and set the fastest lap. He also drove the 25 laps required and wrapped up the inaugural ALMS Drivers' title as a result.\n\n==Mazda Team Joest==\nOn 18 July 2017 it was announced that Joest Racing would take over the operation of the [[Riley Mk. 30#Mazda RT24-P|Mazda RT24-P]] [[Daytona Prototype#Daytona Prototype International|Daytona Prototype International]] (DPi) entry in the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] for the [[2018 WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|2018]] season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2017/07/18/joest-to-take-over-mazda-dpi-programme.html |title=Joest To Take Over Mazda DPi Programme |work=dailysportscar.com|publisher=dailysportscar |date=2017-07-18 |accessdate=2017-07-19|}}</ref> Mazda withdrew from the remainder of the 2017 season in order for Joest to spearhead testing and development of the then uncompetitive DPi.\n\nThe partnership was terminated at the end of March 2020 with Mazda moving to Multimatic Motorsports.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.joest-racing.de}}\n\n{{Audi Sport Team Joest driver timeline}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joest Racing}}\n[[Category:German auto racing teams]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1978]]\n[[Category:1978 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans teams]]\n[[Category:American Le Mans Series teams]]\n[[Category:FIA Sportscar Championship entrants]]\n[[Category:Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters teams]]\n[[Category:British Touring Car Championship teams]]\n[[Category:World Sportscar Championship teams]]\n[[Category:FIA World Endurance Championship teams]]\n[[Category:European Le Mans Series teams]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Auto racing team in Germany}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{update|date=March 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}\n}}\n\n<!--an official website link does not count-->\n{{Motor racing team\n| name           = {{flagicon|DEU}} Joest Racing\n| logo           = \n| founded        = 1978\n| principal      = [[Reinhold Joest]]\n| current series = [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]\n| former series  = [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] [[World Sportscar Championship]]<br>[[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]]<br>[[IMSA GT Championship]]<br>[[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]]<br>[[American Le Mans Series]]<br>[[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]]<br>[[Le Mans Series]]<br>[[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]]\n|current drivers        = {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Oliver Jarvis]]<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jonathan Bomarito]]<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tristan Nunez]]<br>{{flagicon|GBR}} [[Harry Tincknell]]<br>{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Olivier Pla]]<br>{{flagicon|GER}} [[Timo Bernhard]]\n| driver titles  = 6 ([[2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season|'12 WEC]], [[2013 FIA World Endurance Championship season|'13 WEC]], '00, '01, '02, '03 [[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]])\n| team titles    = 6 ([[2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season|'12 WEC]], [[2013 FIA World Endurance Championship season|'13 WEC]], '00, '01, '02, '03 [[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]])\n| folded         = \n}}\n\n'''Joest Racing''' is a [[sports car racing]] team that was established in 1978 by former [[Porsche]] works racer [[Reinhold Joest]].

Both cars qualified on the front row with the team of Marc Basseng, Christopher Mies and [[Darryl O'Young]] leading home Australian team mates Mark Eddy, [[Craig Lowndes]] and [[Warren Luff]] in a 1-2 finish. With both cars on the same lap racing for the win the margin was only 0.7141 between the two at the end of 12 hours of racing. The Joest Racing R8's finished one lap in front of the VIP Pet Foods Racing [[Porsche 997|Porsche 997 GT3 Cup R]] of [[Craig Baird]] and father and son pairing Tony and Klark Quinn.\n\nIt was Joest's 2nd win in Australia in two starts having previously won the ALMS [[Race of a Thousand Years]] on 31 December 2000 with [[Rinaldo Capello|Dindo Capello]] and [[Allan McNish]] winning in an [[Audi R8 (LMP)|Audi R8]] [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]] on the old [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Grand Prix circuit]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. Capello easily put the R8 on pole position, while McNish was actually laid up with a bad back after he put it out when stepping out of his [[Kilt]] after a pre-event photo shoot. They also had to drive a repaired car after Capello put the crocodile liveried car into the tyre barriers in the race morning warm up session. Despite his troubles, McNish started the race and set the fastest lap. He also drove the 25 laps required and wrapped up the inaugural ALMS Drivers' title as a result.\n\n==Mazda Team Joest==\nOn 18 July 2017 it was announced that Joest Racing would take over the operation of the [[Riley Mk. 30#Mazda RT24-P|Mazda RT24-P]] [[Daytona Prototype#Daytona Prototype International|Daytona Prototype International]] (DPi) entry in the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] for the [[2018 WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|2018]] season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2017/07/18/joest-to-take-over-mazda-dpi-programme.html |title=Joest To Take Over Mazda DPi Programme |work=dailysportscar.com|publisher=dailysportscar |date=2017-07-18 |accessdate=2017-07-19|}}</ref> Mazda withdrew from the remainder of the 2017 season in order for Joest to spearhead testing and development of the then uncompetitive DPi.\n\nThe partnership was terminated at the end of March 2020 with Mazda moving to Multimatic Motorsports.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.joest-racing.de}}\n\n{{Audi Sport Team Joest driver timeline}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joest Racing}}\n[[Category:German auto racing teams]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1978]]\n[[Category:1978 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans teams]]\n[[Category:American Le Mans Series teams]]\n[[Category:FIA Sportscar Championship entrants]]\n[[Category:Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters teams]]\n[[Category:British Touring Car Championship teams]]\n[[Category:World Sportscar Championship teams]]\n[[Category:FIA World Endurance Championship teams]]\n[[Category:European Le Mans Series teams]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGT3:Typo fixing, replaced: the win the \u2192  to win the", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joest_Racing"}
