Built between 1939 and 1947 as '''MS ''Willem Ruys''''', a [[passenger liner]] for the Rotterdamsche Lloyd, she was [[Achille Lauro hijacking|hijacked]] by members of the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] in 1985.\n\nIn other incidents, she also suffered two serious collisions (in 1953 with the {{MS|Oranje}} and in 1975 with the cargo ship ''Youseff'') and four onboard fires or explosions (in 1965, 1972, 1981, and 1994). In the last of these, in 1994, the ship caught fire and sank in the [[Indian Ocean]] off [[Somalia]].\n\n==Concept and construction==\nOrdered in 1938 to replace the aging ships on the [[Dutch East Indies]] route, her [[keel]] was laid in 1939 at De Schelde shipyard in [[Vlissingen]], [[Netherlands]], for Rotterdamsche Lloyd (now [[Nedlloyd]]). Interrupted by [[World War II]] and two bombing raids, the ship was finally launched in July 1946, as ''Willem Ruys''. The ship was named after the grandson of the founder of the Rotterdamsche Lloyd who was taken hostage and shot during the war.\n\n''Willem Ruys'' was completed in late 1947. At that time, the Rotterdamsche Lloyd had been granted a royal prefix in honour of its services during the war. ''Willem Ruys'' was {{convert|192|m|ft|0}} in length, {{convert|25|m|ft|0}} in beam, had a draught of {{convert|8.9|m|ft|1}}, and measured 21,119 [[tonnage|gross register ton]]s. Eight [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] engines drove two [[propeller]]s. She could accommodate 900 passengers. She featured a superstructure very different from other liners of that era; ''Willem Ruys'' pioneered low-slung aluminium lifeboats, within the upper-works' flanks. The next ship to adopt this unique arrangement was the {{SS|Canberra}} in 1961. Today, all cruise ships follow this layout, with fibreglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) used for lifeboat hulls.\n\n==Service history==\n\n===As the ''Willem Ruys''===\n\n====On the East Indies route====\nAs ''Willem Ruys'', the ship began her maiden voyage on 5 December 1947. Together with her main competitor and running mate, the [[MS Oranje|MS ''Oranje'']] of the [[Netherland Line]], she became a popular fixture on the [[Dutch East Indies]] route. However, when the East Indies gained independence from The Netherlands in 1949, passengers' numbers decreased.\n\nThe former [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]], had travelled aboard ''Willem Ruys'' as a fresh graduate upon completing his studies in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Time\">{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2056737-5,00.html|title=The Singapore Story|magazine=Time|date= 3 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Collision with ''Oranje''====\nOn 6 January 1953, ''Willem Ruys'' collided in the Red Sea with running mate {{MS|Oranje}}, which was heading in the opposite direction. At that time, it was common for passenger ships to pass each other at close range to entertain their passengers. During the (later heavily criticized) abrupt and fast approach of ''Oranje'', ''Willem Ruys'' made an unexpected swing to the left, resulting in a collision. ''Oranje'' badly damaged her bow. Due to the possibility that she would be impounded for safety reasons, she was unable to call at Colombo as scheduled, and went directly to Jakarta. ''Willem Ruys'' suffered less damage. There was no loss of life involved. Later, it was determined that miscommunication on both ships had caused the collision.\n\n====''Journey to Java''====\nDuring 1957, the English diplomat, author and diarist [[Harold Nicolson]] and his wife, the author and poet [[Vita Sackville-West]], toured the [[Far East]] for two months aboard ''Willem Ruys''. The voyage is documented in ''Journey to Java'', his published journal of the trip,<ref name=\"Journey To Java\">{{cite book |title= Journey to Java |last= Nicolson|first= Harold|year= 1957|publisher= Constable|location= [[London]]}}</ref> which provides a detailed account of [[first class travel]] on the vessel in the 1950s.\n\n====Later years====\nAfter repairs, Royal Rotterdam Lloyd decided to release ''Willem Ruys'' on the North Atlantic run. First, she was placed on the [[New York (state)|New York]] service, and later [[Canada]] was included.\n\nIn 1958, the Royal Rotterdamsche Lloyd and the [[Netherland Line]] signed a co-operative agreement to create a round-the-world passenger service. The joint fleet would sail under the banner of \"The Royal Dutch Mail Ships\". Together with ''Oranje'' and ''[[TSMS Lakonia|Johan van Oldenbarneveldt]]'', ''Willem Ruys'' underwent an extensive refit to prepare her for this new service. She made two charter trips to [[Montreal]] for the Europa-Canada service. Then, from 20 September 1958, until 25 February 1959, she underwent a major facelift at the [[Wilton-Fijenoord]] shipyard in [[Amsterdam]], turning her from a passenger liner into a cruise ship. Her original four class distinctions became First and Tourist Class. A hundred new cabins were installed and [[air-conditioning]] was extended throughout all accommodations. The Javanese crew members were replaced by Europeans, who required upgraded crew accommodation. Externally, she was fitted with a new glazing in Tourist Class Wintergarden, her forward funnel was heightened and [[Stabilizer (ship)|stabilizers]] were fitted. ''Willem Ruys'' was now able to accommodate 275 first class and 770 tourist class passengers, although there were many interchangeable cabins which had additional berths fitted, which could increase the maximum passenger number to 1167. Her new specifications would see her tonnage increase from 21,119 to 23,114 [[tonnage|gross register ton]].\n\nOn 7 March 1959, ''Willem Ruys'' went off on her new world service to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. She departed from [[Rotterdam]], sailing via [[Southampton]], the [[Mediterranean]], the [[Suez Canal]], [[Fremantle]], [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[New Zealand]], returning via the [[Panama Canal]]. The Royal Dutch Mail Ships (''Willem Ruys'', ''Johan van Oldenbarnevelt'' and ''Oranje'') became a popular alternative to the British liners.\n\nAt the end of 1964, due to a strong drop in passenger numbers, ''Willem Ruys'' was laid up in [[Rotterdam]] and put up for sale.\n\n===As ''Achille Lauro''===\nIn 1965, she was sold to the [[Flotta Lauro Line]], or [[Star Lauro]], (now [[MSC Cruises]]) and renamed ''Achille Lauro'' after [[Achille Lauro|the company's owner]]. She was extensively rebuilt and modernized after an August 1965 onboard explosion, and entered service in 1966 carrying passengers to [[Sydney]], Australia. The ship played a role in evacuating the families of British servicemen caught up in unrest in [[Aden]], and made one of the last northbound transits through the [[Suez Canal]] before its closure during the [[Six-Day War]].\n\n''Achille Lauro'' was converted to a cruise ship in early 1972, during which time she suffered a disastrous fire. A 1975 collision with the cargo ship ''Youseff'' resulted in the sinking of the latter, and another onboard fire in 1981 took her out of service for a time. She was laid up in [[Tenerife]] when Lauro Lines went bankrupt in 1982. The [[Chandris Line]] took possession of her under a charter arrangement in 1985, shortly before the hijacking.\n\n====1985 hijacking====\n{{main|Achille Lauro hijacking}}\nOn 7 October 1985, four members of the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] (PLF) took control of the liner off [[Egypt]] as she was sailing from [[Alexandria]] to [[Port Said]]. Holding the passengers and crew hostage, they directed the vessel to sail to [[Tartus]], [[Syria]], and demanded the release of 50 [[Palestinians]] then in Israeli prisons. After being refused permission to dock at Tartus, the hijackers killed disabled Jewish-American passenger [[Leon Klinghoffer]] and then threw his body overboard.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |last=Berman |first=Daphna |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=981987&contrassID=2&subContrassID=16 |title=Klinghoffer daughters recall personal tragedy at commemoration of terror victims outside Israel |work=Haaretz |date=9 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe ship then headed back towards Port Said, and after two days of negotiations, the hijackers agreed to abandon the liner in exchange for safe conduct and were flown towards [[Tunisia]] aboard an Egyptian commercial airliner. This plane, however, was intercepted by US fighter aircraft and directed to land in [[Sicily]], where the hijackers were to be tried for murder, but could not be extradited. The four terrorists were sentenced to prison terms by the Italian courts, while the operation's mastermind, who had not taken part in the actual hijacking, was given passage to Yugoslavia and escaped.\n\n====Later years, fire, and sinking====\nThe ship continued in service; she was reflagged in 1987 when the Lauro Line was taken over by the [[Mediterranean Shipping Company]] to become \"StarLauro\". On 30 November 1994, she caught fire off the coast of Somalia while ''en route'' to [[South Africa]], with 979 passengers and crew on board. At that time, Italian officials said the fire had been caused by a discarded cigarette, but it actually began in the engine room after one of the engines exploded. Because of a lack of supervision, the fire burned out of control before its discovery.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |last=Cowell |first=Alan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/world/achille-lauro-smolders-after-1000-are-rescued.html|title=Achille Lauro Smolders After 1,000 Are Rescued|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= 2 December 1994 |access-date=30 September 2019 }}</ref> The crew tried to battle the fire for several hours but were unsuccessful.

After being refused permission to dock at Tartus, the hijackers killed disabled Jewish-American passenger [[Leon Klinghoffer]] and then threw his body overboard.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |last=Berman |first=Daphna |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=981987&contrassID=2&subContrassID=16 |title=Klinghoffer daughters recall personal tragedy at commemoration of terror victims outside Israel |work=Haaretz |date=9 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe ship then headed back towards Port Said, and after two days of negotiations, the hijackers agreed to abandon the liner in exchange for safe conduct and were flown towards [[Tunisia]] aboard an Egyptian commercial airliner. This plane, however, was intercepted by US fighter aircraft and directed to land in [[Sicily]], where the hijackers were to be tried for murder, but could not be extradited. The four terrorists were sentenced to prison terms by the Italian courts, while the operation's mastermind, who had not taken part in the actual hijacking, was given passage to Yugoslavia and escaped.\n\n====Later years, fire, and sinking====\nThe ship continued in service; she was reflagged in 1987 when the Lauro Line was taken over by the [[Mediterranean Shipping Company]] to become \"StarLauro\". On 30 November 1994, she caught fire off the coast of Somalia while ''en route'' to [[South Africa]], with 979 passengers and crew on board. At that time, Italian officials said the fire had been caused by a discarded cigarette, but it actually began in the engine room after one of the engines exploded. Because of a lack of supervision, the fire burned out of control before its discovery.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |last=Cowell |first=Alan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/world/achille-lauro-smolders-after-1000-are-rescued.html|title=Achille Lauro Smolders After 1,000 Are Rescued|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= 2 December 1994 |access-date=30 September 2019 }}</ref> The crew tried to battle the fire for several hours but were unsuccessful.
