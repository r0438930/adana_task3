The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Kogury\u014f but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Kogury\u014f's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Kogury\u014f capital of P'y\u014fngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Kogury\u014f commander \u016clchi Mund\u014fk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper. Yang Ti continued to send his armies against Kogury\u014f but again without success, and before long his war-weakened empire crumbled.|year=1984}}</ref><ref name=\"Nahm\">{{cite book|last1=Nahm|first1=Andrew C.|title=A Panorama of 5000 Years: Korean History|date=2005|publisher=Hollym International Corporation|location=Seoul|isbn=978-0-930878-68-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/panoramaof5000ye0000nahm/page/18 18]|edition=Second revised|quote=China, which had been split into many states since the early 3rd century, was reunified by the Sui dynasty at the end of the 6th century. Soon after that, Sui China mobilized a large number of troops and launched war against Kogury\u014f. However, the people of Kogury\u014f were united and they were able to repel the Chinese aggressors. In 612, Sui troops invaded Korea again, but Kogury\u014f forces fought bravely and destroyed Sui troops everywhere. General \u016clchi Mund\u014fk of Kogury\u014f completely wiped out some 300,000 Sui troops which came across the Yalu River in the battles near the Salsu River (now Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn River) with his ingenious military tactics. Only 2,700 Sui troops were able to flee from Korea.

At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the [[Ilminism|One-People Principle]] (based on the German [[ideology]] of the ''[[Master race|Herrenvolk]]'') an effort to build an obedient citizenry through [[ethnicity|ethnic]] homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to [[nationalism]].<ref name=Hwang93>Su-kyoung Hwang, ''Korea's Grievous War.''

This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government.  This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961, coup]] led by General [[Park Chung-hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by political repression.\n\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure.  The government developed the [[Expressways in South Korea|nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|his assassination]] in 1979.\n\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979 there came the [[Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth]] led by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]]. Following the Coup d'\u00e9tat, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of [[Jejudo]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency in the events of May 17, triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy, in particular in the city of [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju massacre|Gwangju Democratization Movement]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752055.stm Flashback: The Kwangju massacre], May 17, 2000.</ref>\n\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a [[Seoul National University]] student, [[Bak Jongcheol|Park Jong-chul]], was tortured to death.<ref>[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html \"20 years later, father still seeks truth in son's death\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173203/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, ''The Hankyoreh'', January 15, 2007.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[tofu]], vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes, ''[[banchan]]'' (\ubc18\ucc2c), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. [[Kimchi]] (\uae40\uce58), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' (\ub41c\uc7a5), a type of [[fermented bean paste|fermented soybean paste]], [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, and ''[[gochujang]]'' (\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5), a hot pepper paste. Other well-known dishes are ''[[Bulgogi]]'' (\ubd88\uace0\uae30), grilled marinated beef, ''[[Gimbap]]'' (\uae40\ubc25), and ''[[Tteokbokki]]'' (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774), a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\n\nSoups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' (\uad6d) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, ''tang'' (\ud0d5; \u6e6f) has less water, and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is ''[[jjigae]]'' (\ucc0c\uac1c), a [[stew]] that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.\n\nPopular [[Korean alcoholic beverages]] include [[Soju]], [[Makgeolli]] and [[Bokbunja ju]].\n\nKorea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal [[chopstick]]s. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.<ref>[http://article.joins.com/news/blognews/article.asp?listid=12803159 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ub3d9\uc5913\uad6d\uc758 \uc813\uac00\ub77d \ubb38\ud654\ube44\uad50].

Many K-pop acts have also been able secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as the video sharing website [[YouTube]].

Seoul hosted the [[1967 ABC Championship|1967]] and [[1995 ABC Championship|1995 Asian Basketball Championship]]. The [[Korea national basketball team]] has won a record number of 23 medals at the event to date.<ref>{{cite web |title=FIBA Asia Competition Archives |work=Competition Archives |publisher=International Basketball Federation FIBA |date=September 26, 2011 |url=http://www.fibaasia.net/Competition_Archives.aspx?id=2 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Korea Taekwondo Hanmadang 70.jpg|thumb|left|[[Taekwondo]], a Korean martial art and Olympic sport]]\nSouth Korea hosted the [[Asian Games]] in 1986 (Seoul), 2002 (Busan) and 2014 (Incheon).

The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Kogury\u014f but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Kogury\u014f's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Kogury\u014f capital of P'y\u014fngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Kogury\u014f commander \u016clchi Mund\u014fk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper.

At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the [[Ilminism|One-People Principle]] (based on the German [[ideology]] of the ''[[Master race|Herrenvolk]]'') an effort to build an obedient citizenry through [[ethnicity|ethnic]] homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to [[nationalism]].<ref name=Hwang93>Su-kyoung Hwang, ''Korea's Grievous War.''

This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government.  This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961, coup]] led by General [[Park Chung-hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by political repression.\n\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure.  The government developed the [[Expressways in South Korea|nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|his assassination]] in 1979.\n\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979 there came the [[Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth]] led by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]]. Following the Coup d'\u00e9tat, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of [[Jejudo]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency in the events of May 17, triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy, in particular in the city of [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju massacre|Gwangju Democratization Movement]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752055.stm Flashback: The Kwangju massacre], May 17, 2000.</ref>\n\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[tofu]], vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes, ''[[banchan]]'' (\ubc18\ucc2c), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. [[Kimchi]] (\uae40\uce58), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' (\ub41c\uc7a5), a type of [[fermented bean paste|fermented soybean paste]], [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, and ''[[gochujang]]'' (\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5), a hot pepper paste. Other well-known dishes are ''[[Bulgogi]]'' (\ubd88\uace0\uae30), grilled marinated beef, ''[[Gimbap]]'' (\uae40\ubc25), and ''[[Tteokbokki]]'' (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774), a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\n\nSoups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' (\uad6d) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, ''tang'' (\ud0d5; \u6e6f) has less water, and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is ''[[jjigae]]'' (\ucc0c\uac1c), a [[stew]] that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.\n\nPopular [[Korean alcoholic beverages]] include [[Soju]], [[Makgeolli]] and [[Bokbunja ju]].\n\nKorea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal [[chopstick]]s. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.<ref>[http://article.joins.com/news/blognews/article.asp?listid=12803159 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ub3d9\uc5913\uad6d\uc758 \uc813\uac00\ub77d \ubb38\ud654\ube44\uad50].

Many K-pop acts have also been able secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as the video sharing website [[YouTube]]. South Korean singer [[PSY]] became an international sensation when his song \"[[Gangnam Style]]\" topped global music charts in 2012. <!--Do not add a list of groups here without first suggesting it at the Talk page.-->\n\nSince the success of the film ''[[Shiri (film)|Shiri]]'' in 1999, the [[Korean film]] industry has begun to gain recognition internationally. Domestic film has a dominant share of the market, partly because of the existence of [[screen quotas]] requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.<ref>[http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_Ec_detail.htm?No=74142 \"S.Korea's Screen Quota Hinders Market Access\"], KBS World, July 16, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Television in South Korea|South Korean television shows]] have become popular outside of Korea.
