They numbered about 10,000 fighting men and about the same number of women and children, divided into three tribes, [[Trocmi]], [[Tolistobogii]] and [[Tectosages]]. They were eventually defeated by the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus I]] (275 BC), in a battle in which the Seleucid war elephants shocked the Galatians. Although the momentum of the invasion was broken, the Galatians were by no means exterminated, and continued to demand tribute from the Hellenistic states of Anatolia to avoid war. 4,000 Galatians were hired as mercenaries by the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Egyptian king [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] in 270 BC. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], soon after arrival the Celts plotted \u201cto seize Egypt\u201d, and so Ptolemy marooned them on a deserted island in the [[Nile River]].<ref name=hinds/>\n[[File:Celtic sword and scabbard circa 60 BCE.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Celtic sword]] and [[scabbard]] circa 60 BC]]\nGalatians also participated at the victory at [[Battle of Raphia|Raphia]] in 217 BC under [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]], and continued to serve as mercenaries for the Ptolemaic dynasty until its demise in 30 BC. They sided with the renegade Seleucid prince [[Antiochus Hierax]], who reigned in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]]. Hierax tried to defeat king [[Attalus I|Attalus I of Pergamum]] (241\u2013197 BC), but instead, the Hellenized cities united under Attalus's banner, and his armies inflicted a severe defeat upon the Galatians at the [[Battle of the Caecus River]] in 241 BC. After this defeat, the Galatians continued to be a serious threat to the states of Asia Minor. In fact, they continued to be a threat even after their defeat by [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso (consul 189 BC)|Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] in the [[Galatian War]] (189 BC). Galatia declined and at times fell under [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] ascendancy. They were finally freed by the [[Mithridatic Wars]], in which they supported Rome. In the settlement of 64 BC, Galatia became a [[client state]] of the Roman empire, the old constitution disappeared, and three chiefs (wrongly styled \"tetrarchs\") were appointed, one for each tribe. But this arrangement soon gave way before the ambition of one of these tetrarchs, [[Deiotarus]], a contemporary of [[Cicero]] and [[Julius Caesar]], who made himself master of the other two tetrarchies and was finally recognized by the Romans as [[List of Kings of Galatia|'king' of Galatia]].

They played a part in some of his most spectacular victories, including the [[battle of Cannae]]. The Gauls were so prosperous by the 2nd century that the powerful Greek colony of [[Marseilles|Massilia]] had to appeal to the [[Roman Republic]] for defense against them. The Romans intervened in southern Gaul in 125 BC, and conquered the area eventually known as [[Gallia Narbonensis]] by 121 BC.\n\nIn 58 BC [[Julius Caesar]] launched the [[Gallic Wars]] and had conquered the whole of Gaul by 51 BC. He noted that the Gauls (Celtae) were one of the three primary peoples in the area, along with the [[Aquitanians]] and the [[Belgae]]. Caesar's motivation for the invasion seems to have been his need for gold to pay off his debts and for a successful military expedition to boost his political career. The people of Gaul could provide him with both. So much gold was looted from Gaul that after the war the price of gold fell by as much as 20%. While they were militarily just as brave as the Romans, the internal division between the Gallic tribes guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar, and [[Vercingetorix]]'s attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late.<ref name=\"EB_The_Roman_Conquest\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/41196/The-press |title=France: The Roman conquest |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |access-date=April 6, 2015 |quote=Because of chronic internal rivalries, Gallic resistance was easily broken, though Vercingetorix\u2019s Great Rebellion of 52 bce had notable successes.}}</ref><ref name=\"The_first_triumvirate_and_the_conquest_of_Gaul\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/88114/Julius-Caesar/9735/The-first-triumvirate-and-the-conquest-of-Gaul |title=Julius Caesar: The first triumvirate and the conquest of Gaul |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |access-date=February 15, 2015 |quote=Indeed, the Gallic cavalry was probably superior to the Roman, horseman for horseman.

Also there existed highly developed population centers, called ''oppida'' by Caesar, such as [[Bibracte]], [[Gergovia]], [[Avaricum]], [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]], [[Bibrax]], [[Manching]] and others. Modern archeology strongly suggests that the countries of Gaul were quite civilized and very wealthy. Most had contact with Roman merchants and some, particularly those that were governed by Republics such as the [[Aedui]], [[Helvetii]] and others, had enjoyed stable political alliances with Rome.

The druids were not the only political force, however, and the early political system was complex. The fundamental unit of Gallic politics was the tribe, which itself consisted of one or more of what Caesar called \"pagi\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Each tribe had a council of elders, and initially a king. Later, the executive was an annually-elected magistrate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Among the [[Aedui]] tribe the executive held the title of \"Vergobret\", a position much like a king, but its powers were held in check by rules laid down by the council.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe tribal groups, or ''pagi'' as the Romans called them (singular: ''pagus''; the French word ''pays'', \"country\", comes from this term) were organised into larger super-tribal groups that the Romans called ''[[civitates]]''. These administrative groupings would be taken over by the Romans in their system of local control, and these ''civitates'' would also be the basis of France's eventual division into [[List of Ancien R\u00e9gime dioceses of France|ecclesiastical bishoprics and dioceses]], which would remain in place\u2014with slight changes\u2014until the [[French Revolution]].\n\nAlthough the tribes were moderately stable political entities, Gaul as a whole tended to be politically divided, there being virtually no unity among the various tribes. Only during particularly trying times, such as the invasion of Caesar, could the Gauls unite under a single leader like [[Vercingetorix]]. Even then, however, the faction lines were clear.\n\nThe Romans divided Gaul broadly into ''Provincia'' (the conquered area around the Mediterranean), and the northern [[Gallia Comata]] (\"free Gaul\" or \"wooded Gaul\"). Caesar divided the people of Gaulia Comata into three broad groups: the ''Aquitani''; ''Galli'' (who in their own language were called ''Celtae''); and ''Belgae''. In the modern sense, [[List of peoples of Gaul|Gaulish tribes]] are defined linguistically, as speakers of dialects of the Gaulish language. While the [[Aquitani]] were probably [[Vascons]], the [[Belgae]] would thus probably be counted among the Gaulish tribes, perhaps with Germanic elements.\n\n[[Julius Caesar]], in his book, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', comments:\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, whereas those who in their own language are called Celts and in ours Gauls, the third.\n\nAll these differ from each other in language, customs and laws.\n\nThe [[Garonne]] River separates the Gauls from the Aquitani; the [[River Marne]] and the River [[Seine]] separate them from the Belgae.\n\nOf all these, the Belgae are the bravest, because they are furthest from the civilisation and refinement of (our) Province, and merchants least frequently resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind; and they are the nearest to the Germani, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war; for which reason the Helvetii also surpass the rest of the Gauls in valour, as they contend with the Germani in almost daily battles, when they either repel them from their own territories, or themselves wage war on their frontiers. One part of these, which it has been said that the Gauls occupy, takes its beginning at the River [[Rh\u00f4ne]]; it is bounded by the River [[Garonne]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and the territories of the Belgae; it borders, too, on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii, upon the River [[Rhine]], and stretches toward the north.\n\nThe Belgae rises from the extreme frontier of Gaul, extend to the lower part of the River Rhine; and look toward the north and the rising sun.\n\nAquitania extends from the [[Garonne]] to the [[Pyrenees]] and to that part of the [[Atlantic]] ([[Bay of Biscay]]) which is near [[Spain]]: it looks between the setting of the sun, and the north star.\n|source = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2014 [[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', Book I, chapter 1\n|align =center\n|width =90%\n|quoted=1\n}}\n\n===Language===\n[[File:Bronze cuirass 2900g Grenoble end of 7th early 6th century BCE.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Bronze]] cuirass, weighing 2.9&nbsp;kg, [[Grenoble]], end of 7th century \u2013 early 6th century BCE]]\n{{Main|Gaulish language}}\nGaulish or Gallic is the name given to the [[Celt]]ic language that was spoken in [[Gaul]] before the [[Latin]] of the late [[Roman Empire]] became dominant in [[Roman Gaul]].

Also, worship of animals was not uncommon; the animal most sacred to the Gauls was the [[boar]], which can be found on many Gallic military standards, much like the Roman eagle.\n\nTheir system of [[List of Celtic deities#Gaulish and Brythonic deities|gods and goddesses]] was loose, there being certain deities which virtually every Gallic person {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} worshiped, as well as tribal and household gods. Many of the major gods were related to Greek gods; the primary god worshiped at the time of the arrival of Caesar was [[Toutatis|Teutates]], the Gallic equivalent of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The \"father god\" in Gallic worship was \"Dis Pater\". However, there is no record of a theology {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, just a set of related and evolving traditions of worship.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing facet of Gallic religion is the practice of the [[Druids]]. There is no certainty concerning their origin, but it is clear that they vehemently guarded the secrets of their order and held sway over the people of Gaul. Indeed, they claimed the right to determine questions of war and peace, and thereby held an \"international\" status. In addition, the Druids monitored the religion of ordinary Gauls and were in charge of educating the aristocracy. They also practiced a form of excommunication from the assembly of worshippers, which in ancient Gaul meant a separation from secular society as well. Thus the Druids were an important part of Gallic society.\n\n==List of Gaulish tribes==\n{{See also|List of Celtic tribes}}\n\nAfter completing the conquest of Gaul, Rome converted most of these tribes into [[civitates]], making for the administrative map of the Roman provinces of Gaul. This was then perpetuated by the early church, whose geographical subdivisions were based on those of late Roman Gaul, and lasted into the areas of [[List of Ancien R\u00e9gime dioceses of France|French dioceses]] prior to the French Revolution.\n\n[[File:Gaul warrior Vacheres 1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Sculpture of an armoured torc-wearing Gaul warrior, [[Vach\u00e8res]], France.]]\n[[File:Chambon-sur-Lac2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Celtic cross]], in Chambon-sur-Lac, [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], France.]]\n[[File:Alise-Sainte-Reine statue Vercingetorix par Millet 2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Vercing\u00e9torix]] Memorial in [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]], near the village of [[Alise-Sainte-Reine]], France.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Attention given to the Gauls as the founding population of the French nation was traditionally second to that enjoyed by the [[Franks]], out of whose [[kingdom of the Franks|kingdom]] the historical [[kingdom of France]] arose under the [[Capetian dynasty]]; for example, [[Charles de Gaulle]] is on record as stating, \"For me, the history of France begins with [[Clovis I|Clovis]], elected as king of France by the tribe of the Franks, who gave their name to France. Before Clovis, we have Gallo-Roman and Gaulish prehistory. The decisive element, for me, is that Clovis was the first king to have been baptized a Christian. My country is a Christian country and I reckon the history of France beginning with the accession of a Christian king who bore the name of the Franks.\"\n<ref>\"''Pour moi, l'histoire de France commence avec Clovis, choisi comme roi de France par la tribu des Francs, qui donn\u00e8rent leur nom \u00e0 la France.

Pre-Roman Gaul has been evoked as a template for French independence especially during the [[Third French Republic]]. An iconic phrase summarizing this view is that of \"our ancestors the Gauls\" (''nos anc\u00eatres les Gaulois''), associated with the history textbook for schools by [[Ernest Lavisse]] (1842\u20131922), who taught that \"the Romans established themselves in small numbers; the Franks were not numerous either, Clovis having but a few thousand men with him. The basis of our population has thus remained Gaulish. The Gauls are our ancestors.\"<ref>''Les Romains qui vinrent s'\u00e9tablir en Gaule \u00e9taient en petit nombre.

Although the momentum of the invasion was broken, the Galatians were by no means exterminated, and continued to demand tribute from the Hellenistic states of Anatolia to avoid war. 4,000 Galatians were hired as mercenaries by the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Egyptian king [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] in 270 BC. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], soon after arrival the Celts plotted \u201cto seize Egypt\u201d, and so Ptolemy marooned them on a deserted island in the [[Nile River]].<ref name=hinds/>\n[[File:Celtic sword and scabbard circa 60 BCE.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Celtic sword]] and [[scabbard]] circa 60 BC]]\nGalatians also participated at the victory at [[Battle of Raphia|Raphia]] in 217 BC under [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]], and continued to serve as mercenaries for the Ptolemaic dynasty until its demise in 30 BC. They sided with the renegade Seleucid prince [[Antiochus Hierax]], who reigned in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]]. Hierax tried to defeat king [[Attalus I|Attalus I of Pergamum]] (241\u2013197 BC), but instead, the Hellenized cities united under Attalus's banner, and his armies inflicted a severe defeat upon the Galatians at the [[Battle of the Caecus River]] in 241 BC. After this defeat, the Galatians continued to be a serious threat to the states of Asia Minor. In fact, they continued to be a threat even after their defeat by [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso (consul 189 BC)|Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] in the [[Galatian War]] (189 BC). Galatia declined and at times fell under [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] ascendancy. They were finally freed by the [[Mithridatic Wars]], in which they supported Rome. In the settlement of 64 BC, Galatia became a [[client state]] of the Roman empire, the old constitution disappeared, and three chiefs (wrongly styled \"tetrarchs\") were appointed, one for each tribe. But this arrangement soon gave way before the ambition of one of these tetrarchs, [[Deiotarus]], a contemporary of [[Cicero]] and [[Julius Caesar]], who made himself master of the other two tetrarchies and was finally recognized by the Romans as [[List of Kings of Galatia|'king' of Galatia]].

They played a part in some of his most spectacular victories, including the [[battle of Cannae]]. The Gauls were so prosperous by the 2nd century that the powerful Greek colony of [[Marseilles|Massilia]] had to appeal to the [[Roman Republic]] for defense against them. The Romans intervened in southern Gaul in 125 BC, and conquered the area eventually known as [[Gallia Narbonensis]] by 121 BC.\n\nIn 58 BC [[Julius Caesar]] launched the [[Gallic Wars]] and had conquered the whole of Gaul by 51 BC. He noted that the Gauls (Celtae) were one of the three primary peoples in the area, along with the [[Aquitanians]] and the [[Belgae]]. Caesar's motivation for the invasion seems to have been his need for gold to pay off his debts and for a successful military expedition to boost his political career. The people of Gaul could provide him with both. So much gold was looted from Gaul that after the war the price of gold fell by as much as 20%. While they were militarily just as brave as the Romans, the internal division between the Gallic tribes guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar, and [[Vercingetorix]]'s attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late.<ref name=\"EB_The_Roman_Conquest\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/41196/The-press |title=France: The Roman conquest |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |access-date=April 6, 2015 |quote=Because of chronic internal rivalries, Gallic resistance was easily broken, though Vercingetorix\u2019s Great Rebellion of 52 bce had notable successes.}}</ref><ref name=\"The_first_triumvirate_and_the_conquest_of_Gaul\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/88114/Julius-Caesar/9735/The-first-triumvirate-and-the-conquest-of-Gaul |title=Julius Caesar: The first triumvirate and the conquest of Gaul |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |access-date=February 15, 2015 |quote=Indeed, the Gallic cavalry was probably superior to the Roman, horseman for horseman.

Also there existed highly developed population centers, called ''oppida'' by Caesar, such as [[Bibracte]], [[Gergovia]], [[Avaricum]], [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]], [[Bibrax]], [[Manching]] and others. Modern archeology strongly suggests that the countries of Gaul were quite civilized and very wealthy. Most had contact with Roman merchants and some, particularly those that were governed by Republics such as the [[Aedui]], [[Helvetii]] and others, had enjoyed stable political alliances with Rome. They imported Mediterranean wine on an industrial scale, evidenced by large finds of wine vessels in digs all over Gaul, the largest and most famous of which being the one discovered in [[Vix Grave]], which stands 1.63 m (5\u2032 4\u2033) in height.\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Parade helmet.jpg|[[Agris Helmet]].

The druids were not the only political force, however, and the early political system was complex. The fundamental unit of Gallic politics was the tribe, which itself consisted of one or more of what Caesar called \"pagi\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Each tribe had a council of elders, and initially a king. Later, the executive was an annually-elected magistrate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Among the [[Aedui]] tribe the executive held the title of \"Vergobret\", a position much like a king, but its powers were held in check by rules laid down by the council.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe tribal groups, or ''pagi'' as the Romans called them (singular: ''pagus''; the French word ''pays'', \"country\", comes from this term) were organised into larger super-tribal groups that the Romans called ''[[civitates]]''. These administrative groupings would be taken over by the Romans in their system of local control, and these ''civitates'' would also be the basis of France's eventual division into [[List of Ancien R\u00e9gime dioceses of France|ecclesiastical bishoprics and dioceses]], which would remain in place\u2014with slight changes\u2014until the [[French Revolution]].\n\nAlthough the tribes were moderately stable political entities, Gaul as a whole tended to be politically divided, there being virtually no unity among the various tribes. Only during particularly trying times, such as the invasion of Caesar, could the Gauls unite under a single leader like [[Vercingetorix]]. Even then, however, the faction lines were clear.\n\nThe Romans divided Gaul broadly into ''Provincia'' (the conquered area around the Mediterranean), and the northern [[Gallia Comata]] (\"free Gaul\" or \"wooded Gaul\"). Caesar divided the people of Gaulia Comata into three broad groups: the ''Aquitani''; ''Galli'' (who in their own language were called ''Celtae''); and ''Belgae''. In the modern sense, [[List of peoples of Gaul|Gaulish tribes]] are defined linguistically, as speakers of dialects of the Gaulish language. While the [[Aquitani]] were probably [[Vascons]], the [[Belgae]] would thus probably be counted among the Gaulish tribes, perhaps with Germanic elements.\n\n[[Julius Caesar]], in his book, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', comments:\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, whereas those who in their own language are called Celts and in ours Gauls, the third.\n\nAll these differ from each other in language, customs and laws.\n\nThe [[Garonne]] River separates the Gauls from the Aquitani; the [[River Marne]] and the River [[Seine]] separate them from the Belgae.\n\nOf all these, the Belgae are the bravest, because they are furthest from the civilisation and refinement of (our) Province, and merchants least frequently resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind; and they are the nearest to the Germani, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war; for which reason the Helvetii also surpass the rest of the Gauls in valour, as they contend with the Germani in almost daily battles, when they either repel them from their own territories, or themselves wage war on their frontiers. One part of these, which it has been said that the Gauls occupy, takes its beginning at the River [[Rh\u00f4ne]]; it is bounded by the River [[Garonne]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and the territories of the Belgae; it borders, too, on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii, upon the River [[Rhine]], and stretches toward the north.\n\nThe Belgae rises from the extreme frontier of Gaul, extend to the lower part of the River Rhine; and look toward the north and the rising sun.\n\nAquitania extends from the [[Garonne]] to the [[Pyrenees]] and to that part of the [[Atlantic]] ([[Bay of Biscay]]) which is near [[Spain]]: it looks between the setting of the sun, and the north star.\n|source = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2014 [[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', Book I, chapter 1\n|align =center\n|width =90%\n|quoted=1\n}}\n\n===Language===\n[[File:Bronze cuirass 2900g Grenoble end of 7th early 6th century BCE.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Bronze]] cuirass, weighing 2.9&nbsp;kg, [[Grenoble]], end of 7th century \u2013 early 6th century BCE]]\n{{Main|Gaulish language}}\nGaulish or Gallic is the name given to the [[Celt]]ic language that was spoken in [[Gaul]] before the [[Latin]] of the late [[Roman Empire]] became dominant in [[Roman Gaul]].

Also, worship of animals was not uncommon; the animal most sacred to the Gauls was the [[boar]], which can be found on many Gallic military standards, much like the Roman eagle.\n\nTheir system of [[List of Celtic deities#Gaulish and Brythonic deities|gods and goddesses]] was loose, there being certain deities which virtually every Gallic person {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} worshiped, as well as tribal and household gods. Many of the major gods were related to Greek gods; the primary god worshiped at the time of the arrival of Caesar was [[Toutatis|Teutates]], the Gallic equivalent of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The \"father god\" in Gallic worship was \"Dis Pater\". However, there is no record of a theology {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, just a set of related and evolving traditions of worship.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing facet of Gallic religion is the practice of the [[Druids]]. There is no certainty concerning their origin, but it is clear that they vehemently guarded the secrets of their order and held sway over the people of Gaul. Indeed, they claimed the right to determine questions of war and peace, and thereby held an \"international\" status. In addition, the Druids monitored the religion of ordinary Gauls and were in charge of educating the aristocracy. They also practiced a form of excommunication from the assembly of worshippers, which in ancient Gaul meant a separation from secular society as well. Thus the Druids were an important part of Gallic society.\n\n==List of Gaulish tribes==\n{{See also|List of Celtic tribes}}\n\nAfter completing the conquest of Gaul, Rome converted most of these tribes into [[civitates]], making for the administrative map of the Roman provinces of Gaul. This was then perpetuated by the early church, whose geographical subdivisions were based on those of late Roman Gaul, and lasted into the areas of [[List of Ancien R\u00e9gime dioceses of France|French dioceses]] prior to the French Revolution.\n\n[[File:Gaul warrior Vacheres 1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Sculpture of an armoured torc-wearing Gaul warrior, [[Vach\u00e8res]], France.]]\n[[File:Chambon-sur-Lac2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Celtic cross]], in Chambon-sur-Lac, [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], France.]]\n[[File:Alise-Sainte-Reine statue Vercingetorix par Millet 2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Vercing\u00e9torix]] Memorial in [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]], near the village of [[Alise-Sainte-Reine]], France.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Attention given to the Gauls as the founding population of the French nation was traditionally second to that enjoyed by the [[Franks]], out of whose [[kingdom of the Franks|kingdom]] the historical [[kingdom of France]] arose under the [[Capetian dynasty]]; for example, [[Charles de Gaulle]] is on record as stating, \"For me, the history of France begins with [[Clovis I|Clovis]], elected as king of France by the tribe of the Franks, who gave their name to France. Before Clovis, we have Gallo-Roman and Gaulish prehistory. The decisive element, for me, is that Clovis was the first king to have been baptized a Christian. My country is a Christian country and I reckon the history of France beginning with the accession of a Christian king who bore the name of the Franks.\"\n<ref>\"''Pour moi, l'histoire de France commence avec Clovis, choisi comme roi de France par la tribu des Francs, qui donn\u00e8rent leur nom \u00e0 la France.

Pre-Roman Gaul has been evoked as a template for French independence especially during the [[Third French Republic]]. An iconic phrase summarizing this view is that of \"our ancestors the Gauls\" (''nos anc\u00eatres les Gaulois''), associated with the history textbook for schools by [[Ernest Lavisse]] (1842\u20131922), who taught that \"the Romans established themselves in small numbers; the Franks were not numerous either, Clovis having but a few thousand men with him. The basis of our population has thus remained Gaulish. The Gauls are our ancestors.\"<ref>''Les Romains qui vinrent s'\u00e9tablir en Gaule \u00e9taient en petit nombre. Les Francs n'\u00e9taient pas nombreux non plus, Clovis n'en avait que quelques milliers avec lui. Le fond de notre population est donc rest\u00e9 gaulois. Les Gaulois sont nos anc\u00eatres.''{{-\"}} (cours moyen, p. 26).</ref>\n\n''[[Ast\u00e9rix]]'', the popular series of [[French comics|French comic books]]  following the exploits of a village of \"indomitable Gauls\", satirizes this view by combining scenes set in classical antiquity with modern [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic clich\u00e9s]] of the French and other nations.\n\nSimilarly, in [[Swiss national historiography]] of the 19th century, the Gaulish [[Helvetii]] were chosen as representing the ancestral Swiss population (compare ''[[Helvetia]]'' as national allegory), as the Helvetii had settled in both the French and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, and their Gaulish language set them apart from Latin- and German-speaking populations in equal measure.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Celtic tribes]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Boardman, John (1993).
