The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper [[New York State]], for rebroadcast on W2XB in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] (now [[WRGB]]), making this among the first \"network\" programs of NBC Television. Due to wartime and technical restrictions, there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions, although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day.\n\nAbout this time, there were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC's WNBT in New York City, ([[WNBC]]), and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) in Philadelphia and [[WRGB]] in Schenectady, NY. Such as, Esso sponsored news features a well as The War As It Happens in the final days of World War II, another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program which was also seen in New York, Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5000) television sets which existed at the time. After the war, ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' aired filmed news highlights with narration. Later in 1948, when sponsored by [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel Cigarettes]], ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' was renamed ''[[Camel Newsreel Theatre]]'' and then, when [[John Cameron Swayze]] was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed ''[[Camel News Caravan]]''.\n\nIn 1948, NBC teamed up with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine to provide election night coverage of President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s surprising victory over New York governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. The television audience was small, but NBC's share in New York was double that of any other outlet.<ref>[http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/02/new-york-city-hooper-ratings-for-election-night-1948/ \"New York City Hooper Ratings for Election Night 1948\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302083754/http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/02/new-york-city-hooper-ratings-for-election-night-1948/ |date=March 2, 2009 }} TVObscurities.com.</ref> The following year, the ''[[Camel News Caravan]]'', anchored by [[John Cameron Swayze]], debuted on NBC.

The loss of Huntley, along with a reluctance by RCA to fund NBC News at a similar level as CBS was funding its news division, left NBC News in the doldrums.

However, both NBC News and MSNBC are shown for a few hours a day on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]] Region.\n\nMSNBC is also shown occasionally on sister network [[CNBC Europe]] during [[breaking news]], and Nightly News and Meet the Press are also shown regularly. ''NBC Nightly News'' is shown in the Philippines on [[9TV]] (formerly [[Talk TV (Philippines)|Talktv]] and [[Solar News Channel]]), while ''Early Today'' was officially dropped from the network in December 2013, but they replaced by the repeats of [[Inside Edition]]. ''NBC Nightly News'', along with the full program lineup of NBC, was carried by affiliate [[VSB-TV]] in Bermuda.\n\nThe [[Seven Network]] in [[Australia]] has close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the network's imaging and slogans since the 1970s. ''[[Seven News]]'' has featured ''[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]'' as its news theme since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were named ''Seven Nightly News'' from the mid-1980s until around 2000. NBC and Seven will often share news recourses between the two countries. NBC News has been known to use Seven News reporters for live reports on a developing news story in Australia. Seven News will sometimes also incorporate an NBC News report into its national bulletins. ''Today'', ''Weekend Today'' and ''Meet The Press'' are all broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] during the early morning hours from 3-5 a.m., just before Seven's own morning show ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''.\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' is [[live television|live digital television broadcast transmission]] (or [[broadcast delay|delayed]]) on [[TVB Pearl]] daily from 07:00 until 08:00 [[Hong Kong Time]] (18:00 until 19:00 [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]).\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, used to air segments from ''NBC Nightly News'' on their ''[[ITV News at 5:30]]'' morning newscast before it was cancelled in December 2012.

The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper [[New York State]], for rebroadcast on W2XB in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] (now [[WRGB]]), making this among the first \"network\" programs of NBC Television. Due to wartime and technical restrictions, there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions, although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day.\n\nAbout this time, there were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC's WNBT in New York City, ([[WNBC]]), and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) in Philadelphia and [[WRGB]] in Schenectady, NY. Such as, Esso sponsored news features a well as The War As It Happens in the final days of World War II, another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program which was also seen in New York, Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5000) television sets which existed at the time. After the war, ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' aired filmed news highlights with narration. Later in 1948, when sponsored by [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel Cigarettes]], ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' was renamed ''[[Camel Newsreel Theatre]]'' and then, when [[John Cameron Swayze]] was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed ''[[Camel News Caravan]]''.\n\nIn 1948, NBC teamed up with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine to provide election night coverage of President [[Harry S.

However, both NBC News and MSNBC are shown for a few hours a day on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]] Region.\n\nMSNBC is also shown occasionally on sister network [[CNBC Europe]] during [[breaking news]], and Nightly News and Meet the Press are also shown regularly. ''NBC Nightly News'' is shown in the Philippines on [[9TV]] (formerly [[Talk TV (Philippines)|Talktv]] and [[Solar News Channel]]), while ''Early Today'' was officially dropped from the network in December 2013, but they replaced by the repeats of [[Inside Edition]]. ''NBC Nightly News'', along with the full program lineup of NBC, was carried by affiliate [[VSB-TV]] in Bermuda.\n\nThe [[Seven Network]] in [[Australia]] has close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the network's imaging and slogans since the 1970s. ''[[Seven News]]'' has featured ''[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]'' as its news theme since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were named ''Seven Nightly News'' from the mid-1980s until around 2000. NBC and Seven will often share news recourses between the two countries. NBC News has been known to use Seven News reporters for live reports on a developing news story in Australia. Seven News will sometimes also incorporate an NBC News report into its national bulletins. ''Today'', ''Weekend Today'' and ''Meet The Press'' are all broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] during the early morning hours from 3-5 a.m., just before Seven's own morning show ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''.\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' is [[live television|live digital television broadcast transmission]] (or [[broadcast delay|delayed]]) on [[TVB Pearl]] daily from 07:00 until 08:00 [[Hong Kong Time]] (18:00 until 19:00 [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]).\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, used to air segments from ''NBC Nightly News'' on their ''[[ITV News at 5:30]]'' morning newscast before it was cancelled in December 2012. NBC News share facilities and crew in the UK with [[ITN]], who is the news provider for ITV.\n\n==Theme music==\nMost of NBC's news television programs use \"[[The Mission (theme song)|The Mission]]\" by [[John Williams]] as their theme. The composition was first used by NBC in 1985 and was updated in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|author=Submitted by NBC Universal|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=822|title=SoundtrackNet: News: Legendary Composer John Williams Composes New \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" Theme|publisher=[[Soundtrack.net]]|date=August 30, 2006|accessdate=November 27, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021032305/http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=822|archivedate=October 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{White House James S.
