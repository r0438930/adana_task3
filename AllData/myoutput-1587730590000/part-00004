It stems from a compositional tradition that dates back to the introduction of [[musique concr\u00e8te]] (a form of musique exp\u00e9rimentale)<ref>Palombini, C. (1998), \"[http://www.rem.ufpr.br/_REM/REMv3.1/vol3/Schaefferi.html Pierre Schaeffer, 1953: towards an Experimental Music', an exegesis of Schaeffer's 'Vers une musique exp\u00e9rimentale'], Music & Letters 74 (4): 542--57, Oxford University Press.</ref>  in the late 1940s. Unlike musical works that are realised using [[sheet music]] exclusively, [[musical composition|compositions]] that are purely acousmatic (in listening terms) often exist solely as fixed media [[audio format|audio recordings]].\n\nThe compositional practice of acousmatic music features [[acousmatic sound]] as a central [[musical aspect]]. Other aspects traditionally thought of as 'musical' such as [[melody]], [[harmony]], [[rhythm]], [[Meter (music)|metre]] may be present but more often consideration is given to sound-based characteristics such as [[timbre]] and [[spectral music|spectrum]]. Compositional materials can include sounds derived from [[musical instruments]], [[voice]], electronically generated sound, audio that has been manipulated using various [[effects units|effect processors]], as well as general [[sound effects]] and [[field recordings]].\n\nThe music is produced with the aid of various [[music technology|music technologies]], such as [[digital recording|digital recorders]], [[digital signal processing]] tools and [[digital audio workstation]]s. Using such technology various sound materials can be combined, juxtaposed, and transformed in any conceivable manner. In this context the compositional method can be seen as a process of ''sound organisation'': a term first used by the French composer [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]].<ref>Ouellette, Fernand (1973), ''Edgard Var\u00e8se'', London: Calder and Boyars. {{ISBN|978-0-7145-0208-3}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to certain historical accounts, the origin of the term ''acousmatic'' can be traced back to [[Pythagoras]]; the philosopher is believed to have tutored his [[students]] from behind a screen so as not to let his presence distract them from the content of his lectures. Under these conditions, the listener focuses on the sounds being produced to heighten the sense of hearing. In 1955, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Peignot]] and [[Pierre Schaeffer]] were the first to use the term ''acousmatique'' to define the listening experience of musique concr\u00e8te.<ref>Peignot, J. (1960), De la musique concr\u00e8te \u00e0 l'acousmatique, ''Esprit'', No. 280. Paris: ''Esprit'': 111-123.</ref> It is said to be derived from ''akousmatikoi'', the outer circle of Pythagoras' disciples who only heard their teacher speaking from behind a veil. In a similar way, one hears acousmatic music from behind the 'veil' of loudspeakers, without seeing the source of the sound.<ref>Schaeffer, Pierre (1966), ''Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux'', Paris: \u00c9ditions du Seuil. {{OCLC|301664906}}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\nWithin [[academia]] the term acousmatic music, or acousmatic art,<ref>[[Denis Dufour|Dufour, D.]] (1989), \"Peu importe le son\", ''Le Son des musiques'', Symposium Ina-GRM and France-Culture, Paris: Ina-GRM/Buchet-Chastel.</ref><ref>Dhomont, F. (1996), \"Is there a Quebec sound\", ''Organised Sound'', 1(1), Cambridge University Press.</ref> has gained common usage, particularly when referring to contemporary musique concr\u00e8te; however, there is some dispute as to whether acousmatic practice relates to a style of composition or a way of listening to sound.<ref>McFarlane, M.W.

We are as likely to hear the sounds of a bird, or of a factory as we are the sounds of a [[violin]]. The technology involved transcends the mere reproduction of sounds. Techniques of [[Sound synthesis|synthesis]] and sound processing are employed which may present us with sounds that are unfamiliar and that may defy clear source attribution. Acousmatic compositions may present us with familiar musical events: chords, melodies and rhythms which are easily reconcilable with other forms of music, but may equally present us with events which cannot be classified within such a traditional [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].<ref>Windsor, W.L. (1995). \"A Perceptual Approach to the Description and Analysis of Acousmatic Music\", Ph. D Thesis, City University Department of Music, September 1995, Sheffield.</ref>\n\n==Performance practice==\nAcousmatic compositions are sometimes presented to audiences in concert settings that are often indistinguishable from acoustic recitals, albeit without performers. In an acousmatic concert the sound component is produced using pre-recorded media, or generated in [[Real-time computing|real-time]] using a [[computer]]. The sound material will then be distributed spatially, via multiple [[loudspeakers]], using a practice known as [[Sound diffusion]]. The work is often ''diffused'' by the composer (if present) but the role of interpreter can also be assumed by another practitioner of the art. To provide a guideline for ''spatialisation'' of the work by an interpreter, many composers provide a ''diffusion score''; in its simplest form this might be a graphic representation of the acousmatic work with indications for spatial manipulations, relative to a time-line.<ref>Emmerson, Simon (2007). \"Living Electronic Music\", Aldershot, Hants: Ashgate. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5546-6}}</ref>\n\n==The acousmatic experience==\nIn acousmatic music, listeners are challenged to distinguish sounds, not based on their source, but by their sonic quality. As Pierre Schaeffer writes in his ''Treatise on Musical Objects'' \"The concealment of the causes does not result from a technical imperfection, nor is it an occasional process of variation: it becomes a precondition, a deliberate placing-in-condition of the subject. It is ''toward it'', then, that the question turns around; \"what am I hearing?... What exactly are you hearing\" -in the sense that one asks the subject to describe not the external references of the sound it perceives but the perception itself.\" <ref>Cox, Christopher and Warner, Daniel. ''Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music'' Continuum Books (2002).</ref>\n\nThat music is acousmatic is determined more by ''how'' it is listened to, than by whether it is being played from a loudspeaker or not. In understanding the term 'acousmatic' appropriately, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between sound '''source''' and sound '''identity'''.<ref>Schaeffer, Pierre (1966), ''Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux'', Paris: \u00c9ditions du Seuil. {{OCLC|301664906}}</ref>\n\nIf for example a recording of a solo cello being played in a recognizable way is sounded through a loudspeaker, the source of the sound is the loudspeaker, but its identity is still 'cello' for a listener. Thus, acousmatic music can be said to be that which calls for the listener to perceive sound without (or with a reduced) sensibility to the sound's identity. The listening mode is oriented instead upon more abstract timbral than mimetic aspects of the sound. Pierre Schaeffer has referred to this as ''\u00e9coute r\u00e9duite''. It can be said that an ''\u00e9coute r\u00e9duite'' leads to the perception of music as acousmatic, in the sense that playing sounds from loudspeakers has the potential for obscuring their identity, as the visual reference is removed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Pierre |title=Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux |date=1966 |location=Le Seuil}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Austin, Larry, and Denis Smalley. \"Sound Diffusion in Composition and Performance: An Interview with Denis Smalley\".
