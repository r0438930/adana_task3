And road traffic, including both private cars and heavy vehicles, account for about 10 million tons of {{Co2}}. The NTP set policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from private cars, trucks, ships, aircraft and construction equipment by about one half until 2030.<ref name=NTP01/><ref name=NTP02/>\n\nIn order to achieve this objective, among others, the NTP sets the goal for all sales of new cars, urban buses and light commercial vehicles in 2025 to be [[zero emission vehicles]], this is, all-electric and [[hydrogen vehicle]]s. By 2030, heavy-duty vans, 75% of new long-distance buses, and 50% of new trucks must be zero emission vehicles.<ref name=Outlook2018/><ref name=NTP01/><ref name=NTP02/><ref name=NTP03/> Also, by 2030, 40% of all ships in short sea shipping should be using biofuels or be low- or zero-emission ships. The proposed strategy states that until zero-emission vehicles take over, all internal combustion engine cars sold be plug-in hybrids, and wherever possible, biofuels must be used. Also, government agencies should as far as possible make use of biofuels, low- and zero-emission technologies in private and hired vehicles and vessels. The plan also calls to support the deployment of zero emission vehicles, but also for the reduction of the existing incentives, and proposes to invest more in public transport, walking and cycling.<ref name=NTP01>{{cite web|url=http://www.side3.no/motor/ntp-na-kommer-elbil-bakrusen/3423197581.html |title=NTP: N\u00e5 kommer elbil-bakrusen |language=Norwegian |trans-title=NTP: Now Comes EV Hangover |first = Magnus |last=Blaker |publisher=Side3.no |date=2016-02-29 |accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=NTP02>{{cite web|url=http://www.kystverket.no/Nyheter/2016/februar/ntp-klimautslippene-ma-kuttes/ |title=NTP: Klimautslippene m\u00e5 kuttes |language=Norwegian |trans-title=NTP: Greenhouse gas emissions must be cut  |publisher=[[Norwegian Coastal Administration]] |date=2016-02-29|accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=NTP03>{{cite news |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/norway-aiming-for-100-percent-zero-emission-vehicle-sales-by-2025/ | title=Norway Aiming For 100-Percent Zero Emission Vehicle Sales By 2025 |first=Jeff |last=Cobb|work=HybridCars.com |date=2016-03-08 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of the incentives===\n[[File:Oslo taxi Tesla.jpg|thumb|[[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]] providing [[taxi cab]] service in Oslo]]\n\nSince 2013 several complaints and criticism have arisen due to the rapid increase in the number of electric vehicles on the roads as a result of the existing incentives to promote EV adoption, and particularly about the non-fiscal incentives. These include high public subsidies as compared to the value of the reduced [[carbon footprint]] of electric vehicles; the [[Modal share|travel mode]] shift by people who buy an electric vehicle as a second car instead of taking buses and trains; the potential traffic congestion in Oslo's bus lanes due to the increasing number of electric cars; the loss of revenue for some ferry operators due to the large number of electric cars exempted from payment; and shortage of parking spaces for owners of conventional cars due to preference to electric cars and lack of a cap on parking time.\n\n====Excessive subsidies====\n\nAccording to the results of a study published by [[Reuters]] in March 2013, prepared by Bjart Holtsmark, an analyst of [[Statistics Norway]], the tax exemptions on the purchase of an electric car are worth almost {{USD|11,000}} in comparison to the fully taxed price of a regular [[internal combustion engine]] car, which is equivalent to {{USD|1,400}} a year over a car's lifetime (8 years). The value of the toll exemption for driving into Oslo are worth {{USD|1,400}} per year, the free parking is worth {{USD|5,000}} per year, and electric cars avoid other charges worth {{USD|400}} a year. Without adding value to the benefit of driving in bus lanes, the annual benefit of owning an electric car in Oslo is estimated at {{USD|8,200}} per car, per year. The analysis used a [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]] as the benchmark vehicle. Mr. Holtsmark also pointed out that \"by encouraging people who can afford it to buy a second car instead of taking buses and trains, the electric car scheme may ironically be aggravating environmental problems and causing traffic jams.\"<ref name=Reuters032013/><ref name=Rebuttal/>\n\nThe Norwegian project ''Gr\u00f8nn bil'' (Green Car) disputed these figures because they consider the analysis is based on unrealistic assumptions. The group argues that the analysis used a very short total vehicle lifespan of 7.8 years, while Norway's average is closer to 18 years; it is very unlikely that a vehicle can be parked in Oslo between 1,875 hours and 3,000 hours per year to save the estimated {{USD|5.000}} considering the existing time limits for parking; and the typical EV owner drives around {{Convert|15,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} per year, not the {{Convert|6,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} implicit in the analysis. Using what they consider more realistic assumptions, ''Gr\u00f8nn bil'' estimates that the annual benefit of owning an electric car in Oslo is estimated at {{USD|3,336}} per car, per year, 40% of Holtsmark's estimation. They also found that the cost per tonne of {{co2}} emissions reduced is {{USD|2,499}}, not the {{USD|13,600}} estimated by Holtsmark.<ref name=Rebuttal>{{cite web|url=http://www.gronnbil.no/nyheter/highly-misleading-figures-regarding-norwegian-ev-benefits-in-reuters-article-article326-239.html|title=Highly misleading figures regarding Norwegian EV benefits in Reuters article|author=Ole Henrik Hannisdahl|publisher=Gr\u00f8nn bil|date=2012-03-22|accessdate=2012-04-06}}</ref>\n\n====Bus lane congestion====\n\nIn December 2013 the newspaper ''[[Budstikka]]'' conducted an informal test to measure the difference in travel time between an electric car and a gasoline-powered car during the morning rush hour on a stretch of road between the suburban municipality of [[Asker]] in [[Akershus]], and [[Sk\u00f8yen]], a neighborhood of Oslo. The electric car completed the trip in 19 minutes using the [[bus lane]] while it took 51 minutes for the conventional car traveling in the normal lanes.

The newspaper found that a total of 829 vehicles used the bus lane between 7:30 and 8:30&nbsp;a.m., of which, 618 vehicles were electric cars (74.5%). Buses accounted for only 7.5% of the traffic in the bus lane, and taxis, two-wheelers and mini-buses made up the rest. The Deputy Director of the [[Institute of Transport Economics]] (T\u00d8I) explained that the normal capacity of a highway lane is between 1,800 and 2,000 vehicles per hour, but because of the ramp entrances and exits, and the buses maneuvering in and out the bus lane to do their stops, the traffic flow starts to become troublesome when the number of vehicles in the bus lane is about 1,000 vehicles per hour.

The accelerated growth of electric cars on some ferry routes has caused complaints from [[ferryboat]] operators due to the increasing loss on their [[farebox]] revenues. According to FosenNamsos Sea AS, an operator with four ferry lines servicing [[Hordaland]] county, during the first seven months of 2014 the number of electric vehicles riding the service [[Krokeidet]]-[[Hufthamar]] from Hordaland increased by 215% compared to the same period last year, for a total of 9,226 electric cars not paying the ferry fee through the end of July. The company argues that \"''no one could foresee the tremendous growth of electric cars we see on some ferry routes, but the [[Austevoll]] satellite connection involves a significant loss of revenue for us.''\"<ref name=ferries/>\n\nOn 1 June 2014, the company's home county of [[S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag]] repealed the payment exemption for electric vehicles on the county ferries.

The city has a five-hour time limit for electric cars to use street parking for free, but electric car owners who use their car to commute keep moving their cars during the day and end up having free parking all day while they are at work. A city council member{{who|date=June 2019}} noted that in many streets there are large numbers of plug-in electric vehicles parked all day, and sometimes there are more electric cars than regular cars.

The study found that the typical electric car owner is a middle-aged family father with higher education and income, and he owns a Nissan Leaf as one of two cars. A total of 85% of the respondents had two or more cars in their household because they need a second car for longer journeys given the limited range current electric cars can provide. However, for everyday needs, the study found that one electric car is sufficient. Norwegians travel 42&nbsp;km on average every day, mostly by car. Based on the survey, the study found that 15% of the electric car owners do their daily travel with just their one electric car. These users opt for public transport or car rental/[[car sharing|sharing]] for longer trips, because high taxation on traditional cars in Norway makes it expensive to own a car.<ref name=Survey2013>{{cite web| url=https://www.tekes.fi/contentassets/c2e729551a964321958a0c6c6c33b45f/norwegian_electric_car_user_experiences_-_evs27_paper.pdf | title=Norwegian electric car user experiences | first1=Petter | last1=Haugneland | first2=Hans | last2=H\u00e5vard Kvisle | publisher=EVS27 Barcelona | date=November 2013 | accessdate=2016-08-22}}</ref>\n\nThe study also found that about half of the respondents to the 2013 survey own a Nissan Leaf the best-selling electric car in Norway and among the top five at the general model ranking. About 5% of the respondents had more than one electric car, as some owners kept their old electric car (such as Th!nk and Buddy) when they bought a new one. The survey showed that in most cases electric cars replaced a traditional car (87%), but also use of public transport (10%), and walking and bicycling (1%). Regarding everyday use of electric cars, the study found that owners use the electric car mostly for commuting to work (89.6%), shopping (88.4%) and driving to after work activities (77.0%). Other uses include delivery of children to school or kindergarten (40.9%) and for business purposes (40.2%). On the other hand, use of the electric car for holiday travel is very limited (11.7%).<ref name=Survey2013/>\n\nAs for the charging patterns, the 2013 survey found that 85% of the respondents could charge in their own garage or parking lot, and 10% had access to charging in the shared apartment building where they live. This means that 95% of the respondents were able to charge their electric cars at home during the night. The survey showed that 59% of the respondents had access to charging where they work, and 48% at public charging stations in the area they normally use the electric car.<ref name=Survey2013/>\n\n===2016 survey===\nThe Norwegian [[Institute of Transport Economics]] conducted in March 2016 a survey among over 8,000 vehicle owners in Norway. The study's aim was to identified how the plug-in vehicles are used, why they are bought and how the technology is rated compared to owners of [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) vehicles. The sample consisted of 3,111 all-electric vehicles (BEV) owners, 2,065 private plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners, and 3,080 ICE vehicle owners.<ref name=TOI2016/> The study found that buyers of BEVs and PHEVs have different transport needs but both are motivated by economy of use and environment, whereas all-electric vehicle owners are also motivated by the free toll road incentive. The survey showed that normally diesel and gasoline vehicles are replaced with the purchase of a plug-in vehicle, but a larger share of battery electric vehicles become extra vehicles in households. BEV owners are younger, have more children, travel a longer distance to work and own more vehicles than other vehicle owners.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\n[[File:Elbilfestival i Geiranger.jpg|thumb|275px|Electric vehicle festival in [[Geiranger]]]]\nMost BEV owners (71%) also own an ICEV, 4% a PHEV, and 4% more than one BEV. The remaining 21% only have one BEV. 46% of PHEV owners and 48% of ICEV owners belong to single vehicle household. The most multipurpose BEV, [[Tesla Model S]], is twice as common in single BEV households as in households also owning ICEVs, and four times as common in households owning several BEVs.<ref name=TOI2016/> Based on the survey, the researchers found that plug-in hybrid owners in Norway drive on average 55% of their annual distance in charge-depleting or all-electric mode ([[EV mode]]), and the share goes up to about 63% for work trips. The share of electric travel is higher for trips to work and in the summer, and lower in the winter. The average plug-in hybrid user in the survey drives 60% of the total distance in EV mode in the summer and 53% in winter. The estimate for work trips is higher at 70% in the summer and 59% in winter. On the other hand, the study found that battery electric vehicles are driven more in total and in everyday traffic.<ref name=TOI2016>{{cite web| url=https://www.toi.no/getfile.php?mmfileid=43161 | title=Learning from Norwegian Battery Electric and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle users |first1=Erik |last1=Figenbaum |first2=Marika |last2=Kolbenstvedt |publisher=[[Institute of Transport Economics]] (T\u00d8I), Norwegian Centre for Transport Research |date=June 2016 |accessdate=2016-08-17}} ''T\u00d8I report 1492/2016. See: \"Hydropower use\" - pp.1, \"Estimated percentage in EV mode\" - pp. 55.''</ref>\n\nAccording to the survey results, plug-in vehicles are mainly charged at home, whether in their garage or at an outdoor parking on the owner property, with 59% of BEV owners and 74% of PHEV owners charging this way. Only 6% of BEV owners and 5% of PHEV owners never charge at home. Charging at work is relatively common among BEV owners, 28% do it more than twice a week, 38% weekly. About 21% of PHEV owners do it at least weekly. Charging elsewhere is rare, but BEVs owners more frequently recharged at public charging stations and shopping centers than\nPHEV owners. Fast charging is used for irregular trips where users plan to use fast chargers to accomplish the trip or to solve a problem on the go. Most battery electric vehicle owners manage everyday life well and are satisfied with the vehicle which in combination with attractive local incentives not available to plug-in hybrid owners and other vehicle users.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\nPeer-to-peer influences is particularly important to diffusion of battery electric vehicles being the biggest source of information leading to the purchase. Plug-in hybrid buyers received most information leading to the purchase from dealers and advertising material. The four reasons most frequently mentioned by the 89% of BEV owners who say they will buy a BEV again are economy of use, environmental performance, future proof technology, and the free usage of toll roads without paying. Less than 1% will not buy a BEV again. The reasons not to buy again are range and charging issues. The three main reasons why 80% of PHEV owners say they will buy one again are economy of use, environmental performance and that the technology is future proof. Only 2% will not buy a PHEV again. The main reasons not to buy again are the short range in all-electric mode and inability to use EV mode when it is cold.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\n===2018 survey===\n\nThe Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association (''Norsk Elbilforening'') conducted a survey among all-electric car owners in June 2018, with a total of 9,520 respondents. The study found that 63% of Norwegian households with electric cars also have a fossil car or hybrid car, down from 70% in 2017.

One factor in the slow decline of oil consumption is Norway's relatively rapid population growth. Another factor is the significant number of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles still on the roads, with only 5% being plug-in electric passenger cars by the end of 2016.<ref name=TopTen2016/><ref name=OilForbes/>\n\nHowever, according to [[Forbes]], government figures for the sales of petroleum products in 2017, show that for the first time since 2014 Norway's consumption of gasoline and diesel declined across the board in 2017. Motor gasoline sales declined by 2.9%, dutiable diesel fell by 2.7%, and duty-free diesel (used by agricultural equipment) declined by 2.6%. This decline follows oil sales that were flat in 2014, and then grew by 1% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2016.<ref name=OilForbes>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/05/24/electric-vehicles-could-finally-be-reducing-norways-fuel-consumption/#231f27c23ff6 |title=Electric Vehicles Could Finally Be Reducing Norway's Fuel Consumption | first=Robert | last= Rapier | work=[[Forbes]] | date=2017-05-24 | accessdate=2018-10-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Elbil Parkering Plass Oslo 10 2018 3806.jpg|thumb|450px|center|All-electric cars at a dedicated parking lot reserved for charging in Oslo. {{Asof|2016|12}}, plug-in electrics represented 5% of all passenger cars on the road,<ref name=TopTen2016/><ref name=OilForbes/> and 10% by the end of October 2018.<ref name=Norway10pct/>]]\n\n== Effects on average fleet CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ==\n\n[[File:Average fleet CO2 emissions Norway.png|thumb|275px|Historical trend of annual average new fleet {{CO2}} emissions in Norway (2011-2018).<br>Source: Norwegian Road Federation (OFV)]]\n\nA 2009 [[Directive (European Union)|European Union regulation]] set a mandatory [[European emission standards#Obligatory vehicle CO2 emission limits|average {{CO2}} emissions target for new cars]] of 130 g/km, that were phased in between 2012 and 2015.

And road traffic, including both private cars and heavy vehicles, account for about 10 million tons of {{Co2}}. The NTP set policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from private cars, trucks, ships, aircraft and construction equipment by about one half until 2030.<ref name=NTP01/><ref name=NTP02/>\n\nIn order to achieve this objective, among others, the NTP sets the goal for all sales of new cars, urban buses and light commercial vehicles in 2025 to be [[zero emission vehicles]], this is, all-electric and [[hydrogen vehicle]]s. By 2030, heavy-duty vans, 75% of new long-distance buses, and 50% of new trucks must be zero emission vehicles.<ref name=Outlook2018/><ref name=NTP01/><ref name=NTP02/><ref name=NTP03/> Also, by 2030, 40% of all ships in short sea shipping should be using biofuels or be low- or zero-emission ships. The proposed strategy states that until zero-emission vehicles take over, all internal combustion engine cars sold be plug-in hybrids, and wherever possible, biofuels must be used. Also, government agencies should as far as possible make use of biofuels, low- and zero-emission technologies in private and hired vehicles and vessels. The plan also calls to support the deployment of zero emission vehicles, but also for the reduction of the existing incentives, and proposes to invest more in public transport, walking and cycling.<ref name=NTP01>{{cite web|url=http://www.side3.no/motor/ntp-na-kommer-elbil-bakrusen/3423197581.html |title=NTP: N\u00e5 kommer elbil-bakrusen |language=Norwegian |trans-title=NTP: Now Comes EV Hangover |first = Magnus |last=Blaker |publisher=Side3.no |date=2016-02-29 |accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=NTP02>{{cite web|url=http://www.kystverket.no/Nyheter/2016/februar/ntp-klimautslippene-ma-kuttes/ |title=NTP: Klimautslippene m\u00e5 kuttes |language=Norwegian |trans-title=NTP: Greenhouse gas emissions must be cut  |publisher=[[Norwegian Coastal Administration]] |date=2016-02-29|accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=NTP03>{{cite news |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/norway-aiming-for-100-percent-zero-emission-vehicle-sales-by-2025/ | title=Norway Aiming For 100-Percent Zero Emission Vehicle Sales By 2025 |first=Jeff |last=Cobb|work=HybridCars.com |date=2016-03-08 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of the incentives===\n[[File:Oslo taxi Tesla.jpg|thumb|[[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]] providing [[taxi cab]] service in Oslo]]\n\nSince 2013 several complaints and criticism have arisen due to the rapid increase in the number of electric vehicles on the roads as a result of the existing incentives to promote EV adoption, and particularly about the non-fiscal incentives. These include high public subsidies as compared to the value of the reduced [[carbon footprint]] of electric vehicles; the [[Modal share|travel mode]] shift by people who buy an electric vehicle as a second car instead of taking buses and trains; the potential traffic congestion in Oslo's bus lanes due to the increasing number of electric cars; the loss of revenue for some ferry operators due to the large number of electric cars exempted from payment; and shortage of parking spaces for owners of conventional cars due to preference to electric cars and lack of a cap on parking time.\n\n====Excessive subsidies====\n\nAccording to the results of a study published by [[Reuters]] in March 2013, prepared by Bjart Holtsmark, an analyst of [[Statistics Norway]], the tax exemptions on the purchase of an electric car are worth almost {{USD|11,000}} in comparison to the fully taxed price of a regular [[internal combustion engine]] car, which is equivalent to {{USD|1,400}} a year over a car's lifetime (8 years). The value of the toll exemption for driving into Oslo are worth {{USD|1,400}} per year, the free parking is worth {{USD|5,000}} per year, and electric cars avoid other charges worth {{USD|400}} a year. Without adding value to the benefit of driving in bus lanes, the annual benefit of owning an electric car in Oslo is estimated at {{USD|8,200}} per car, per year. The analysis used a [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]] as the benchmark vehicle. Mr. Holtsmark also pointed out that \"by encouraging people who can afford it to buy a second car instead of taking buses and trains, the electric car scheme may ironically be aggravating environmental problems and causing traffic jams.\"<ref name=Reuters032013/><ref name=Rebuttal/>\n\nThe Norwegian project ''Gr\u00f8nn bil'' (Green Car) disputed these figures because they consider the analysis is based on unrealistic assumptions. The group argues that the analysis used a very short total vehicle lifespan of 7.8 years, while Norway's average is closer to 18 years; it is very unlikely that a vehicle can be parked in Oslo between 1,875 hours and 3,000 hours per year to save the estimated {{USD|5.000}} considering the existing time limits for parking; and the typical EV owner drives around {{Convert|15,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} per year, not the {{Convert|6,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} implicit in the analysis. Using what they consider more realistic assumptions, ''Gr\u00f8nn bil'' estimates that the annual benefit of owning an electric car in Oslo is estimated at {{USD|3,336}} per car, per year, 40% of Holtsmark's estimation. They also found that the cost per tonne of {{co2}} emissions reduced is {{USD|2,499}}, not the {{USD|13,600}} estimated by Holtsmark.<ref name=Rebuttal>{{cite web|url=http://www.gronnbil.no/nyheter/highly-misleading-figures-regarding-norwegian-ev-benefits-in-reuters-article-article326-239.html|title=Highly misleading figures regarding Norwegian EV benefits in Reuters article|author=Ole Henrik Hannisdahl|publisher=Gr\u00f8nn bil|date=2012-03-22|accessdate=2012-04-06}}</ref>\n\n====Bus lane congestion====\n\nIn December 2013 the newspaper ''[[Budstikka]]'' conducted an informal test to measure the difference in travel time between an electric car and a gasoline-powered car during the morning rush hour on a stretch of road between the suburban municipality of [[Asker]] in [[Akershus]], and [[Sk\u00f8yen]], a neighborhood of Oslo. The electric car completed the trip in 19 minutes using the [[bus lane]] while it took 51 minutes for the conventional car traveling in the normal lanes.

The newspaper found that a total of 829 vehicles used the bus lane between 7:30 and 8:30&nbsp;a.m., of which, 618 vehicles were electric cars (74.5%). Buses accounted for only 7.5% of the traffic in the bus lane, and taxis, two-wheelers and mini-buses made up the rest. The Deputy Director of the [[Institute of Transport Economics]] (T\u00d8I) explained that the normal capacity of a highway lane is between 1,800 and 2,000 vehicles per hour, but because of the ramp entrances and exits, and the buses maneuvering in and out the bus lane to do their stops, the traffic flow starts to become troublesome when the number of vehicles in the bus lane is about 1,000 vehicles per hour. Although by December 2013 the traffic is approaching this limit, T\u00d8I's Deputy Director did not want to predict when this critical situation will occur. The Manager of the green car advocate group Gr\u00f8nn Bil warned that \"if the only reason people bought an electric car is to drive in the bus lane, they will probably be disappointed sooner or later.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/elbilene-kan-gi-full-stopp-i-kollektivfeltet-neste-ar-1.8203938|title=Elbilene kan gi full stopp i kollektivfeltet neste \u00e5r|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Electric cars can cause full stop in the bus lanes next year|author1=Nils H.

The accelerated growth of electric cars on some ferry routes has caused complaints from [[ferryboat]] operators due to the increasing loss on their [[farebox]] revenues. According to FosenNamsos Sea AS, an operator with four ferry lines servicing [[Hordaland]] county, during the first seven months of 2014 the number of electric vehicles riding the service [[Krokeidet]]-[[Hufthamar]] from Hordaland increased by 215% compared to the same period last year, for a total of 9,226 electric cars not paying the ferry fee through the end of July.

The study found that the typical electric car owner is a middle-aged family father with higher education and income, and he owns a Nissan Leaf as one of two cars. A total of 85% of the respondents had two or more cars in their household because they need a second car for longer journeys given the limited range current electric cars can provide. However, for everyday needs, the study found that one electric car is sufficient. Norwegians travel 42&nbsp;km on average every day, mostly by car. Based on the survey, the study found that 15% of the electric car owners do their daily travel with just their one electric car.

About 5% of the respondents had more than one electric car, as some owners kept their old electric car (such as Th!nk and Buddy) when they bought a new one. The survey showed that in most cases electric cars replaced a traditional car (87%), but also use of public transport (10%), and walking and bicycling (1%). Regarding everyday use of electric cars, the study found that owners use the electric car mostly for commuting to work (89.6%), shopping (88.4%) and driving to after work activities (77.0%). Other uses include delivery of children to school or kindergarten (40.9%) and for business purposes (40.2%).

The study's aim was to identified how the plug-in vehicles are used, why they are bought and how the technology is rated compared to owners of [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) vehicles. The sample consisted of 3,111 all-electric vehicles (BEV) owners, 2,065 private plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners, and 3,080 ICE vehicle owners.<ref name=TOI2016/> The study found that buyers of BEVs and PHEVs have different transport needs but both are motivated by economy of use and environment, whereas all-electric vehicle owners are also motivated by the free toll road incentive. The survey showed that normally diesel and gasoline vehicles are replaced with the purchase of a plug-in vehicle, but a larger share of battery electric vehicles become extra vehicles in households. BEV owners are younger, have more children, travel a longer distance to work and own more vehicles than other vehicle owners.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\n[[File:Elbilfestival i Geiranger.jpg|thumb|275px|Electric vehicle festival in [[Geiranger]]]]\nMost BEV owners (71%) also own an ICEV, 4% a PHEV, and 4% more than one BEV. The remaining 21% only have one BEV. 46% of PHEV owners and 48% of ICEV owners belong to single vehicle household. The most multipurpose BEV, [[Tesla Model S]], is twice as common in single BEV households as in households also owning ICEVs, and four times as common in households owning several BEVs.<ref name=TOI2016/> Based on the survey, the researchers found that plug-in hybrid owners in Norway drive on average 55% of their annual distance in charge-depleting or all-electric mode ([[EV mode]]), and the share goes up to about 63% for work trips. The share of electric travel is higher for trips to work and in the summer, and lower in the winter. The average plug-in hybrid user in the survey drives 60% of the total distance in EV mode in the summer and 53% in winter. The estimate for work trips is higher at 70% in the summer and 59% in winter. On the other hand, the study found that battery electric vehicles are driven more in total and in everyday traffic.<ref name=TOI2016>{{cite web| url=https://www.toi.no/getfile.php?mmfileid=43161 | title=Learning from Norwegian Battery Electric and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle users |first1=Erik |last1=Figenbaum |first2=Marika |last2=Kolbenstvedt |publisher=[[Institute of Transport Economics]] (T\u00d8I), Norwegian Centre for Transport Research |date=June 2016 |accessdate=2016-08-17}} ''T\u00d8I report 1492/2016. See: \"Hydropower use\" - pp.1, \"Estimated percentage in EV mode\" - pp. 55.''</ref>\n\nAccording to the survey results, plug-in vehicles are mainly charged at home, whether in their garage or at an outdoor parking on the owner property, with 59% of BEV owners and 74% of PHEV owners charging this way. Only 6% of BEV owners and 5% of PHEV owners never charge at home. Charging at work is relatively common among BEV owners, 28% do it more than twice a week, 38% weekly. About 21% of PHEV owners do it at least weekly. Charging elsewhere is rare, but BEVs owners more frequently recharged at public charging stations and shopping centers than\nPHEV owners. Fast charging is used for irregular trips where users plan to use fast chargers to accomplish the trip or to solve a problem on the go. Most battery electric vehicle owners manage everyday life well and are satisfied with the vehicle which in combination with attractive local incentives not available to plug-in hybrid owners and other vehicle users.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\nPeer-to-peer influences is particularly important to diffusion of battery electric vehicles being the biggest source of information leading to the purchase. Plug-in hybrid buyers received most information leading to the purchase from dealers and advertising material. The four reasons most frequently mentioned by the 89% of BEV owners who say they will buy a BEV again are economy of use, environmental performance, future proof technology, and the free usage of toll roads without paying. Less than 1% will not buy a BEV again. The reasons not to buy again are range and charging issues. The three main reasons why 80% of PHEV owners say they will buy one again are economy of use, environmental performance and that the technology is future proof. Only 2% will not buy a PHEV again. The main reasons not to buy again are the short range in all-electric mode and inability to use EV mode when it is cold.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\n===2018 survey===\n\nThe Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association (''Norsk Elbilforening'') conducted a survey among all-electric car owners in June 2018, with a total of 9,520 respondents. The study found that 63% of Norwegian households with electric cars also have a fossil car or hybrid car, down from 70% in 2017.

Figures for 2014 and 2015 correspond only to new car registrations. The breakdown between new and used import for the Nissan Leaf and the Kia Soul EV is shown because these are the two PEV models with the largest share of used import registrations (almost 70%).<!--The source providing registration figures for both used and new registrations stopped publishing them in September 2014.

Source: Statistisk sentralbyr\u00e5 (Statistics Norway).]]\n\nDespite having for many years the world's highest growth rates and highest penetration of EVs, Norway's crude oil consumption for motor vehicles increased from 2013 to 2016, particularly dutiable diesel fuel. One factor in the slow decline of oil consumption is Norway's relatively rapid population growth. Another factor is the significant number of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles still on the roads, with only 5% being plug-in electric passenger cars by the end of 2016.<ref name=TopTen2016/><ref name=OilForbes/>\n\nHowever, according to [[Forbes]], government figures for the sales of petroleum products in 2017, show that for the first time since 2014 Norway's consumption of gasoline and diesel declined across the board in 2017. Motor gasoline sales declined by 2.9%, dutiable diesel fell by 2.7%, and duty-free diesel (used by agricultural equipment) declined by 2.6%. This decline follows oil sales that were flat in 2014, and then grew by 1% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2016.<ref name=OilForbes>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/05/24/electric-vehicles-could-finally-be-reducing-norways-fuel-consumption/#231f27c23ff6 |title=Electric Vehicles Could Finally Be Reducing Norway's Fuel Consumption | first=Robert | last= Rapier | work=[[Forbes]] | date=2017-05-24 | accessdate=2018-10-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Elbil Parkering Plass Oslo 10 2018 3806.jpg|thumb|450px|center|All-electric cars at a dedicated parking lot reserved for charging in Oslo. {{Asof|2016|12}}, plug-in electrics represented 5% of all passenger cars on the road,<ref name=TopTen2016/><ref name=OilForbes/> and 10% by the end of October 2018.<ref name=Norway10pct/>]]\n\n== Effects on average fleet CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ==\n\n[[File:Average fleet CO2 emissions Norway.png|thumb|275px|Historical trend of annual average new fleet {{CO2}} emissions in Norway (2011-2018).<br>Source: Norwegian Road Federation (OFV)]]\n\nA 2009 [[Directive (European Union)|European Union regulation]] set a mandatory [[European emission standards#Obligatory vehicle CO2 emission limits|average {{CO2}} emissions target for new cars]] of 130 g/km, that were phased in between 2012 and 2015.

According to the magazine, [[Kia Motors]] is registering the electric cars in Germany and then shipping them to Norway, which does not belong to the [[European Union]], as a strategy to reduce the average {{CO2}} fleet emissions of the entire [[Hyundai-Kia Group]]. This strategy allows the carmaker to comply with European Union regulations that mandate 130 grams of {{CO2}} emission per km in 2015, and so they avoid to pay a fine of {{euro|70 million}} per year for each gram above the established average limit.
