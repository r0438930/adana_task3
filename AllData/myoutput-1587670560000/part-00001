In 1917 Gipsy Hill College for teacher training opened, a predecessor of Kingston University. In 1930 the [[Kingston School of Art]] separated from the Technical Institute, later to become Kingston College of Art in 1945. In 1946 Gipsy Hill College moved to Kingston Hill. In 1951, the first Penryhn Road campus buildings opened. Kingston was recognised as a 'Regional College of Technology' by the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]] in 1957. In 1970, the College of Technology merged with the College of Art to become Kingston Polytechnic, offering 34 major courses, of which 17 were at degree level.<ref name=kuwebsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingston.ac.uk/aboutkingstonuniversity/factsandfigures/ourhistory/|title=Our history - Facts and figures|website=Kingston University Website|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref> In 1975, Kingston merged with the Gipsy Hill College of Education, incorporating the College's faculty into Kingston's Division of Educational Studies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.kingston.ac.uk/documents/aboutkingstonuniversity/factsandfigures/ourhistory/documents/history-of-kingston-text.pdf|title=A History of Kingston university|last=Gibson|first=Michael|date=1999|publisher=Kingston University|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nKingston was granted university status under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].

The examiner was persuaded to moderate her criticism following contact from a member of the University's staff.
