The EU directive 2019/904 (Article 5) of the European Parliament and of the Council (5 June 2019) the introduction of single use plastics made from oxo-degradable plastics was prohibited because they believed that they created microplastics.\n .<ref name=\"EUdirective5thJune2019\">[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0904&from=EN the EU directive 2019/904 (Article 5)], EU directive 5th June 2019</ref>  However, there is no dossier by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to support this.  ECHA was asked to investigate and one 30th October 2018, they said that they were not convinced that microplastics were forms.  There are therefore questions over the validity of a ban, and the EU will also need to clarify that it does not apply to oxo-biodegradable plastic.\n\nThere is a very big difference between oxo-degradable and oxo-biodegradable plastics. There is a case for banning plastics that are persistent and simply fragment, as has been done in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and elsewhere, but this does not apply to oxo-biodegradable plastics which are designed to degrade and biodegrade if littered in the environment on land or in the marine environment.  Microplastics are formed by the disintegration of ordinary plastics. \n\n==Background==\nThere are two different types of [[biodegradable plastic]]:\n\n* Vegetable-based plastics, which are also loosely known as \"[[bioplastics]]\" or \"[[compostable plastics]]\", are tested in accordance with ASTM D6400 or EN13432 as to their ability to biodegrade under conditions found in [[industrial composting]] or [[biogas]] facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bpiworld.org/page-190422|title=ASTM D6400 - Test for Compostability|website=Biodegradable Products Institute|accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n* Oxo-biodegradable plastics\u2014which are made from polymers such as [[polyethylene]] (PE), [[polypropylene]] (PP), or [[polystyrene]] (PS)\u2014contain a prodegradant catalyst\u2014often a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[manganese]] or [[iron]], and are tested in accordance with [[ASTM]] D6954 or BS8472, or [[AFNOR]] Accord T51-808, as to their ability to degrade and then biodegrade in the open environment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The prodegradant [[Catalysis|catalyze]]s the [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] degradation process so that Oxo-biodegradable plastic will degrade in the presence of oxygen much more quickly than ordinary plastic.<ref>Eyheraguibel, B., et al (2017).

The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN, for ''Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation'') has established the following definitions, in TR 15351:\n\n1. Oxo-degradation is degradation resulting from \"oxidative cleavage of macromolecules\";\n\n2. Oxo-biodegradation is \"degradation resulting from oxidative and cell-mediated phenomena, either simultaneously or successively.\n\nWith regard to definition 2, an oxo-biodegredable [[polyolefin]] plastic file (e.g. [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], and all their combinations), incorporating a catalyst that ensures fast oxidative cleavage of its macromolecules, will become biodegradable by cell-mediated phenomena (bacteria and fungi) in the environment and much more quickly than conventional ordinary plastic.\n\n==Degradation process==\n[[Chemical decomposition|Degradation]] is a process that takes place in almost all materials. Conventional [[polyethylene]] (PE) and [[polypropylene]] (PP) plastics will typically fragment quite quickly, but will then take decades to become [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]]. OXO-degradable products utilize a catalyst to speed up the fragmentation.\n\n[[File:Plastic degradtion.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration of the OXO-Degradation: A process whereby the conventional polyolefin plastic is first oxidised to short-chain oxygenated molecules{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.]]\n\nThe first process of degradation in OXO-treated plastic is an [[oxidative]] [[chain scission]] that is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by metal [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], leading to oxygenated ([[hydroxyl]]ated and [[carboxyl]]ated) shorter-chain molecules.\n\nOXO-degradable plastic, if discarded in the environment, will degrade to oxygenated low-molecular-weight chains (typically MW 5\u201310,000 [[Atomic mass unit|amu]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} within 2\u201318 months, depending on the material ([[Synthetic resin|resin]], thickness, [[Antioxidant|anti-oxidants]], etc.), temperature, and other factors in the environment. By contrast, old-fashioned plastic will take decades to reach this stage, and in the meantime will have [[adsorbed]] toxins.\n\nOXO-degradable plastics are designed so that they will not degrade deep in [[landfill]] and they will not therefore generate [[methane]] (a powerful [[greenhouse gas]]) in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions.\n\nOXO-degradable products do not degrade immediately in an open environment because they are stabilized to give the product a useful service-life, during which they do not break down.\n\nOXO-degradation of polymer material has been studied in depth at the [[Technical Research Institute of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} A peer-reviewed report of the work showed 91% biodegradation in a [[soil]] environment within 24 months, when tested in accordance with ISO 17556.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jakubowicz |first=Ignacy |last2=Yarahmadi |first2=Nazdaneh |last3=Arthurson |first3=Veronica |title=Kinetics of abiotic and biotic degradability of low-density polyethylene containing prodegradant additives and its effect on the growth of microbial communities |date=1 May 2011 |journal=[[Polymer Degradation and Stability]] |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=919\u2013928 |issn=0141-3910 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.01.031 |language=en}}</ref> OXO-degradation has been studied at the [[Eurofins Scientific|Eurofins]] laboratory in Spain, where on 25 July 2017 they noted 88.9% biodegradation in 121 days, and in many other laboratories around the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} OXO-degradable plastics have been degraded in real time in [[seawater]] at the Banyul laboratory in France.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe statements about biodegradation of oxo-degradable plastics have however been disputed by the EU. In a 2017 report it was stated that the biodegradation of the fragmented pieces is only partially supported <ref name=\":12\">[http://publications.europa.eu/resource/cellar/ab9d2024-2fca-11e7-9412-01aa75ed71a1.0001.01/DOC_1 Study to provide information supplementing the study on the impact of the use of \"oxo-degradable\" plastic on the environment\"]. European Commission. April, 2017.</ref>\n\n==Standards applicability==\nOxo-biodegradable plastic degrades in the presence of [[oxygen]]. Heat and [[UV light]] will accelerate the process, but neither they nor moisture are necessary. Such plastic is not designed to be [[compostable]] in open [[industrial composting]] facilities, according to ASTM D6400 or EN13432; but it can be satisfactorily composted in an in-vessel process.\n\nASTM D6400 and EN13432, the standards for industrial composting, require oxo-biodegradable material to convert to [[CO2]] gas within 180 days by industrial composting, which is faster than degradation in the open environment. A leaf is generally considered to be [[biodegradable]], but it will not pass the ASTM composting standards, due to the 180-day limit. Indeed, materials which do comply with ASTM D6400, EN13432, Australian 4736, and ISO 17088 cannot properly be described as \"compostable\". This is because those standards require them to convert substantially to CO2 gas within 180 days. You cannot therefore make them into compost\u2014only into CO2 gas. This contributes to [[climate change]], but does nothing for the soil.\n\nOXO-biodegradable plastic conforms to the American Standard (ASTM D6954) and a British Standard (BS8472), which specify procedures to test degradability, biodegradability, and non-toxicity, and with which a properly designed and manufactured OXO product must comply. These standards contain pass/fail criteria.\n\nThere is no need to refer to a standard specification unless a specific disposal route (e.g., composting), is envisaged. ASTM D6400, EN13432, and  Australian 4736 are standard specifications appropriate only for the special conditions found in industrial composting.\n\nAccording to an EU report the oxo-degradable plastics do not biodegrade on a landfill neither should they be regarded as compostable.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==New Research==\nIn August 2019 a new scientific study into oxo-biodegradable plastics was published. this important study by Queen Mary university London (\"QMUL\") adds further weight to the four decades of scientific research into this technology.\n\nThe QMUL study  <ref>https://doi.org/10.1107/719476</ref> was conducted by Dr rose, R., Richardson, K., Latvanen, E.,Hanson, C. and Sanders, I.\n\nQMUL developed a new scientific approach to the assessment of biodegradability of plastics by monitoring bacterial respiration in aqueous media, with plastic as the sole source of carbon. the main findings were that:\n- Oxo-biodegradable plastic demonstrated up to 90 times more biodegradation than conventional plastic, when aged for the same period of time.\n- The degraded material was biodegraded by bacteria found in soil and marine environments\n- Molecular-weight reduction is a critical factor in the rate and extend of biodegradation, showing that biodegradability increases as molecular-weight reduces.\n- The use of a prodegradant catalyst such as that in a d2w masterbatch, caused a rapid reduction of molecular weight.\n- The plastic samples tested for biodegradation were abiotically degraded under both real life and laboratory conditions.\n\n\n\n==Environmental issues==\n\nThe problem with conventional plastic is that it is very durable. Which means that if it is not collected for disposal/recycling it can persist in the open environment for decades.  During this time it is a visual eyesore, it can clog drainage systems, provide a habitat for disease carrying pests. It can also endanger wildlife by entanglement or ingestion.\n\nOxo-biodegradable plastic, including plastic carrier bags, will degrade quicker in the open environment that conventional plastic.\n\nhowever, the European Commission is advocating a circular economy, but in the case of plastics this can only apply to the plastic that is collected.  There is no policy for plastic which is not collected and can therefore lie or float around for decades.  This is the problem for which oxo-biodegradable plastic was invented.\n\nA circular economy is one in which goods are made, used and recycled back into other goods.  By definition, compostable plastics do not meet this criteria.\n\nThe name 'compostable' is misleading, because compostable plastics are tested according to ASTM D6400 and EN13432 to biodegrade in industrial composting facilities, where they are required by these standards to convert 90% of the materials into CO2 gas in 180 days. they do not therefore make compost of anything useful for the soil, only CO2 which is a powerful greenhouse gas.  they contribute to climate-change, but they do not contribute to a circular economy.\n\nAnother problem with plant-based plastics is that we should not be using valuable land/food resources to make plastic.  In addition to which, once polymerised, a plant-based plastic is no better for the environment than conventional plastic, in that it will persist in the environment in the same way as conventional plastic, eventually degrading into microplastics. \n</blockquote>\n\n==Controversy==\nOn 6 November 2017, the [[Ellen MacArthur Foundation]] issued a paper supported by 150 organisations\u2014including [[M&S]], [[PepsiCo]], and [[Unilever]]\u2014backing a call to ban oxo-biodegradable plastics. The report had support from industry associations including the [[British Plastics Federation Recycling Group]] and the [[Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association]], NGOs such as the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF), scientists including those based at [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]], and ten [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from nine EU countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.european-bioplastics.org/over-150-organisations-back-call-to-ban-oxo-degradable-plastic-packaging/|title=Over 150 organisations back call to ban oxo-degradable plastic packaging|website=european-bioplastics.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Oxo-Biodegradable Plastics Association (OPA) however, claimed the report was inaccurate. It argued many of the 150 organisations aggressively promoted a rival bio-plastic technology, while many of the others whose logos appeared in the document were themselves producers of the plastic items that get into the open environment as litter. The paper's conclusions were rejected by Professor Ignacy Jacubowicz, who said the degradation process was not merely a fragmentation, but a change from a high molecular weight polymer to a material that can be bio-assimilated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.symphonyenvironmental.com/opa-responds-macarthur-report/|title=OPA responds to MacArthur report {{!}} Symphony Environmental Technologies Plc|date=2017-11-13|work=Symphony Environmental Technologies Plc|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation have since met with the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association scientists and have withdrawn in their 2019 report the statement in the 2017 report asserting that oxo-biodegradable plastics simply create microplastics.\n\nThe evidence for and against oxo-biodegradable plastic was also reviewed in November 2018 by Peter Susman QC, a deputy judge of the high court in England, who had over 25 years experience of adjudicating cases in the technology and construction branch of the high court, involving the evaluation of expert evidence. He declared the scientific case in favour of oxo-biodegradable plastic to be \"clear and compelling\". Susman examined the processes of abiotic and biotic degradation of plastics, and then looked specifically at degradation in air and degradation in seawater. He concluded, in a 15-page written opinion that\n\n<blockquote>\nIt is no longer tenable to conclude that there is 'no firm evidence either way' whether oxo-biodegradable is effective. I consider that recent research provides clear and compelling evidence that oxo-biodegradable plastic is indeed effective in facilitating very significantly speedier degradation than is the case when that technology is not used.... [I] cannot imagine that such significantly speedier final degradation occurs later than 'within a reasonable time', however that the expression might be defined.... [I regard the idea that biodegradable plastics might encourage littering as] \"fanciful and unreasonable\".<ref>http://www.biodeg.org/2018/11/06/uk-judge-find-the-case-for-oxo-biodegradable-plastic-proven/</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPeter Susman's report was criticized by others.<ref>https://www.bioplasticsmagazine.com/en/news/meldungen/20181105UK-judge-finds-the-case-for-oxo-degradabl--plastic--compelling-.php</ref>\n\n==European strategy for plastics in a circular economy==\nOn 16 January 2018, the [[European Commission]] published its report on the use of oxo-degradable plastic.<ref name=\":0\">[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/pdf/oxo-plastics.pdf Report to the European Parliament and the Council on the impact of the use of oxo-degradable plastic, including oxo-degradable plastic carrier bags on the environment]. European Commission. January, 2018.</ref> The document forms part of the European strategy for plastics in a [[circular economy]],<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/pdf/plastics-strategy.pdf A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy. European Commission]. January 2018.</ref> which was released the same day.\n\nThe Commission focused on three key issues relating to oxo-degradables: the biodegradability of oxo-degradable plastics in various environments; the environmental impacts in relation to littering; and [[recycling]].\n\nThe Commission found there was no conclusive evidence that, in the open environment, oxo-degradables fragmented to a sufficiently low enough molecular weight to enable biodegradation. There was no conclusive evidence about the time needed for oxo-degradable plastics to fragment in marine environments, nor about the degree of fragmentation. It said there was a considerable risk that fragmented plastics would not fully biodegrade, leading to subsequent risk of an accelerated and accumulating amount of [[microplastics]], especially in the marine environment. Rapid fragmentation was found to increase the risk of microplastic ingestion by marine animals.\n\nIn relation to littering, the report found that, although it appeared the oxo-degradable plastics industry could create products with minimal toxic impact on [[flora]] and [[fauna]], it had not been conclusively proven that there were no negative effects. Marketing oxo-degradables as a solution for plastic waste in the environment may make it more likely that items are discarded inappropriately and in marine environments; the fragmentation process made oxo-degradable plastic less likely to be recovered during clean-up exercises.\n\nThe report was criticised by the [[Oxo-Biodegradable Plastics Association]] (OPA), which said the European Commission had failed to understand the difference between oxo-degradable and oxo-biodegradable plastics.<ref>[http://www.biodeg.org/OPA%20responds%20to%20European%20Commission%20%20-%20%20%2019%20January%202018.pdf OPA RESPONDS TO EUROPEAN COMMISSION A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy]. January 2018.</ref> The OPA accused the Commission of not listening to evidence relating to the breakdown of oxo-plastics, which it maintained showed the plastic broke down to a molecular level that could be [[Bioassimilation|bioassimilated]]. In relation to timescales for biodegradation, the OPA said it was not useful to examine how long it took for particular specimens to breakdown in particular conditions, due to the variability of environmental conditions. It said the key point was that oxo-biodegradable plastics would breakdown faster than conventional plastics under the same conditions. Regarding recycling, it said its members had been successfully recycling oxo-biodegradable plastics for more than ten years, with no adverse reports. It rejected the Commission's view on littering and said that, as oxo-degradable plastics were indistinguishable from other plastic products, they were unlikely to cause any additional levels of littering. It criticised the Commission's use of external reports, including that of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the findings of which it previously disputed.\n\nA more recent report, of October 2018, is in line with the previous one. It states that micro-plastics need to be restricted, including oxo-degradable plastics.<ref>http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2F%2FEP%2F%2FTEXT%2BREPORT%2BA8-2018-0317%2B0%2BDOC%2BXML%2BV0%2F%2FEN&language=EN</ref>\n\nThe EU directive 2019/904 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5 June 2019) prohibits the introduction in the market of products made from oxo-degradable plastic (Article 5)<ref name=\"EUdirective5thJune2019\"/>\n\n==Response of the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association to the EU==\nIn its Proposal (2018/0172(COD)) for a Directive on \"Reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment\", the EU Commission proposed various measures for reducing the quantity of plastic goods being produced, and measures for encouraging collection for recycling. Most people would support those measures, but plastic will still escape into the open environment in unacceptable quantities until such time as plastic waste has been eliminated. This is not likely to happen any time soon.\n\nAccording to the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association oxo-biodegradable technology is the only way to prevent the accumulation of plastic waste in the environment; and if oxo-biodegradable technology were severely restricted in the EU, there would be unintended consequences. There would be a distortion of markets, if European companies were effectively prevented from manufacturing for countries where oxo-biodegradable plastic is mandatory. Alternatively, some countries could follow Europe's lead with disastrous consequences, and much of their accumulated plastic waste would eventually find its way to the shores of Europe.\n\nRecital (3) to the draft Directive says \"Marine litter is of a transboundary nature and is recognized as a global problem.\" The Reis report to the European Parliament (11 October 2018) says \"Every year in Europe, 150,000 tonnes of plastic are dumped into the sea. The situation is even more alarming at [the] global level, with 8 million tonnes ending up in the sea each year.\" Recital (5) to the draft Directive says \"In the Union, 80 to 85 % of marine litter, measured as beach litter counts, is plastic, with single-use plastic items representing 50%.\" This is why the plastic needs to be urgently upgraded so that it will convert into biodegradable materials much sooner than ordinary plastic, if it does escape into the open environment, especially the oceans.\n\nMicroplastics being recovered from the oceans are from \"oxo-degradable\" plastics, which degrade and fragment but do not biodegrade except over a very long period of time{{Citation needed|date=April 2019|reason=}}. These are conventional plastics which undoubtedly create persistent microplastics, and this is why they have been banned for a wide range of products in Saudi Arabia and 11 other countries, where oxo-biodegradable technology for making these products is now mandatory. Oxo-biodegradable products have to comply with strict standards, based on ASTM D6954.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* \"Environmentally Degradable Plastics Based on Oxo-biodegradation of Conventional Polyolefins\".

The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN, for ''Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation'') has established the following definitions, in TR 15351:\n\n1. Oxo-degradation is degradation resulting from \"oxidative cleavage of macromolecules\";\n\n2. Oxo-biodegradation is \"degradation resulting from oxidative and cell-mediated phenomena, either simultaneously or successively.\n\nWith regard to definition 2, an oxo-biodegredable [[polyolefin]] plastic file (e.g. [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], and all their combinations), incorporating a catalyst that ensures fast oxidative cleavage of its macromolecules, will become biodegradable by cell-mediated phenomena (bacteria and fungi) in the environment and much more quickly than conventional ordinary plastic.\n\n==Degradation process==\n[[Chemical decomposition|Degradation]] is a process that takes place in almost all materials. Conventional [[polyethylene]] (PE) and [[polypropylene]] (PP) plastics will typically fragment quite quickly, but will then take decades to become [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]]. OXO-degradable products utilize a catalyst to speed up the fragmentation.\n\n[[File:Plastic degradtion.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration of the OXO-Degradation: A process whereby the conventional polyolefin plastic is first oxidised to short-chain oxygenated molecules{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.]]\n\nThe first process of degradation in OXO-treated plastic is an [[oxidative]] [[chain scission]] that is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by metal [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], leading to oxygenated ([[hydroxyl]]ated and [[carboxyl]]ated) shorter-chain molecules.\n\nOXO-degradable plastic, if discarded in the environment, will degrade to oxygenated low-molecular-weight chains (typically MW 5\u201310,000 [[Atomic mass unit|amu]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} within 2\u201318 months, depending on the material ([[Synthetic resin|resin]], thickness, [[Antioxidant|anti-oxidants]], etc.), temperature, and other factors in the environment. By contrast, old-fashioned plastic will take decades to reach this stage, and in the meantime will have [[adsorbed]] toxins.\n\nOXO-degradable plastics are designed so that they will not degrade deep in [[landfill]] and they will not therefore generate [[methane]] (a powerful [[greenhouse gas]]) in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions.\n\nOXO-degradable products do not degrade immediately in an open environment because they are stabilized to give the product a useful service-life, during which they do not break down.\n\nOXO-degradation of polymer material has been studied in depth at the [[Technical Research Institute of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} A peer-reviewed report of the work showed 91% biodegradation in a [[soil]] environment within 24 months, when tested in accordance with ISO 17556.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jakubowicz |first=Ignacy |last2=Yarahmadi |first2=Nazdaneh |last3=Arthurson |first3=Veronica |title=Kinetics of abiotic and biotic degradability of low-density polyethylene containing prodegradant additives and its effect on the growth of microbial communities |date=1 May 2011 |journal=[[Polymer Degradation and Stability]] |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=919\u2013928 |issn=0141-3910 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.01.031 |language=en}}</ref> OXO-degradation has been studied at the [[Eurofins Scientific|Eurofins]] laboratory in Spain, where on 25 July 2017 they noted 88.9% biodegradation in 121 days, and in many other laboratories around the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} OXO-degradable plastics have been degraded in real time in [[seawater]] at the Banyul laboratory in France.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe statements about biodegradation of oxo-degradable plastics have however been disputed by the EU. In a 2017 report it was stated that the biodegradation of the fragmented pieces is only partially supported <ref name=\":12\">[http://publications.europa.eu/resource/cellar/ab9d2024-2fca-11e7-9412-01aa75ed71a1.0001.01/DOC_1 Study to provide information supplementing the study on the impact of the use of \"oxo-degradable\" plastic on the environment\"]. European Commission. April, 2017.</ref>\n\n==Standards applicability==\nOxo-biodegradable plastic degrades in the presence of [[oxygen]]. Heat and [[UV light]] will accelerate the process, but neither they nor moisture are necessary. Such plastic is not designed to be [[compostable]] in open [[industrial composting]] facilities, according to ASTM D6400 or EN13432; but it can be satisfactorily composted in an in-vessel process.\n\nASTM D6400 and EN13432, the standards for industrial composting, require oxo-biodegradable material to convert to [[CO2]] gas within 180 days by industrial composting, which is faster than degradation in the open environment. A leaf is generally considered to be [[biodegradable]], but it will not pass the ASTM composting standards, due to the 180-day limit. Indeed, materials which do comply with ASTM D6400, EN13432, Australian 4736, and ISO 17088 cannot properly be described as \"compostable\". This is because those standards require them to convert substantially to CO2 gas within 180 days. You cannot therefore make them into compost\u2014only into CO2 gas. This contributes to [[climate change]], but does nothing for the soil.\n\nOXO-biodegradable plastic conforms to the American Standard (ASTM D6954) and a British Standard (BS8472), which specify procedures to test degradability, biodegradability, and non-toxicity, and with which a properly designed and manufactured OXO product must comply. These standards contain pass/fail criteria.\n\nThere is no need to refer to a standard specification unless a specific disposal route (e.g., composting), is envisaged. ASTM D6400, EN13432, and  Australian 4736 are standard specifications appropriate only for the special conditions found in industrial composting.\n\nAccording to an EU report the oxo-degradable plastics do not biodegrade on a landfill neither should they be regarded as compostable.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==Environmental issues==\nOxo-degradable plastic, including plastic [[carrier bags]], may degrade quicker in the open environment than conventional plastic. However, according to a report from the [[European Commission]], there is no evidence that oxo-degradable plastic will subsequently fully biodegrade in a reasonable time in the open environment, on [[landfill]]s, or in the [[marine environment]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> According to the 2018 report:\n\n<blockquote>\nSufficiently quick biodegradation is in particular not demonstrated for landfills and the marine environment. A wide range of scientists, international and governmental institutions, testing laboratories, trade associations of plastics manufacturers, [[Recycler (person)|recyclers]] and other experts have therefore come to the conclusion that oxo-degradable plastics are not a solution for the environment and that oxo-degradable plastic is not suited for long-term use, recycling or composting. There is a considerable risk that fragmented plastics will not fully biodegrade and a subsequent risk of an accelerated and accumulating amount of [[microplastics]] in the environment, especially the marine environment. The issue of microplastics is long acknowledged as a global problem in need of urgent action, not just in terms of clean-up of [[littering]], but also of [[plastic pollution]] prevention.<ref name=\":0\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nOne major problem with testing oxo-degradable plastics for safety is that current standards and test methods can't realistically predict the biodegradability of plastic carrier bags within natural ecosystems.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=Jesse P.|last2=Boardman|first2=Carl|last3=O'Callaghan|first3=Kenneth|last4=Delort|first4=Anne-Marie|last5=Song|first5=Jim|date=2018-05-01|title=Biodegradability standards for carrier bags and plastic films in aquatic environments: a critical review|journal=Open Science|language=en|volume=5|issue=5|pages=171792|doi=10.1098/rsos.171792|pmid=29892374|pmc=5990801|issn=2054-5703|bibcode=2018RSOS....571792H}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref> Moreover, existing biodegradability standards and test methods for aquatic environments do not involve [[toxicity]] testing or account for the potentially adverse ecological impacts of carrier bags, plastic additives, polymer degradation products, or small (microscopic) plastic particles that can arise via fragmentation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA 2019 EU report<ref name=\"EUdirective5thJune2019\"/> describes oxo-degradable plastics as:\n<blockquote>\nOxo-degradable plastic\u2019 means plastic materials that include additives which, through oxidation, lead to the fragmentation of the plastic material into micro-fragments or to chemical decomposition\n</blockquote>\n\n==Controversy==\nOn 6 November 2017, the [[Ellen MacArthur Foundation]] issued a paper supported by 150 organisations\u2014including [[M&S]], [[PepsiCo]], and [[Unilever]]\u2014backing a call to ban oxo-biodegradable plastics. The report had support from industry associations including the [[British Plastics Federation Recycling Group]] and the [[Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association]], NGOs such as the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF), scientists including those based at [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]], and ten [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from nine EU countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.european-bioplastics.org/over-150-organisations-back-call-to-ban-oxo-degradable-plastic-packaging/|title=Over 150 organisations back call to ban oxo-degradable plastic packaging|website=european-bioplastics.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Oxo-Biodegradable Plastics Association (OPA) however, claimed the report was inaccurate. It argued many of the 150 organisations aggressively promoted a rival bio-plastic technology, while many of the others whose logos appeared in the document were themselves producers of the plastic items that get into the open environment as litter. The paper's conclusions were rejected by Professor Ignacy Jacubowicz, who said the degradation process was not merely a fragmentation, but a change from a high molecular weight polymer to a material that can be bio-assimilated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.symphonyenvironmental.com/opa-responds-macarthur-report/|title=OPA responds to MacArthur report {{!}} Symphony Environmental Technologies Plc|date=2017-11-13|work=Symphony Environmental Technologies Plc|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe evidence for and against oxo-biodegradable plastic was also reviewed in November 2018 by Peter Susman QC, a deputy judge of the high court in England, who had over 25 years experience of adjudicating cases in the technology and construction branch of the high court, involving the evaluation of expert evidence. He declared the scientific case in favour of oxo-biodegradable plastic to be \"clear and compelling\". Susman examined the processes of abiotic and biotic degradation of plastics, and then looked specifically at degradation in air and degradation in seawater. He concluded, in a 15-page written opinion that\n\n<blockquote>\nIt is no longer tenable to conclude that there is 'no firm evidence either way' whether oxo-biodegradable is effective. I consider that recent research provides clear and compelling evidence that oxo-biodegradable plastic is indeed effective in facilitating very significantly speedier degradation than is the case when that technology is not used.... [I] cannot imagine that such significantly speedier final degradation occurs later than 'within a reasonable time', however that the expression might be defined.... [I regard the idea that biodegradable plastics might encourage littering as] \"fanciful and unreasonable\".<ref>http://www.biodeg.org/2018/11/06/uk-judge-find-the-case-for-oxo-biodegradable-plastic-proven/</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPeter Susman's report was criticized by others.<ref>https://www.bioplasticsmagazine.com/en/news/meldungen/20181105UK-judge-finds-the-case-for-oxo-degradabl--plastic--compelling-.php</ref>\n\n==European strategy for plastics in a circular economy==\nOn 16 January 2018, the [[European Commission]] published its report on the use of oxo-degradable plastic.<ref name=\":0\">[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/pdf/oxo-plastics.pdf Report to the European Parliament and the Council on the impact of the use of oxo-degradable plastic, including oxo-degradable plastic carrier bags on the environment]. European Commission. January, 2018.</ref> The document forms part of the European strategy for plastics in a [[circular economy]],<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/pdf/plastics-strategy.pdf A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy. European Commission]. January 2018.</ref> which was released the same day.\n\nThe Commission focused on three key issues relating to oxo-degradables: the biodegradability of oxo-degradable plastics in various environments; the environmental impacts in relation to littering; and [[recycling]].\n\nThe Commission found there was no conclusive evidence that, in the open environment, oxo-degradables fragmented to a sufficiently low enough molecular weight to enable biodegradation. There was no conclusive evidence about the time needed for oxo-degradable plastics to fragment in marine environments, nor about the degree of fragmentation. It said there was a considerable risk that fragmented plastics would not fully biodegrade, leading to subsequent risk of an accelerated and accumulating amount of [[microplastics]], especially in the marine environment. Rapid fragmentation was found to increase the risk of microplastic ingestion by marine animals.\n\nIn relation to littering, the report found that, although it appeared the oxo-degradable plastics industry could create products with minimal toxic impact on [[flora]] and [[fauna]], it had not been conclusively proven that there were no negative effects. Marketing oxo-degradables as a solution for plastic waste in the environment may make it more likely that items are discarded inappropriately and in marine environments; the fragmentation process made oxo-degradable plastic less likely to be recovered during clean-up exercises.\n\nThe report was criticised by the [[Oxo-Biodegradable Plastics Association]] (OPA), which said the European Commission had failed to understand the difference between oxo-degradable and oxo-biodegradable plastics.<ref>[http://www.biodeg.org/OPA%20responds%20to%20European%20Commission%20%20-%20%20%2019%20January%202018.pdf OPA RESPONDS TO EUROPEAN COMMISSION A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy]. January 2018.</ref> The OPA accused the Commission of not listening to evidence relating to the breakdown of oxo-plastics, which it maintained showed the plastic broke down to a molecular level that could be [[Bioassimilation|bioassimilated]]. In relation to timescales for biodegradation, the OPA said it was not useful to examine how long it took for particular specimens to breakdown in particular conditions, due to the variability of environmental conditions. It said the key point was that oxo-biodegradable plastics would breakdown faster than conventional plastics under the same conditions. Regarding recycling, it said its members had been successfully recycling oxo-biodegradable plastics for more than ten years, with no adverse reports. It rejected the Commission's view on littering and said that, as oxo-degradable plastics were indistinguishable from other plastic products, they were unlikely to cause any additional levels of littering. It criticised the Commission's use of external reports, including that of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the findings of which it previously disputed.\n\nA more recent report, of October 2018, is in line with the previous one. It states that micro-plastics need to be restricted, including oxo-degradable plastics.<ref>http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2F%2FEP%2F%2FTEXT%2BREPORT%2BA8-2018-0317%2B0%2BDOC%2BXML%2BV0%2F%2FEN&language=EN</ref>\n\nThe EU directive 2019/904 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5 June 2019) prohibits the introduction in the market of products made from oxo-degradable plastic (Article 5)<ref name=\"EUdirective5thJune2019\"/>\n\n==Response of the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association to the EU==\nIn its Proposal (2018/0172(COD)) for a Directive on \"Reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment\", the EU Commission proposed various measures for reducing the quantity of plastic goods being produced, and measures for encouraging collection for recycling. Most people would support those measures, but plastic will still escape into the open environment in unacceptable quantities until such time as plastic waste has been eliminated. This is not likely to happen any time soon.\n\nAccording to the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association oxo-biodegradable technology is the only way to prevent the accumulation of plastic waste in the environment; and if oxo-biodegradable technology were severely restricted in the EU, there would be unintended consequences. There would be a distortion of markets, if European companies were effectively prevented from manufacturing for countries where oxo-biodegradable plastic is mandatory. Alternatively, some countries could follow Europe's lead with disastrous consequences, and much of their accumulated plastic waste would eventually find its way to the shores of Europe.\n\nRecital (3) to the draft Directive says \"Marine litter is of a transboundary nature and is recognized as a global problem.\" The Reis report to the European Parliament (11 October 2018) says \"Every year in Europe, 150,000 tonnes of plastic are dumped into the sea. The situation is even more alarming at [the] global level, with 8 million tonnes ending up in the sea each year.\" Recital (5) to the draft Directive says \"In the Union, 80 to 85 % of marine litter, measured as beach litter counts, is plastic, with single-use plastic items representing 50%.\" This is why the plastic needs to be urgently upgraded so that it will convert into biodegradable materials much sooner than ordinary plastic, if it does escape into the open environment, especially the oceans.\n\nMicroplastics being recovered from the oceans are from \"oxo-degradable\" plastics, which degrade and fragment but do not biodegrade except over a very long period of time{{Citation needed|date=April 2019|reason=}}. These are conventional plastics which undoubtedly create persistent microplastics, and this is why they have been banned for a wide range of products in Saudi Arabia and 11 other countries, where oxo-biodegradable technology for making these products is now mandatory. The products have to comply with strict standards, based on ASTM D6954.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* \"Environmentally Degradable Plastics Based on Oxo-biodegradation of Conventional Polyolefins\".
