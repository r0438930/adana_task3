It was produced by [[Grant Heslov]], Affleck and [[George Clooney]].\n\n''Argo'' was praised for the acting (particularly Arkin and Goodman's), Affleck's direction, Terrio's screenplay, the editing, and Desplat's score. The film received seven nominations at the [[85th Academy Awards]] and won three, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. The film also earned five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations: it won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]] for Alan Arkin. It won [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture|Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[19th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and Arkin was nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]]. It also won [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]] at the [[66th British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Hochi Film Award|37th Hochi Film Award]] for Best International Picture.\n\nDespite its praise, ''Argo'' has been criticized for some specific inaccuracies, in particular for minimizing the role of the Canadian embassy in the rescue, for falsely showing that the Americans were turned away by the British and New Zealand embassies, and for exaggerating the danger the group faced during events preceding their escape from the country.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn November 4, 1979, Iranian [[Islamism|Islamists]] storm the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|United States embassy in Tehran]] in retaliation for President [[Jimmy Carter]] giving the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] asylum in the U.S. during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Sixty of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and are sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]]. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] begins to explore options for [[Extraction (military)|exfiltrating]] them from Iran. [[Tony Mendez]], a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] exfiltration specialist, is brought in for a consultation. He criticizes the proposals but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching [[Battle for the Planet of the Apes|''Battle for the Planet of the Apes'']] and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees: that they are Canadian filmmakers who are in Iran scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film.\n\nMendez contacts [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]], a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing ''Argo'', a \"science fantasy adventure\" in the style of [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow restless. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and finally realize that some personnel are unaccounted for.\n\nPosing as a producer for ''Argo'', Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees. He provides them with [[Canadian passports]] and fake identities. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|bazaar]] to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when they are harassed by a hostile shopkeeper, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd.\n\nMendez is told that the operation has been canceled to avoid conflicting with a [[Operation Eagle Claw|planned military rescue of the hostages]]. He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss Jack O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and confirm their tickets on a [[Swissair]] flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' ticket reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and the head guard's call to the fake production company in Hollywood is answered only at the last second. The group boards the airliner, which takes off just as the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] at the airport are informed of the ruse and try to stop them.\n\nTo protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from retaliation, all U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed, and full credit is given to the Canadian government and its ambassador (who shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife as the operation is underway). The ambassador's Iranian housekeeper, who had known about the Americans and lied to the revolutionaries to protect them, escapes to [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]. Mendez is awarded the [[Intelligence Star]], but due to the mission's classified nature, he receives the medal in secret and has to return it afterward. The award is restored to him after the [[Canadian Caper]] is declassified in 1997.\n<br />\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ben Affleck by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|Actor, producer, and director Ben Affleck.]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as [[Tony Mendez]]\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Jack O'Donnell\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Lester Siegel\n* [[John Goodman]] as [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]]\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as Robert Anders\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Cora Lijek\n* [[Christopher Denham]] as Mark Lijek\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Joe Stafford\n* [[Kerry Bish\u00e9]] as Kathy Stafford\n* [[Rory Cochrane]] as Lee Schatz\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Kenneth D.

It was produced by [[Grant Heslov]], Affleck and [[George Clooney]].\n\n''Argo'' was praised for the acting (particularly Arkin and Goodman's), Affleck's direction, Terrio's screenplay, the editing, and Desplat's score. The film received seven nominations at the [[85th Academy Awards]] and won three, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. The film also earned five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations: it won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]] for Alan Arkin. It won [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture|Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[19th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and Arkin was nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]]. It also won [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]] at the [[66th British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Hochi Film Award|37th Hochi Film Award]] for Best International Picture.\n\nDespite its praise, ''Argo'' has been criticized for some specific inaccuracies, in particular for minimizing the role of the Canadian embassy in the rescue, for falsely showing that the Americans were turned away by the British and New Zealand embassies, and for exaggerating the danger the group faced during events preceding their escape from the country.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn November 4, 1979, Iranian [[Islamism|Islamists]] storm the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|United States embassy in Tehran]] in retaliation for President [[Jimmy Carter]] giving the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] asylum in the U.S. during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Sixty of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and are sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]]. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] begins to explore options for [[Extraction (military)|exfiltrating]] them from Iran. [[Tony Mendez]], a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] exfiltration specialist, is brought in for a consultation. He criticizes the proposals but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching [[Battle for the Planet of the Apes|''Battle for the Planet of the Apes'']] and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees: that they are Canadian filmmakers who are in Iran scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film.\n\nMendez contacts [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]], a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing ''Argo'', a \"science fantasy adventure\" in the style of [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow restless. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and finally realize that some personnel are unaccounted for.\n\nPosing as a producer for ''Argo'', Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees. He provides them with [[Canadian passports]] and fake identities. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|bazaar]] to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when they are harassed by a hostile shopkeeper, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd.\n\nMendez is told that the operation has been canceled to avoid conflicting with a [[Operation Eagle Claw|planned military rescue of the hostages]]. He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss Jack O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and confirm their tickets on a [[Swissair]] flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' ticket reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and the head guard's call to the fake production company in Hollywood is answered only at the last second. The group boards the airliner, which takes off just as the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] at the airport are informed of the ruse and try to stop them.\n\nTo protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from retaliation, all U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed, and full credit is given to the Canadian government and its ambassador (who shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife as the operation is underway). The ambassador's Iranian housekeeper, who had known about the Americans and lied to the revolutionaries to protect them, escapes to [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]. Mendez is awarded the [[Intelligence Star]], but due to the mission's classified nature, he receives the medal in secret and has to return it afterward. The award is restored to him after the [[Canadian Caper]] is declassified in 1997.\n<br />\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ben Affleck by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|Actor, producer, and director Ben Affleck.]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as [[Tony Mendez]]\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Jack O'Donnell\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Lester Siegel\n* [[John Goodman]] as [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]]\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as Robert Anders\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Cora Lijek\n* [[Christopher Denham]] as Mark Lijek\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Joe Stafford\n* [[Kerry Bish\u00e9]] as Kathy Stafford\n* [[Rory Cochrane]] as Lee Schatz\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Kenneth D.
