It was originally recorded by the [[virtual band|cartoon band]] [[the Archies]]. This version reached No. 1 in the US on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in 1969 and remained there for four weeks. It was also No.1 on the [[UK Singles chart]] in that same year for eight weeks. The song became a hit again in 1970 when [[rhythm and blues]] and [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Wilson Pickett]] took it back onto the charts [[#Wilson Pickett version|with his own version]].\n\n==The Archies version==\n===Background===\nProduced by Jeff Barry, the Archies' \"Sugar, Sugar\" was originally released on the album ''[[Everything's Archie (album)|Everything's Archie]].'' The album was the product of a group of [[studio musician]]s managed by [[Don Kirshner]]. [[Ron Dante]]'s lead vocals were accompanied by those of [[Toni Wine]] and Andy Kim. Together they provided the voices of the Archies using [[multitrack recording|multitracking]]. The song was initially released in late May 1969 on the Calendar label (the same label as with the two previous Archies singles), achieving moderate chart success in the early summer in some radio markets. When the song was re-released in mid-July 1969 on the Kirshner label, it attained massive success nationwide by the late summer/early fall.<ref>[https://text.npr.org/s.php?sId=761616330 npr.org]</ref>\n\nUpon the song's initial release, Kirshner had promotion men play it for radio station personnel without revealing the group's name, as the Archies' previous single, \"Feelin' So Good (S.K.O.O.B.Y-D.O.O)\", had only reached No. 53 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100|title=Top 100 Songs {{!}} Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Archies-Feelin-So-Good-SKOOBY-DOO/master/456550|title=The Archies - Feelin' So Good (S.K.O.O.B.Y-D.O.O)|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> Only after most of the DJs liked the song were they told that it was performed by a \"mystery group\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/26/sugar-sugar-singer-ron-dante-discusses-archies-ban/|title=Archies singer Ron Dante: \u2018Cartoon Band Man\u2019|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\nSeveral sources, including Kirshner,<ref>{{Citation|title=The Monkees Behind The Music|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jblsl29OaQ|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> have stated that the song had originally been offered to [[the Monkees]], although songwriters Barry and Kim deny this.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Cooper  | first = Kim  | editor = Smay, David  | title = Bubblegum Music is the Naked Truth: The Dark History of Prepubescent Pop, From the Banana Splits to Britney Spears  | publisher = Feral House  | year = 2001  | page = [https://archive.org/details/bubblegummusicis0000unse/page/77 77]  | isbn = 0-922915-69-5  | url = https://archive.org/details/bubblegummusicis0000unse/page/77  }}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\nAfter topping the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM 100]]'' national singles chart in Canada on September 13, 1969 (where it spent three weeks), the single went on to spend four weeks at the top of the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100 from September 20 through October 11.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> It spent a total of 22 weeks in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and was the 1969 US [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1969|number-one single of the year]].

It was originally recorded by the [[virtual band|cartoon band]] [[the Archies]]. This version reached No. 1 in the US on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in 1969 and remained there for four weeks. It was also No.1 on the [[UK Singles chart]] in that same year for eight weeks. The song became a hit again in 1970 when [[rhythm and blues]] and [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Wilson Pickett]] took it back onto the charts [[#Wilson Pickett version|with his own version]].\n\n==The Archies version==\n===Background===\nProduced by Jeff Barry, the Archies' \"Sugar, Sugar\" was originally released on the album ''[[Everything's Archie (album)|Everything's Archie]].'' The album was the product of a group of [[studio musician]]s managed by [[Don Kirshner]]. [[Ron Dante]]'s lead vocals were accompanied by those of [[Toni Wine]] and Andy Kim. Together they provided the voices of the Archies using [[multitrack recording|multitracking]]. The song was initially released in late May 1969 on the Calendar label (the same label as with the two previous Archies singles), achieving moderate chart success in the early summer in some radio markets. When the song was re-released in mid-July 1969 on the Kirshner label, it attained massive success nationwide by the late summer/early fall.<ref>[https://text.npr.org/s.php?sId=761616330 npr.org]</ref>\n\nUpon the song's initial release, Kirshner had promotion men play it for radio station personnel without revealing the group's name, as the Archies' previous single, \"Feelin' So Good (S.K.O.O.B.Y-D.O.O)\", had only reached No. 53 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100|title=Top 100 Songs {{!}} Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Archies-Feelin-So-Good-SKOOBY-DOO/master/456550|title=The Archies - Feelin' So Good (S.K.O.O.B.Y-D.O.O)|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> Only after most of the DJs liked the song were they told that it was performed by a \"mystery group\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/26/sugar-sugar-singer-ron-dante-discusses-archies-ban/|title=Archies singer Ron Dante: \u2018Cartoon Band Man\u2019|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\nSeveral sources, including Kirshner,<ref>{{Citation|title=The Monkees Behind The Music|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jblsl29OaQ|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> have stated that the song had originally been offered to [[the Monkees]], although songwriters Barry and Kim deny this.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Cooper  | first = Kim  | editor = Smay, David  | title = Bubblegum Music is the Naked Truth: The Dark History of Prepubescent Pop, From the Banana Splits to Britney Spears  | publisher = Feral House  | year = 2001  | page = [https://archive.org/details/bubblegummusicis0000unse/page/77 77]  | isbn = 0-922915-69-5  | url = https://archive.org/details/bubblegummusicis0000unse/page/77  }}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\nAfter topping the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM 100]]'' national singles chart in Canada on September 13, 1969 (where it spent three weeks), the single went on to spend four weeks at the top of the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100 from September 20 through October 11.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> It spent a total of 22 weeks in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and was the 1969 US [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1969|number-one single of the year]].
