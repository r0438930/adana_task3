Nestled on Khurdha uplands of the [[Eastern Ghats]] biotic region, Chandaka forest is spread over {{convert|175.79|km2|sqmi}} of rolling table land and small sprawling hillocks of [[Khurdha]] and Cuttack Districts. It was designated as an elephant reserve in December 1982.\n\n==Flora==\nThe floral diversity is distributed in six types, viz., secondary moist miscellaneous semi-[[evergreen forests]], moist Kangada (''[[Xylia xylocarpa]]'') forests, coastal Sal forests (''[[Shorea robusta]]''), thorny bamboo brakes (''[[Bambusa bambos]]''), planted [[teak]] and ''[[Eupatorium]]'' scrub. The main tree species are [[Strychnos nux-vomica|kochila]], kalicha, belo, kangada, giringa, sunari, [[Sal tree|sal]], kumbhi, jamu, [[Karanj (tree)|karanja]], [[teak]] and sidha. Male bamboo (''[[Dendrocalamus strictus]]'') has a very restricted distribution. Common medicinal plants of the sanctuary are duramari, baidanka (''[[Mucuna pruriens]]''), brudhadaraka, bhuinlimbo, [[Tinospora cordifolia|guduchi lata]], salparni (''[[Desmodium gangeticum]]''), satabari, bhuin-kakharu, indrajaba, thalkudi, apamaranga, [[Holarrhena floribunda|kurchi]], and patalgaruda. A few species of ground [[orchids]], [[ferns]], club [[mosses]], [[bryophytes]] and [[lichens]] are distributed in shady wet pockets and rock escarpments.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Chandaka Bhubaneswar.me.jpg|thumb|Elephants inside Chandaka Dampara forest]]\n[[File:Deras Dam Bhubaneswar.me.jpg|thumb|Deras Dam, located within the reserve]]\n{{Commons category|Deras Dam}}\n\nThe [[Indian elephant]] is the flagship species and indicative of the potential productivity of the habitat.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pachyderm Census to Begin from May 25|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Pachyderm-Census-to-Begin-from-May-25/2015/04/27/article2785217.ece|publisher=[[The New Indian Express]]|date=27 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=80-year-old elephant dies in Orissa reserve|url=http://www.topnews.in/80yearold-elephant-dies-orissa-reserve-2236376|work=TopNews|date=15 November 2009}}</ref> The [[leopard]] is in the apex of biological pyramid.

[[Chital]] or spotted deer are commonly encountered in groups of 3\u20137 on forest roads, forest openings, grass lands, foreshore of water bodies and even near guard camps. Wild dogs are occasionally seen. After 40 years researchers have found evidence of a tigress and her cub in the forest; in the winter of 2012, they spotted footprints of those two.\n\nProminent birds of the sanctuary are [[peafowl]], [[red junglefowl]], [[crested serpent eagle]], [[great horned owl]], [[Black-hooded oriole|black hooded oriole]], [[paradise flycatcher]], [[coucal]] and [[stone curlew]]. Kumarkhunti reservoir, during winter, serves as a transient roosting and feeding ground for several migratory [[duck]] species, notably [[garganey]] and [[common teal]], [[Eaton's pintail|pintail]], [[Spot-billed duck|spot billed duck]] and [[Brahminy duck]] and white eyed [[Baer's pochard|pochard]]. [[Lesser whistling teal]], [[Little grebe|dabchick]], [[cotton teal]], nakta, lesser [[cormorant]], bronze winged [[Jacanidae|jacana]], [[White-breasted waterhen|white breasted waterhen]], pied, white breasted and little blue [[kingfisher]]s and red wattled [[lapwing]]s are other resident birds around. In July the reservoir transforms into an abode of [[migratory birds]], mainly [[Open-billed stork|open billed storks]], [[pond heron]], [[egrets]] and [[cormorants]]. Butterflies are abundant during monsoon and post-monsoon months.\n\nAmong reptiles, [[Asiatic rock python|rock python]] and Bengal [[monitor lizard]] are quite common. [[Chameleon]], [[common skink]], Indian flap shell turtle, [[Russell's viper]], [[bamboo pit viper]], [[common krait]], common [[Ahaetulla nasuta|vine snake]], [[Kukri Snake|kukri snake]], and Indian bronze back are indicative reptiles. [[Mugger crocodile]]s have remarkably adapted to large water bodies after their release.\n\nThe [[Zoological Survey of India]] (in 2002) reported 37 species of mammals, 167 species of birds, 33 species of reptiles, 13 species of amphibians and 28 species of fishes in this sanctuary.<ref>[http://www.vedamsbooks.in/no29020.htm Vertebrate Fauna of Chandaka Dampara Wildlife Sanctuary Odisha ]</ref>\n\n==Watch towers==\nFor visitors there are a number of watch towers to observe wildlife. While Kochilaberana, Pitagadia and Charichhak watch towers are excellent for observation of birds and animals, the ones at Kumarkhunti and Ambilo have the comfort of rest houses where one can make a night halt.\n\nThere are two water reservoirs, Deras Dam and Jhumka Dam, situated within the reserve.
