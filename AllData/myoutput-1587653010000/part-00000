Similar wording appears in Edgar Allan Poe's 1831 short story, ''[[The Bargain Lost]]'', although not at the very beginning. It reads:\n\n<blockquote>It was a dark and stormy night. The rain fell in cataracts; and drowsy citizens started, from dreams of the deluge, to gaze upon the boisterous sea, which foamed and bellowed for admittance into the proud towers and marble palaces. Who would have thought of passions so fierce in that calm water that slumbers all day long? At a slight alabaster stand, trembling beneath the ponderous tomes which it supported, sat the hero of our story.</blockquote>\n\n===Operas===\nSeveral of Bulwer-Lytton's novels were made into operas. One of them, ''[[Rienzi|Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen]]'' (1842) by [[Richard Wagner]], eventually became more famous than the novel. ''Leonora'' (1846) by [[William Henry Fry]], the first European-styled \"grand\" opera composed in the United States, is based on Bulwer-Lytton's play ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]'', as is [[Frederic Cowen]]'s first opera ''[[Pauline (opera)|Pauline]]'' (1876). Verdi rival [[Errico Petrella]]'s most successful opera, ''[[Jone (opera)|Jone]]'' (1858), was based upon Bulwer-Lytton's ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', and was performed all over the world until the First World War. ''Harold, the Last of the Saxons'' (1848) was the source for Verdi's opera ''[[Aroldo]]'' in 1857.\n\n===Magazines===\nIn addition to his political and literary work, Bulwer-Lytton became the editor of the ''New Monthly'' in 1831, but he resigned the following year. In 1841, he started the ''Monthly Chronicle'', a semi-scientific magazine. During his career he wrote poetry, prose, and stage plays; his last novel was ''Kenelm Chillingly'', which was in course of publication in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood\u2019s Magazine]]'' at the time of his death in 1873.{{sfn|Waugh|1911|p=186}}\n\n===Translations===\nBulwer-Lytton's works of fiction and non-fiction were translated in his day and since then into many languages, including Serbian (by [[Laza Kostic]]), German, Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Finnish, and Spanish. In 1879, his ''Ernest Maltravers'' was the first complete novel from the West to be translated into Japanese.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Keene |first=Donald |title=Dawn to the West: Japanese Literature of the Modern Era |year=1984 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York |isbn=0030628148 |page=62}}</ref>\n\n===Place names===\nIn Queensland, Australia the Brisbane suburb of Lytton is to be found on Bulwer Island which today is home to the Port of Brisbane.\nAlso in Queensland on Moreton Island (Moorgumpin) is located another settlement by the name of Bulwer.\nThe township of Lytton, Quebec (today part of [[Montcerf-Lytton, Quebec|Montcerf-Lytton]]) was named after him<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=37667 |language=French |title=Lytton |publisher=[[Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec]] |work=Banque de noms de lieux du Qu\u00e9bec |accessdate=16 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173531/http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/CT/toposweb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=37667 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> as was [[Lytton, British Columbia]], and Lytton, Iowa.

At a slight alabaster stand, trembling beneath the ponderous tomes which it supported, sat the hero of our story.</blockquote>\n\n===Operas===\nSeveral of Bulwer-Lytton's novels were made into operas. One of them, ''[[Rienzi|Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen]]'' (1842) by [[Richard Wagner]], eventually became more famous than the novel. ''Leonora'' (1846) by [[William Henry Fry]], the first European-styled \"grand\" opera composed in the United States, is based on Bulwer-Lytton's play ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]'', as is [[Frederic Cowen]]'s first opera ''[[Pauline (opera)|Pauline]]'' (1876). Verdi rival [[Errico Petrella]]'s most successful opera, ''[[Jone (opera)|Jone]]'' (1858), was based upon Bulwer-Lytton's ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', and was performed all over the world until the First World War. ''Harold, the Last of the Saxons'' (1848) was the source for Verdi's opera ''[[Aroldo]]'' in 1857.\n\n===Magazines===\nIn addition to his political and literary work, Bulwer-Lytton became the editor of the ''New Monthly'' in 1831, but he resigned the following year. In 1841, he started the ''Monthly Chronicle'', a semi-scientific magazine. During his career he wrote poetry, prose, and stage plays; his last novel was ''Kenelm Chillingly'', which was in course of publication in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood\u2019s Magazine]]'' at the time of his death in 1873.{{sfn|Waugh|1911|p=186}}\n\n===Translations===\nBulwer-Lytton's works of fiction and non-fiction were translated in his day and since then into many languages, including Serbian (by [[Laza Kostic]]), German, Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Finnish, and Spanish.
