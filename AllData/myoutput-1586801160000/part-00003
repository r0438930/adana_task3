Approximately 11% of undergraduates, 3,400 students, participate in one of the 60 chapters of social fraternities or sororities at the [[University of Minnesota]], Twin Cities campus.<ref name=\"OFSL2017\" /> Participation in affiliated groups associated with the Greek System such as honor, service and professional fraternities bring total Greek System affiliation figures significantly higher.  Counting past and present, more than half of the University's 200 Greek organizations remain active today, the pioneers of which have had a presence on the [[University of Minnesota]] campus for over 145 years. The university's \"Greek System\" includes [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional fraternities]], [[Honor society|honor societies]], [[Service fraternities and sororities|service fraternities]], and religious fraternities along with the highly visible residential undergrad [[Fraternities and sororities|academic and social]] chapters.\n\nA '''[[#Academic and social fraternities and sororities|comprehensive list of chapters]]''', past and present, segmented by category, follows this brief overview of what these societies are and how they evolved. References for each group show current and former property addresses either owned or leased. Contact information is provided via the references, where available.\n\nThe terms \"Fraternity\" and \"Sorority\" are used somewhat interchangeably, with men's and co-ed groups always using Fraternity, and women's groups using either Fraternity or Sorority.<ref name=\"Sorority terminology\">There is one exception to this usage rule, where normally, men's and co-ed groups call themselves \"fraternities.\" The music sorority [[Tau Beta Sigma]] is co-educational and its male and female members are members of the sorority.</ref>  For convenience, the term \"Greek Letter Society\" is a generic substitute. The word, \"Greek,\" in this case refers to the use of [[Greek alphabet#Letters|Greek Letters]] for each society's name, and not to Greek ethnicity.\n\n==Historical sketch==\n\n[[File:Honor Societies etching, 1922 Minnesota Gopher Yearbook.jpg|thumb|left|Editors of the '''Minnesota Gopher''' Yearbook created iconic etchings to highlight fraternity and sorority pages, this example from 1922.]]The '''[[University of Minnesota]] Greek system''' is over 145 years old, having grown steadily with the rapid growth of the University. Its first men's fraternity, [[Chi Psi]], dates to 1874, and its first women's fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], dates to 1880, long before the term 'sorority' was popularized as a term for the women's 'houses'.\n\nYet these pioneers did not themselves mark the beginnings of fraternal presence at the school. Many of Minnesota's early University presidents and department heads were fraternity men or women from'' 'back East,' ''having experienced undergraduate life in the flourishing [[College literary societies|literary societies]] and old line fraternities that in turn were born out of America's earliest institutions of higher learning.

Similarly, the age, prestige, size and breadth of the University of Minnesota have resulted in its hosting many of the nation's [[Honor societies|honor]] and [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional]] fraternities for most disciplines.  As early as 1925, the ''Minnesota Gopher'' yearbook reported the presence of 25 national academic [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]], 18 national academic [[Fraternities and sororities in North America#Sororities|sororities]], and 33 national professional chapters on campus.

Between 1900 and 1917, rentals gave way to properties built for the chapters, resulting in several iconic examples of Beaux Arts, Georgian and Classical styles. Finally, between 1921 and 1936, Minnesota's fraternity chapters engaged in that same popular [[North American fraternity and sorority housing|building spree]] which was sweeping across other early private and land grant colleges and universities from New York to California. The result of this last phase was the often stately homes occupied by many Greek chapters today, upgrades from boarding house-style clapboard and stucco homes, to the many ''Fraternity Row'' mansions that are visible at Minnesota along University Avenue SE, on 4th and 5th Street SE, and the 10th Avenue ''\"Sorority Row,\"'' all in Minneapolis. Similarly, the St. Paul campus is home to several stately chapter buildings, or chapterhouses, along Cleveland Avenue. It is a testament to the alumni of many of these chapters that their buildings survived, as so many were financed by the 1920s financial bubble, having endured weak membership eras during the Great Depression and then the twin turmoils of WWII and 1960s anti-establishment unrest.

In partnership with national organizations, University oversight of the Academic and Social chapters is managed on a day-to-day basis by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140717205551/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/index.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life], a unit of the [http://www.osa.umn.edu/ Office for Student Affairs].\n\nProfessional and Honor societies are coordinated at a lower level of administrative involvement by the various academic departments within the University and its several colleges, and of these, some operate merely cooperatively, with no involvement from the University at all.\n\nSince gaining its first chapter in 1874, Minnesota administrators have maintained an open, if not always supportive relationship with its chapters {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. An impulse to exert administrative management on these highly visible registered student organizations has at times been offset by interest in limiting liability exposure where it could be claimed that the administration ''was'' responsible but ''did not do enough'' to prevent an unsafe or illegal occurrence. Minnesota's Greek System has, on balance, avoided the frequency of harmful events, as have occurred at other large schools; this primarily as the result of self-policing.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /><ref name=\"Nuwer\">[http://www.hanknuwer.com/hazing-deaths/ Hank Nuwer's list of global hazing incidents] does not show Minnesota among its extensive list of 'troubled' schools, accessed 27 May 2014</ref> The original, more active relationship between the Greeks and the Administration had been marginalized somewhat after the turbulent late 1960s and during the ''lassaiz-faire'' commuter-student years of 1970\u201390. This coincided with national scrutiny and bad publicity over hazing events elsewhere in the US. With the return to a more residential campus, both the Minnesota Greek System and its relationship with the University are thriving: An estimated 2,800 Greeks on campus participate in '''58''' separate undergraduate Academic and Social chapters.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /> In addition, Professional and honor societies, many accepting undergraduates, number more than 80. Because of this and other factors, the University is again improving its relationship with the Greek Community:\n\n<blockquote>In March 2012, President Kaler announced the formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF) and issued a Charge to the GCSTF Steering Committee which emphasized the need to develop a \"sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.\"<ref name=\"GCSTF12\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{further|Fraternities_and_sororities#Criticism}}\nOver the decades, Minnesota's Greek system, like others nationwide, has had its detractors.  Most notably in the late 1960s, anti-establishment agitation resulted in decreased interest and participation. This negative environment abated with the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. While membership again surged beginning in the late 1970s, the campus population was swelling even faster. While hitting ''numeric'' highs, Greeks at Minnesota thus never achieved the pre-Vietnam era participation level as a ''percentage'' of the campus.  For some, Greeks were \"too exclusive.\" Commuting students may have had little occasion to socialize with them on the largely non-residential campus. Some students chafed at overt culture differences where Prep-era Greek men would wear blazers and ties to Monday meetings. Occasional surveys of detractors would declare a perception that membership was akin to buying friends.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\">Greek Action Committee Recruitment survey, 1984, IFC archives, accessed 16 June 2014</ref>  For others, it was simply a monetary concern, with a reluctance to include fraternity or sorority dues into a tight college budget.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\"/> The hugely popular movie, \"[[Animal House]]\" also branded for a generation the image of a lethargic, disruptive and academically inferior \"frat boy\" on the national consciousness.<ref>{{IMDb title|0077975|\"Animal House\"|- Hugely popular, this movie was a National Lampoon parody of writer Chris Miller's experiences at 1960s-era Dartmouth.}}</ref>\n\n===Response to criticism===\n\n====Fixing problems====\n\nGreek organizations both nationally and locally sponsor many risk avoidance programs for the real benefits of student safety and well-being, as well as to avoid harmful bad publicity. Hence, these organizations have learned to address criticism quickly: Chapters and national bodies have adopted extensive changes to reduce incidents of hazing and other harmful behaviors. The recent announcement by Sigma Alpha Epsilon to ban \"pledging\" nationwide is only the latest of such announcements, of revised prospective member programs now adopted by many fraternities.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/11/sigma-alpha-epsilon-pledging-hazing_n_4938425.html Sigma Alpha Epsilon Bans Pledging Nationwide In Effort To Stop Hazing], as reported by the Huffington Post's Tyler Kingkade on 11 March 2014, accessed 11 June 2014</ref> While not limited to fraternities and sororities, harmful activities like underage drinking and hazing are often headlined as local news stories, with fraternity chapters as the most visible examples.<ref>Studies show that underage and binge drinking are more prevalent nationally among student athletes, Greek system members, and organization members, with the most significant grouping ''less'' affected by the problem being commuter students that live at home.

All sororities and some fraternity chapters have banned alcohol in their living facilities. National fraternities, through the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] and sororities through their national and local governing boards require member training each year to combat hazing, underage drinking, sexual assault and other harmful behaviors.<ref>[https://nicfraternity.org/nic-standards/ NIC Standards statement] accessed 21 Nov 2018.</ref> Hence, individual chapters are not alone in addressing these problems. Inter-chapter governing boards at Minnesota (listed below by chapter groupings) provide event monitoring services and local risk management training, culminating in the introduction in 2012 of '''Arkeo''', which serves as an inter-Greek cooperative monitoring program to help chapters avoid risk.<ref>[http://www.fsl.umn.edu/assets/pdf/comm_info/State%20of%20the%20Greek%20Sp%202013.pdf State of the Greek Community, 2013 Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040843/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/assets/pdf/comm_info/State%20of%20the%20Greek%20Sp%202013.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, accessed 11 June 2014</ref><ref name=\"DefyingCritics\">[http://www.fsl.umn.edu/parents/greek_sterotypes.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life risk management statement on \"Defying the Stereotypes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162943/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/parents/greek_sterotypes.html |date=2014-07-14 }}, accessed 12 June 2014</ref>\n\n====Response to perceptions====\n\nAs to the financial cost of participation, fraternity leaders note that the vast majority of Greek students work their way through school.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> In fact, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life claims that the average cost burden for fraternity chapter membership adds 3% to a student budget, and may indeed be less costly on a net basis when factoring reduced summer rents and lower live-in costs versus dorms and private apartments. Finally, the Minnesota campus is markedly more residential than thirty years ago. Development of over a dozen large for-profit private dorms and many upgraded apartments has increased the average ''quality'' and ''quantity'' of near-campus housing ''and'' has increased their average expense. The result has been that fraternities and sororities, previously perceived as among the more expensive housing options now range from \"in line with\" or even lower than the average cost of dorms or apartments.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/university-of-minnesota-sees-resurgence-of-interest-in-greek-life/223334431/ StarTrib article on resurgence of interest in Greek Life], accessed 4 Sept 2016</ref><ref name=\"2016 IFC Study\">For reference, see the 2016 Interfraternity Council recruitment book, p.8. The book examines Sept-May average costs of living in a fraternity house of $6,544 (which includes room and board, fees, meals, utilities, social expenses, etc.) to the cost for similar double-occupancy dorm living of $8,100 which includes 14 meals and utilities, but no social fees or parking. These average expenses both compare favorably to living in a private apartment with an average cost of $10,056, which does not include meals, parking or social events, and which requires a sublease if the apartment is vacated during the summer months. Sorority living expenses may be higher, with increased services. For further analysis of these costs, see University Housing Services. The analysis is more involved than can be fully treated here due to space limitations.</ref>\n\nAddressing the claim of exclusivity in recruitment materials, Greek leaders will accept that label as another way of saying they promote high standards. All fraternities are by definition self-selective.  But, they clarify, so are all friendships. Further, they state, \"U\" students all have passed a bar of exclusivity by getting into the increasingly selective University itself. With an array of student groups numbering in the thousands, and a multitude of Greek chapter personalities, fraternity and sorority proponents are confident that all students who wish to join a Greek society can find one where they can flourish.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> The matter of religious and race exclusivity appears to have passed several generations ago: While some chapters are historically black, Hispanic, or Asian-oriented, there is no race exclusivity or other discrimination exclusivity in any of Minnesota's chapters. All are integrated, and have been for some time. Minnesota was the second Big Ten school (after [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]) to see its fraternities and sororities drop all bias clauses (race, color or creed) from their bylaws and policies. Older chapters have been integrated since the 1950s and 1960s<ref name=\"HistoricalStudy2003\" /> and the multi-cultural Greek chapters since their founding in more recent years.<ref>[https://diversity.umn.edu/eoaa/ The University Department of Equal Opportunity] requires all members of University communities to adhere to this standard, but has not seen a need for intervention in Minnesota's fully integrated community of Greek chapters.

While CSHI's proposed ''Greek Village'' development for the 1700 block of University Avenue was not adopted in 2011, in March 2012, University President Kaler followed up on his promise at that time with formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF), with the Charge to the group that ''\"emphasized the need to develop a sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.\"'' He stated, ''\"[The Greeks] get better grades, graduate sooner, and give more money to the University.\"''{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Under his direction, the UM Foundation has been collecting data on Greek participation for all students, a data point that had been only sporadically kept prior to 2012.<ref name=\"GCSTF12\" />\n\n==Academic and social fraternities and sororities==\nFor brevity, the sections below make extensive use of [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]], one of the first items in a new member's instruction program.

While most IFC chapters are based in Minneapolis, several call St. Paul their home. After a period of level membership, for various reasons, fraternity membership is increasing rapidly.  Average chapter size is 50, and several chapters exceed 100 men.\n\nFraternity buildings are generally owned by chapter alumni organizations.  Some chapters are non-residential, while a few rent or lease space.\n\nAs part of IFC or national organization self-governance, or University disciplinary action, chapters may be suspended (\"de-recognized\") or closed for a time.

According to the \u0398\u039d\u0395 website, the ''Tau'' designation was \"fancied by the chapter,\" and ''Chi'' was also considered, before ''Alpha Epsilon'' was allowed.  \u0398\u039d\u0395's Wikipedia page notes (without clear citation) possible activity at Minnesota as late as 1934, which the lack of a ''Gopher'' record shows is unlikely.</ref><ref name=\"Theta Nu Epsilon perception\">Baird's and other sources note \u0398\u039d\u0395 was an ill-favored national due to its recruitment of sophomores who were already members of other fraternities, and a policy of secrecy about the active members - those same sophomores tapped each year. It was NOT an honorary, nor a service society. (Freshmen were discluded, juniors and seniors were advisoral only.) Hence, \u0398\u039d\u0395 became a bit of a pariah, and members were pressured to quit lest they be expelled from their primary fraternities at Minnesota (see \u03a6\u03a3\u039a Rand History); in 1913 the NIC advocated ''vigorously against'' its collegians joining \u0398\u039d\u0395. Struggling for a workable path to legitimacy, several varying models developed on \u0398\u039d\u0395's campuses, where some chapters became standard fraternities, and others public inter-fraternity groups. At Alabama it even became a political machine, while other chapters took yet other forms. Later, with adoption of changes, \u0398\u039d\u0395 briefly joined the NIC in the 1930s, but ceased operations after WWII. Several chapters reformed the society as a smaller entity, some becoming co-ed in the 1970s.

The terms are synonymous, After a period of level membership representing about 3% of campus women, for various reasons, sorority membership is increasing rapidly.  Chapter size in almost all cases now exceeds 120 women.\n\nInterest and recruitment is strong enough that, in 2013, the University of Minnesota was opened to PHC expansion for the first time in 30 years, and the resulting two colonization efforts (welcoming [[Chi Omega]] and [[Phi Mu]]) occurred in 2013 and 2016, respectively.\n\nSorority properties are generally owned by a chapter's alumni club, though some chapters do not have housing, and others rent or lease space. As part of PHC or national organization self-governance, or University disciplinary action, chapters may be suspended (\"de-recognized\") or closed for a time. If a chapter is closed and/or forfeits its housing, it will be listed as a dormant chapter.

They are currently not grouped with the social fraternities and sororities.<ref name=\"OFSL2017\" /> However, some also associate with social fraternities and societies. They may also use of chapter and national organizational hierarchy, and their use of Greek Letters as identification. Some of these are populated by graduate students, a few exclusively so. As a rule, the honor and professional societies focus on specific academic, professional or service missions. Historically too there has been significant crossover and cooperation between types; some professional societies have revised themselves into non-residential honor groups. In contrast, several professional organizations have gone the other direction to conference among the academic and social chapters.<ref>This crossover is apparent in many examples: [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] fraternity became an [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] member while ''retaining'' its membership in the [[Professional Fraternity Association|PHA]]. Born as a professional fraternity, by 1917 it had begun to operate as a social and academic fraternity, requiring 'exclusivity' of its members, i.e.: they couldn't be part of another social or academic society. In 1944 [[FarmHouse]] fraternity made a similar move. Like AGR, both retain a focus on agriculture. [[Delta Chi]] fraternity began as a Law fraternity, conferencing with similar societies it its early days, while by 1911 moving exclusively into what would become the NIC camp. Minnesota's was the fourth oldest chapter of this national and was a participant in this evolution. A number of multicultural fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] are members of both the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|NPHC]] as well as the NIC. [[Evans Scholars Foundation|Evans Scholars]], an honorary fraternity for golf caddies whose [http://minnesota.evansscholars.org/site/c.5nJIJQPnEhKWE/b.7924611/k.BD08/Home.htm Eta chapter] (accessed 3 Dec 2017) occupies a home among the undergraduate Greeks, operates as a social and academic residential chapter and maintains a full social schedule among the NIC and NPC fraternities and sororities. City codes group all such property-owning organizations together, regulating them as similar to boarding houses. Sale or rental of properties between groups has occurred cooperatively for well over a century. To summarize, rather than exhibiting hard-and-fast lines of demarcation that separate social, professional or honor types of organizations, these societies appear to flex, cooperate and adjust over time with the demands of participants, becoming more or less vigorous (residential, social, 'programmed') in a slow but steady evolution.</ref> But most remain oriented toward senior students (including 3rd and 4th year students) and graduate students. Social/academic fraternity or sorority membership is not a requirement for these groups. Individuals who meet a group's criteria may join or be \"tapped,\" or asked to join, as may non-Greek students.  Multiple affiliations may be allowable as membership is frequently not exclusive to one group - see individual societies for details.  Activity varies; some of the professional and service groups are residential, while the honors societies may meet only quarterly or annually, if at all. The cut-off line where any campus organization falls ''within'' these headings or ''without'' is by long-established convention; those formed prior to 1990 are listed under the subheadings used by various volumes of the [[Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities]], which for more than a century has been the data source of record for such organizations.  Newer groups have been placed in categories similar to Baird's. The latest version of Baird's, 1991,  was published ''before'' the national development of some of the societies here, and therefore, position and inclusion is, in some cases, assumptive.<ref name=\"Baird's\" />\n\n[[File:Phi Beta Kappa Key.png|thumb|right|x200px|The Phi Beta Kappa Key.

Because of the age, size and research focus of the University of Minnesota, it hosts a wide variety of these organizations. Members commonly include the society on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV, which may serve to bolster grad school acceptance, publishing merit, and professional opportunities.\n\nListed by date of local founding with national conference membership, these are co-ed, non-residential, achievement-based organizations which self-select members based on published criteria.\n\nAt graduation, or at times of formal academic processionals, graduates, administrators, PhD holders and post-doctoral fellows wear [[Academic regalia in the United States|academic robes]] in the colors of their degree, school and other distinction, according to a voluntary Intercollegiate Code that governs customs such as formal academic regalia. In addition, various colored devices such as [[Academic stole|stoles]], [[Academic scarf|scarfs]], [[Honor cords|cords]], [[Square academic cap#tassel|tassels]], and medallions are used to indicate membership in a student's honor society; cords and [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] tassels are most common. '''[[Phi Beta Kappa]]''', the first honor society, locally founded at Minnesota in 1892, has used {{color box|#FFC0CB}} [[Pink]] and {{color box|#87CEEB}} [[Sky blue]] since its national founding in 1776.  Hence, students tapped for \u03a6\u0392\u039a may wear tassels or other society-approved items, in these colors. Like most schools, the University of Minnesota allows such regalia for honor society members. Stoles are less common, but they are used by a few honor societies. In academic circles, colors are well-known, and follow long-standing protocols. [http://www.achsnatl.org/honor_cord_registry.asp The ACHS website lists the colors] for their 68 member organizations, and the [[Honor society]] WP page lists others. [[File:Graduating students.JPG|thumb|left|x160px|Multi-colored tassels, cords and stoles are noticeable over black graduation robes.]]<!--This photo should be updated to a free-use photo of University of Minnesota grads, showing honors colors-->\n\nMany honor societies invite students to become members based on scholastic rank (the top x% of a class) and/or grade point, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition. In cases where academic achievement would not be an appropriate criterion for membership, other standards are required for membership (such as completion of a particular ceremony or training program). These societies recognize ''past achievement.'' Pledging is ''not'' required, and new candidates may be immediately inducted into membership after meeting predetermined academic criteria and paying a one-time membership fee. Some require graduate enrollment.  Because of their purpose of recognition, most honor societies will have much higher academic achievement requirements for membership than professional societies. It is also common for a scholastic honor society to add a criterion relating to the character of the student. Some honor societies are ''invitation only'' while others allow unsolicited applications. Finally, membership in an honor society might be considered exclusive, i.e., a member of such an organization cannot join other honor societies representing the same field. Governance requires a faculty sponsor and each society remains faculty-guided, usually with alumni input.<br>\n(ACHS) indicates members of the [[Association of College Honor Societies]].\n\n'''''Active honor and recognition societies'''''\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break|width=34%}}\n* '''\u03a6\u0394\u03a6''' - [[Phi Delta Phi]], 1891, legal honors<ref>Note, until 2012, \u03a6\u0394\u03a6 had nationally been a ''professional'' fraternity.

Similarly, the age, prestige, size and breadth of the University of Minnesota have resulted in its hosting many of the nation's [[Honor societies|honor]] and [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional]] fraternities for most disciplines.

Between 1900 and 1917, rentals gave way to properties built for the chapters, resulting in several iconic examples of Beaux Arts, Georgian and Classical styles. Finally, between 1921 and 1936, Minnesota's fraternity chapters engaged in that same popular [[North American fraternity and sorority housing|building spree]] which was sweeping across other early private and land grant colleges and universities from New York to California. The result of this last phase was the often stately homes occupied by many Greek chapters today, upgrades from boarding house-style clapboard and stucco homes, to the many ''Fraternity Row'' mansions that are visible at Minnesota along University Avenue SE, on 4th and 5th Street SE, and the 10th Avenue ''\"Sorority Row,\"'' all in Minneapolis. Similarly, the St. Paul campus is home to several stately chapter buildings, or chapterhouses, along Cleveland Avenue. It is a testament to the alumni of many of these chapters that their buildings survived, as so many were financed by the 1920s financial bubble, having endured weak membership eras during the Great Depression and then the twin turmoils of WWII and 1960s anti-establishment unrest.

Several recent remodeling and renovation programs have allowed significant improvement to some chapters, including recent full renovations by Chi Psi, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Phi Sigma Kappa, along with completely rebuilt houses for Alpha Gamma Rho and FarmHouse. Lack of housing for fraternity and sororities, a community now grown to 15% of the student population in 2017 according to the OFSL, remains a hurdle that new groups must overcome. This dearth is only partially remedied by the opening of the new (2013) 17th Avenue Freshman Dorm.  This particular project has allowed two ground level rental suites along University Avenue for chapters new to campus, intended to serve as a long-term incubator.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\"/>\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council approved a number of zoning changes that relaxed restrictions on Greek ownership and renovation of properties near campus in action taken on 28 April 2017.

Incorporated alumni groups own the residential chapter buildings where they exist, serving in the role of property manager. Additional local alumni oversight varies by chapter. National organizations provide organizational and operational guidance, extending to disciplinary action where warranted. In partnership with national organizations, University oversight of the Academic and Social chapters is managed on a day-to-day basis by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140717205551/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/index.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life], a unit of the [http://www.osa.umn.edu/ Office for Student Affairs].\n\nProfessional and Honor societies are coordinated at a lower level of administrative involvement by the various academic departments within the University and its several colleges, and of these, some operate merely cooperatively, with no involvement from the University at all.\n\nSince gaining its first chapter in 1874, Minnesota administrators have maintained an open, if not always supportive relationship with its chapters {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. An impulse to exert administrative management on these highly visible registered student organizations has at times been offset by interest in limiting liability exposure where it could be claimed that the administration ''was'' responsible but ''did not do enough'' to prevent an unsafe or illegal occurrence. Minnesota's Greek System has, on balance, avoided the frequency of harmful events, as have occurred at other large schools; this primarily as the result of self-policing.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /><ref name=\"Nuwer\">[http://www.hanknuwer.com/hazing-deaths/ Hank Nuwer's list of global hazing incidents] does not show Minnesota among its extensive list of 'troubled' schools, accessed 27 May 2014</ref> The original, more active relationship between the Greeks and the Administration had been marginalized somewhat after the turbulent late 1960s and during the ''lassaiz-faire'' commuter-student years of 1970\u201390. This coincided with national scrutiny and bad publicity over hazing events elsewhere in the US. With the return to a more residential campus, both the Minnesota Greek System and its relationship with the University are thriving: An estimated 2,800 Greeks on campus participate in '''58''' separate undergraduate Academic and Social chapters.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /> In addition, Professional and honor societies, many accepting undergraduates, number more than 80. Because of this and other factors, the University is again improving its relationship with the Greek Community:\n\n<blockquote>In March 2012, President Kaler announced the formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF) and issued a Charge to the GCSTF Steering Committee which emphasized the need to develop a \"sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.\"<ref name=\"GCSTF12\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{further|Fraternities_and_sororities#Criticism}}\nOver the decades, Minnesota's Greek system, like others nationwide, has had its detractors.  Most notably in the late 1960s, anti-establishment agitation resulted in decreased interest and participation. This negative environment abated with the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. While membership again surged beginning in the late 1970s, the campus population was swelling even faster. While hitting ''numeric'' highs, Greeks at Minnesota thus never achieved the pre-Vietnam era participation level as a ''percentage'' of the campus.  For some, Greeks were \"too exclusive.\" Commuting students may have had little occasion to socialize with them on the largely non-residential campus. Some students chafed at overt culture differences where Prep-era Greek men would wear blazers and ties to Monday meetings. Occasional surveys of detractors would declare a perception that membership was akin to buying friends.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\">Greek Action Committee Recruitment survey, 1984, IFC archives, accessed 16 June 2014</ref>  For others, it was simply a monetary concern, with a reluctance to include fraternity or sorority dues into a tight college budget.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\"/> The hugely popular movie, \"[[Animal House]]\" also branded for a generation the image of a lethargic, disruptive and academically inferior \"frat boy\" on the national consciousness.<ref>{{IMDb title|0077975|\"Animal House\"|- Hugely popular, this movie was a National Lampoon parody of writer Chris Miller's experiences at 1960s-era Dartmouth.}}</ref>\n\n===Response to criticism===\n\n====Fixing problems====\n\nGreek organizations both nationally and locally sponsor many risk avoidance programs for the real benefits of student safety and well-being, as well as to avoid harmful bad publicity. Hence, these organizations have learned to address criticism quickly: Chapters and national bodies have adopted extensive changes to reduce incidents of hazing and other harmful behaviors. The recent announcement by Sigma Alpha Epsilon to ban \"pledging\" nationwide is only the latest of such announcements, of revised prospective member programs now adopted by many fraternities.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/11/sigma-alpha-epsilon-pledging-hazing_n_4938425.html Sigma Alpha Epsilon Bans Pledging Nationwide In Effort To Stop Hazing], as reported by the Huffington Post's Tyler Kingkade on 11 March 2014, accessed 11 June 2014</ref> While not limited to fraternities and sororities, harmful activities like underage drinking and hazing are often headlined as local news stories, with fraternity chapters as the most visible examples.<ref>Studies show that underage and binge drinking are more prevalent nationally among student athletes, Greek system members, and organization members, with the most significant grouping ''less'' affected by the problem being commuter students that live at home.

All sororities and some fraternity chapters have banned alcohol in their living facilities. National fraternities, through the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] and sororities through their national and local governing boards require member training each year to combat hazing, underage drinking, sexual assault and other harmful behaviors.<ref>[https://nicfraternity.org/nic-standards/ NIC Standards statement] accessed 21 Nov 2018.</ref> Hence, individual chapters are not alone in addressing these problems. Inter-chapter governing boards at Minnesota (listed below by chapter groupings) provide event monitoring services and local risk management training, culminating in the introduction in 2012 of '''Arkeo''', which serves as an inter-Greek cooperative monitoring program to help chapters avoid risk.<ref>[http://www.fsl.umn.edu/assets/pdf/comm_info/State%20of%20the%20Greek%20Sp%202013.pdf State of the Greek Community, 2013 Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040843/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/assets/pdf/comm_info/State%20of%20the%20Greek%20Sp%202013.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, accessed 11 June 2014</ref><ref name=\"DefyingCritics\">[http://www.fsl.umn.edu/parents/greek_sterotypes.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life risk management statement on \"Defying the Stereotypes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162943/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/parents/greek_sterotypes.html |date=2014-07-14 }}, accessed 12 June 2014</ref>\n\n====Response to perceptions====\n\nAs to the financial cost of participation, fraternity leaders note that the vast majority of Greek students work their way through school.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> In fact, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life claims that the average cost burden for fraternity chapter membership adds 3% to a student budget, and may indeed be less costly on a net basis when factoring reduced summer rents and lower live-in costs versus dorms and private apartments. Finally, the Minnesota campus is markedly more residential than thirty years ago. Development of over a dozen large for-profit private dorms and many upgraded apartments has increased the average ''quality'' and ''quantity'' of near-campus housing ''and'' has increased their average expense. The result has been that fraternities and sororities, previously perceived as among the more expensive housing options now range from \"in line with\" or even lower than the average cost of dorms or apartments.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/university-of-minnesota-sees-resurgence-of-interest-in-greek-life/223334431/ StarTrib article on resurgence of interest in Greek Life], accessed 4 Sept 2016</ref><ref name=\"2016 IFC Study\">For reference, see the 2016 Interfraternity Council recruitment book, p.8.

These average expenses both compare favorably to living in a private apartment with an average cost of $10,056, which does not include meals, parking or social events, and which requires a sublease if the apartment is vacated during the summer months. Sorority living expenses may be higher, with increased services. For further analysis of these costs, see University Housing Services. The analysis is more involved than can be fully treated here due to space limitations.</ref>\n\nAddressing the claim of exclusivity in recruitment materials, Greek leaders will accept that label as another way of saying they promote high standards. All fraternities are by definition self-selective.  But, they clarify, so are all friendships. Further, they state, \"U\" students all have passed a bar of exclusivity by getting into the increasingly selective University itself. With an array of student groups numbering in the thousands, and a multitude of Greek chapter personalities, fraternity and sorority proponents are confident that all students who wish to join a Greek society can find one where they can flourish.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> The matter of religious and race exclusivity appears to have passed several generations ago: While some chapters are historically black, Hispanic, or Asian-oriented, there is no race exclusivity or other discrimination exclusivity in any of Minnesota's chapters. All are integrated, and have been for some time. Minnesota was the second Big Ten school (after [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]) to see its fraternities and sororities drop all bias clauses (race, color or creed) from their bylaws and policies. Older chapters have been integrated since the 1950s and 1960s<ref name=\"HistoricalStudy2003\" /> and the multi-cultural Greek chapters since their founding in more recent years.<ref>[https://diversity.umn.edu/eoaa/ The University Department of Equal Opportunity] requires all members of University communities to adhere to this standard, but has not seen a need for intervention in Minnesota's fully integrated community of Greek chapters.

According to the \u0398\u039d\u0395 website, the ''Tau'' designation was \"fancied by the chapter,\" and ''Chi'' was also considered, before ''Alpha Epsilon'' was allowed.  \u0398\u039d\u0395's Wikipedia page notes (without clear citation) possible activity at Minnesota as late as 1934, which the lack of a ''Gopher'' record shows is unlikely.</ref><ref name=\"Theta Nu Epsilon perception\">Baird's and other sources note \u0398\u039d\u0395 was an ill-favored national due to its recruitment of sophomores who were already members of other fraternities, and a policy of secrecy about the active members - those same sophomores tapped each year. It was NOT an honorary, nor a service society. (Freshmen were discluded, juniors and seniors were advisoral only.) Hence, \u0398\u039d\u0395 became a bit of a pariah, and members were pressured to quit lest they be expelled from their primary fraternities at Minnesota (see \u03a6\u03a3\u039a Rand History); in 1913 the NIC advocated ''vigorously against'' its collegians joining \u0398\u039d\u0395. Struggling for a workable path to legitimacy, several varying models developed on \u0398\u039d\u0395's campuses, where some chapters became standard fraternities, and others public inter-fraternity groups. At Alabama it even became a political machine, while other chapters took yet other forms. Later, with adoption of changes, \u0398\u039d\u0395 briefly joined the NIC in the 1930s, but ceased operations after WWII. Several chapters reformed the society as a smaller entity, some becoming co-ed in the 1970s.

They are currently not grouped with the social fraternities and sororities.<ref name=\"OFSL2017\" /> However, some also associate with social fraternities and societies. They may also use of chapter and national organizational hierarchy, and their use of Greek Letters as identification. Some of these are populated by graduate students, a few exclusively so. As a rule, the honor and professional societies focus on specific academic, professional or service missions. Historically too there has been significant crossover and cooperation between types; some professional societies have revised themselves into non-residential honor groups. In contrast, several professional organizations have gone the other direction to conference among the academic and social chapters.<ref>This crossover is apparent in many examples: [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] fraternity became an [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] member while ''retaining'' its membership in the [[Professional Fraternity Association|PHA]]. Born as a professional fraternity, by 1917 it had begun to operate as a social and academic fraternity, requiring 'exclusivity' of its members, i.e.: they couldn't be part of another social or academic society. In 1944 [[FarmHouse]] fraternity made a similar move. Like AGR, both retain a focus on agriculture. [[Delta Chi]] fraternity began as a Law fraternity, conferencing with similar societies it its early days, while by 1911 moving exclusively into what would become the NIC camp. Minnesota's was the fourth oldest chapter of this national and was a participant in this evolution. A number of multicultural fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] are members of both the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|NPHC]] as well as the NIC. [[Evans Scholars Foundation|Evans Scholars]], an honorary fraternity for golf caddies whose [http://minnesota.evansscholars.org/site/c.5nJIJQPnEhKWE/b.7924611/k.BD08/Home.htm Eta chapter] (accessed 3 Dec 2017) occupies a home among the undergraduate Greeks, operates as a social and academic residential chapter and maintains a full social schedule among the NIC and NPC fraternities and sororities. City codes group all such property-owning organizations together, regulating them as similar to boarding houses. Sale or rental of properties between groups has occurred cooperatively for well over a century. To summarize, rather than exhibiting hard-and-fast lines of demarcation that separate social, professional or honor types of organizations, these societies appear to flex, cooperate and adjust over time with the demands of participants, becoming more or less vigorous (residential, social, 'programmed') in a slow but steady evolution.</ref> But most remain oriented toward senior students (including 3rd and 4th year students) and graduate students. Social/academic fraternity or sorority membership is not a requirement for these groups. Individuals who meet a group's criteria may join or be \"tapped,\" or asked to join, as may non-Greek students.  Multiple affiliations may be allowable as membership is frequently not exclusive to one group - see individual societies for details.  Activity varies; some of the professional and service groups are residential, while the honors societies may meet only quarterly or annually, if at all. The cut-off line where any campus organization falls ''within'' these headings or ''without'' is by long-established convention; those formed prior to 1990 are listed under the subheadings used by various volumes of the [[Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities]], which for more than a century has been the data source of record for such organizations.  Newer groups have been placed in categories similar to Baird's. The latest version of Baird's, 1991,  was published ''before'' the national development of some of the societies here, and therefore, position and inclusion is, in some cases, assumptive.<ref name=\"Baird's\" />\n\n[[File:Phi Beta Kappa Key.png|thumb|right|x200px|The Phi Beta Kappa Key. Minnesota's chapter was formed in 1892.]]\n\n===[[Honor society|Honor and recognition societies]]===\nHonor societies recognize students who excel academically or as leaders among their peers, usually within a specific academic discipline. Because of the age, size and research focus of the University of Minnesota, it hosts a wide variety of these organizations. Members commonly include the society on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV, which may serve to bolster grad school acceptance, publishing merit, and professional opportunities.\n\nListed by date of local founding with national conference membership, these are co-ed, non-residential, achievement-based organizations which self-select members based on published criteria.\n\nAt graduation, or at times of formal academic processionals, graduates, administrators, PhD holders and post-doctoral fellows wear [[Academic regalia in the United States|academic robes]] in the colors of their degree, school and other distinction, according to a voluntary Intercollegiate Code that governs customs such as formal academic regalia. In addition, various colored devices such as [[Academic stole|stoles]], [[Academic scarf|scarfs]], [[Honor cords|cords]], [[Square academic cap#tassel|tassels]], and medallions are used to indicate membership in a student's honor society; cords and [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] tassels are most common. '''[[Phi Beta Kappa]]''', the first honor society, locally founded at Minnesota in 1892, has used {{color box|#FFC0CB}} [[Pink]] and {{color box|#87CEEB}} [[Sky blue]] since its national founding in 1776.  Hence, students tapped for \u03a6\u0392\u039a may wear tassels or other society-approved items, in these colors. Like most schools, the University of Minnesota allows such regalia for honor society members. Stoles are less common, but they are used by a few honor societies. In academic circles, colors are well-known, and follow long-standing protocols. [http://www.achsnatl.org/honor_cord_registry.asp The ACHS website lists the colors] for their 68 member organizations, and the [[Honor society]] WP page lists others. [[File:Graduating students.JPG|thumb|left|x160px|Multi-colored tassels, cords and stoles are noticeable over black graduation robes.]]<!--This photo should be updated to a free-use photo of University of Minnesota grads, showing honors colors-->\n\nMany honor societies invite students to become members based on scholastic rank (the top x% of a class) and/or grade point, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition. In cases where academic achievement would not be an appropriate criterion for membership, other standards are required for membership (such as completion of a particular ceremony or training program). These societies recognize ''past achievement.'' Pledging is ''not'' required, and new candidates may be immediately inducted into membership after meeting predetermined academic criteria and paying a one-time membership fee. Some require graduate enrollment.  Because of their purpose of recognition, most honor societies will have much higher academic achievement requirements for membership than professional societies. It is also common for a scholastic honor society to add a criterion relating to the character of the student. Some honor societies are ''invitation only'' while others allow unsolicited applications. Finally, membership in an honor society might be considered exclusive, i.e., a member of such an organization cannot join other honor societies representing the same field. Governance requires a faculty sponsor and each society remains faculty-guided, usually with alumni input.<br>\n(ACHS) indicates members of the [[Association of College Honor Societies]].\n\n'''''Active honor and recognition societies'''''\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break|width=34%}}\n* '''\u03a6\u0394\u03a6''' - [[Phi Delta Phi]], 1891, legal honors<ref>Note, until 2012, \u03a6\u0394\u03a6 had nationally been a ''professional'' fraternity.

Some are residential in a co-operative fashion and all offer a moderate amount of social programming. Membership in a professional fraternity may be gained by the result of a pledge process, much like a social fraternity, and members are expected to remain loyal and active in the organization for life. Within their professional field of study, membership is exclusive; for example, if one joins a law society they cannot join another law society. However, these societies do initiate members who belong to social or honors fraternities. Professional Societies are known for networking and post-collegiate involvement, and membership is often included with pride on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV.
