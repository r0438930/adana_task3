'''Cumberland Pass''' ([[elevation]] {{convert|12034|ft|m|0}}) is a high [[mountain pass]] in south-central [[Colorado]] in the [[Sawatch Range]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of the [[western United States]].

The pass is traversed by Forest Road 765 and can be accessed from the towns of [[Tincup, Colorado|Tincup]] to the north and [[Pitkin, Colorado|Pitkin]] to the south.

The Cumberland Pass road was built in 1882, connecting the mining towns of Tin Cup to the north and Pitkin to the south. The wagon road allowed ore from Tincup-area mines to be shipped to the Quartz Station of the Denver & South Park Railroad.

__NOTOC__
Year '''411''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CDXI]]''') was a [[common year starting on Sunday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Theodosius without colleague''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1164 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 411 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

__NOTOC__
Year '''411''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CDXI]]''') was a [[common year starting on Sunday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Theodosius without colleague''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1164 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 411 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

\"'''Best Look Lately'''\" is the third single from Canadian [[indie rock]] band [[Dear Rouge]]. In a press release, Drew McTaggart remarked about the song: \"We all know of our world's endless bombardment of things to better ourselves. We hope to offer a song to people that fights back at this cultural obsession, and at the same time gives you a boost of confidence. We've always found that the people who are most content are the ones we strive to be like, more than someone who is perfect!\".

'''Charles Chorley''' (c. 1810–1874) was an English journalist, man of letters and translator from several languages.

==Life==
Chorley was born in [[Taunton]], Somerset about 1810, the son of Lt Paymaster John Chorley of the 1st Somerset Militia (died February 1839). Most of his life was spent at [[Truro]], where he acted for 30 years as sub-editor and reporter of the ''[[Royal Cornwall Gazette]]'', an old-established Tory paper. He held also the posts of secretary to the Truro Public Rooms Company, and sub-manager of the Truro Savings Bank. For eleven years (1863–1874) he edited the ''Journal of the [[Royal Institution of Cornwall]]'', and was involved in managing the society. He died at Lemon Street, Truro, on 22 June 1874, aged 64.{{sfn |Courtney |1887}}

==Writings==
Chorley was a man of wide scholarship, versed in the classics and several modern languages, and of good classical taste. It was his custom to print for the private gratification of his friends, to whom alone the initials \"C. C.\" revealed the authorship, small volumes of translations from dead and living languages. The most important were versions of [[George Buchanan]]'s tragedies of ''Jephtha, or the Vow'', and ''The Baptist, or Calumny'', and two volumes of miscellaneous renderings from the German, Italian, Spanish, and French, as well as from the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.

The titles of all these works appear in the pages of the ''Bibliotheca Cornubiensis''. When the council of the Royal Institution of Cornwall proposed to bring out a volume under that title, the preparatory lists of the publications known to them were drawn up by Chorley and [[Thomas Quiller Couch]]. The scheme did not propose to go beyond works relating to the topography or the history of the county, and even within that limited area, the design was beyond the power of persons not acquainted with the treasures of the British Museum.{{sfn |Courtney |1887}}

The '''Hungarian violin school''' started with Jòzsef [[Joseph Böhm]], when in 1819 he began to teach the first violin class of [[Vienna]]'s Conservatory. Böhm studied in [[Budapest]], with his father, and with [[Pierre Rode]] (probably when he was in Russia), so he is the link between the French school (an evolution of the Italian school through [[Viotti]]) and the Hungarian one.

==Böhm's classes==
Böhm's classes gave birth to the following Hungarian violinists: [[Joachim]], [[Leopold Auer|Auer]], [[Carl Flesch|Flesch]], [[Otto Singer]], [[Tivadar Nachez]], [[Hubay]]; and to violinists of other nationalities as: [[Hellmesberger]], [[Jacob Dont]], [[Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst|Ernst]] (Romanian), [[Ferdinand Laub]], [[Franz Kneisel]] and [[Karl Klingler]]. The importance: Joachim will teach in Berlin, Auer in Russia and in America, Flesch in Switzerland and England, Hellmesberger and Dont in Vienna, Hubay in Brussels and Budapest, Laub in Russia, Klingler in Germany and Kneisel in America. Among the violinists who were pupils in the Budapest academy, created by Hubay, we find: [[Tibor Varga (violinist)|Tibor Varga]] (director of Sion academy), [[André Gertler]] (head of string-department in Brussels), [[Joseph Szigeti]] (head of string-department in Budapest), [[Sandor Vegh]] (director of the Mozarteum), [[Ilona Feher]] (teacher of [[Shlomo Mintz]] in Tel Aviv), [[Oskar Back]] (founder of Amsterdam's school), Béla Katona. Someone will perhaps have heard about [[Kato Havas]], [[Géza Szilvay]], [[Paul Rolland]], [[Robert Gerle]] or [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]]. The first four have studied in Budapest academy in the same cultural atmosphere and with the same technique. Suzuki studied in Berlin with Klingler (Joachim's pupil). These violinists are mentioned because of their fame, but they are part of a long list of key-persons in world musical life coming from the Hungarian school. the way from Karl Klingler also leads to Alphonse Brun,Alfred Ellenberger in Switzerland.

Kato Havas is author of the book \"Stage fright\" in which all the problems of posture are faced. Sensitive to these problems, Rolland has created the violin school system in the U.S. and collaborated with [[F. Matthias Alexander]]. Silvay organized the string-department in Helsinki \"Sibelius\" academy. Gerle collaborated with Rolland and Havas and worked in U.S. It must be told that in Budapest academy there is a violin pedagogy class since the year of its foundation in 1875. Since then it is collecting the elements of the violin playing tradition and those of researchers. Very big importance is given to pedagogy and to its diffusion.

Sensitive to these problems, Rolland has created the violin school system in the U.S. and collaborated with [[F. Matthias Alexander]]. Silvay organized the string-department in Helsinki \"Sibelius\" academy. Gerle collaborated with Rolland and Havas and worked in U.S. It must be told that in Budapest academy there is a violin pedagogy class since the year of its foundation in 1875. Since then it is collecting the elements of the violin playing tradition and those of researchers. Very big importance is given to pedagogy and to its diffusion.

'''Christian Adolf I, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Franzhagen''' (3 June 1641 &ndash; 2 January 1702) was a German nobleman.  He was the second son of Duke [[John Christian, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg|John Christian]] of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg and his wife,and Anna of Oldenburg-Delmenhorst.

When he was 8-years-old his older brother, John Frederick, died, making him heir to his father's estate. On his father's death in 1653, he inherited his father's small duchy, only for it to go bankrupt in 1667 and be returned to the Danish Crown.

In 1676, he married [[Eleonore Charlotte of Saxe-Lauenburg-Franzhagen|Eleonore Charlotte of Saxony-Lauenburg]], granddaughter of [[Francis II, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg]]. Christian Adolf obtained the estate Franzhagen from the marriage, and from here he started the brief [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Franzhagen]] line. The couple had three sons:

* Christian Leopold, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Franzhagen (25 August 1678 &ndash; 13 July 1707)
* [[Louis Charles, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Franzhagen]] (4 June 1684 &ndash; 11 October 1708) — his son, Christian Adolf II, inherited the lands as a small child and was the last to hold the title.
* John Francis (30 July 1685 &ndash; 22 January 1687)

He died on 2 January 1702 in [[Hamburg]], and his line would end with the death of his grandson Christian Adolf II.

The '''Pfeffel family''' (ennobled as '''von Pfeffel''') is a [[Germans|German]] family originally from [[Neuburg an der Donau]] in [[Bavaria]]. Some family members were ennobled in Bavaria in the 19th century. Among the family's descendants are [[Boris Johnson|Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson]], the British Prime Minister.

The family is descended from the [[Watchman (law enforcement)|watchman]] Johannes Pfeffel (1580–1634) of [[Neuburg an der Donau]]. His son Conrad Pfeffel (born 1605) was a tailor in [[Augsburg]], and was the father of pastor in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] Johann Conrad Pfeffel (1636–1701). The latter's son Johann Conrad Pfeffel (1682–1738) moved from Freiburg to nearby [[Colmar]] in [[Alsace]], where he served as ''Stettmeister'' (mayor) for half a year in 1727. He was the father of the historian, lawyer and diplomat [[Christian Friedrich Pfeffel von Kriegelstein|Christian Friedrich Pfeffel]] (later Pfeffel von Kriegelstein) (1726–1807). His son Christian Hubert Pfeffel von Krigenstein (1765–1834) served as the [[Embassy of Germany, London|Envoy of the Kingdom of Bavaria to the United Kingdom]] and was raised to the rank of ''[[Freiherr]]'' (Baron) in his native Bavaria. He was the father of Baroness [[:ru:Пфеффель, Эрнестина|Ernestine von Pfeffel]] (1810-94), who married in 1839 [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] (one of the most famous Russian poets), and ''Freiherr'' Karl Maximilian Friedrich Hubert Pfeffel von Krigenstein (born 1811 in [[Dresden]], died 1890 in [[Munich]]). Among the children of the latter were ''Freiherr'' Christian Hubert Theodor Marie Karl von Pfeffel (born 1843 in Munich, died 1922), who was the father of Marie-Louise von Pfeffel (1882–1944), the great-grandmother of Boris Johnson. The family's history was explored in the [[BBC]] series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/whodoyouthinkyouare/new-stories/boris-johnson/how-we-did-it_2.shtml Who Do You Think You Are?] (BBC)</ref>

A younger brother of Christian Friedrich Pfeffel von Kriegelstein was the writer [[Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel]] (1736–1809).

A [[Mummy|mummified corpse]] of a woman buried in the Barfüsser Church in [[Basel]], Switzerland, was identified in 2018, 43 years after the disovery, as [[Anna Catharina Bischoff]] (1719–1787), the mother-in-law of Christian Friedrich Pfeffel von Kriegelstein (1726–1807).

== ''The Detroit Electric Scheme: A Mystery'' ==

''The Detroit Electric Scheme: A Mystery'' was published by [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Minotaur Books]] in September 2010.<ref name=wci />

From the [https://www.amazon.com/The-Detroit-Electric-Scheme-ebook/dp/B003OUXE60/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1?ie=UTF8&m=AG56TWVU5XWC2 Amazon book description]:

:\"Will Anderson is a drunk, heartbroken over the breakup with his fiancée, Elizabeth. He’s barely kept his job at his father’s company---Detroit Electric, 1910’s leading electric automobile manufacturer. Late one night, Elizabeth’s new fiancé and Will’s one-time friend, John Cooper, asks Will to meet him at the car factory. He finds Cooper dead, crushed in a huge hydraulic roof press. Surprised by the police, Will panics and runs, leaving behind his cap and automobile, and buries his blood-spattered clothing in a garbage can.

:What follows is a fast-paced, detail-filled ride through early-1900s Detroit, involving murder, blackmail, organized crime, the development of a wonderful friendship, and the inside story on early electric automobiles. Through it all, Will learns that clearing himself of the crime he was framed for is only the beginning. To survive, and for his loved ones to survive, he must also become a man.

:''The Detroit Electric Scheme'' is populated with fascinating characters, both real and fictional, from a then-flourishing Detroit: The Dodge brothers and Edsel Ford come to life, interacting with denizens of the sordid underbelly of the Motor City, such as Vito Adamo, Detroit’s first Mob boss, and Big Boy, the bouncer at a saloon so notorious the newspapers called it “The Bucket of Blood.” This expertly plotted debut delivers with great research, wonderfully flawed yet likable characters, and a shattering climax.\"

The novel is the first in a series of books featuring Will Anderson. Later books in the series include ''Motor City shakedown'',  ''Detroit breakdown'', and ''Detroit shuffle.<ref name=\"wci\" /> ''

==History==
On April 22, 1898, a successful election was held to establish a high school in Alhambra. The election, which passed with a vote of 49 to 9, established the Alhambra High School District. The high school began classes for twenty-three students on the second floor of Garfield School on October 1, 1898. At the first commencement in June 1899, three students received diplomas.

The need for schools grew with the population, and the communities approved bonds to provide these schools. The second building program began in 1905 with the completion of the first of three [[Alhambra High School (Alhambra, California)|Alhambra High School]]s.
