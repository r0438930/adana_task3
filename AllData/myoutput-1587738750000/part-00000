Throckmorton arrived in the small city of [[Bodrum]] in the southwest of Turkey, built on the ancient city of [[Halicarnassus]], where the remnants of one of the ancient wonders of the world, the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], can still be seen today. He had received word that a bronze statue of the Greek goddess [[Demeter]] was pulled up by fishing nets and left on the beach, but by the time he had arrived the statue was taken and would eventually find a home in the Museum of [[Izmir]], north of Bodrum.\n\nThrockmorton came to know Captain Kemal of the ''Mandlinci'', a [[sponge fishing]] boat. The captain told Throckmorton that he knew of many ancient sites that were lying on the seabed, one of which he planned to dynamite the following year. Throckmorton urged him to preserve the site and convinced the Captain to draw a map, allegedly on the back of a napkin. He would return in 1958 under the flag of the [[Explorers' Club]], with filmmaker [[Stan Waterman]] among others, including Honor Frost.  They set out to visit a number of underwater archaeological sites and finally arrived at Cape Gelidonya, where they spent most of their time trying to identify the site. Finally, on the last day, they located the site on one of the small islands off the Cape.\n\nThrockmorton convinced the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] to sponsor an excavation of the site, while Frost convinced [[Joan du Plat Taylor]] to be a co-director with whoever Throckmorton found.  At this time, the young archaeologist [[George Bass (archaeologist)|George Bass]] was working on his PhD at the University and was sent to co-direct the archaeological excavation of the site.
