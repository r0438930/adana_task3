It was designed by [[Shreve, Lamb & Harmon]] and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from \"[[Empire State]]\", the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]] of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. The building has a roof height of {{convert|1250|ft|m}} and stands a total of {{convert|1454|ft|m|1}} tall, including its antenna. The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building until the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in 1970; following the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse of the Twin Towers]] in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the Empire State Building was again the city's tallest skyscraper until 2012 (when the WTC Tower overtook it once again). {{As of|2020}}, the building is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|seventh-tallest building in New York City]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|ninth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States]], the [[List of tallest buildings|51st-tallest in the world]], and the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas]].\n\nThe site of the Empire State Building, located in [[Midtown South]] on the west side of [[Fifth Avenue]] between West [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|33rd]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Streets]], was originally part of an early 18th-century farm. It was developed in 1893 as the site of the [[Waldorf\u2013Astoria (1893\u20131929)|Waldorf\u2013Astoria Hotel]]. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], its owners did not make a profit until the early 1950s.\n\nThe building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around 4 million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an American [[cultural icon]]: it has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' was released in 1933. A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. It was ranked first on the [[American Institute of Architects]]' List of [[America's Favorite Architecture]] in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1980, and were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Location==\nThe Empire State Building is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue in [[Manhattan]], between 33rd Street to the south and 34th Street to the north.{{sfn|Jackson|2010|p=414}} Tenants enter the building through the Art Deco lobby located at 350 Fifth Avenue.

It was designed by [[Shreve, Lamb & Harmon]] and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from \"[[Empire State]]\", the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]] of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. The building has a roof height of {{convert|1250|ft|m}} and stands a total of {{convert|1454|ft|m|1}} tall, including its antenna. The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building until the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in 1970; following the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse of the Twin Towers]] in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the Empire State Building was again the city's tallest building until 2012 (when the WTC Tower overtook it once again). {{As of|2020}}, the building is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|seventh-tallest building in New York City]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|ninth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States]], the [[List of tallest buildings|51st-tallest in the world]], and the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas]].\n\nThe site of the Empire State Building, located in [[Midtown South]] on the west side of [[Fifth Avenue]] between West [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|33rd]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Streets]], was originally part of an early 18th-century farm. It was developed in 1893 as the site of the [[Waldorf\u2013Astoria (1893\u20131929)|Waldorf\u2013Astoria Hotel]]. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], its owners did not make a profit until the early 1950s.\n\nThe building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around 4 million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an American [[cultural icon]]: it has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' was released in 1933. A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. It was ranked first on the [[American Institute of Architects]]' List of [[America's Favorite Architecture]] in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1980, and were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Location==\nThe Empire State Building is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue in [[Manhattan]], between 33rd Street to the south and 34th Street to the north.{{sfn|Jackson|2010|p=414}} Tenants enter the building through the Art Deco lobby located at 350 Fifth Avenue.
