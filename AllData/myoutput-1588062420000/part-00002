Plans to revitalize and expand it\u2014whether to convert the line to use modern light rail vehicles or to close the line and extend Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth further into Scarborough\u2014have been debated for over a decade by the [[municipal government of Toronto]].

This image also clearly shows the [[Fourth rail|pusher plate]] for the linear motor between the rails, and the two inductive communications wires on either side of the plate.]]\nIn 1972, the provincial government announced the [[GO-Urban]] plan to build an intermediate capacity transit system across suburban Toronto using the experimental [[Krauss-Maffei Transurban]]. However, [[Krauss-Maffei]] was forced to abandon development when the [[West Germany|West German]] federal government declined further funding.<ref>{{cite news |title=GO-Urban's bright future fades suddenly |work=Toronto Star |date=November 14, 1974}}</ref> GO-Urban then used some of the technologies from the Transurban to develop a simpler steel-wheeled version, the [[Bombardier Innovia Metro|ICTS system]].\n\nDuring this period, the TTC had been working on plans to extend its own network with a series of [[Tram|streetcar]] systems using a new and greatly enlarged streetcar design, the [[Canadian Light Rail Vehicle]] (CLRV). The Ontario government, in charge of the GO network, was looking for a test site for the ICTS system and demanded that the TTC use it for one of their planned streetcar projects, selecting the Scarborough extension. The TTC initially refused to make the change, arguing it was both the wrong solution and that since the construction of the line had already commenced this would be a waste of money. However, as the Ontario government was providing 75% of the funding for the line, they changed their minds when the government threatened to cut the funding.\n\nAt [[Kennedy station]], there are clues revealing that it was originally built for streetcar operation; it is possible to see old low-level streetcar platforms protruding under the current high-level platforms, and the loop to turn streetcars proved too sharp for safe operation of the ICTS cars, which did not have a reason to turn around, so the loop was replaced by a [[Spanish solution]]-like crossover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Toronto's Subway and the Scarborough RT \u2013 Transit Toronto \u2013 Content |website=Transit Toronto}}</ref> Ontario wanted to develop and promote its new technology, which had been designed for a proposed urban [[GO Transit]] service known as [[GO-ALRT]]. Changes to federal railway regulations had made the new system unnecessary for GO, so the government hoped to sell it to other transit services in order to recoup its investment.\n\n[[Image:TTC_UTDC_ICTS_Mark_I_3012.jpg|thumb|left|An [[S series (Toronto subway)|S-series]] train in its original (1985\u20132015) livery]]\nThe Scarborough line opened in March 1985 as the Scarborough RT. Three years after it opened, the TTC renovated its southwestern terminus at Kennedy station, because the looped turnaround track, designed for uni-directional streetcars under the earlier plan and not needed for the bi-directional ICTS trains, was causing derailments; it was replaced with a single terminal track and the station was thus quasi-Spanish solution, with one side for boarding and another side for alighting, though the boarding side is also used for alighting during off-peak hours and weekends.\n\nFrom when the line opened in 1985 until 2015, it was known as the \"Scarborough RT\" or \"SRT\". The \"RT\" in Scarborough RT stood for \"rapid transit\". Locals have often referred to the line as ''SRT'' or ''the RT'' for short.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ttc.ca/Subway/index.jsp|title=TTC Subway|website=www.ttc.ca}}</ref> The name Scarborough Line is used on the official TTC website and 2014 TTC Ride Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ttc.ca/PDF/Maps/SubwayRT_Map_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120055/http://ttc.ca/PDF/Maps/SubwayRT_Map_2014.pdf |archivedate=August 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>http://ttc.ca/Subway/index.jsp</ref> In October 2013, the TTC announced plans to give the lines official numbers to help riders and visitors to navigate the system.

The business proposal initially bore little fruit\u2014a proposed pilot project in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] was cancelled after meeting widespread public opposition, and the only other transit systems to use the technology, named the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS), at the time were [[Vancouver]]'s [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] and the [[Detroit People Mover|People Mover]] in [[Detroit]]. After Bombardier took over UTDC, it redesigned the technology with newer, longer cars, used to expand the SkyTrain network and also for new installations across the world. ICTS was rebranded as \"Advanced Rapid Transit\" (ART) and became a success for the company. Later, the technology was again rebranded, this time as [[Bombardier Innovia Metro]].\n\nOne unusual feature of the ICTS cars is that they are driven by [[linear motor|linear induction motors]]: instead of using [[electric motor|conventional motors]] to turn the wheels, they push themselves along the route using alternating flat [[magnet]]s reacting with the distinctive di-magnetic [[Aluminium|aluminum]] metal plate that runs down the centre of the tracks. This system requires very few moving parts and therefore leads to lower maintenance costs. When the car motors are accelerating, they actually lift the car off the track an extremely small distance, repelling against the aluminum plate.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0_XvdbL620C&pg=PA13&dq=Linear+repulsion+motors#v=onepage&q=Linear%20repulsion%20motors&f=false |title=Linear motion electromagnetic devices |first1=Ion |last1=Boldea |first2=S. A. |last2=Nasar |year=2001}}</ref> This micro-lifting prevents the [[Bogie|truck]] wheels from making a solid electrical contact with the track. <!-- Comment from an engineer involved in the design: the net vertical force is actually down not up and has very little impact on the normal force at the wheel rail interface. Fourth Rail was chosen to eliminate stray current problems and is common on modern systems globally --> Instead of using the conventional method, in which motive power is supplied by a single [[third rail]], with return current travelling through the running rails, a separate positive and negative power rail are provided on one side of the track. With respect to the accelerating trucks and the micro-lifting, the truck wheels have a somewhat larger flange than normal in order to keep the car inline on the track during the micro-lifting.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}} The linear induction motors also allow the cars to climb steeper grades than would be possible with traditional subway technology since wheel slip is not an issue.\n\nThe trains are also able to be operated exclusively by computers, becoming one of the earliest installations of [[Standard Elektrik Lorenz]]'s \"[[SelTrac]] IS\" system (now owned and delivered by [[Thales Rail Signalling Solutions]]), doing away with the need for a human operator. However, due to opposition from the transit [[Trade union|workers' union]] and public perception, [[Railroad engineer|operators]] were retained; the union has firmly opposed driverless trains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gttavisions.blogspot.com/2006/11/ttc-eyes-driverless-subway-toronto-star.html |title=TTC eyes driverless subway |work=[[Toronto Star]] |first=David |last=Bruser |date=November 17, 2006 |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref> (Other systems took full advantage of the automated operation and Vancouver's SkyTrain has been automated since 1985 with no mishaps.) The Scarborough line trains have only [[One-man operation|one operator]], unlike most of the other TTC subway lines, which carry both a guard at the rear, who operates the train's doors, and an operator, who drives the train from the front. ([[Line 4 Sheppard]], however, has used a single operator only since October 2016.) In practice, the Scarborough line trains [[Automatic train operation|drive themselves]]; the operator monitors their operations and controls the doors. One feature, which was not implemented at the time of Scarborough line's opening, is the automated next stop announcement system, which was introduced in January 2008 (which means operators are no longer required to call out stops manually) and uses the voice-over of Susan Bigioni, a TTC employee, identical to those used on the [[T series (Toronto subway)|T1 series]] and the retired H4, H5, and H6 trains.\n\n==Track<span id=\"Track\"></span>==\n<!--Linked to from [[Railway electrification system#Five rail system]]-->\nLine 3 uses 5-rail track, which a TTC document describes as follows: \n{{quote|Track is the [[5 rail system]] on direct fixation and car is powered by an induction or \"[[reaction rail]]\" situated between the running rails at the same top of rail elevation.

The Scarborough line's ICTS trains have their own small yard east of McCowan station. This yard is large enough to store the existing fleet, but would have to be expanded or replaced if the TTC were to expand the line's capacity with new trains. Basic maintenance is performed in this yard; for more extensive work the cars are taken to the subway's [[Greenwood Yard]] by truck, given the train's different track gauge. The north\u2013south section of the route, where it follows the Stouffville line tracks, is at ground level; the shorter east\u2013west section (except for the ground-level yard) is elevated, as is the Kennedy terminus. The line dives briefly underground just north of [[Ellesmere station]] to cross under the Stouffville line tracks. After that, it is elevated towards McCowan station. Two stations, Kennedy and Scarborough Centre, are wheelchair accessible as those two are the busiest stations of Line 3.\n\nFrom 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., when the Scarborough line is not operating, the 302 Kingston Rd-McCowan [[Blue Night Network|Blue Night]] bus serves the same area. The 302 originates at [[Bingham Loop]], where it connects with the 322 Coxwell bus that travels to the west, as well as the 324 Victoria Park, that runs north. From the loop, the 302 travels east along Kingston Road to Brimley, then north along Brimley to Danforth Road, then north on McCowan Road to Steeles. With the exception of [[McCowan station]], it does not pass near any of the rapid transit stations, though other [[night service (public transport)|night bus services]] pass near stations. Bus service is extended on Sundays because the rapid transit lines start at 8&nbsp;a.m. (beginning January 3, 2016) instead of the usual 6&nbsp;a.m. start. Service frequency is 30 minutes.\n\nThe frequency for this line is 4\u20135 minutes during peak periods and 5\u20136 minutes during off-peak periods.\n\n==Future==\n{{Line 3 Extension}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Scarborough LRT Subway Map Options.jpg|thumb|right|The different options considered for the proposed Scarborough line extension.

The existing line would have closed after the [[2015 Pan American Games]] and be completed in 2020. In January 2013, [[Ministry of Infrastructure (Ontario)|Infrastructure Ontario]] issued a [[Request for proposal#Other requests|request for qualifications]] to shortlist companies to construct both this line and the Eglinton Crosstown line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infrastructureontario.ca/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147489840 |title=Request for Qualifications Issued for the Eglinton Crosstown LRT and Scarborough LRT Lines |date=January 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2013, [[Toronto City Council]] again debated having the Scarborough line replaced with an extension of the Bloor\u2013Danforth line north to Sheppard Avenue along a different right of way. Metrolinx issued a letter to Toronto City Council indicating it would cease work on the Scarborough portion of the line, because its position strayed from the original LRT agreement.<ref name=\"GlobeAndMail2013-07-02a\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/metrolinx-to-toronto-subway-is-yours/article12942512/ |title=Metrolinx to Toronto: Subway is yours |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Oliver |last=Moore |date=July 2, 2013 |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}</ref> The subway alternative would cost between $500{{nbsp}}million and $1{{nbsp}}billion more than converting the Scarborough line to use the same rolling stock as the Eglinton Crosstown line be so it could be a continuation of that line. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that Scarborough councillors had argued that providing Scarborough residents with light rail, not heavy rail, treated them as \"second class citizens\".\n\nTwo competing subway plans were proposed to replace the Scarborough line. TTC Chair [[Karen Stintz]] proposed to extend the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway line to the east before turning north with three new stations at Lawrence Avenue and McCowan Road (primarily to serve the [[Scarborough Health Network|Scarborough Hospital's]] General Campus), at [[Scarborough Town Centre]] and then at Sheppard Avenue East and McCowan Road, where it would connect to the [[Sheppard East LRT]]. Transportation Minister [[Glen Murray (politician)|Glen Murray]] made an alternative proposal to extend Line 2 along the route of the current Scarborough line but terminating at Scarborough Town Centre. Under the Murray plan, there would be only two stations and there would be no direct connection with the Sheppard LRT. The Murray plan would have required the relocation of Kennedy station as a new northbound curve from the existing Kennedy station would have been too tight for subway trains. The Murray plan would also have required the complete shutdown of the line during construction, something that the Stintz plan avoided.<ref name=\"Subway deal\" />\n\nOn October 8, 2013, Toronto City Council voted 24\u201320 to replace the Scarborough line with a three-station extension of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway line.

City Council based its decision to choose a subway extension over an LRT conversion based on the higher number.\n\nIn June 2016, city planning staff proposed to eliminate two of the three stops along the planned Scarborough Subway Extension terminating [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] at Scarborough Town Centre in order to free up funding for a proposed [[Line 5 Eglinton#Crosstown East|Crosstown East LRT line]]. The eliminated intermediate stops were at Lawrence Avenue and Sheppard Avenue.<ref name=\"TheStar-2016-01-20\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2016/01/20/revised-scarborough-subway-plan-eliminates-2-stations.html |title=New Scarborough transit plan 'buys peace in the land' |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Jennifer |last=Pagliaro |date=January 20, 2016 |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}</ref> However, subsequently the cost estimate for the one-stop subway extension increased to $3.2{{nbsp}}billion leaving the Crosstown East LRT unfunded. Given the rising cost for the subway extension and the loss of funding for the LRT line, a group of city councillors led by [[Josh Matlow]] reopened the subway versus LRT debate. Matlow proposed scrapping the one-stop subway extension in order to provide funding for 24 LRT stops on two LRT lines within Scarborough.

However, [[Krauss-Maffei]] was forced to abandon development when the [[West Germany|West German]] federal government declined further funding.<ref>{{cite news |title=GO-Urban's bright future fades suddenly |work=Toronto Star |date=November 14, 1974}}</ref> GO-Urban then used some of the technologies from the Transurban to develop a simpler steel-wheeled version, the [[Bombardier Innovia Metro|ICTS system]].\n\nDuring this period, the TTC had been working on plans to extend its own network with a series of [[Tram|streetcar]] systems using a new and greatly enlarged streetcar design, the [[Canadian Light Rail Vehicle]] (CLRV). The Ontario government, in charge of the GO network, was looking for a test site for the ICTS system and demanded that the TTC use it for one of their planned streetcar projects, selecting the Scarborough extension. The TTC initially refused to make the change, arguing it was both the wrong solution and that since the construction of the line had already commenced this would be a waste of money. However, as the Ontario government was providing 75% of the funding for the line, they changed their minds when the government threatened to cut the funding.\n\nAt [[Kennedy station]], there are clues revealing that it was originally built for streetcar operation; it is possible to see old low-level streetcar platforms protruding under the current high-level platforms, and the loop to turn streetcars proved too sharp for safe operation of the ICTS cars, which did not have a reason to turn around, so the loop was replaced by a [[Spanish solution]]-like crossover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Toronto's Subway and the Scarborough RT \u2013 Transit Toronto \u2013 Content |website=Transit Toronto}}</ref> Ontario wanted to develop and promote its new technology, which had been designed for a proposed urban [[GO Transit]] service known as [[GO-ALRT]]. Changes to federal railway regulations had made the new system unnecessary for GO, so the government hoped to sell it to other transit services in order to recoup its investment.\n\n[[Image:TTC_UTDC_ICTS_Mark_I_3012.jpg|thumb|left|An [[S series (Toronto subway)|S-series]] train in its original (1985\u20132015) livery]]\nThe Scarborough line opened in March 1985 as the Scarborough RT. Three years after it opened, the TTC renovated its southwestern terminus at Kennedy station, because the looped turnaround track, designed for uni-directional streetcars under the earlier plan and not needed for the bi-directional ICTS trains, was causing derailments; it was replaced with a single terminal track and the station was thus quasi-Spanish solution, with one side for boarding and another side for alighting, though the boarding side is also used for alighting during off-peak hours and weekends.\n\nFrom when the line opened in 1985 until 2015, it was known as the \"Scarborough RT\" or \"SRT\". The \"RT\" in Scarborough RT stood for \"rapid transit\". Locals have often referred to the line as ''SRT'' or ''the RT'' for short.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ttc.ca/Subway/index.jsp|title=TTC Subway|website=www.ttc.ca}}</ref> The name Scarborough Line is used on the official TTC website and 2014 TTC Ride Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ttc.ca/PDF/Maps/SubwayRT_Map_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120055/http://ttc.ca/PDF/Maps/SubwayRT_Map_2014.pdf |archivedate=August 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>http://ttc.ca/Subway/index.jsp</ref> In October 2013, the TTC announced plans to give the lines official numbers to help riders and visitors to navigate the system.

The business proposal initially bore little fruit\u2014a proposed pilot project in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] was cancelled after meeting widespread public opposition, and the only other transit systems to use the technology, named the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS), at the time were [[Vancouver]]'s [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] and the [[Detroit People Mover|People Mover]] in [[Detroit]]. After Bombardier took over UTDC, it redesigned the technology with newer, longer cars, used to expand the SkyTrain network and also for new installations across the world. ICTS was rebranded as \"Advanced Rapid Transit\" (ART) and became a success for the company. Later, the technology was again rebranded, this time as [[Bombardier Innovia Metro]].\n\nOne unusual feature of the ICTS cars is that they are driven by [[linear motor|linear induction motors]]: instead of using [[electric motor|conventional motors]] to turn the wheels, they push themselves along the route using alternating flat [[magnet]]s reacting with the distinctive di-magnetic [[Aluminium|aluminum]] metal plate that runs down the centre of the tracks. This system requires very few moving parts and therefore leads to lower maintenance costs. When the car motors are accelerating, they actually lift the car off the track an extremely small distance, repelling against the aluminum plate.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0_XvdbL620C&pg=PA13&dq=Linear+repulsion+motors#v=onepage&q=Linear%20repulsion%20motors&f=false |title=Linear motion electromagnetic devices |first1=Ion |last1=Boldea |first2=S. A. |last2=Nasar |year=2001}}</ref> This micro-lifting prevents the [[Bogie|truck]] wheels from making a solid electrical contact with the track. <!-- Comment from an engineer involved in the design: the net vertical force is actually down not up and has very little impact on the normal force at the wheel rail interface. Fourth Rail was chosen to eliminate stray current problems and is common on modern systems globally --> Instead of using the conventional method, in which motive power is supplied by a single [[third rail]], with return current travelling through the running rails, a separate positive and negative power rail are provided on one side of the track. With respect to the accelerating trucks and the micro-lifting, the truck wheels have a somewhat larger flange than normal in order to keep the car inline on the track during the micro-lifting.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}} The linear induction motors also allow the cars to climb steeper grades than would be possible with traditional subway technology since wheel slip is not an issue.\n\nThe trains are also able to be operated exclusively by computers, becoming one of the earliest installations of [[Standard Elektrik Lorenz]]'s \"[[SelTrac]] IS\" system (now owned and delivered by [[Thales Rail Signalling Solutions]]), doing away with the need for a human operator. However, due to opposition from the transit [[Trade union|workers' union]] and public perception, [[Railroad engineer|operators]] were retained; the union has firmly opposed driverless trains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gttavisions.blogspot.com/2006/11/ttc-eyes-driverless-subway-toronto-star.html |title=TTC eyes driverless subway |work=[[Toronto Star]] |first=David |last=Bruser |date=November 17, 2006 |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref> (Other systems took full advantage of the automated operation and Vancouver's SkyTrain has been automated since 1985 with no mishaps.) The Scarborough line trains have only [[One-man operation|one operator]], unlike most of the other TTC subway lines, which carry both a guard at the rear, who operates the train's doors, and an operator, who drives the train from the front. ([[Line 4 Sheppard]], however, has used a single operator only since October 2016.) In practice, the Scarborough line trains [[Automatic train operation|drive themselves]]; the operator monitors their operations and controls the doors. One feature, which was not implemented at the time of Scarborough line's opening, is the automated next stop announcement system, which was introduced in January 2008 (which means operators are no longer required to call out stops manually) and uses the voice-over of Susan Bigioni, a TTC employee, identical to those used on the [[T series (Toronto subway)|T1 series]] and the retired H4, H5, and H6 trains.\n\n==Track<span id=\"Track\"></span>==\n<!--Linked to from [[Railway electrification system#Five rail system]]-->\nLine 3 uses 5-rail track, which a TTC document describes as follows: \n{{quote|Track is the [[5 rail system]] on direct fixation and car is powered by an induction or \"[[reaction rail]]\" situated between the running rails at the same top of rail elevation.

The Scarborough line's ICTS trains have their own small yard east of McCowan station. This yard is large enough to store the existing fleet, but would have to be expanded or replaced if the TTC were to expand the line's capacity with new trains. Basic maintenance is performed in this yard; for more extensive work the cars are taken to the subway's [[Greenwood Yard]] by truck, given the train's different track gauge. The north\u2013south section of the route, where it follows the Stouffville line tracks, is at ground level; the shorter east\u2013west section (except for the ground-level yard) is elevated, as is the Kennedy terminus. The line dives briefly underground just north of [[Ellesmere station]] to cross under the Stouffville line tracks. After that, it is elevated towards McCowan station. Two stations, Kennedy and Scarborough Centre, are wheelchair accessible as those two are the busiest stations of Line 3.\n\nFrom 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., when the Scarborough line is not operating, the 302 Kingston Rd-McCowan [[Blue Night Network|Blue Night]] bus serves the same area. The 302 originates at [[Bingham Loop]], where it connects with the 322 Coxwell bus that travels to the west, as well as the 324 Victoria Park, that runs north. From the loop, the 302 travels east along Kingston Road to Brimley, then north along Brimley to Danforth Road, then north on McCowan Road to Steeles. With the exception of [[McCowan station]], it does not pass near any of the rapid transit stations, though other [[night service (public transport)|night bus services]] pass near stations. Bus service is extended on Sundays because the rapid transit lines start at 8&nbsp;a.m. (beginning January 3, 2016) instead of the usual 6&nbsp;a.m. start.

The existing line would have closed after the [[2015 Pan American Games]] and be completed in 2020. In January 2013, [[Ministry of Infrastructure (Ontario)|Infrastructure Ontario]] issued a [[Request for proposal#Other requests|request for qualifications]] to shortlist companies to construct both this line and the Eglinton Crosstown line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infrastructureontario.ca/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147489840 |title=Request for Qualifications Issued for the Eglinton Crosstown LRT and Scarborough LRT Lines |date=January 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2013, [[Toronto City Council]] again debated having the Scarborough line replaced with an extension of the Bloor\u2013Danforth line north to Sheppard Avenue along a different right of way. Metrolinx issued a letter to Toronto City Council indicating it would cease work on the Scarborough portion of the line, because its position strayed from the original LRT agreement.<ref name=\"GlobeAndMail2013-07-02a\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/metrolinx-to-toronto-subway-is-yours/article12942512/ |title=Metrolinx to Toronto: Subway is yours |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Oliver |last=Moore |date=July 2, 2013 |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}</ref> The subway alternative would cost between $500{{nbsp}}million and $1{{nbsp}}billion more than converting the Scarborough line to use the same rolling stock as the Eglinton Crosstown line be so it could be a continuation of that line. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that Scarborough councillors had argued that providing Scarborough residents with light rail, not heavy rail, treated them as \"second class citizens\".\n\nTwo competing subway plans were proposed to replace the Scarborough line. TTC Chair [[Karen Stintz]] proposed to extend the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway line to the east before turning north with three new stations at Lawrence Avenue and McCowan Road (primarily to serve the [[Scarborough Health Network|Scarborough Hospital's]] General Campus), at [[Scarborough Town Centre]] and then at Sheppard Avenue East and McCowan Road, where it would connect to the [[Sheppard East LRT]]. Transportation Minister [[Glen Murray (politician)|Glen Murray]] made an alternative proposal to extend Line 2 along the route of the current Scarborough line but terminating at Scarborough Town Centre. Under the Murray plan, there would be only two stations and there would be no direct connection with the Sheppard LRT. The Murray plan would have required the relocation of Kennedy station as a new northbound curve from the existing Kennedy station would have been too tight for subway trains. The Murray plan would also have required the complete shutdown of the line during construction, something that the Stintz plan avoided.<ref name=\"Subway deal\" />\n\nOn October 8, 2013, Toronto City Council voted 24\u201320 to replace the Scarborough line with a three-station extension of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway line.

City Council based its decision to choose a subway extension over an LRT conversion based on the higher number.\n\nIn June 2016, city planning staff proposed to eliminate two of the three stops along the planned Scarborough Subway Extension terminating [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] at Scarborough Town Centre in order to free up funding for a proposed [[Line 5 Eglinton#Crosstown East|Crosstown East LRT line]]. The eliminated intermediate stops were at Lawrence Avenue and Sheppard Avenue.<ref name=\"TheStar-2016-01-20\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2016/01/20/revised-scarborough-subway-plan-eliminates-2-stations.html |title=New Scarborough transit plan 'buys peace in the land' |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Jennifer |last=Pagliaro |date=January 20, 2016 |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}</ref> However, subsequently the cost estimate for the one-stop subway extension increased to $3.2{{nbsp}}billion leaving the Crosstown East LRT unfunded. Given the rising cost for the subway extension and the loss of funding for the LRT line, a group of city councillors led by [[Josh Matlow]] reopened the subway versus LRT debate. Matlow proposed scrapping the one-stop subway extension in order to provide funding for 24 LRT stops on two LRT lines within Scarborough. TTC CEO [[Andy Byford]] said the cost of the LRT line following the SRT route may have risen to as high as $3{{nbsp}}billion because of \"delays and redesign\" since 2013,<ref name=\"TheStar-2016-06-28\" /> but Brad Ross also of the TTC warned of \"caveats around numbers and assumptions\" associated with that estimate.<ref name=\"TheStar-2016-10-24\" /> After Council's vote, Byford admitted that the cost estimates for \"delays\" was unnecessary,<ref name=\"TheStar-2016-10-24b\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2016/10/24/watchdog-says-city-staff-may-have-violated-public-service-code-over-scarborough-subway-advice.html |title=Watchdog says city staff may have violated public service code over Scarborough subway advice |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Jennifer |last=Pagliaro |date=October 25, 2016 |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref> which assumed the LRT's completion would be in 2026, the same date as the subway option.
