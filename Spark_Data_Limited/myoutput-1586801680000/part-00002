{"title_page": "2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:Pedro Alvares Cabral.jpg|thumb|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]\nThe '''Second [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India Armada]]''' was assembled in 1500 on the order of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and placed under the command of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].  Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the 2nd Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the [[Portuguese India Armadas|sea route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn the orders of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

Oddly, Couto inserts [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in place of Sim\u00e3o de Pina, but subsequently corrects himself.

The other great deviant is the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which introduces four new names: Diogo de Figueir\u00f3, Jo\u00e3o Fernandes, Ruy de Miranda, and Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves, who replace P. d'Ataide, A.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) of the armada was largely a political one.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first (1497) armada]] include captain [[Nicolau Coelho]], pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope back in 1488, and his brother [[Diogo Dias]], who had served as clerk on Gama's ship in the first expedition, also served as captains in the trip. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551).  It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese crown]].\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest [[astrolabe]] and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nCabral's instructions were several-fold. The priority was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to the brothers [[Bartolomeu Dias|Bartolomeu]] and [[Diogo Dias]], was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  Like Sofala, Kilwa had been visited by Covilh\u00e3, but not by da Gama.\n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] also had secret instructions from King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] to lay claim to the landmass of [[Brazil]]\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> In particular, there is little evidence of any such instructions from the King, and there are various reasons to presume them unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south lately. [[Christopher Columbus]] had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]], with one of his squadrons, under [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who was exploring parts of what is now northern Brazil.  In early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now modern [[Cear\u00e1]], perhaps as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nHowever, these Spanish expeditions were much too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself\u2014at that moment, Ojeda was still in [[Hispaniola]], and Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were still out at sea.  It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them.  Even if they were, it would not seem sensible to alter Cabral's large and heavy Second Armada, prepared for an important mission to India, to satisfy the pursuit some open-ended exploratory work in unknown waters which could have been far more efficiently accomplished by a smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nMarch 9, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's expedition, the 2nd India Armada of 13 ships, sets out from the Tagus.\n\nMarch 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches [[Cape Verde]] island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires is too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returns to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref> (Note: Caminha's letter (see below) makes no mention of Pires and instead reports that it was the crown ship of Vasco de Ataide was lost around Cape Verde.)\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral strikes southwest.  The reasons for this unusual direction have been speculated upon endlessly. The most probable hypothesis is that Cabral was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n[Navigationally, the arc is perfectly sensible: from Cape Verde, the ship cuts across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catches the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], turns into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies will then carry them quickly straight across the South Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In almost all of this trajectory, the sailing ship is going with the current and usually upwind.  If instead of his arc, a ship attempts to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it will go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]], and from there to the Cape of Good Hope is a struggle\u2014it means sailing against the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, and fighting against the [[Benguela Current]] to go south\u2014a much slower and more painful route, especially for square-rigged heavy ships which cannot [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] easily.]\n\nHow did Cabral know about this arc?  The most probable answer is that this was precisely the route followed by Vasco da Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and [[Pedro Escobar]]\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did.  How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before?  Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance.  But, in the more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], it is more straightforward: since [[Bartolomeu Dias]]'s 1488 expedition discovered the [[westerlies]], the South Atlantic arc became 'navigationally obvious' to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref>  Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document based on Gama and intended for Cabral that gives the essential instruction: to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve').  See Fonseca (1908: p.211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938: p.167)</ref>  The difference is that this time the arc was a little wider, Cabral went further west than Gama had, and as a result hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of [[Brazil]].\n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest have been (1.) that Cabral was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet; (2.) that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships; (3.) the hypothesis, already considered above, that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=July 2012}}\nApril 21, 1500 \u2013 After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21 (a Tuesday in the [[octave of Easter]]),<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.225)</ref> Cabral's fleet finds the first indications of nearby land.\n\nApril 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada sights the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they name [[Monte Pascoal]] (some 60&nbsp;km south of modern [[Porto Seguro]], [[Bahia]]).\n\nApril 23, 1500 \u2013 The armada anchors at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembles on the beach. Cabral dispatches a small party, headed by [[Nicolau Coelho]], in a longboat ashore to make first contact.  Coelho tosses his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf is too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, and so they return to the ships.<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.241-42)</ref>\n\nApril 23\u201324, 1500 \u2013 Strong overnight winds on prompt the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes goes [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat. He spies a native canoe, captures the two Indians on board, and brings them back to ship.  The language barrier prevents questioning, but they are fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural differences were staggering, fed with honey and cake, they spit them out and were deeply surprised with the sight of a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nApril 25, 1500 \u2013 The next day a party led by [[Nicolau Coelho]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] goes ashore, accompanied by the two natives.  Armed Tupiniquim warily approach the beach, but on a signal from the two natives, lay down their bows, and allow the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861).]]\nApril 26, 1500 \u2013 (Octave of Easter Sunday) Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra goes ashore to celebrate mass, curiously watched by some 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  It is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nFor much of the week, interaction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increases.  There is a brisk trade in European iron nails, cloth, beads and crucifixes in return for American amulets, spears, parrots and monkeys. There is only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the remainder of the crews sleep aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of the letter of [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to  King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], reporting the discovery of the 'Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\nMay 1, 1500 \u2013 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras and his astronomical instruments, determine that the land lies east of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], prompting Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to formally claim Brazil for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"\u2014later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz'', \"Land of the Holy Cross\", upon the realization that it is not an island).<ref>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia noting it was named so because May 3 (the departure date) was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.  But the letters of Caminha and Mestre Jo\u00e3o are both signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1500, Cabral dispatches the supply ship (captained either by [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]\u2014chronicles conflict on this<ref>Jo\u00e3o de Barros (1552: p.390) and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is (1566: p.69) say Gaspar de Lemos; Gaspar Correia (c.1550: p.152) says Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves.

The fleet faces headlong winds for six straight days. Four ships are lost at sea in the process\u2014most tragically, the Sofala-destined ship of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].  The famous navigator, the first to round the Cape back in 1488, fatally fails to round it this time. The three others are the crown-owned ships of Aires Gomes da Silva, Sim\u00e3o de Pina and Vasco de Ata\u00edde <ref>Castanheda (1551), Barros (1552) and G\u00f3is (1566) all identify the same four (B. Dias, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, V. d' Ata\u00edde) as lost at the Cape.  The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos.   Analogously, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which doesn't have Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost (in addition to Vasco d'Ata\u00edde and Bartolomeu Dias).  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five.</ref> (if Ata\u00edde had not been lost earlier at Cape Verde, he is certainly lost now; some scholars contend Pires was lost now, and Ata\u00edde was lost earlier).  In any case, the fleet is reduced to seven ships.  Facing strong winds, the seven split into smaller groups, to meet again on the other side.  Cabral holds two ships together with his own.\n\nJune 16, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's battered three-ship squadron reaches the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (several leagues north of Sofala).  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, take flight.  Cabral gives pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured.  Questioning quickly determines that these ships are owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of [[Malindi]] (who had received Vasco da Gama so graciously back in 1498), so they are released without harm.\n\nJune 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's three-ship squadron hobble on to [[Mozambique Island]].  Despite the earlier quarrel with Gama, Cabral is given an unexpectedly warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique, and allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the 2nd Armada sail into Mozambique island and make junction with Cabral.  Only the ship of [[Diogo Dias]] (Bartolomeu's brother) remains missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decides not to wait for it but rather to press on with his current fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\nJuly 26, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches the city-state of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city of the East African coast (which Gama had never visited).  Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala back in Lisbon and mercifully escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), goes ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim  [Note: There is no current ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]]\u2014the last one, al-Fudail, was deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.]\n\nA meeting is arranged between Cabral and Emir Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in Kilwa harbor.  Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Emir Ibrahim is suspicious and, for all the formal pleasantries, resistant to the overtures.  Cabral, feeling there's nothing to be achieved here and worried about missing the [[monsoon]] winds to India, decides to break off the negotiations and sail on.\n\nAugust 2, 1500, Pressing north, the Cabral fleet avoid hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reach friendly [[Malindi]] (''Melinde'').  There he drops off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  The Sultan of Malindi gives Cabral an excellent reception. Leaving behind  two ''degredados'' (Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado) and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally begins its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the 2nd Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], ruled by [[Zamorin]]s.  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although da Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Da Gama managed, however, to open the [[Portuguese India Armadas|sea route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn the orders of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat da Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) of the armada was largely a political one.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first (1497) armada]] include captain [[Nicolau Coelho]], pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope back in 1488, and his brother [[Diogo Dias]], who had served as clerk on da Gama's ship in the first expedition, also served as captains in the trip. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551).  It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese crown]].\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco da Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Zamorin's kingdom taken by da Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal da Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], Sofala factor Afonso Furtado, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest [[astrolabe]] and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nCabral's instructions were several-fold. The priority was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. Calicut had been visited by [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada in 1498, but failed to impress the elderly ruling [[Zamorin|Manivikraman Raja Zamorin]] ('Samoothiri Raja') of Calicut, and no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were precisely to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, to be placed under Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to the brothers [[Bartolomeu Dias]] and [[Diogo Dias]], was to search out the [[East Africa]]n port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p.107</ref>  Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the end-point of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, instructions were probably also given to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala (see [[Kilwa Sultanate]]).  Like Sofala, Kilwa had been visited by Covilh\u00e3, but overlooked by Gama.\n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of 'primitive' Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the 'Hindu church' up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of [[Franciscan]] friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nFinally, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon.\n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some controversial debate over whether [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] also had secret instructions from King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] to lay claim to the landmass of [[Brazil]]\u2014or more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>e.g. Peres (1948). Among the pieces of 'evidence', is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]], in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' (c. 1505, Cap. 2), that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.  That's about the full extent of the evidence of 'intentionality'.  See Greenlee (1938: pp.l-lv) for a critical assessment.</ref>    This claim is largely speculative.  There is no evidence of any such instructions, and various reasons to presume them unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south lately. [[Christopher Columbus]] had touched the coast of the [[South America]]n mainland (around [[Guyana]]) in 1498, on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela]]n coast, with one of his squadrons, under [[Amerigo Vespucci]] exploring parts of what is now northern Brazil.  In early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now modern [[Cear\u00e1]], perhaps as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] (in [[Pernambuco]]), and explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it.  It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref>Although the person the Spanish crown was trying to claim land away from was not the king of Portugal (that was already mediated by Tordesillas anyway), but from  Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies!  Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e. to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty, limiting him to the islands he already had.  This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nHowever, these Spanish expeditions were much too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500 (indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself\u2014at that moment, Ojeda was still in [[Hispaniola]], and Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were still out at sea).  It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them.  And, even if they were, it would not seem sensible to deviate Cabral's large and heavy Second Armada, on an important mission to India, to pursue some open-ended exploratory work in unknown waters, that could have been far more efficiently accomplished by a couple of little caravels.\n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nMarch 9, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's expedition, the 2nd India Armada of 13 ships, sets out from the Tagus.\n\nMarch 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches [[Cape Verde]] island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires is too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returns to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref> (Note: Caminha's letter (see below) makes no mention of Pires and instead reports that it was the crown ship of Vasco de Ataide was lost around Cape Verde.)\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral strikes southwest.  The reasons for this unusual direction have been speculated upon endlessly. The most probable hypothesis is that Cabral was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n[Navigationally, the arc is perfectly sensible: from Cape Verde, the ship cuts across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catches the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], turns into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies will then carry them quickly straight across the South Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In almost all of this trajectory, the sailing ship is going with the current and usually upwind.  If instead of his arc, a ship attempts to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it will go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]], and from there to the Cape of Good Hope is a struggle\u2014it means sailing against the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, and fighting against the [[Benguela Current]] to go south\u2014a much slower and more painful route, especially for square-rigged heavy ships which cannot [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] easily.]\n\nHow did Cabral know about this arc?  The most probable answer is that this was precisely the route followed by [[Vasco da Gama]] on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and [[Pedro Escobar]]\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did.  How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before?  Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance.  But, in the more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], it is more straightforward: since [[Bartolomeu Dias]]'s 1488 expedition discovered the [[westerlies]], the South Atlantic arc became 'navigationally obvious' to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref>  Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document based on Gama and intended for Cabral that gives the essential instruction: to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve').  See Fonseca (1908: p.211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938: p.167)</ref>  The difference is that this time the arc was a little wider, Cabral went further west than Gama had, and as a result hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of [[Brazil]].\n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest have been (1.) that Cabral was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet; (2.) that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships; (3.) the hypothesis, already considered above, that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=July 2012}}\nApril 21, 1500 \u2013 After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21 (a Tuesday in the [[octave of Easter]]),<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.225)</ref> Cabral's fleet finds the first indications of nearby land.\n\nApril 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada sights the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they name [[Monte Pascoal]] (some 60&nbsp;km south of modern [[Porto Seguro]], [[Bahia]]).\n\nApril 23, 1500 \u2013 The armada anchors at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembles on the beach. Cabral dispatches a small party, headed by [[Nicolau Coelho]], in a longboat ashore to make first contact.  Coelho tosses his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf is too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, and so they return to the ships.<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.241-42)</ref>\n\nApril 23\u201324, 1500 \u2013 Strong overnight winds on prompt the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes goes [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat. He spies a native canoe, captures the two Indians on board, and brings them back to ship.  The language barrier prevents questioning, but they are fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural differences were staggering, fed with honey and cake, they spit them out and were deeply surprised with the sight of a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nApril 25, 1500 \u2013 The next day a party led by [[Nicolau Coelho]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] goes ashore, accompanied by the two natives.  Armed Tupiniquim warily approach the beach, but on a signal from the two natives, lay down their bows, and allow the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861).]]\nApril 26, 1500 \u2013 (Octave of Easter Sunday) Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra goes ashore to celebrate mass, curiously watched by some 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  It is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nFor much of the week, interaction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increases.  There is a brisk trade in European iron nails, cloth, beads and crucifixes in return for American amulets, spears, parrots and monkeys. There is only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the remainder of the crews sleep aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of the letter of [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to  King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], reporting the discovery of the 'Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\nMay 1, 1500 \u2013 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras and his astronomical instruments, determine that the land lies east of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], prompting Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to formally claim Brazil for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"\u2014later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz'', \"Land of the Holy Cross\", upon the realization that it is not an island).<ref>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia noting it was named so because May 3 (the departure date) was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.  But the letters of Caminha and Mestre Jo\u00e3o are both signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1500, Cabral dispatches the supply ship (captained either by [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]\u2014chronicles conflict on this<ref>Jo\u00e3o de Barros (1552: p.390) and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is (1566: p.69) say Gaspar de Lemos; Gaspar Correia (c.1550: p.152) says Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves.

It also carries a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identifies the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s</ref>  The supply ship will arrive in Lisbon in June.\n\nMay 3, 1500 \u2013 Leaving behind a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral orders the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nLate May, 1500 \u2013 After crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reaches the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  The fleet faces headlong winds for six straight days. Four ships are lost at sea in the process\u2014most tragically, the Sofala-destined ship of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].  The famous navigator, the first to round the Cape back in 1488, fatally fails to round it this time. The three others are the crown-owned ships of Aires Gomes da Silva, Sim\u00e3o de Pina and Vasco de Ata\u00edde <ref>Castanheda (1551), Barros (1552) and G\u00f3is (1566) all identify the same four (B. Dias, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, V. d' Ata\u00edde) as lost at the Cape.  The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos.   Analogously, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which doesn't have Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost (in addition to Vasco d'Ata\u00edde and Bartolomeu Dias).  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five.</ref> (if Ata\u00edde had not been lost earlier at Cape Verde, he is certainly lost now; some scholars contend Pires was lost now, and Ata\u00edde was lost earlier).  In any case, the fleet is reduced to seven ships.  Facing strong winds, the seven split into smaller groups, to meet again on the other side.  Cabral holds two ships together with his own.\n\nJune 16, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's battered three-ship squadron reaches the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (several leagues north of Sofala).  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, take flight.  Cabral gives pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured.  Questioning quickly determines that these ships are owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of [[Malindi]] (who had received Vasco da Gama so graciously back in 1498), so they are released without harm.\n\nJune 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's three-ship squadron hobble on to [[Mozambique Island]].  Despite the earlier quarrel with Gama, Cabral is given an unexpectedly warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique, and allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the 2nd Armada sail into Mozambique island and make junction with Cabral.  Only the ship of [[Diogo Dias]] (Bartolomeu's brother) remains missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decides not to wait for it but rather to press on with his current fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\nJuly 26, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches the city-state of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city of the East African coast (which Gama had never visited).  Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala back in Lisbon and mercifully escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), goes ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim  [Note: There is no current ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]]\u2014the last one, al-Fudail, was deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.]\n\nA meeting is arranged between Cabral and Emir Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in Kilwa harbor.  Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Emir Ibrahim is suspicious and, for all the formal pleasantries, resistant to the overtures.  Cabral, feeling there's nothing to be achieved here and worried about missing the [[monsoon]] winds to India, decides to break off the negotiations and sail on.\n\nAugust 2, 1500, Pressing north, the Cabral fleet avoid hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reach friendly [[Malindi]] (''Melinde'').  There he drops off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  The Sultan of Malindi gives Cabral an excellent reception. Leaving behind  two ''degredados'' (Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado) and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally begins its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by da Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that da Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]].\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.
