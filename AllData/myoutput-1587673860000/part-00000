Owing to the laws passed during the period and the [[Great Leap Forward]] during 1958\u20131962, about 36 million people died of starvation in this period, according to an analysis by journalist [[Yang Jisheng (journalist)|Yang Jisheng]].<ref>Jisheng, Yang \"Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962\".

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow deeply into the soil (1 to 2 [[Chi (unit)|chi]]). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deeply would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pests Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nBeginning in 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] began to report excessive production of grains because of pressure from above to succeed. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref name=\":15\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\".

As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\n{{see also|1958 Yellow River flood}}\n[[File:Luokou yellow river bridge visit zhou enlai 1958.jpg|thumb|Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] (center front) visited Luokou Yellow River Bridge during the 1958 Yellow River flood.<ref name=\":16\" />]]\nIn 1958, there was a notable regional [[1958 Yellow River flood|flood of the Yellow River]] which affected part of [[Henan Province]] and [[Shandong Province]].<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/wxzl/wxzl/2000-12/26/content_1671.htm|title=\u5173\u4e8e\u9ec4\u6cb3\u3001\u957f\u6c5f\u3001\u6dee\u6cb3\u3001\u6c38\u5b9a\u6cb3\u9632\u5fa1\u7279\u5927\u6d2a\u6c34\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff08\u6458\u8981\uff09_\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u5927\u7f51|website=www.npc.gov.cn|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2007-06/14/content_648957.htm|title=\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u505a\u597d\u9ec4\u6cb3\u9632\u6c5b\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f55\u4e0d\u80fd\u6389\u4ee5\u8f7b\u5fc3\uff1f|last=|first=|date=|website=The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guoqing.china.com.cn/zhuanti/2017-07/13/content_41210848.htm|title=\u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u6c34\u707e\u6709\u54ea\u4e9b\uff1f_\u4e2d\u56fd\u7f51|last=|first=|date=|website=[[China Internet Information Center]]|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tongji.cnki.net/kns55/Navi/result.aspx?id=N2007080101&file=N2007080101000094&floor=1|title=\u7b2c\u516d\u8282 1958\u5e74\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6d2a\u6c34-\u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u707e\u60c5\u62a5\u544a1949-1995\u300b-\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5e93|last=|first=|date=|website=tongji.cnki.net|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/13/content_199329.htm|title=1958\u5e74\u9ec4\u6cb3\u5927\u6c34\u707e\u7eaa\u5b9e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/20/content_201822.htm|title=\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u4e94\u6b21\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6c34\u707e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> It was reported as the most severe flood of [[Yellow River]] since 1933.<ref name=\"dahe1\" /><ref name=\"dahe\">{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/20/content_201822.htm|title=\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u4e94\u6b21\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6c34\u707e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> In July 1958, the Yellow River flood affected 741,000 people in 1708 villages and inundated over 3.04 million [[Mu (unit of area)|mu]] (over half a million [[Acre|acres]]) of cultivated fields.<ref name=\"dahe1\">{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/13/content_199329.htm|title=1958\u5e74\u9ec4\u6cb3\u5927\u6c34\u707e\u7eaa\u5b9e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> The largest torrent of the flood was smoothly directed into the [[Bohai Sea]] on July 27, and the government declared a \"victory over the flood\" after sending a rescue team of over 2 million people.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://politics.people.com.cn/GB/8198/54051/54053/3757306.html|title=\u9ec4\u6cb3\u9632\u6d2a\u6982\u8ff0|last=|first=|date=2005|website=politics.people.com.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> The spokesperson of the Flood Prevention Center of Chinese government stated on July 27, 1958, that:<ref name=\":17\" /><blockquote>This year we defeated the large flood without division of torrents or [[Dam failure|breaks on dams]], which secures the big harvest of the crops.

that these reports of weather-related crop failures were designed to cover up political factors that had led to poor agricultural performance. They also suspected that local officials tended to exaggerate such reports to obtain more state assistance or tax relief. Clearly, the weather contributed to the appalling drop in output, but it is impossible to assess to what extent. <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Ashton|first=Basil|last2=Hill|first2=Kenneth|last3=Piazza|first3=Alan|last4=Zeitz|first4=Robin|date=1984|title=Famine in China, 1958-61|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1973284.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ac9eb43504cd6326446fcc77dbbdfd856|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=10|pages=613-645|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}} Mao was kept unaware of some of the starvation villagers in the rural areas who were suffering, as the birth rate began to plummet and deaths increased in 1958 and 1959.<ref name=\"Yang\" /> \n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow deeply into the soil (1 to 2 [[Chi (unit)|chi]]). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deeply would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pests Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nBeginning in 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] began to report excessive production of grains because of pressure from above to succeed. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref name=\":15\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization.

errors. In June 1981, however, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) officially changed the name to \"Three Years of Difficulty\", and stated that the famine was mainly due to the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward as well as the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], in addition to some natural disasters and the [[Sino-Soviet split]].<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> Academic studies on the Great Chinese Famine also became more active in [[mainland China]] after 1980, and the government began to release some demographic data to the public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/indepth/2009/09/090924_china60_yangjisheng|title=\u4e00\u6bb5\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5386\u53f2\uff1a\u5927\u9965\u8352|work=BBC News \u4e2d\u6587|access-date=2020-04-22|language=zh-CN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Gene Hsin|last2=Wen|first2=Guanzhong James|date=1997|title=Communal Dining and the Chinese Famine of 1958\u20131961|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/452319|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=46|issue=1|pages=1\u201334|doi=10.1086/452319|issn=0013-0079}}</ref>  \n\nResearchers outside China have argued that massive institutional and policy changes that accompanied the [[Great Leap Forward]] were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|title=China: A Century of Revolution|date=1997|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Population|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|year=2003|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|contribution=Famine in China|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey}}</ref> In particular, Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.
