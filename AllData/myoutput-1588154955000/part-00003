Austria is a key country in movement of freight between northern and southern Europe and between eastern and western Europe. The Brenner region is very politically sensitive with respect to both local and cross-border transport issues. Between 1970 and 1999, highway freight increased seven-fold. (3 million to 22 million tonnes)\nIn 1990, 70% of the freight from eastern Europe was transported by rail and the remainder by trucks. These proportions were expected to reverse by 2010.<ref name=\"EU Policy 2004\">{{Google books|kspRHY8UfX0C|Contemporary Issues and Debates in EU Policy: The European Union and ...|page=PA182 ff}} {{ISBN|071906418X}}</ref>{{rp|182ff}}\nAbout three-quarters of traffic through the Brenner Pass is currently carried by road transport. Local residents have long fought for relief from the associated pollution.\nThe construction of a rail tunnel is considered by its proponents to be necessary for a shift of freight traffic from road to rail.\n\nThe railway line from Innsbruck to Bozen was built between 1860 and 1867. Tight curve radii and gradients of up to 2.6% complicate rail operations. However, improvements on the Italian side in recent years to the existing line, which were completed in late 2008, allow the line theoretically to accommodate 240 trains per day. The grades were not significantly improved.\n\nThe new Brenner line would have a maximum gradient of 0.4%-0.7%. Thus, a locomotive would be capable of hauling more than double the weight. The new line (the [[base tunnel]] together with the southern approach from [[Waidbruck|Waidbruck/Ponte Gardena]] to [[Franzensfeste|Franzensfeste/Fortezza]]) would cut travel time between Innsbruck and Bolzano from about two hours today to less than half that.\n\n==Project==\n\n===Main tunnel===\n[[File:Galleria TAv.JPG|thumb|left|Start of the [[Tunnel boring machine]] at Aicha/Aica construction site in April 2008]]\n[[File:Cantiere BBT a Mules.jpg|thumb|left|View of Mauls/Mules construction site in summer of 2008]]\nThe {{convert|55|km||abbr=|adj=on}} long, twin-tube tunnel begins in the Innsbruck suburb of Wilten and penetrates the [[Alps]] reaching a height of about {{convert|840|m}} above sea level (ASL). The tunnel will be up to {{convert|1720|m|abbr=on}} below the surface at its deepest point in the [[gneiss]] section stretching south from the Italian border<!--Staatsgrenze-->.<ref name=\"urlwww.tunneltalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tunneltalk.com/Brenner-Base-Tunnel-Feb11-A-leap-forward.php|title=Brenner project takes a major leap forward|last=Reynolds|first=Patrick|date=February 2011|website=Tunnel Talk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820150827/http://tunneltalk.com/Brenner-Base-Tunnel-Feb11-A-leap-forward.php|archive-date=2013-08-20|accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> Since under the most recent plan the tunnel starts as a twin-tube tunnel, the junction already prepared in the [[Inntal Tunnel|Inntal tunnel]] on the [[Innsbruck bypass]] will not be used. Instead, a costly diversion with several branches is planned.\n\nThe volume of rock to be excavated during the construction of the tunnel is estimated at {{Convert|21|e6m3||abbr=off}}, of which approximately 60% will be incurred in Austria, as about 60% of the tunnel will be in Austria. A part of the spoil will be used as [[Fill dirt|fill]] for the approach lines and another part of the spoil material is used to produce the concrete segment for the final lining of the tunnel. The main tunnels will have a circular cross section  with a diameter of approx. {{Convert|8.1|m||abbr=on}}\n\nAccording to current planning the apex of the tunnel will be at the border at an altitude of about {{convert|810|m|abbr=on}} ASL, although an apex farther south would have been lower. The placing of the apex at the border is set out in the treaty between Austria and Italy. As justification for this choice it is stated that this will allow Austrian water to run in the tunnel to Austria and Italian water to Italy.\n\n===Northern approach===\n[[File:BBT 18 4 2011.JPG|thumb|left|BBT construction site in [[Sill (river)|Sill river]] seen from Bergisel in April 2011]]\nOn its north end, the base tunnel (BBT) has two entrances, which must go underground a few kilometres before the junction with the main tunnels, and will also be built as part of the BBT. One route leads from the main Innsbruck station under [[Bergisel]] and the other connects with the Innsbruck bypass. This route adds about {{convert|8|km}} more to the length of the tunnel than the Innsbruck station route; with it included, the BBT, at {{convert|62.7|km}}, would become the longest continuous railroad tunnel in the world. However, if the [[Axentunnel]] extension is added to the Gotthard base tunnel, its length would become {{convert|75|km}}, allowing it to reclaim the 'longest tunnel' title.\n\nThe northern approach from Munich within Germany is the {{convert|165|km}} [[Munich\u2013Rosenheim railway|Grafing]]\u2013[[Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein railway|Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein]] route.  The \"Brenner Nordzulauf\" (Brenner northern link) project aims to construct a high-speed line for speeds of up to 230&nbsp;km/h (143&nbsp;mph) between [[Grafing]] and [[Brannenburg]] in addition to the existing line, adapting the route's capacity to the projected increase as a result of the BBT.

Austria is a key country in movement of freight between northern and southern Europe and between eastern and western Europe. The Brenner region is very politically sensitive with respect to both local and cross-border transport issues. Between 1970 and 1999, highway freight increased seven-fold. (3 million to 22 million tonnes)\nIn 1990, 70% of the freight from eastern Europe was transported by rail and the remainder by trucks. These proportions were expected to reverse by 2010.<ref name=\"EU Policy 2004\">{{Google books|kspRHY8UfX0C|Contemporary Issues and Debates in EU Policy: The European Union and ...|page=PA182 ff}} {{ISBN|071906418X}}</ref>{{rp|182ff}}\nAbout three-quarters of traffic through the Brenner Pass is currently carried by road transport. Local residents have long fought for relief from the associated pollution.\nThe construction of a rail tunnel is considered by its proponents to be necessary for a shift of freight traffic from road to rail.\n\nThe railway line from Innsbruck to Bozen was built between 1860 and 1867. Tight curve radii and gradients of up to 2.6% complicate rail operations. However, improvements on the Italian side in recent years to the existing line, which were completed in late 2008, allow the line theoretically to accommodate 240 trains per day. The grades were not significantly improved.\n\nThe new Brenner line would have a maximum gradient of 0.4%-0.7%. Thus, a locomotive would be capable of hauling more than double the weight. The new line (the [[base tunnel]] together with the southern approach from [[Waidbruck|Waidbruck/Ponte Gardena]] to [[Franzensfeste|Franzensfeste/Fortezza]]) would cut travel time between Innsbruck and Bolzano from about two hours today to less than half that.\n\n==Project==\n\n===Main tunnel===\n[[File:Galleria TAv.JPG|thumb|left|Start of the [[Tunnel boring machine]] at Aicha/Aica construction site in April 2008]]\n[[File:Cantiere BBT a Mules.jpg|thumb|left|View of Mauls/Mules construction site in summer of 2008]]\nThe {{convert|55|km||abbr=|adj=on}} long, twin-tube tunnel begins in the Innsbruck suburb of Wilten and penetrates the [[Alps]] reaching a height of about {{convert|840|m}} above sea level (ASL). The tunnel will be up to {{convert|1720|m|abbr=on}} below the surface at its deepest point in the [[gneiss]] section stretching south from the Italian border<!--Staatsgrenze-->.<ref name=\"urlwww.tunneltalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tunneltalk.com/Brenner-Base-Tunnel-Feb11-A-leap-forward.php|title=Brenner project takes a major leap forward|last=Reynolds|first=Patrick|date=February 2011|website=Tunnel Talk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820150827/http://tunneltalk.com/Brenner-Base-Tunnel-Feb11-A-leap-forward.php|archive-date=2013-08-20|accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> Since under the most recent plan the tunnel starts as a twin-tube tunnel, the junction already prepared in the [[Inntal Tunnel|Inntal tunnel]] on the [[Innsbruck bypass]] will not be used. Instead, a costly diversion with several branches is planned.\n\nThe volume of rock to be excavated during the construction of the tunnel is estimated at {{Convert|21|e6m3||abbr=off}}, of which approximately 60% will be incurred in Austria, as about 60% of the tunnel will be in Austria. A part of the spoil will be used as [[Fill dirt|fill]] for the approach lines and another part of the spoil material is used to produce the concrete segment for the final lining of the tunnel. The main tunnels will have a circular cross section  with a diameter of approx. {{Convert|8.1|m||abbr=on}}\n\nAccording to current planning the apex of the tunnel will be at the border at an altitude of about {{convert|810|m|abbr=on}} ASL, although an apex farther south would have been lower. The placing of the apex at the border is set out in the treaty between Austria and Italy. As justification for this choice it is stated that this will allow Austrian water to run in the tunnel to Austria and Italian water to Italy.\n\n===Northern approach===\n[[File:BBT 18 4 2011.JPG|thumb|left|BBT construction site in [[Sill (river)|Sill river]] seen from Bergisel in April 2011]]\nOn its north end, the base tunnel (BBT) has two entrances, which must go underground a few kilometres before the junction with the main tunnels, and will also be built as part of the BBT. One route leads from the main Innsbruck station under [[Bergisel]] and the other connects with the Innsbruck bypass. This route adds about {{convert|8|km}} more to the length of the tunnel than the Innsbruck station route; with it included, the BBT, at {{convert|62.7|km}}, would become the longest continuous railroad tunnel in the world. However, if the [[Axentunnel]] extension is added to the Gotthard base tunnel, its length would become {{convert|75|km}}, allowing it to reclaim the 'longest tunnel' title.\n\nThe northern approach from Munich within Germany is the {{convert|165|km}} [[Munich\u2013Rosenheim railway|Grafing]]\u2013[[Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein railway|Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein]] route.  The \"Brenner Nordzulauf\" (Brenner northern link) project aims to construct a high-speed line for speeds of up to 230&nbsp;km/h (143&nbsp;mph) between [[Grafing]] and [[Brannenburg]] in addition to the existing line, adapting the route's capacity to the projected increase as a result of the BBT.
