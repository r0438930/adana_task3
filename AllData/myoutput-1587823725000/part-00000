After all of them performed, the acts were brought in front of the judges as part of one of three groups. Two of these groups made it through and one was eliminated, leaving 100 acts still in the competition. The judges threw a party for the remaining acts that for many lasted late into the night.\n\nDay two started with everyone getting woken up at 6:00am and heading to meet Reid. He informed them that they would be put into \"ensembles\" and groups, and would be working with stylists, choreographers, and vocal coaches. They were given five hours to learn the songs they were given. One third of the acts would be eliminated by the end of the second day. Several of the ensembles performances were aired. The first ensemble performed \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\", the second ensemble performed \"[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]\", the third ensemble performed \"[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]\", the fourth ensemble performed \"[[Wishing on a Star (Jay-Z song)|Wishing on a Star]]\", the fifth ensemble performed \"[[Superman (It's Not Easy)]]\", the sixth ensemble performed \"[[Feeling Good]]\", the seventh ensemble performed \"[[I Have Nothing]]\" and the eighth ensemble performed \"[[Run (Leona Lewis song)|Run]]\".\n\nDay two continued with more ensembles performing for the judges. The ninth ensemble performed \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\". Next, they showed a couple of quick shots of some ensembles, presumably consisting of all people that would not make it through to the end. The tenth ensemble that was covered in detail performed \"[[I Won't Let Go (Rascal Flatts song)|I Won't Let Go]]\". The eleventh (and final) ensemble performed \"[[Chasing Cars]]\". Next, the judges deliberated, and decided on which a third of the acts would be eliminated. Once again, three groups were brought in. Group 1 was eliminated, meaning groups 2 and 3 made it through to the next round of boot camp.\n\nDay three had all 64 acts perform for the judges. They were given a list of 35 songs at the end of the day two and were told to choose one that best represented them. At the end of this final boot camp round, 32 acts would go through to judges' houses. This final performance was done in front of a crowd of 3,000 people. After each of the performances, the judges gave no feedback.\n\nThe first boot camp episode aired on October 5, 2011 and covered the first two days of boot camp.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/> The second bootcamp episode aired on October 6 and covered the rest of day two and the remainder of bootcamp. By the end of bootcamp, 162 acts were cut to 32, 8 acts in each category. The judges later found out which category they would mentor and their acts joined them at their house.\n\n===Judges' houses===\n[[Enrique Iglesias]] helped Scherzinger to pick her finalists in [[Malibu, California]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] acted as a guest judge helping Abdul to pick her finalists in [[Santa Barbara, California]].

Her vote either meant that if she would eliminate Canty, Canty would be eliminated or if she voted against Crow, the result would go to deadlock and the public vote would determine the result. While Scherzinger was deliberating, she wanted the public vote to decide the outcome that week and sent the result to deadlock.

Two of these groups made it through and one was eliminated, leaving 100 acts still in the competition. The judges threw a party for the remaining acts that for many lasted late into the night.\n\nDay two started with everyone getting woken up at 6:00am and heading to meet Reid. He informed them that they would be put into \"ensembles\" and groups, and would be working with stylists, choreographers, and vocal coaches. They were given five hours to learn the songs they were given. One third of the acts would be eliminated by the end of the second day. Several of the ensembles performances were aired. The first ensemble performed \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\", the second ensemble performed \"[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]\", the third ensemble performed \"[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]\", the fourth ensemble performed \"[[Wishing on a Star (Jay-Z song)|Wishing on a Star]]\", the fifth ensemble performed \"[[Superman (It's Not Easy)]]\", the sixth ensemble performed \"[[Feeling Good]]\", the seventh ensemble performed \"[[I Have Nothing]]\" and the eighth ensemble performed \"[[Run (Leona Lewis song)|Run]]\".\n\nDay two continued with more ensembles performing for the judges. The ninth ensemble performed \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\". Next, they showed a couple of quick shots of some ensembles, presumably consisting of all people that would not make it through to the end. The tenth ensemble that was covered in detail performed \"[[I Won't Let Go (Rascal Flatts song)|I Won't Let Go]]\". The eleventh (and final) ensemble performed \"[[Chasing Cars]]\". Next, the judges deliberated, and decided on which a third of the acts would be eliminated. Once again, three groups were brought in. Group 1 was eliminated, meaning groups 2 and 3 made it through to the next round of boot camp.\n\nDay three had all 64 acts perform for the judges. They were given a list of 35 songs at the end of the day two and were told to choose one that best represented them. At the end of this final boot camp round, 32 acts would go through to judges' houses. This final performance was done in front of a crowd of 3,000 people. After each of the performances, the judges gave no feedback.\n\nThe first boot camp episode aired on October 5, 2011 and covered the first two days of boot camp.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/> The second bootcamp episode aired on October 6 and covered the rest of day two and the remainder of bootcamp. By the end of bootcamp, 162 acts were cut to 32, 8 acts in each category. The judges later found out which category they would mentor and their acts joined them at their house.\n\n===Judges' houses===\n[[Enrique Iglesias]] helped Scherzinger to pick her finalists in [[Malibu, California]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] acted as a guest judge helping Abdul to pick her finalists in [[Santa Barbara, California]].

The judges' houses 2 episode was originally scheduled for October 13 and so was also moved to October 16. The time-delay version shown in the UK was also delayed to avoid the results being shown outside of the U.S. first.</ref>}}\n\n===Controversy===\nIn the quarter-final result show, Scherzinger who had the deciding vote, was clearly upset with the bottom two acts ([[Rachel Crow]] and [[Marcus Canty]]) because she admired both acts and was undecided about how she would vote. Her vote either meant that if she would eliminate Canty, Canty would be eliminated or if she voted against Crow, the result would go to deadlock and the public vote would determine the result. While Scherzinger was deliberating, she wanted the public vote to decide the outcome that week and sent the result to deadlock. Following this, Crow was voted out which led to Crow breaking down on stage and Scherzinger was booed off the stage and her future on the show was put in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dean Piper |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2011/12/11/nicole-scherzinger-faces-the-axe-after-us-x-factor-backlash-115875-23626040/ |title=Nicole Scherzinger faces the axe after US X Factor backlash \u2013 3am & Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=December 11, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> She subsequently received death threats from some viewers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Geno |url=http://www.genogenogeno.com/2011/12/nicole-scherzinger-on-receiving-death.html |title=Geno's World: Nicole Scherzinger On Receiving Death Threats Over Rachel Crow's 'X Factor' Elimination |publisher=Genogenogeno.com |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> Scherzinger was let go at the end of the season and later relocated to [[London]] to be a judge on the [[The X Factor (British series 9)|2012 series of the UK show]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thexfactorusa.com Official website]\n\n{{The X Factor U.S.}}\n{{The X Factor (U.S.) contestants}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X Factor (American season 1)}}\n[[Category:The X Factor (American TV series)|Season 1]]\n[[Category:2011 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:The X Factor seasons|United States 01]]\n", "name_user": "LittleWink", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toSteve Jones(link changed toSteve Jones (Welsh presenter); link changed toSteve Jones (Welsh presenter); link changed toSteve Jones (Welsh presenter)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(American_season_1)"}
