{"title_page": "Phonon", "text_new": "{{short description|Quasiparticle of mechanical vibrations}}\n{{Distinguish|photon}}{{About||the multimedia framework|Phonon (software)|the company|Phonon Communications}}\n\nIn [[physics]], a '''phonon''' is a [[collective excitation]] in a periodic, [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] arrangement of [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s in [[condensed matter physics|condensed matter]], specifically in [[solid]]s and some [[liquid]]s. Often designated a [[quasiparticle]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Franz |last=Schwabl |title=Advanced Quantum Mechanics |edition=4th |publisher=Springer |date=2008 |page=253 |isbn=978-3-540-85062-5}}</ref> it represents an [[excited state]] in the [[quantum mechanical]] quantization of the [[mode of vibration|modes of vibrations]] of elastic structures of interacting particles.\n\nPhonons play a major role in many of the physical properties of condensed matter, such as [[thermal conductivity]] and [[electrical conductivity]]. The study of phonons is an important part of condensed matter physics.\n\nThe concept of phonons was introduced in 1932 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] physicist [[Igor Tamm]]. The name ''phonon'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae (''phon\u0113''), which translates to ''sound'' or ''voice'', because long-wavelength phonons give rise to [[sound]]. The name is analogous to the word ''[[photon]]''.\n\n==Definition==\nA phonon is the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] description of an elementary [[vibration]]al motion in which a [[lattice model (physics)|lattice]] of atoms or molecules uniformly oscillates at a single [[frequency]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Steven H.|title=The Oxford solid state basics|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-968077-1|pages=82|edition=1st}}</ref> In [[classical mechanics]] this designates a [[normal mode]] of vibration. Normal modes are important because any arbitrary lattice vibration can be considered to be a [[superposition principle|superposition]] of these ''elementary'' vibration modes (cf. [[Fourier analysis]]). While normal modes are [[wave|wave-like]] phenomena in classical mechanics, phonons have [[Elementary particle|particle-like]] properties too, in a way related to the [[wave\u2013particle duality]] of quantum mechanics.\n\n==Lattice dynamics==\nThe equations in this section do not use [[axiom]]s of quantum mechanics but instead use relations for which there exists a direct [[correspondence principle|correspondence]] in classical mechanics.\n\nFor example: a rigid regular, [[crystalline]] (not [[amorphous solid|amorphous]]) lattice is composed of ''N'' particles. These particles may be atoms or molecules. ''N'' is a large number, say of the order of 10<sup>23</sup>, or on the order of [[Avogadro's number]] for a typical sample of a solid. Since the lattice is rigid, the atoms must be exerting [[force]]s on one another to keep each atom near its equilibrium position. These forces may be [[Van der Waals force]]s, [[covalent bond]]s, [[electrostatic attraction]]s, and others, all of which are ultimately due to the [[electric field|electric]] force. [[magnetism|Magnetic]] and [[gravity|gravitational]] forces are generally negligible. The forces between each pair of atoms may be characterized by a [[potential energy]] function ''V'' that depends on the distance of separation of the atoms. The potential energy of the entire lattice is the sum of all pairwise potential energies multiplied by a factor of 1/2 to compensate for double counting:<ref name=latticemechanics3>{{cite book\n | last = Krauth| first = Werner| title =Statistical mechanics: algorithms and computations \n | publisher =Oxford University Press| date =April 2006| location =International publishing locations| pages =231\u2013232 \n | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=EnabPPmmS4sC&pg=RA1-PA231&dq=Mechanics+of+particles+on+a+lattice#v=onepage&q=Mechanics%20of%20particles%20on%20a%20lattice&f=false| isbn =978-0-19-851536-4}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\frac12\\sum_{i \\neq j} V\\left(r_i - r_j\\right)</math>\n\nwhere ''r<sub>i</sub>'' is the [[space|position]] of the ''i''th atom, and ''V'' is the [[potential energy]] between two atoms. \n\nIt is difficult to solve this [[many-body problem]] explicitly in either classical or quantum mechanics. In order to simplify the task, two important [[approximation]]s are usually imposed. First, the sum is only performed over neighboring atoms. Although the electric forces in real solids extend to infinity, this approximation is still valid because the fields produced by distant atoms are effectively [[electric field screening|screened]]. Secondly, the potentials ''V'' are treated as [[harmonic oscillator|harmonic potentials]]. This is permissible as long as the atoms remain close to their equilibrium positions. Formally, this is accomplished by [[Taylor series|Taylor expanding]] ''V'' about its equilibrium value to quadratic order, giving ''V'' proportional to the displacement ''x''<sup>2</sup> and the elastic force simply proportional to ''x''. The error in ignoring higher order terms remains small if ''x'' remains close to the equilibrium position.\n\nThe resulting lattice may be visualized as a system of balls connected by springs. The following figure shows a cubic lattice, which is a good model for many types of crystalline solid. Other lattices include a linear chain, which is a very simple lattice which we will shortly use for modeling phonons. (For other common lattices, see [[crystal structure]].)\n\n:[[File:Cubic.svg]]\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Linear crystal shape.png]] -->\n\nThe potential energy of the lattice may now be written as\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\{ij\\} (\\mathrm{nn})} \\tfrac12 m \\omega^2 \\left(R_i - R_j\\right)^2.</math>\n\nHere, ''\u03c9'' is the [[natural frequency]] of the harmonic potentials, which are assumed to be the same since the lattice is regular. ''R<sub>i</sub>'' is the position coordinate of the ''i''th atom, which we now measure from its equilibrium position. The sum over nearest neighbors is denoted (nn).\n\n===Lattice waves===\n[[File:Lattice wave.svg|200px|thumb|right|Phonon propagating through a square lattice (atom displacements greatly exaggerated)]]\nDue to the connections between atoms, the displacement of one or more atoms from their equilibrium positions gives rise to a set of vibration [[wave]]s propagating through the lattice. One such wave is shown in the figure to the right. The [[amplitude]] of the wave is given by the displacements of the atoms from their equilibrium positions. The [[wavelength]] ''\u03bb'' is marked.\n\nThere is a minimum possible wavelength, given by twice the equilibrium separation ''a'' between atoms. Any wavelength shorter than this can be mapped onto a wavelength longer than 2''a'', due to the periodicity of the lattice. This can be thought as one consequence of [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]], the lattice points are viewed as the \"sampling points\" of a continuous wave.\n\nNot every possible lattice vibration has a well-defined wavelength and frequency. However, the [[normal mode]]s do possess well-defined wavelengths and [[frequency|frequencies]].\n\n===One-dimensional lattice===\n[[File:1D normal modes (280 kB).gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Animation showing the first 6 normal modes of a one-dimensional lattice: a linear chain of particles.  The shortest wavelength is at top, with progressively longer wavelengths below. In the lowest lines the motion of the waves to the right can be seen.]] \n\nIn order to simplify the analysis needed for a 3-dimensional lattice of atoms, it is convenient to model a 1-dimensional lattice or linear chain. This model is complex enough to display the salient features of phonons.\n\n====Classical treatment====\nThe forces between the atoms are assumed to be linear and nearest-neighbour, and they are represented by an elastic spring. Each atom is assumed to be a point particle and the nucleus and electrons move in step ([[adiabatic theorem]]):\n\n::::::::''n'' \u2212 1 {{pad|1em}} ''n'' {{pad|2em}} ''n'' + 1 {{pad|5em}} \u2190 {{pad|1em}} ''a'' {{pad|1em}} \u2192\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7o++++++o++++++o++++++o++++++o++++++o++++++o++++++o++++++o++++++o\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n::::::::\u2192\u2192{{pad|2em}}\u2192{{pad|2em}}\u2192\u2192\u2192\n::::::::''u''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>{{pad|2em}}''u<sub>n</sub>''{{pad|2em}}''u''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>\nwhere {{mvar|n}} labels the {{mvar|n}}th atom out of a total of {{mvar|N}}, {{mvar|a}} is the distance between atoms when the chain is in equilibrium, and {{math|''u<sub>n</sub>''}} the displacement of the {{mvar|n}}th atom from its equilibrium position.\n\nIf ''C'' is the elastic constant of the spring and {{mvar|m}} the mass of the atom, then the equation of motion of the {{mvar|n}}th atom is\n:<math>-2Cu_n + C\\left(u_{n+1} + u_{n-1}\\right) = m\\frac{d^2u_n}{dt^2} .</math>\nThis is a set of coupled equations.  Since the solutions are expected to be oscillatory, new coordinates are defined by a [[discrete Fourier transform]], in order to decouple them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mattuck |first=R. |title=A guide to Feynman Diagrams in the many-body problem|url=https://archive.org/details/guidetofeynmandi0000matt |url-access=registration }}</ref> \n\nPut\n:<math>u_n = \\sum_{Nak/2\\pi=1}^N Q_k e^{ikna}</math>\nHere, {{math|''na''}} corresponds and devolves to the continuous variable {{mvar|x}} of scalar field theory.

This amounts to free scalar classical field theory.\n\n====Quantum treatment====\nA one-dimensional quantum mechanical harmonic chain consists of ''N'' identical atoms. This is the simplest quantum mechanical model of a lattice that allows phonons to arise from it. The formalism for this model is readily generalizable to two and three dimensions.\n\nIn some contrast to the previous section, the positions of the masses are not denoted by ''u<sub>i</sub>'', but, instead, by  ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>\u2026, as measured from their equilibrium positions (i.e. ''x<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 if particle ''i'' is at its equilibrium position.) In two or more dimensions, the ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are vector quantities. The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for this system is\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{p_i^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2} m\\omega^2 \\sum_{\\{ij\\} (\\mathrm{nn})} \\left(x_i - x_j\\right)^2</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is the mass of each atom (assuming it is equal for all), and ''x<sub>i</sub>'' and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' are the position and [[momentum]] operators, respectively, for the ''i''th atom and the sum is made over the nearest neighbors (nn). However one expects that in a lattice there could also appear waves that behave like particles. It is customary to deal with [[wave]]s in [[Fourier space]] which uses [[normal modes]] of the [[wavevector]] as variables instead coordinates of particles. The number of normal modes is same as the number of particles. However, the [[Fourier space]] is very useful given the [[Fourier series|periodicity]] of the system.\n\nA set of ''N'' \"normal coordinates\" ''Q<sub>k</sub>'' may be introduced, defined as the [[discrete Fourier transform]]s of the ''x<sub>k</sub>'' and ''N'' \"conjugate momenta\" ''\u03a0<sub>k</sub>'' defined as the Fourier transforms of the ''p<sub>k</sub>'':\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} Q_k &= \\frac{1}\\sqrt{N} \\sum_{l} e^{ikal} x_l \\\\ \\Pi_{k} &= \\frac{1}\\sqrt{N} \\sum_{l} e^{-ikal} p_l. \\end{align}</math>\n\nThe quantity ''k<sub>n</sub>'' turns out to be the [[wavenumber]] of the phonon, i.e. 2{{pi}} divided by the [[wavelength]].\n\nThis choice retains the desired commutation relations in either real space or wavevector space\n\n: <math> \\begin{align} \n\\left[x_l , p_m \\right]&=i\\hbar\\delta_{l,m} \\\\ \n\\left[ Q_k , \\Pi_{k'} \\right] &=\\frac{1}N \\sum_{l,m} e^{ikal} e^{-ik'am} \\left[x_l , p_m \\right] \\\\\n &= \\frac{i \\hbar}N \\sum_{l} e^{ial\\left(k-k'\\right)} = i\\hbar\\delta_{k,k'} \\\\\n\\left[ Q_k , Q_{k'} \\right] &= \\left[ \\Pi_k , \\Pi_{k'} \\right] = 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFrom the general result\n\n: <math> \\begin{align} \n\\sum_{l}x_l x_{l+m}&=\\frac{1}N\\sum_{kk'}Q_k Q_{k'}\\sum_{l} e^{ial\\left(k+k'\\right)}e^{iamk'}= \\sum_{k}Q_k Q_{-k}e^{iamk} \\\\ \n\\sum_{l}{p_l}^2 &= \\sum_{k}\\Pi_k \\Pi_{-k}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe potential energy term is\n: <math> \\tfrac12 m \\omega^2 \\sum_{j} \\left(x_j - x_{j+1}\\right)^2= \\tfrac12 m\\omega^2\\sum_{k}Q_k Q_{-k}(2-e^{ika}-e^{-ika})= \\tfrac12 \\sum_{k}m{\\omega_k}^2Q_k Q_{-k}</math>\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\omega_k = \\sqrt{2 \\omega^2 \\left( 1 - \\cos{ka} \\right)} = 2\\omega\\left|\\sin\\frac{ka}2\\right|</math>\n\nThe Hamiltonian may be written in wavevector space as\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_k \\left( \\Pi_k\\Pi_{-k} + m^2 \\omega_k^2 Q_k Q_{-k} \\right)</math>\n\nThe couplings between the position variables have been transformed away; if the ''Q'' and ''\u03a0'' were [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]] (which they are not), the transformed Hamiltonian would describe ''N'' uncoupled harmonic oscillators.\n\nThe form of the quantization depends on the choice of boundary conditions; for simplicity, ''periodic'' boundary conditions are imposed, defining the (''N''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)th atom as equivalent to the first atom. Physically, this corresponds to joining the chain at its ends. The resulting quantization is\n\n:<math>k=k_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{Na} \\quad \\mbox{for } n = 0, \\pm1, \\pm2, \\ldots \\pm \\frac{N}2 .\\ </math>\n\nThe upper bound to ''n'' comes from the minimum wavelength, which is twice the lattice spacing ''a'', as discussed above.\n\nThe harmonic oscillator eigenvalues or energy levels for the mode ''\u03c9<sub>k</sub>'' are:\n\n:<math>E_n = \\left(\\tfrac12+n\\right)\\hbar\\omega_k \\qquad n=0,1,2,3 \\ldots</math>\n\nThe levels are evenly spaced at:\n \n:<math>\\tfrac12\\hbar\\omega , \\ \\tfrac32\\hbar\\omega ,\\ \\tfrac52\\hbar\\omega \\ \\cdots</math>\n\nwhere {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u0127\u03c9'' is the [[zero-point energy]] of a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]].\n\nAn '''exact''' amount of [[energy]] ''\u0127\u03c9'' must be supplied to the harmonic oscillator lattice to push it to the next energy level. In comparison to the [[photon]] case when the [[electromagnetic field]] is quantized, the quantum of vibrational energy is called a phonon.\n\nAll quantum systems show wavelike and particlelike properties simultaneously. The particle-like properties of the phonon are best understood using the methods of [[second quantization]] and operator techniques described later.<ref name=\"Mahan\">{{cite book|last=Mahan|first=G. D.|title=Many-Particle Physics|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-46338-9|year=1981}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Canonical quantization#Real scalar field}}\n\n===Three-dimensional lattice===\nThis may be generalized to a three-dimensional lattice. The wavenumber ''k'' is replaced by a three-dimensional [[wavevector]] '''k'''. Furthermore, each '''k''' is now associated with three normal coordinates.\n\nThe new indices ''s'' = 1, 2, 3 label the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the phonons. In the one-dimensional model, the atoms were restricted to moving along the line, so the phonons corresponded to [[longitudinal wave]]s. In three dimensions, vibration is not restricted to the direction of propagation, and can also occur in the perpendicular planes, like [[transverse wave]]s. This gives rise to the additional normal coordinates, which, as the form of the Hamiltonian indicates, we may view as independent species of phonons.\n\n===Dispersion relation===\n[[File:Diatomic phonons.png|thumb|Dispersion curves in linear diatomic chain]]\n[[File:Optical & acoustic vibrations.png|thumb|250px|Optical and acoustic vibrations in a linear diatomic chain.]]\n[[File:Phonon dispersion relations in GaAs.png|thumb|250px|Dispersion relation ''\u03c9''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c9''('''k''') for some waves corresponding to lattice vibrations in GaAs.<ref name=Cardona/>]]\nFor a one-dimensional alternating array of two types of ion or atom of mass ''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub> repeated periodically at a distance ''a'', connected by springs of spring constant ''K'', two modes of vibration result:<ref name=Misra/>\n:<math>\\omega_\\pm^2 = K\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1} +\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right) \\pm K \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1} +\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right)^2-\\frac{4\\sin^2\\frac{ka}{2}}{m_1 m_2}} ,</math>\nwhere ''k'' is the wavevector of the vibration related to its wavelength by\n<math>k = \\tfrac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda}</math>.\n\nThe connection between frequency and wavevector, ''\u03c9''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c9''(''k''), is known as a [[dispersion relation]]. The plus sign results in the so-called ''optical'' mode, and the minus sign to the ''acoustic'' mode. In the optical mode two adjacent different atoms move against each other, while in the acoustic mode they move together.\n\nThe speed of propagation of an acoustic phonon, which is also the [[speed of sound]] in the lattice, is given by the slope of the acoustic dispersion relation, {{sfrac|\u2202''\u03c9<sub>k</sub>''|\u2202''k''}} (see [[group velocity]].) At low values of ''k'' (i.e. long wavelengths), the dispersion relation is almost linear, and the speed of sound is approximately ''\u03c9a'', independent of the phonon frequency. As a result, packets of phonons with different (but long) wavelengths can propagate for large distances across the lattice without breaking apart. This is the reason that sound propagates through solids without significant distortion. This behavior fails at large values of ''k'', i.e. short wavelengths, due to the microscopic details of the lattice.\n\nFor a crystal that has at least two atoms in its [[Wigner-Seitz cell#Primitive cell|primitive cell]], the dispersion relations exhibit two types of phonons, namely, optical and acoustic modes corresponding to the upper blue and lower red curve in the diagram, respectively. The vertical axis is the energy or frequency of phonon, while the horizontal axis is the [[wavevector]]. The boundaries at \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|''a''}} and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|''a''}} are those of the first [[Brillouin zone]].<ref name=Misra>{{cite book |title=Physics of Condensed Matter |first=Prasanta Kumar |last=Misra |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6rMISLVCmcC&pg=PA44 |pages=44 |chapter=\u00a72.1.3 Normal modes of a one-dimensional chain with a basis |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-384954-0 |year=2010}}</ref> A crystal with ''N''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;2 different atoms in the [[primitive cell]] exhibits three acoustic modes: one [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal acoustic mode]] and two [[Transverse wave|transverse acoustic modes]].

This is because fluids cannot support [[shear stress]]es (but see [[viscoelastic]] fluids, which only apply to high frequencies).\n\n===Interpretation of phonons using second quantization techniques===\nIn fact, the above-derived Hamiltonian looks like the classical Hamiltonian function, but if it is interpreted as an [[Operator (physics)|operator]], then it describes a [[quantum field theory]] of non-interacting [[boson]]s.\n\nThe [[energy]] [[Spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of this Hamiltonian is easily obtained by the method of ladder operators, similar to the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] problem. We introduce a set of ladder operators defined by:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\nb_k&=\\frac{1}\\sqrt{2}\\left(\\frac{Q_k}{l_k}+i\\frac{\\Pi_{-k}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{l_k}}\\right), &\\quad Q_k&=l_k\\frac{1}\\sqrt{2}\\left({b_k}^\\dagger+b_{-k}\\right) \\\\\n{b_k}^\\dagger&=\\frac{1}\\sqrt{2}\\left(\\frac{Q_{-k}}{l_k}-i\\frac{\\Pi_{k}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{l_k}}\\right), &\\quad \\Pi_k&=\\frac{\\hbar}{l_k}\\frac{i}\\sqrt{2}\\left({b_k}^\\dagger-b_{-k}\\right) \\\\\nl_k&=\\sqrt\\frac{\\hbar}{m\\omega_k} \\end{alignat}</math>\nBy direct insertion on the Hamiltonian, it is readily verified that{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} =\\sum_k \\hbar\\omega_k \\left({b_k}^\\dagger b_k+\\tfrac12\\right) ,\\quad \\left[b_k , {b_{k'}}^\\dagger \\right] = \\delta_{k,k'} ,\\quad \\Big[b_k , b_{k'} \\Big] = \\left[{b_k}^\\dagger , {b_{k'}}^\\dagger \\right] = 0.</math>\n\nAs with the quantum harmonic oscillator, one can show that ''b<sub>k</sub>''<sup>\u2020</sup> and ''b<sub>k</sub>'' respectively create and destroy one excitation of energy ''\u0127\u03c9<sub>k</sub>''. These excitations are phonons.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nTwo important properties of phonons may be deduced. Firstly, phonons are [[boson]]s, since any number of identical excitations can be created by repeated application of the creation operator ''b<sub>k</sub>''<sup>\u2020</sup>. Secondly, each phonon is a \"collective mode\" caused by the motion of every atom in the lattice. This may be seen from the fact that the ladder operators contain sums over the position and momentum operators of every atom.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIt is not ''a priori'' obvious that these excitations generated by the ''b'' operators are literally waves of lattice displacement, but one may convince oneself of this by calculating the ''position\u2013position [[correlation function]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Let {{ket|''k''}} denote a state with a single quantum of mode ''k'' excited, i.e.\n\n:<math>| k \\rangle = b_k^\\dagger | 0 \\rangle.</math>\n\nOne can show that, for any two atoms ''j'' and ''l'',\n\n:<math>\\langle k | x_j(t) x_l(0) | k \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{Nm\\omega_k} \\cos \\big( k(j-l)a - \\omega_k t \\big) + \\langle 0 | x_j(t) x_l(0) |0 \\rangle </math>\n\nwhich has the form of a lattice wave with frequency ''\u03c9<sub>k</sub>'' and wavenumber ''k''.\n\nIn three dimensions the Hamiltonian has the form\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\sum_k \\sum_{s = 1}^3 \\hbar \\, \\omega_{k,s}\n\\left( {b_{k,s}}^\\dagger b_{k,s} + \\tfrac12 \\right).</math>{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Acoustic and optical phonons==<!-- the links \"acoustic phonons\" and \"optical phonons\" from the article \"Photoluminescence\" links here -->\nSolids with more than one atom in the smallest [[unit cell]] exhibit two types of phonons: acoustic phonons and optical phonons.\n\n'''Acoustic phonons''' are coherent movements of atoms of the lattice out of their equilibrium positions. If the displacement is in the direction of propagation, then in some areas the atoms will be closer, in others farther apart, as in a sound wave in air (hence the name acoustic). Displacement perpendicular to the propagation direction is comparable to waves on a string. If the wavelength of acoustic phonons goes to infinity, this corresponds to a simple displacement of the whole crystal, and this costs zero deformation energy. Acoustic phonons exhibit a linear relationship between frequency and phonon wavevector for long wavelengths. The frequencies of acoustic phonons tend to zero with longer wavelength. Longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons are often abbreviated as LA and TA phonons, respectively.\n\n'''Optical phonons''' are out-of-phase movements of the atoms in the lattice, one atom moving to the left, and its neighbour to the right. This occurs if the lattice basis consists of two or more atoms. They are called ''optical'' because in ionic crystals, like [[sodium chloride]], they are excited by [[infrared radiation]]. The electric field of the light will move every positive sodium ion in the direction of the field, and every negative chloride ion in the other direction, sending the crystal vibrating.\n\nOptical phonons have a non-zero frequency at the [[Brillouin zone]] center and show no dispersion near that long wavelength limit. This is because they correspond to a mode of vibration where positive and negative ions at adjacent lattice sites swing against each other, creating a time-varying [[electrical dipole moment]]. Optical phonons that interact in this way with light are called ''infrared active''. Optical phonons that are ''Raman active'' can also interact indirectly with light, through [[Raman scattering]]. Optical phonons are often abbreviated as LO and TO phonons, for the longitudinal and transverse modes respectively; the splitting between LO and TO frequencies is often described accurately by the [[Lyddane\u2013Sachs\u2013Teller relation]].\n\nWhen measuring optical phonon energy experimentally, optical phonon frequencies are sometimes given in spectroscopic [[wavenumber]] notation, where the symbol ''\u03c9'' represents ordinary frequency (not angular frequency), and is expressed in units of [[Centimetre|cm]]<sup>\u22121</sup>. The value is obtained by dividing the frequency by the [[speed of light in vacuum]]. In other words, the wavenumber in cm<sup>\u22121</sup> units corresponds to the inverse of the [[wavelength]] of a [[photon]] in vacuum, that has the same frequency as the measured phonon.<ref name=\"cmian\">{{cite book | last = Mahan | first = Gerald | title = Condensed Matter in a Nutshell | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-691-14016-2 }}</ref>\n\n==Crystal momentum==\n{{Main article|Crystal momentum}}\n[[File:phonon k 3k.gif|right|thumb|250px|k-vectors exceeding the first Brillouin zone (red) do not carry any more information than their counterparts (black) in the first Brillouin zone.]]\nBy analogy to [[photon]]s and [[De Broglie wavelength|matter waves]], phonons have been treated with wavevector ''k'' as though it has a [[momentum]] ''\u0127k'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Solid State Physics, 8th Edition|last=Kittel|first=Charles|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=978-0-471-41526-8|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780471415268/page/100 100]|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780471415268/page/100}}</ref> however, this is not strictly correct, because ''\u0127k'' is not actually a physical momentum; it is called the ''crystal momentum'' or ''pseudomomentum''. This is because ''k'' is only determined up to addition of constant vectors (the [[reciprocal lattice|reciprocal lattice vector]]s and integer multiples thereof). For example, in the one-dimensional model, the normal coordinates ''Q'' and ''\u03a0'' are defined so that\n:<math>Q_k \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} Q_{k+K} ;\\quad \\Pi_k \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\Pi_{k + K}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>K = \\frac{2n\\pi}{a}</math>\n\nfor any integer ''n''. A phonon with wavenumber ''k'' is thus equivalent to an infinite family of phonons with wavenumbers ''k''&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;{{sfrac|2{{pi}}|''a''}}, ''k''&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;{{sfrac|4{{pi}}|''a''}}, and so forth. Physically, the reciprocal lattice vectors act as additional chunks of momentum which the lattice can impart to the phonon. [[Bloch wave|Bloch electron]]s obey a similar set of restrictions.\n\n[[File:Brillouin zone.svg|thumb|Brillouin zones, (a) in a square lattice, and (b) in a hexagonal lattice]]\nIt is usually convenient to consider phonon wavevectors ''k'' which have the smallest magnitude |''k''| in their \"family\". The set of all such wavevectors defines the ''first [[Brillouin zone]]''. Additional Brillouin zones may be defined as copies of the first zone, shifted by some reciprocal lattice vector.\n\n==Thermodynamics==\nThe [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties of a solid are directly related to its phonon structure. The entire set of all possible phonons that are described by the phonon dispersion relations combine in what is known as the phonon [[density of states]] which determines the [[heat capacity]] of a crystal.  By the nature of this distribution, the heat capacity is dominated by the high-frequency part of the distribution, while thermal conductivity is primarily the result of the low-frequency region.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nAt [[absolute zero]] temperature, a crystal lattice lies in its [[ground state]], and contains no phonons. A lattice at a nonzero [[temperature]] has an energy that is not constant, but fluctuates [[random]]ly about some [[Arithmetic mean|mean value]]. These energy fluctuations are caused by random lattice vibrations, which can be viewed as a gas of phonons. Because these phonons are generated by the temperature of the lattice, they are sometimes designated thermal phonons.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThermal phonons can be created and destroyed by random energy fluctuations. In the language of statistical mechanics this means that the chemical potential for adding a phonon is zero. This behavior is an extension of the harmonic potential into the anharmonic regime. The behavior of thermal phonons is similar to the [[photon gas]] produced by an [[electromagnetic cavity]], wherein photons may be emitted or absorbed by the cavity walls. This similarity is not coincidental, for it turns out that the electromagnetic field behaves like a set of harmonic oscillators, giving rise to [[Black-body radiation]]. Both gases obey the [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]]: in thermal equilibrium and within the harmonic regime, the probability of finding phonons or photons in a given state with a given angular frequency is:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pathria |last2=Beale |title=Statistical Mechanics |date=2011 |publisher=Elsevier |location=India |isbn=978-93-80931-89-0 |page=201 |edition=3}}</ref>\n\n:<math>n\\left(\\omega_{k,s}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\dfrac{\\hbar\\omega_{k,s}}{k_\\mathrm{B}T}\\right) - 1}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c9''<sub>''k'',''s''</sub> is the frequency of the phonons (or photons) in the state, ''k''<sub>B</sub> is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and ''T'' is the temperature.\n\n===Heat flow in nanometer-wide gaps===\nThe idea of [[quantum tunneling]] applied to phonons produces the idea of ''phonon tunneling'', where across nanometer-wide gaps, heat can transfer between materials from phonon that \"tunnel\" between the two materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2015/phonon-tunneling-heat-flow-nanometer-gaps-0407|title=Tunneling across a tiny gap|website=News.mit.edu|accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref> The type of heat transfer works between distances too large for [[Thermal conduction| conduction]] to occur but too small for [[thermal radiation| radiation]] to occur.\n\n==Operator formalism==\nThe phonon Hamiltonian is given by\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\tfrac12 \\sum_\\alpha\\left(p_\\alpha^2 + \\omega^2_\\alpha q_\\alpha^2 -\\tfrac12 \\hbar\\omega_\\alpha\\right)</math>\nIn terms of the operators, these are given by\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\sum_\\alpha\\hbar\\omega_\\alpha {a_\\alpha}^\\dagger a_\\alpha</math>\nHere, in expressing the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] in operator formalism, we have not taken into account the {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u0127\u03c9<sub>q</sub>'' term, since if we take an infinite lattice or, for that matter a continuum, the {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u0127\u03c9<sub>q</sub>'' terms will add up giving an infinity. Hence, it is \"renormalized\" by putting the factor of {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u0127\u03c9<sub>q</sub>'' to 0 arguing that the difference in energy is what we measure and not the absolute value of it. Hence, the {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u0127\u03c9<sub>q</sub>'' factor is absent in the operator formalised expression for the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]].\n\nThe ground state also called the \"vacuum state\" is the state composed of no phonons. Hence, the energy of the ground state is 0. When, a system is in state {{ket|''n''<sub>1</sub>''n''<sub>2</sub>''n''<sub>3</sub>\u2026}}, we say there are ''n<sub>\u03b1</sub>'' phonons of type ''\u03b1''. The ''n<sub>\u03b1</sub>'' are called the occupation number of the phonons. Energy of a single phonon of type ''\u03b1'' being ''\u0127\u03c9<sub>q</sub>'', the total energy of a general phonon system is given by ''n''<sub>1</sub>''\u0127\u03c9''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''<sub>2</sub>''\u0127\u03c9''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+\u2026. In other words, the phonons are non-interacting. The action of creation and annihilation operators are given by\n:<math>{a_\\alpha}^\\dagger\\Big|n_1\\ldots n_{\\alpha -1}n_\\alpha n_{\\alpha +1}\\ldots\\Big\\rangle = \\sqrt{n_\\alpha +1}\\Big|n_1\\ldots,n_{\\alpha -1}, (n_\\alpha+1), n_{\\alpha+1}\\ldots\\Big\\rangle</math>\nand,\n:<math>a_\\alpha\\Big|n_1\\ldots n_{\\alpha -1}n_\\alpha n_{\\alpha +1}\\ldots\\Big\\rangle = \\sqrt{n_\\alpha}\\Big|n_1\\ldots,n_{\\alpha -1},(n_\\alpha-1),n_{\\alpha+1},\\ldots\\Big\\rangle</math>\ni.e. ''a<sub>\u03b1</sub>''<sup>\u2020</sup> creates a phonon of type ''\u03b1'' while ''a<sub>\u03b1</sub>'' annihilates.

The study of phonons is an important part of condensed matter physics.\n\nThe concept of phonons was introduced in 1932 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] physicist [[Igor Tamm]]. The name ''phonon'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae (''phon\u0113''), which translates to ''sound'' or ''voice'', because long-wavelength phonons give rise to [[sound]]. The name is analogous to the word ''[[photon]]''.\n\n==Definition==\nA phonon is the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] description of an elementary [[vibration]]al motion in which a [[lattice model (physics)|lattice]] of atoms or molecules uniformly oscillates at a single [[frequency]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Steven H.|title=The Oxford solid state basics|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-968077-1|pages=82|edition=1st}}</ref> In [[classical mechanics]] this designates a [[normal mode]] of vibration. Normal modes are important because any arbitrary lattice vibration can be considered to be a [[superposition principle|superposition]] of these ''elementary'' vibration modes (cf. [[Fourier analysis]]). While normal modes are [[wave|wave-like]] phenomena in classical mechanics, phonons have [[Elementary particle|particle-like]] properties too, in a way related to the [[wave\u2013particle duality]] of quantum mechanics.\n\n==Lattice dynamics==\nThe equations in this section do not use [[axiom]]s of quantum mechanics but instead use relations for which there exists a direct [[correspondence principle|correspondence]] in classical mechanics.\n\nFor example: a rigid regular, [[crystalline]] (not [[amorphous solid|amorphous]]) lattice is composed of ''N'' particles. These particles may be atoms or molecules. ''N'' is a large number, say of the order of 10<sup>23</sup>, or on the order of [[Avogadro's number]] for a typical sample of a solid. Since the lattice is rigid, the atoms must be exerting [[force]]s on one another to keep each atom near its equilibrium position. These forces may be [[Van der Waals force]]s, [[covalent bond]]s, [[electrostatic attraction]]s, and others, all of which are ultimately due to the [[electric field|electric]] force. [[magnetism|Magnetic]] and [[gravity|gravitational]] forces are generally negligible. The forces between each pair of atoms may be characterized by a [[potential energy]] function ''V'' that depends on the distance of separation of the atoms. The potential energy of the entire lattice is the sum of all pairwise potential energies multiplied by a factor of 1/2 to compensate for double counting:<ref name=latticemechanics3>{{cite book\n | last = Krauth| first = Werner| title =Statistical mechanics: algorithms and computations \n | publisher =Oxford University Press| date =April 2006| location =International publishing locations| pages =231\u2013232 \n | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=EnabPPmmS4sC&pg=RA1-PA231&dq=Mechanics+of+particles+on+a+lattice#v=onepage&q=Mechanics%20of%20particles%20on%20a%20lattice&f=false| isbn =978-0-19-851536-4}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\frac12\\sum_{i \\neq j} V\\left(r_i - r_j\\right)</math>\n\nwhere ''r<sub>i</sub>'' is the [[space|position]] of the ''i''th atom, and ''V'' is the [[potential energy]] between two atoms. \n\nIt is difficult to solve this [[many-body problem]] explicitly in either classical or quantum mechanics. In order to simplify the task, two important [[approximation]]s are usually imposed. First, the sum is only performed over neighboring atoms. Although the electric forces in real solids extend to infinity, this approximation is still valid because the fields produced by distant atoms are effectively [[electric field screening|screened]]. Secondly, the potentials ''V'' are treated as [[harmonic oscillator|harmonic potentials]]. This is permissible as long as the atoms remain close to their equilibrium positions. Formally, this is accomplished by [[Taylor series|Taylor expanding]] ''V'' about its equilibrium value to quadratic order, giving ''V'' proportional to the displacement ''x''<sup>2</sup> and the elastic force simply proportional to ''x''. The error in ignoring higher order terms remains small if ''x'' remains close to the equilibrium position.\n\nThe resulting lattice may be visualized as a system of balls connected by springs. The following figure shows a cubic lattice, which is a good model for many types of crystalline solid. Other lattices include a linear chain, which is a very simple lattice which we will shortly use for modeling phonons. (For other common lattices, see [[crystal structure]].)\n\n:[[File:Cubic.svg]]\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Linear crystal shape.png]] -->\n\nThe potential energy of the lattice may now be written as\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\{ij\\} (\\mathrm{nn})} \\tfrac12 m \\omega^2 \\left(R_i - R_j\\right)^2.</math>\n\nHere, ''\u03c9'' is the [[natural frequency]] of the harmonic potentials, which are assumed to be the same since the lattice is regular. ''R<sub>i</sub>'' is the position coordinate of the ''i''th atom, which we now measure from its equilibrium position. The sum over nearest neighbors is denoted (nn).\n\n===Lattice waves===\n[[File:Lattice wave.svg|200px|thumb|right|Phonon propagating through a square lattice (atom displacements greatly exaggerated)]]\nDue to the connections between atoms, the displacement of one or more atoms from their equilibrium positions gives rise to a set of vibration [[wave]]s propagating through the lattice. One such wave is shown in the figure to the right. The [[amplitude]] of the wave is given by the displacements of the atoms from their equilibrium positions. The [[wavelength]] ''\u03bb'' is marked.\n\nThere is a minimum possible wavelength, given by twice the equilibrium separation ''a'' between atoms. Any wavelength shorter than this can be mapped onto a wavelength longer than 2''a'', due to the periodicity of the lattice. This can be thought as one consequence of [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]], the lattice points are viewed as the \"sampling points\" of a continuous wave.\n\nNot every possible lattice vibration has a well-defined wavelength and frequency. However, the [[normal mode]]s do possess well-defined wavelengths and [[frequency|frequencies]].\n\n===One-dimensional lattice===\n[[File:1D normal modes (280 kB).gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Animation showing the first 6 normal modes of a one-dimensional lattice: a linear chain of particles.

This model is complex enough to display the salient features of phonons.\n\n====Classical treatment====\nThe forces between the atoms are assumed to be linear and nearest-neighbour, and they are represented by an elastic spring.

This amounts to free scalar classical field theory.\n\n====Quantum treatment====\nA one-dimensional quantum mechanical harmonic chain consists of ''N'' identical atoms. This is the simplest quantum mechanical model of a lattice that allows phonons to arise from it. The formalism for this model is readily generalizable to two and three dimensions.\n\nIn some contrast to the previous section, the positions of the masses are not denoted by ''u<sub>i</sub>'', but, instead, by  ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>\u2026, as measured from their equilibrium positions (i.e. ''x<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 if particle ''i'' is at its equilibrium position.) In two or more dimensions, the ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are vector quantities. The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for this system is\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{p_i^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2} m\\omega^2 \\sum_{\\{ij\\} (\\mathrm{nn})} \\left(x_i - x_j\\right)^2</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is the mass of each atom (assuming it is equal for all), and ''x<sub>i</sub>'' and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' are the position and [[momentum]] operators, respectively, for the ''i''th atom and the sum is made over the nearest neighbors (nn). However one expects that in a lattice there could also appear waves that behave like particles. It is customary to deal with [[wave]]s in [[Fourier space]] which uses [[normal modes]] of the [[wavevector]] as variables instead coordinates of particles. The number of normal modes is same as the number of particles. However, the [[Fourier space]] is very useful given the [[Fourier series|periodicity]] of the system.\n\nA set of ''N'' \"normal coordinates\" ''Q<sub>k</sub>'' may be introduced, defined as the [[discrete Fourier transform]]s of the ''x<sub>k</sub>'' and ''N'' \"conjugate momenta\" ''\u03a0<sub>k</sub>'' defined as the Fourier transforms of the ''p<sub>k</sub>'':\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} Q_k &= \\frac{1}\\sqrt{N} \\sum_{l} e^{ikal} x_l \\\\ \\Pi_{k} &= \\frac{1}\\sqrt{N} \\sum_{l} e^{-ikal} p_l. \\end{align}</math>\n\nThe quantity ''k<sub>n</sub>'' turns out to be the [[wavenumber]] of the phonon, i.e. 2{{pi}} divided by the [[wavelength]].\n\nThis choice retains the desired commutation relations in either real space or wavevector space\n\n: <math> \\begin{align} \n\\left[x_l , p_m \\right]&=i\\hbar\\delta_{l,m} \\\\ \n\\left[ Q_k , \\Pi_{k'} \\right] &=\\frac{1}N \\sum_{l,m} e^{ikal} e^{-ik'am} \\left[x_l , p_m \\right] \\\\\n &= \\frac{i \\hbar}N \\sum_{l} e^{ial\\left(k-k'\\right)} = i\\hbar\\delta_{k,k'} \\\\\n\\left[ Q_k , Q_{k'} \\right] &= \\left[ \\Pi_k , \\Pi_{k'} \\right] = 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFrom the general result\n\n: <math> \\begin{align} \n\\sum_{l}x_l x_{l+m}&=\\frac{1}N\\sum_{kk'}Q_k Q_{k'}\\sum_{l} e^{ial\\left(k+k'\\right)}e^{iamk'}= \\sum_{k}Q_k Q_{-k}e^{iamk} \\\\ \n\\sum_{l}{p_l}^2 &= \\sum_{k}\\Pi_k \\Pi_{-k}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe potential energy term is\n: <math> \\tfrac12 m \\omega^2 \\sum_{j} \\left(x_j - x_{j+1}\\right)^2= \\tfrac12 m\\omega^2\\sum_{k}Q_k Q_{-k}(2-e^{ika}-e^{-ika})= \\tfrac12 \\sum_{k}m{\\omega_k}^2Q_k Q_{-k}</math>\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\omega_k = \\sqrt{2 \\omega^2 \\left( 1 - \\cos{ka} \\right)} = 2\\omega\\left|\\sin\\frac{ka}2\\right|</math>\n\nThe Hamiltonian may be written in wavevector space as\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_k \\left( \\Pi_k\\Pi_{-k} + m^2 \\omega_k^2 Q_k Q_{-k} \\right)</math>\n\nThe couplings between the position variables have been transformed away; if the ''Q'' and ''\u03a0'' were [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]] (which they are not), the transformed Hamiltonian would describe ''N'' uncoupled harmonic oscillators.\n\nThe form of the quantization depends on the choice of boundary conditions; for simplicity, ''periodic'' boundary conditions are imposed, defining the (''N''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)th atom as equivalent to the first atom. Physically, this corresponds to joining the chain at its ends. The resulting quantization is\n\n:<math>k=k_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{Na} \\quad \\mbox{for } n = 0, \\pm1, \\pm2, \\ldots \\pm \\frac{N}2 .\\ </math>\n\nThe upper bound to ''n'' comes from the minimum wavelength, which is twice the lattice spacing ''a'', as discussed above.\n\nThe harmonic oscillator eigenvalues or energy levels for the mode ''\u03c9<sub>k</sub>'' are:\n\n:<math>E_n = \\left(\\tfrac12+n\\right)\\hbar\\omega_k \\qquad n=0,1,2,3 \\ldots</math>\n\nThe levels are evenly spaced at:\n \n:<math>\\tfrac12\\hbar\\omega , \\ \\tfrac32\\hbar\\omega ,\\ \\tfrac52\\hbar\\omega \\ \\cdots</math>\n\nwhere {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u0127\u03c9'' is the [[zero-point energy]] of a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]].\n\nAn '''exact''' amount of [[energy]] ''\u0127\u03c9'' must be supplied to the harmonic oscillator lattice to push it to the next energy level. In comparison to the [[photon]] case when the [[electromagnetic field]] is quantized, the quantum of vibrational energy is called a phonon.\n\nAll quantum systems show wavelike and particlelike properties simultaneously. The particle-like properties of the phonon are best understood using the methods of [[second quantization]] and operator techniques described later.<ref name=\"Mahan\">{{cite book|last=Mahan|first=G. D.|title=Many-Particle Physics|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-46338-9|year=1981}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Canonical quantization#Real scalar field}}\n\n===Three-dimensional lattice===\nThis may be generalized to a three-dimensional lattice. The wavenumber ''k'' is replaced by a three-dimensional [[wavevector]] '''k'''. Furthermore, each '''k''' is now associated with three normal coordinates.\n\nThe new indices ''s'' = 1, 2, 3 label the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the phonons. In the one-dimensional model, the atoms were restricted to moving along the line, so the phonons corresponded to [[longitudinal wave]]s. In three dimensions, vibration is not restricted to the direction of propagation, and can also occur in the perpendicular planes, like [[transverse wave]]s. This gives rise to the additional normal coordinates, which, as the form of the Hamiltonian indicates, we may view as independent species of phonons.\n\n===Dispersion relation===\n[[File:Diatomic phonons.png|thumb|Dispersion curves in linear diatomic chain]]\n[[File:Optical & acoustic vibrations.png|thumb|250px|Optical and acoustic vibrations in a linear diatomic chain.]]\n[[File:Phonon dispersion relations in GaAs.png|thumb|250px|Dispersion relation ''\u03c9''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c9''('''k''') for some waves corresponding to lattice vibrations in GaAs.<ref name=Cardona/>]]\nFor a one-dimensional alternating array of two types of ion or atom of mass ''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub> repeated periodically at a distance ''a'', connected by springs of spring constant ''K'', two modes of vibration result:<ref name=Misra/>\n:<math>\\omega_\\pm^2 = K\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1} +\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right) \\pm K \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1} +\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right)^2-\\frac{4\\sin^2\\frac{ka}{2}}{m_1 m_2}} ,</math>\nwhere ''k'' is the wavevector of the vibration related to its wavelength by\n<math>k = \\tfrac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda}</math>.\n\nThe connection between frequency and wavevector, ''\u03c9''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c9''(''k''), is known as a [[dispersion relation]]. The plus sign results in the so-called ''optical'' mode, and the minus sign to the ''acoustic'' mode. In the optical mode two adjacent different atoms move against each other, while in the acoustic mode they move together.\n\nThe speed of propagation of an acoustic phonon, which is also the [[speed of sound]] in the lattice, is given by the slope of the acoustic dispersion relation, {{sfrac|\u2202''\u03c9<sub>k</sub>''|\u2202''k''}} (see [[group velocity]].) At low values of ''k'' (i.e. long wavelengths), the dispersion relation is almost linear, and the speed of sound is approximately ''\u03c9a'', independent of the phonon frequency. As a result, packets of phonons with different (but long) wavelengths can propagate for large distances across the lattice without breaking apart. This is the reason that sound propagates through solids without significant distortion. This behavior fails at large values of ''k'', i.e. short wavelengths, due to the microscopic details of the lattice.\n\nFor a crystal that has at least two atoms in its [[Wigner-Seitz cell#Primitive cell|primitive cell]], the dispersion relations exhibit two types of phonons, namely, optical and acoustic modes corresponding to the upper blue and lower red curve in the diagram, respectively. The vertical axis is the energy or frequency of phonon, while the horizontal axis is the [[wavevector]]. The boundaries at \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|''a''}} and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|''a''}} are those of the first [[Brillouin zone]].<ref name=Misra>{{cite book |title=Physics of Condensed Matter |first=Prasanta Kumar |last=Misra |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6rMISLVCmcC&pg=PA44 |pages=44 |chapter=\u00a72.1.3 Normal modes of a one-dimensional chain with a basis |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-384954-0 |year=2010}}</ref> A crystal with ''N''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;2 different atoms in the [[primitive cell]] exhibits three acoustic modes: one [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal acoustic mode]] and two [[Transverse wave|transverse acoustic modes]].

This is because fluids cannot support [[shear stress]]es (but see [[viscoelastic]] fluids, which only apply to high frequencies).\n\n===Interpretation of phonons using second quantization techniques===\nIn fact, the above-derived Hamiltonian looks like the classical Hamiltonian function, but if it is interpreted as an [[Operator (physics)|operator]], then it describes a [[quantum field theory]] of non-interacting [[boson]]s.\n\nThe [[energy]] [[Spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of this Hamiltonian is easily obtained by the method of ladder operators, similar to the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] problem. We introduce a set of ladder operators defined by:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\nb_k&=\\frac{1}\\sqrt{2}\\left(\\frac{Q_k}{l_k}+i\\frac{\\Pi_{-k}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{l_k}}\\right), &\\quad Q_k&=l_k\\frac{1}\\sqrt{2}\\left({b_k}^\\dagger+b_{-k}\\right) \\\\\n{b_k}^\\dagger&=\\frac{1}\\sqrt{2}\\left(\\frac{Q_{-k}}{l_k}-i\\frac{\\Pi_{k}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{l_k}}\\right), &\\quad \\Pi_k&=\\frac{\\hbar}{l_k}\\frac{i}\\sqrt{2}\\left({b_k}^\\dagger-b_{-k}\\right) \\\\\nl_k&=\\sqrt\\frac{\\hbar}{m\\omega_k} \\end{alignat}</math>\nBy direct insertion on the Hamiltonian, it is readily verified that{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} =\\sum_k \\hbar\\omega_k \\left({b_k}^\\dagger b_k+\\tfrac12\\right) ,\\quad \\left[b_k , {b_{k'}}^\\dagger \\right] = \\delta_{k,k'} ,\\quad \\Big[b_k , b_{k'} \\Big] = \\left[{b_k}^\\dagger , {b_{k'}}^\\dagger \\right] = 0.</math>\n\nAs with the quantum harmonic oscillator, one can show that ''b<sub>k</sub>''<sup>\u2020</sup> and ''b<sub>k</sub>'' respectively create and destroy one excitation of energy ''\u0127\u03c9<sub>k</sub>''. These excitations are phonons.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nTwo important properties of phonons may be deduced. Firstly, phonons are [[boson]]s, since any number of identical excitations can be created by repeated application of the creation operator ''b<sub>k</sub>''<sup>\u2020</sup>. Secondly, each phonon is a \"collective mode\" caused by the motion of every atom in the lattice. This may be seen from the fact that the ladder operators contain sums over the position and momentum operators of every atom.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIt is not ''a priori'' obvious that these excitations generated by the ''b'' operators are literally waves of lattice displacement, but one may convince oneself of this by calculating the ''position\u2013position [[correlation function]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Let {{ket|''k''}} denote a state with a single quantum of mode ''k'' excited, i.e.\n\n:<math>| k \\rangle = b_k^\\dagger | 0 \\rangle.</math>\n\nOne can show that, for any two atoms ''j'' and ''l'',\n\n:<math>\\langle k | x_j(t) x_l(0) | k \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{Nm\\omega_k} \\cos \\big( k(j-l)a - \\omega_k t \\big) + \\langle 0 | x_j(t) x_l(0) |0 \\rangle </math>\n\nwhich has the form of a lattice wave with frequency ''\u03c9<sub>k</sub>'' and wavenumber ''k''.\n\nIn three dimensions the Hamiltonian has the form\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\sum_k \\sum_{s = 1}^3 \\hbar \\, \\omega_{k,s}\n\\left( {b_{k,s}}^\\dagger b_{k,s} + \\tfrac12 \\right).</math>{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Acoustic and optical phonons==<!-- the links \"acoustic phonons\" and \"optical phonons\" from the article \"Photoluminescence\" links here -->\nSolids with more than one atom in the smallest [[unit cell]] exhibit two types of phonons: acoustic phonons and optical phonons.\n\n'''Acoustic phonons''' are coherent movements of atoms of the lattice out of their equilibrium positions. If the displacement is in the direction of propagation, then in some areas the atoms will be closer, in others farther apart, as in a sound wave in air (hence the name acoustic). Displacement perpendicular to the propagation direction is comparable to waves on a string. If the wavelength of acoustic phonons goes to infinity, this corresponds to a simple displacement of the whole crystal, and this costs zero deformation energy. Acoustic phonons exhibit a linear relationship between frequency and phonon wavevector for long wavelengths. The frequencies of acoustic phonons tend to zero with longer wavelength. Longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons are often abbreviated as LA and TA phonons, respectively.\n\n'''Optical phonons''' are out-of-phase movements of the atoms in the lattice, one atom moving to the left, and its neighbour to the right. This occurs if the lattice basis consists of two or more atoms. They are called ''optical'' because in ionic crystals, like [[sodium chloride]], they are excited by [[infrared radiation]]. The electric field of the light will move every positive sodium ion in the direction of the field, and every negative chloride ion in the other direction, sending the crystal vibrating.\n\nOptical phonons have a non-zero frequency at the [[Brillouin zone]] center and show no dispersion near that long wavelength limit. This is because they correspond to a mode of vibration where positive and negative ions at adjacent lattice sites swing against each other, creating a time-varying [[electrical dipole moment]]. Optical phonons that interact in this way with light are called ''infrared active''. Optical phonons that are ''Raman active'' can also interact indirectly with light, through [[Raman scattering]]. Optical phonons are often abbreviated as LO and TO phonons, for the longitudinal and transverse modes respectively; the splitting between LO and TO frequencies is often described accurately by the [[Lyddane\u2013Sachs\u2013Teller relation]].\n\nWhen measuring optical phonon energy experimentally, optical phonon frequencies are sometimes given in spectroscopic [[wavenumber]] notation, where the symbol ''\u03c9'' represents ordinary frequency (not angular frequency), and is expressed in units of [[Centimetre|cm]]<sup>\u22121</sup>. The value is obtained by dividing the frequency by the [[speed of light in vacuum]]. In other words, the wavenumber in cm<sup>\u22121</sup> units corresponds to the inverse of the [[wavelength]] of a [[photon]] in vacuum, that has the same frequency as the measured phonon.<ref name=\"cmian\">{{cite book | last = Mahan | first = Gerald | title = Condensed Matter in a Nutshell | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-691-14016-2 }}</ref>\n\n==Crystal momentum==\n{{Main article|Crystal momentum}}\n[[File:phonon k 3k.gif|right|thumb|250px|k-vectors exceeding the first Brillouin zone (red) do not carry any more information than their counterparts (black) in the first Brillouin zone.]]\nBy analogy to [[photon]]s and [[De Broglie wavelength|matter waves]], phonons have been treated with wavevector ''k'' as though it has a [[momentum]] ''\u0127k'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Solid State Physics, 8th Edition|last=Kittel|first=Charles|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=978-0-471-41526-8|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780471415268/page/100 100]|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780471415268/page/100}}</ref> however, this is not strictly correct, because ''\u0127k'' is not actually a physical momentum; it is called the ''crystal momentum'' or ''pseudomomentum''. This is because ''k'' is only determined up to addition of constant vectors (the [[reciprocal lattice|reciprocal lattice vector]]s and integer multiples thereof). For example, in the one-dimensional model, the normal coordinates ''Q'' and ''\u03a0'' are defined so that\n:<math>Q_k \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} Q_{k+K} ;\\quad \\Pi_k \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\Pi_{k + K}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>K = \\frac{2n\\pi}{a}</math>\n\nfor any integer ''n''. A phonon with wavenumber ''k'' is thus equivalent to an infinite family of phonons with wavenumbers ''k''&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;{{sfrac|2{{pi}}|''a''}}, ''k''&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;{{sfrac|4{{pi}}|''a''}}, and so forth. Physically, the reciprocal lattice vectors act as additional chunks of momentum which the lattice can impart to the phonon. [[Bloch wave|Bloch electron]]s obey a similar set of restrictions.\n\n[[File:Brillouin zone.svg|thumb|Brillouin zones, (a) in a square lattice, and (b) in a hexagonal lattice]]\nIt is usually convenient to consider phonon wavevectors ''k'' which have the smallest magnitude |''k''| in their \"family\". The set of all such wavevectors defines the ''first [[Brillouin zone]]''. Additional Brillouin zones may be defined as copies of the first zone, shifted by some reciprocal lattice vector.\n\n==Thermodynamics==\nThe [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties of a solid are directly related to its phonon structure. The entire set of all possible phonons that are described by the phonon dispersion relations combine in what is known as the phonon [[density of states]] which determines the [[heat capacity]] of a crystal.  By the nature of this distribution, the heat capacity is dominated by the high-frequency part of the distribution, while thermal conductivity is primarily the result of the low-frequency region.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nAt [[absolute zero]] temperature, a crystal lattice lies in its [[ground state]], and contains no phonons. A lattice at a nonzero [[temperature]] has an energy that is not constant, but fluctuates [[random]]ly about some [[Arithmetic mean|mean value]]. These energy fluctuations are caused by random lattice vibrations, which can be viewed as a gas of phonons. Because these phonons are generated by the temperature of the lattice, they are sometimes designated thermal phonons.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThermal phonons can be created and destroyed by random energy fluctuations. In the language of statistical mechanics this means that the chemical potential for adding a phonon is zero. This behavior is an extension of the harmonic potential into the anharmonic regime. The behavior of thermal phonons is similar to the [[photon gas]] produced by an [[electromagnetic cavity]], wherein photons may be emitted or absorbed by the cavity walls. This similarity is not coincidental, for it turns out that the electromagnetic field behaves like a set of harmonic oscillators, giving rise to [[Black-body radiation]]. Both gases obey the [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]]: in thermal equilibrium and within the harmonic regime, the probability of finding phonons or photons in a given state with a given angular frequency is:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pathria |last2=Beale |title=Statistical Mechanics |date=2011 |publisher=Elsevier |location=India |isbn=978-93-80931-89-0 |page=201 |edition=3}}</ref>\n\n:<math>n\\left(\\omega_{k,s}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\dfrac{\\hbar\\omega_{k,s}}{k_\\mathrm{B}T}\\right) - 1}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c9''<sub>''k'',''s''</sub> is the frequency of the phonons (or photons) in the state, ''k''<sub>B</sub> is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and ''T'' is the temperature.\n\n===Heat flow in nanometer-wide gaps===\nThe idea of [[quantum tunneling]] applied to phonons produces the idea of ''phonon tunneling'', where across nanometer-wide gaps, heat can transfer between materials from phonon that \"tunnel\" between the two materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2015/phonon-tunneling-heat-flow-nanometer-gaps-0407|title=Tunneling across a tiny gap|website=News.mit.edu|accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref> The type of heat transfer works between distances too large for [[Thermal conduction| conduction]] to occur but too small for [[thermal radiation| radiation]] to occur.\n\n==Operator formalism==\nThe phonon Hamiltonian is given by\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\tfrac12 \\sum_\\alpha\\left(p_\\alpha^2 + \\omega^2_\\alpha q_\\alpha^2 -\\tfrac12 \\hbar\\omega_\\alpha\\right)</math>\nIn terms of the operators, these are given by\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\sum_\\alpha\\hbar\\omega_\\alpha {a_\\alpha}^\\dagger a_\\alpha</math>\nHere, in expressing the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] in operator formalism, we have not taken into account the {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u0127\u03c9<sub>q</sub>'' term, since if we take an infinite lattice or, for that matter a continuum, the {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u0127\u03c9<sub>q</sub>'' terms will add up giving an infinity. Hence, it is \"renormalized\" by putting the factor of {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u0127\u03c9<sub>q</sub>'' to 0 arguing that the difference in energy is what we measure and not the absolute value of it. Hence, the {{sfrac|1|2}}''\u0127\u03c9<sub>q</sub>'' factor is absent in the operator formalised expression for the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]].\n\nThe ground state also called the \"vacuum state\" is the state composed of no phonons. Hence, the energy of the ground state is 0. When, a system is in state {{ket|''n''<sub>1</sub>''n''<sub>2</sub>''n''<sub>3</sub>\u2026}}, we say there are ''n<sub>\u03b1</sub>'' phonons of type ''\u03b1''. The ''n<sub>\u03b1</sub>'' are called the occupation number of the phonons. Energy of a single phonon of type ''\u03b1'' being ''\u0127\u03c9<sub>q</sub>'', the total energy of a general phonon system is given by ''n''<sub>1</sub>''\u0127\u03c9''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''<sub>2</sub>''\u0127\u03c9''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+\u2026. In other words, the phonons are non-interacting.
