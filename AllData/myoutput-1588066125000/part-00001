placed Ebner's chances of making the team at \"10 or 20 percent.\" However, after strong showings in the [[2016 Hong Kong Sevens|Hong Kong]] and [[2016 Singapore Sevens|Singapore]] events on the [[2015\u201316 World Rugby Sevens Series|World Rugby Sevens]] circuit, Friday said, \"He has a 50:50 chance now but if he stays on this trajectory then it's only going one way and that's up.\" Friday added that Ebner played a critical role in improving the team's on-field communication. According to Friday, one of Ebner's first questions upon arriving at the USA training camp was whether the team had a \"comms book.\" Friday was unfamiliar with the term, and Ebner pointed out that the Patriots provide all players with a manual of common on-field language, with all terms tightly defined. While the sevens team had operated with a set of common words, Friday and the rest of the coaching staff analyzed the team's communications and found that many players had different definitions for the same term. In the interview, Friday indicated, \"That's exactly what I wanted from Nate. From being a newbie in the environment, he'd recognised an area we could improve.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/15228148/usa-sevens-mike-friday-nate-ebner-right-track-feature-rio-2016 |title=Nate Ebner on right path for Olympics, says USA coach Mike Friday |first=Tom |last=Hamilton |publisher=[[ESPN (UK)]] |date=April 19, 2016 |accessdate=April 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEbner's efforts proved successful: in July 2016 he was named to the 2016 US rugby sevens team.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pengelly|first1=Martin|title=NFL player Nate Ebner selected for US Olympic rugby sevens squad|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/18/nate-ebner-usa-rugby-sevens-olympic-games|website=The Guardian|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}</ref> While with the rugby team, the Patriots received a roster exemption for Ebner, so he did not count against the Patriots' 90-man limit for training camp.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.masslive.com/patriots/2016/07/new_england_patriots_roster_mo_14.html|title=New England Patriots roster moves: Nate Ebner gets exemption, team adds two veterans|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 2016 Summer Olympics ===\nEbner played in the team's first two matches, a 17\u201314 loss to Argentina and a 26\u20130 shutout of host Brazil.

added that Ebner played a critical role in improving the team's on-field communication. According to Friday, one of Ebner's first questions upon arriving at the USA training camp was whether the team had a \"comms book.\" Friday was unfamiliar with the term, and Ebner pointed out that the Patriots provide all players with a manual of common on-field language, with all terms tightly defined. While the sevens team had operated with a set of common words, Friday and the rest of the coaching staff analyzed the team's communications and found that many players had different definitions for the same term.

During the latter match, Ebner scored a try in the first half, and was sent to the [[sin bin]] for two minutes in the second half for an illegal tackle. Playing against Fiji in the final pool match, Ebner scored a try to make the score 24\u201319 in favor of Fiji with just over one minute to play, but the Eagles were unable to score the conversion. As a result, the US team fell two points (in scoring differential) short of advancing to medal play; they ultimately finished ninth.\n\nDuring the Patriots' 2018 offseason, Ebner served as an in-studio analyst for NBC Sports' coverage of the [[2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/sports/20180814/pats-nate-ebner-glad-to-be-back-on-football-field|title=Pats' Nate Ebner glad to be back on football field|last=Gazette|first=RICH GARVEN The Worcester Telegram &|work=capecodtimes.com|access-date=August 17, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 Ebner became a minority owner in the [[New England Free Jacks]], a [[Major League Rugby]] team, as did his Patriot teammate [[Patrick Chung]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nesn.com/2020/02/how-patriots-nate-ebner-patrick-chung-became-part-owners-of-pro-rugby-team/|title=How Patriots\u2019 Nate Ebner, Patrick Chung Became Part Owners Of Pro Rugby Team {{!}} New England Patriots {{!}} NESN.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Jews in sports#Football (American)|List of select Jewish football players]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Twitter|NateEbner|Nate Ebner}}\n* [http://instagram.com/ebs43 Nate Ebner on Instagram]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160813032041/http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/ebner_nate00.html Ohio State Buckeyes bio]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140315145401/http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Nate-Ebner/16aa96d1-761d-4f21-8f07-4f40afd136d3 New England Patriots bio]\n* [http://itiswhatitis.weei.com/sports/newengland/football/patriots/2012/04/28/nate-ebners-qa-with-the-new-england-media-on-saturday-afternoon/ Nate Ebner\u2019s Q&A with the New England media], April 28, 2012\n* {{SR/Olympics profile|eb/nate-ebner-1}}\n\n{{USA 2016 Summer Olympics Squad}}\n{{Patriots2012DraftPicks}}\n{{Super Bowl XLIX}}\n{{Super Bowl LI}}\n{{Super Bowl LIII}}\n{{New York Giants roster navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ebner, Nate}}\n[[Category:1988 births]]\n[[Category:American football safeties]]\n[[Category:American rugby union players]]\n[[Category:Footballers who switched code]]\n[[Category:Jewish American sportspeople]]\n[[Category:Jewish rugby union players]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Male rugby sevens players]]\n[[Category:New England Patriots players]]\n[[Category:New York Giants players]]\n[[Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football players]]\n[[Category:Ohio State Buckeyes rugby]]\n[[Category:Olympic rugby sevens players of the United States]]\n[[Category:People from Mason, Ohio]]\n[[Category:People from Dublin, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from Ohio]]\n[[Category:Rugby sevens players at the 2016 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Columbus, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Super Bowl champions]]\n[[Category:United States international rugby sevens players]]\n[[Category:Rugby union players that played in the NFL]]\n[[Category:Olympic rugby sevens players of the National Football League]]\n", "name_user": "KristofferAG", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Ebner"}
