From that time on, until the script was supplanted by an early version of Coptic (about the 3rd and 4th centuries AD), the system remained virtually unchanged. Even the number of signs used remained constant at about 700 for more than 2,000 years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hieroglyph {{!}} writing character |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/265009/hieroglyph |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=5 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Egyptian===\n\nMiddle Egyptian was spoken for about 700 years, beginning around 2000 BC.<ref name=\"l5\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=5}}</ref> As the classical variant of Egyptian, Middle Egyptian is the best-documented variety of the language, and has attracted the most attention by far from [[Egyptology]].

The first grammar of Middle Egyptian was published by [[Adolf Erman]] in 1894, surpassed in 1927 by [[Alan Gardiner]]'s  work.

This transition was taking place in the later period of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]] (known as the [[Amarna Period]]). \nMiddle Egyptian was retained as a literary [[standard language]], and in this usage survived until the Christianisation of [[Roman Egypt]] in the 4th century.\n\n===Late Egyptian===\n[[Late Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]], appearing around 1350 BC, is represented by a large body of religious and secular [[Ancient Egyptian literature|literature]], comprising such examples as the ''[[Story of Wenamun]]'', the love poems of the Chester\u2013Beatty I  papyrus, and the ''[[Instruction of Any]]''. [[Sebayt|Instructions]] became a popular literary genre of the New Kingdom, which took the form of advice on proper behavior.

It survived into the medieval period, but by the 16th century was dwindling rapidly due to the persecution of Coptic Christians under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]]. It probably survived in the Egyptian countryside as a spoken language for several centuries after that.

There was also a form of [[cursive hieroglyphs]], used for religious documents on papyrus, such as the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]; it was simpler to write than the hieroglyphs in stone inscriptions, but it was not as cursive as hieratic and lacked the wide use of [[typographic ligature#History|ligatures]]. Additionally, there was a variety of stone-cut hieratic, known as \"lapidary hieratic\".{{cn|date=January 2019}}\nIn the language's final stage of development, the [[Coptic alphabet]] replaced the older writing system.\n\nHieroglyphs are employed in two ways in Egyptian texts: as [[ideogram]]s to represent the idea depicted by the pictures and, more commonly, as [[phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]] to represent their [[phonetics|phonetic]] value.\n\nAs the phonetic realisation of Egyptian cannot be known with certainty, Egyptologists use a system of [[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|transliteration]] to denote each sound that could be represented by a uniliteral hieroglyph.<ref name=\"a13\">{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2000|p=13}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Further|Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian}}\nWhile the consonantal phonology of the Egyptian language may be reconstructed, the exact [[phonetics]] are unknown, and there are varying opinions on how to classify the individual phonemes. In addition, because Egyptian is recorded over a full 2000 years, the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates [[Old Latin]] from [[Italian language|Modern Italian]], significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time frame.\n\nPhonologically, Egyptian contrasted labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal consonants. Egyptian also contrasted voiceless and emphatic consonants, as with other Afroasiatic languages, but exactly how the emphatic consonants were realised is unknown. Early research had assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing, but it is now thought to be either one of [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] and [[emphatic consonant]]s, as in many Semitic languages, or one of [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[ejective consonant]]s, as in many [[Cushitic languages]].<ref>See ''Egyptian Phonology'', by Carsten Peust, for a review of the history of thinking on the subject; his reconstructions of words are nonstandard.</ref>\n\nSince vowels were not written until Coptic, reconstructions of the Egyptian vowel system are much more uncertain and rely mainly on evidence from Coptic and records of Egyptian words, especially proper nouns, in other languages/writing systems. Also, scribal errors provide evidence of changes in pronunciation over time.\n\nThe actual pronunciations reconstructed by such means are used only by a few specialists in the language. For all other purposes, the Egyptological pronunciation is used, but it often bears little resemblance to what is known of how Egyptian was pronounced.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following consonants are reconstructed for Archaic (before 2600 BC) and Old Egyptian (2686\u20132181 BC), with IPA equivalents in square brackets if they differ from the usual transcription scheme:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''Early Egyptian consonants'''<ref name=\"l33\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=33}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=2 |\n!

Two consonants, alef and ayin, are generally pronounced {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}}. Yodh is pronounced {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, ''w'' {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Between other consonants, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is then inserted. Thus, for example, the name of an Egyptian king is most accurately transliterated as ''R\ua725-ms-sw'' and transcribed as \"R\u0251m\u025bssu\"; it means \"[[Ra]] has Fashioned (literally, \"Borne\") Him\".\n\nIn [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|i}}, and {{angbr|u}} all represent consonants; for example, the name [[Tutankhamun]] (1341\u20131323 BC) was written in Egyptian as ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn''. Experts have assigned generic sounds to these values as a matter of convenience, which is an artificial pronunciation and should not be mistaken for how Egyptian was ever pronounced at any time. For example, the name ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn'' is conventionally pronounced {{IPAc-en|t|u\u02d0|t|\u0259n|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|m|\u0259|n}} in English, but, in his lifetime, it was likely to be pronounced something like *{{IPA-sem|ta\u02c8wa\u02d0t \u02c8\u0295a\u02d0nxu \u0294a\u02c8ma\u02d0n|}}.<ref>Fecht, Gerhard, ''Wortakzent und Silbenstruktur: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der \u00e4gyptischen Sprache'', J.

Larger roots are also common and can have up to five consonants: ''s\u1e2bd\u1e2bd'' \"be upside-down\".\n\nVowels and other consonants are added to the root to derive different meanings, as Arabic, Hebrew, and other Afroasiatic languages still do. However, because vowels and sometimes glides are not written in any Egyptian script except Coptic, it can be difficult to reconstruct the actual forms of words. Thus, orthographic {{angbr|stp}} \"to choose\", for example, can represent the [[stative]] (whose endings can be left unexpressed), the [[imperfective]] forms or even a [[verbal noun]] (\"a choosing\").\n\n===Nouns===\nEgyptian [[noun]]s can be masculine or feminine (the latter is indicated, as with other Afroasiatic languages, by adding a ''-t'') and singular or plural (''-w / -wt''), or dual (''-wy / -ty'').\n\n[[Article (grammar)|Article]]s, both definite and indefinite, do not occur until Late Egyptian but are used widely thereafter.\n\n===Pronouns===\nEgyptian has three different types of [[personal pronoun]]s: suffix, [[clitic|enclitic]] (called \"dependent\" by Egyptologists) and independent pronouns. There are also a number of verbal endings added to the [[infinitive]] to form the stative and are regarded by some linguists<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=65}}</ref> as a \"fourth\" set of personal pronouns. They bear close resemblance to their Semitic counterparts. The three main sets of personal pronouns are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!\n!Suffix\n!Dependent\n!Independent\n|-\n!1st sg.\n|''-\u0131\u0357''\n|''w\u0131\u0357''\n|''\u0131\u0357nk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. m.\n|''-k''\n|''tw''\n|''ntk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. f.\n|''-t''\n|''tn''\n|''ntt''\n|-\n!3rd sg. m.\n|''-f''\n|''sw''\n|''ntf''\n|-\n!3rd sg. f.\n|''-s''\n|''sy''\n|''nts''\n|-\n!1st pl.\n|''-n''\n|''n''\n|''\u0131\u0357nn''\n|-\n!2nd pl.\n|''-tn''\n|''tn''\n|''nttn''\n|-\n!3rd pl.\n|''-sn''\n|''sn''\n|''ntsn''\n|}\n\nDemonstrative pronouns have separate masculine and feminine singular forms and common plural forms for both genders:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Mas.\n!Fem.\n!Plu.\n!Meaning\n|-\n|''pn''\n|''tn''\n|''nn''\n|this, that, these, those\n|-\n|''pf''\n|''tf''\n|''nf''\n|that, those\n|-\n|''pw''\n|''tw''\n|''nw''\n|this, that, these, those (archaic)\n|-\n|''p\ua723''\n|''t\ua723''\n|''n\ua723''\n|this, that, these, those (colloquial [earlier] & Late Egyptian)\n|}\n\nFinally are interrogative pronouns. They bear a close resemblance to their Semitic and [[Berber language|Berber]] counterparts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Pronoun\n!Meaning\n!Dependency\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|who / what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''ptr''\n|who / what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''i\u1e2b''\n|what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357\u0161st''\n|what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''z\u0131\u0357''\n|which\n|Independent & Dependent\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\nEgyptian verbs have finite and non-finite forms.\n\nFinite verbs convey [[Grammatical person|person]], tense/[[Lexical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. Each is indicated by a set of [[affix]]al morphemes attached to the verb: the basic conjugation is ''s\u1e0fm.f'' \"he hears\".\n\nNon-finite verbs occur without a subject and are the infinitive, the [[participle]]s and the negative infinitive, which ''[[Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs]]'' calls \"negatival complement\". There are two main tenses/aspects in Egyptian: [[past tense|past]] and temporally-unmarked [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] and [[aorist]] forms. The latter are determined from their [[syntax|syntactic]] context.\n\n===Adjectives===\n[[Adjective]]s agree in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and number with the nouns they modify: ''s nfr''  \"(the) good man\" and ''st nfrt''  \"(the) good woman\".\n\nAttributive adjectives in phrases are after the nouns they modify: \"(the) great god\" (''n\u1e6fr \ua725\ua723'').\n\nHowever, when they are used independently as a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] in an [[adjectival phrase]], as \"(the) god (is) great\"  (''\ua725\ua723 n\u1e6fr'') (literally, \"great (is the) god\"), adjectives precede the nouns they modify.\n\n===Prepositions===\nEgyptian uses [[preposition]]s, as in English and many other Indo-European languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''m''\n|\"in, as, with, from\"\n|-\n|''n''\n|\"to, for\"\n|-\n|''r''\n|\"to, at\"\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357n''\n|\"by\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25n\ua725''\n|\"with\"\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"like\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25r''\n|\"on, upon\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25\ua723''\n|\"behind, around\"\n|-\n|''\u1e96r''\n|\"under\"\n|-\n|''tp''\n|\"atop\"\n|-\n|''\u1e0fr''\n|\"since\"\n|}\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs, in Egyptian, are at the end of a sentence: in ''z\u0131\u0357.n n\u1e6fr \u0131\u0357m'' \"the god went there\", \"there\" (''\u0131\u0357m'') is the adverb. Here are some other common Egyptian adverbs:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''\ua725\ua723''\n|\"here\"\n|-\n|''\u1e6fn\u0131\u0357''\n|\"where\"\n|-\n|''zy-nw''\n|\"when\" (lit. \"what moment\")\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357-\u0131\u0357\u1e2b''\n|\"how\"  (lit. \"like-what\")\n|-\n|''r-m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"why\"  (lit. \"for what\")\n|-\n|''\u1e2bnt''\n|\"before\"\n|}\n\n==Syntax==\nOld Egyptian, Classical Egyptian, and Middle Egyptian have [[verb-subject-object]] as the basic [[word order]]. However, that changed in the later stages of the language, including Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.\n\nThe equivalent to \"the man opens the door\" would be a sentence that would correspond, in the language's earlier stages, to \"opens the man the door\" (''wn s \ua725\ua723''). The so-called [[status constructus|construct state]] combines two or more nouns to express the [[genitive]], as in Semitic and [[Berber languages]].\n\nThe early stages of Egyptian have no articles, but the later forms use ''p\ua723'', ''t\ua723'' and ''n\ua723''. As with other Afroasiatic languages, Egyptian uses two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. It also uses three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural. However, later Egyptian has a tendency to lose the dual as a productive form.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see|Coptic language#Influence on other languages}}\n\nThe Egyptian language survived into the early modern period in the form of the [[Coptic language]]. Coptic survived past the 16th century only as an isolated vernacular.\n\nHowever, in antiquity, Egyptian exerted some influence on [[Classical Greek]], so that a number of Egyptian loanwords into Greek survive into modern usage. Examples include \n''[[:wikt:ebony|ebony]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\udf41\ud80c\ude16\ud80c\udfed\ud80c\uddb1 ''hbny'', via Greek and then Latin), \n''[[:wikt:ivory|ivory]]'' (Egyptian ''\ua723bw'', literally \"ivory, elephant\"),\n''[[:wikt:natron|natron]]'' (via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:lily|lily]]'' (Coptic ''hl\u0113ri'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:ibis|ibis]]'' (Egyptian ''hbj'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:oasis|oasis]]'' (Demotic ''w\u1e25j'', via Greek),\nperhaps ''[[:wikt:barge|barge]]'' (Greek [[Wikt:\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2|\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2]] ''baris'' \"Egyptian boat\" from Coptic \u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89 ''ba\u0294r\u0259'' \"small boat\" from Egyptian [[Wikt:b\ua723jr|b\ua723jr]] ),\nand possibly ''[[:wikt:cat|cat]]'';<ref>Often assumed to represent the precursor of Coptic \u03e3\u2c81\u2ca9 (''\u0161au'' \"tomcat\") suffixed with feminine ''-t'', but some authorities dispute this, e.g. John Huehnergard, \"Qitta: Arabic Cats\", ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms'' (2007).</ref> and of course a number of terms and proper names directly associated with [[Ancient Egypt]], such as\n''[[:wikt:pharaoh|pharaoh]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\ude50\ud80c\ude7b ''pr-\ua725\ua723'', literally \"great house\", transmitted via Hebrew and Greek). The [[Name of Egypt|name ''Egypt'']] itself is etymologically identical to that of the ''[[Copts]]'', ultimately from the [[Late Egyptian]] name of [[Memphis (Egypt)|Memphis]], ''Hikuptah'', a continuation of Middle Egyptian ''{{transl|egy|[[wikt:\u1e25wt-k\ua723-pt\u1e25|\u1e25wt-k\ua723-pt\u1e25]]}}''  \"temple of the [[Egyptian soul|ka (soul)]] of [[Ptah]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Hoffmeier|first =James K|title =Rameses of the Exodus narratives is the 13th B.C.

There was also a form of [[cursive hieroglyphs]], used for religious documents on papyrus, such as the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]; it was simpler to write than the hieroglyphs in stone inscriptions, but it was not as cursive as hieratic and lacked the wide use of [[typographic ligature#History|ligatures]]. Additionally, there was a variety of stone-cut hieratic, known as \"lapidary hieratic\".{{cn|date=January 2019}}\nIn the language's final stage of development, the [[Coptic alphabet]] replaced the older writing system.\n\nHieroglyphs are employed in two ways in Egyptian texts: as [[ideogram]]s to represent the idea depicted by the pictures and, more commonly, as [[phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]] to represent their [[phonetics|phonetic]] value.\n\nAs the phonetic realisation of Egyptian cannot be known with certainty, Egyptologists use a system of [[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|transliteration]] to denote each sound that could be represented by a uniliteral hieroglyph.<ref name=\"a13\">{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2000|p=13}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Further|Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian}}\nWhile the consonantal phonology of the Egyptian language may be reconstructed, the exact [[phonetics]] are unknown, and there are varying opinions on how to classify the individual phonemes. In addition, because Egyptian is recorded over a full 2000 years, the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates [[Old Latin]] from [[Italian language|Modern Italian]], significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time frame.\n\nPhonologically, Egyptian contrasted labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal consonants. Egyptian also contrasted voiceless and emphatic consonants, as with other Afroasiatic languages, but exactly how the emphatic consonants were realised is unknown. Early research had assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing, but it is now thought to be either one of [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] and [[emphatic consonant]]s, as in many Semitic languages, or one of [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[ejective consonant]]s, as in many [[Cushitic languages]].<ref>See ''Egyptian Phonology'', by Carsten Peust, for a review of the history of thinking on the subject; his reconstructions of words are nonstandard.</ref>\n\nSince vowels were not written until Coptic, reconstructions of the Egyptian vowel system are much more uncertain and rely mainly on evidence from Coptic and records of Egyptian words, especially proper nouns, in other languages/writing systems. Also, scribal errors provide evidence of changes in pronunciation over time.\n\nThe actual pronunciations reconstructed by such means are used only by a few specialists in the language. For all other purposes, the Egyptological pronunciation is used, but it often bears little resemblance to what is known of how Egyptian was pronounced.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following consonants are reconstructed for Archaic (before 2600 BC) and Old Egyptian (2686\u20132181 BC), with IPA equivalents in square brackets if they differ from the usual transcription scheme:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''Early Egyptian consonants'''<ref name=\"l33\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=33}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=2 |\n!

Two consonants, alef and ayin, are generally pronounced {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}}. Yodh is pronounced {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, ''w'' {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Between other consonants, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is then inserted. Thus, for example, the name of an Egyptian king is most accurately transliterated as ''R\ua725-ms-sw'' and transcribed as \"R\u0251m\u025bssu\"; it means \"[[Ra]] has Fashioned (literally, \"Borne\") Him\".\n\nIn [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|i}}, and {{angbr|u}} all represent consonants; for example, the name [[Tutankhamun]] (1341\u20131323 BC) was written in Egyptian as ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn''. Experts have assigned generic sounds to these values as a matter of convenience, which is an artificial pronunciation and should not be mistaken for how Egyptian was ever pronounced at any time. For example, the name ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn'' is conventionally pronounced {{IPAc-en|t|u\u02d0|t|\u0259n|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|m|\u0259|n}} in English, but, in his lifetime, it was likely to be pronounced something like *{{IPA-sem|ta\u02c8wa\u02d0t \u02c8\u0295a\u02d0nxu \u0294a\u02c8ma\u02d0n|}}.<ref>Fecht, Gerhard, ''Wortakzent und Silbenstruktur: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der \u00e4gyptischen Sprache'', J.

Larger roots are also common and can have up to five consonants: ''s\u1e2bd\u1e2bd'' \"be upside-down\".\n\nVowels and other consonants are added to the root to derive different meanings, as Arabic, Hebrew, and other Afroasiatic languages still do. However, because vowels and sometimes glides are not written in any Egyptian script except Coptic, it can be difficult to reconstruct the actual forms of words. Thus, orthographic {{angbr|stp}} \"to choose\", for example, can represent the [[stative]] (whose endings can be left unexpressed), the [[imperfective]] forms or even a [[verbal noun]] (\"a choosing\").\n\n===Nouns===\nEgyptian [[noun]]s can be masculine or feminine (the latter is indicated, as with other Afroasiatic languages, by adding a ''-t'') and singular or plural (''-w / -wt''), or dual (''-wy / -ty'').\n\n[[Article (grammar)|Article]]s, both definite and indefinite, do not occur until Late Egyptian but are used widely thereafter.\n\n===Pronouns===\nEgyptian has three different types of [[personal pronoun]]s: suffix, [[clitic|enclitic]] (called \"dependent\" by Egyptologists) and independent pronouns. There are also a number of verbal endings added to the [[infinitive]] to form the stative and are regarded by some linguists<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=65}}</ref> as a \"fourth\" set of personal pronouns. They bear close resemblance to their Semitic counterparts. The three main sets of personal pronouns are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!\n!Suffix\n!Dependent\n!Independent\n|-\n!1st sg.\n|''-\u0131\u0357''\n|''w\u0131\u0357''\n|''\u0131\u0357nk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. m.\n|''-k''\n|''tw''\n|''ntk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. f.\n|''-t''\n|''tn''\n|''ntt''\n|-\n!3rd sg. m.\n|''-f''\n|''sw''\n|''ntf''\n|-\n!3rd sg. f.\n|''-s''\n|''sy''\n|''nts''\n|-\n!1st pl.\n|''-n''\n|''n''\n|''\u0131\u0357nn''\n|-\n!2nd pl.\n|''-tn''\n|''tn''\n|''nttn''\n|-\n!3rd pl.\n|''-sn''\n|''sn''\n|''ntsn''\n|}\n\nDemonstrative pronouns have separate masculine and feminine singular forms and common plural forms for both genders:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Mas.\n!Fem.\n!Plu.\n!Meaning\n|-\n|''pn''\n|''tn''\n|''nn''\n|this, that, these, those\n|-\n|''pf''\n|''tf''\n|''nf''\n|that, those\n|-\n|''pw''\n|''tw''\n|''nw''\n|this, that, these, those (archaic)\n|-\n|''p\ua723''\n|''t\ua723''\n|''n\ua723''\n|this, that, these, those (colloquial [earlier] & Late Egyptian)\n|}\n\nFinally are interrogative pronouns. They bear a close resemblance to their Semitic and [[Berber language|Berber]] counterparts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Pronoun\n!Meaning\n!Dependency\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|who / what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''ptr''\n|who / what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''i\u1e2b''\n|what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357\u0161st''\n|what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''z\u0131\u0357''\n|which\n|Independent & Dependent\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\nEgyptian verbs have finite and non-finite forms.\n\nFinite verbs convey [[Grammatical person|person]], tense/[[Lexical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. Each is indicated by a set of [[affix]]al morphemes attached to the verb: the basic conjugation is ''s\u1e0fm.f'' \"he hears\".\n\nNon-finite verbs occur without a subject and are the infinitive, the [[participle]]s and the negative infinitive, which ''[[Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs]]'' calls \"negatival complement\". There are two main tenses/aspects in Egyptian: [[past tense|past]] and temporally-unmarked [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] and [[aorist]] forms. The latter are determined from their [[syntax|syntactic]] context.\n\n===Adjectives===\n[[Adjective]]s agree in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and number with the nouns they modify: ''s nfr''  \"(the) good man\" and ''st nfrt''  \"(the) good woman\".\n\nAttributive adjectives in phrases are after the nouns they modify: \"(the) great god\" (''n\u1e6fr \ua725\ua723'').\n\nHowever, when they are used independently as a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] in an [[adjectival phrase]], as \"(the) god (is) great\"  (''\ua725\ua723 n\u1e6fr'') (literally, \"great (is the) god\"), adjectives precede the nouns they modify.\n\n===Prepositions===\nEgyptian uses [[preposition]]s, as in English and many other Indo-European languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''m''\n|\"in, as, with, from\"\n|-\n|''n''\n|\"to, for\"\n|-\n|''r''\n|\"to, at\"\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357n''\n|\"by\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25n\ua725''\n|\"with\"\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"like\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25r''\n|\"on, upon\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25\ua723''\n|\"behind, around\"\n|-\n|''\u1e96r''\n|\"under\"\n|-\n|''tp''\n|\"atop\"\n|-\n|''\u1e0fr''\n|\"since\"\n|}\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs, in Egyptian, are at the end of a sentence: in ''z\u0131\u0357.n n\u1e6fr \u0131\u0357m'' \"the god went there\", \"there\" (''\u0131\u0357m'') is the adverb. Here are some other common Egyptian adverbs:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''\ua725\ua723''\n|\"here\"\n|-\n|''\u1e6fn\u0131\u0357''\n|\"where\"\n|-\n|''zy-nw''\n|\"when\" (lit. \"what moment\")\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357-\u0131\u0357\u1e2b''\n|\"how\"  (lit. \"like-what\")\n|-\n|''r-m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"why\"  (lit. \"for what\")\n|-\n|''\u1e2bnt''\n|\"before\"\n|}\n\n==Syntax==\nOld Egyptian, Classical Egyptian, and Middle Egyptian have [[verb-subject-object]] as the basic [[word order]]. However, that changed in the later stages of the language, including Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.\n\nThe equivalent to \"the man opens the door\" would be a sentence that would correspond, in the language's earlier stages, to \"opens the man the door\" (''wn s \ua725\ua723''). The so-called [[status constructus|construct state]] combines two or more nouns to express the [[genitive]], as in Semitic and [[Berber languages]].\n\nThe early stages of Egyptian have no articles, but the later forms use ''p\ua723'', ''t\ua723'' and ''n\ua723''. As with other Afroasiatic languages, Egyptian uses two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. It also uses three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural. However, later Egyptian has a tendency to lose the dual as a productive form.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see|Coptic language#Influence on other languages}}\n\nThe Egyptian language survived into the early modern period in the form of the [[Coptic language]]. Coptic survived past the 16th century only as an isolated vernacular.\n\nHowever, in antiquity, Egyptian exerted some influence on [[Classical Greek]], so that a number of Egyptian loanwords into Greek survive into modern usage. Examples include \n''[[:wikt:ebony|ebony]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\udf41\ud80c\ude16\ud80c\udfed\ud80c\uddb1 ''hbny'', via Greek and then Latin), \n''[[:wikt:ivory|ivory]]'' (Egyptian ''\ua723bw'', literally \"ivory, elephant\"),\n''[[:wikt:natron|natron]]'' (via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:lily|lily]]'' (Coptic ''hl\u0113ri'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:ibis|ibis]]'' (Egyptian ''hbj'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:oasis|oasis]]'' (Demotic ''w\u1e25j'', via Greek),\nperhaps ''[[:wikt:barge|barge]]'' (Greek [[Wikt:\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2|\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2]] ''baris'' \"Egyptian boat\" from Coptic \u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89 ''ba\u0294r\u0259'' \"small boat\" from Egyptian [[Wikt:b\ua723jr|b\ua723jr]] ),\nand possibly ''[[:wikt:cat|cat]]'';<ref>Often assumed to represent the precursor of Coptic \u03e3\u2c81\u2ca9 (''\u0161au'' \"tomcat\") suffixed with feminine ''-t'', but some authorities dispute this, e.g. John Huehnergard, \"Qitta: Arabic Cats\", ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms'' (2007).</ref> and of course a number of terms and proper names directly associated with [[Ancient Egypt]], such as\n''[[:wikt:pharaoh|pharaoh]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\ude50\ud80c\ude7b ''pr-\ua725\ua723'', literally \"great house\", transmitted via Hebrew and Greek). The [[Name of Egypt|name ''Egypt'']] itself is etymologically identical to that of the ''[[Copts]]'', ultimately from the [[Late Egyptian]] name of [[Memphis (Egypt)|Memphis]], ''Hikuptah'', a continuation of Middle Egyptian ''{{transl|egy|[[wikt:\u1e25wt-k\ua723-pt\u1e25|\u1e25wt-k\ua723-pt\u1e25]]}}''  \"temple of the [[Egyptian soul|ka (soul)]] of [[Ptah]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Hoffmeier|first =James K|title =Rameses of the Exodus narratives is the 13th B.C.
