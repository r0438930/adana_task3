The symbol for molar quantities may be indicated by adding a subscript \"m\" to the corresponding extensive property.  For example, molar enthalpy is ''H''<sub>m</sub>.<ref name=\"IUPACgreen\" />  Molar Gibbs free energy is commonly referred to as [[chemical potential]], symbolized by ''\u03bc'', particularly when discussing a partial molar Gibbs free energy ''\u03bc<sub>i</sub>'' for a component ''i'' in a mixture.\n\nFor the characterization of substances or reactions, tables usually report the molar properties referred to a [[standard state]]. In that case an additional superscript \u00b0 is added to the symbol. Examples:\n* ''V''<sub>m</sub>\u00b0 = {{gaps|22.41|[[liter|L]]/mol}} is the molar volume of an [[ideal gas]] at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]]. \n* ''C''<sub>''P'',m</sub>\u00b0 is the standard molar heat capacity of a substance at constant pressure.\n* \u0394<sub>r</sub>''H''<sub>m</sub>\u00b0 is the standard enthalpy variation of a reaction (with subcases: formation enthalpy, combustion enthalpy...).\n* ''E''\u00b0 is the [[standard reduction potential]] of a [[redox couple]], i.e. Gibbs energy over charge, which is measured in [[volt]] = J/C.\n\n==Potential sources of confusion==\n\nThe use of the term {{em|intensive}} is potentially confusing. The meaning here is \"something within the area, length, or size of something\", and often constrained by it, as opposed to \"extensive\", \"something without the area, more than that\".\n\n==Limitations==\n\nThe general validity of the division of physical properties into extensive and intensive kinds has been addressed in the course of science.<ref name= \"Hatsopoulos\">{{cite book | title=Principles of General Thermodynamics | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | author=George N.

Redlich pointed out that the assignment of some properties as intensive or extensive may depend on the way subsystems are arranged. For example, if two identical [[galvanic cell]]s are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]], the [[voltage]] of the system is equal to the voltage of each cell, while the [[electric charge]] transferred (or the [[electric current]]) is extensive. However, if the same cells are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]], the charge becomes intensive and the voltage extensive.<ref name=Redlich/> The IUPAC definitions do not consider such cases.<ref name=IUPACgreen/>\n\nSome intensive properties do not apply at very small sizes.  For example, [[viscosity]] is a [[macroscopic]] [[quantity]] and is not relevant for extremely small systems.  Likewise, at a very small scale [[color]] is not independent of size, as shown by [[quantum dots]], whose color depends on the size of the \"dot\".\n\n==Complex systems and entropy production==\n[[Ilya Prigogine]]\u2019s <ref name=\"Prigogine\">{{cite book | title=Order Out of Chaos, MAN\u2019S NEW DIALOGUE WITH NATURE | publisher=Verso | author=Ilya Prigogine, Isabelle Stengers | year=2018 | isbn=9781786631008}}</ref> groundbreaking work shows that every form of energy is made up of an intensive variable and an extensive variable. Measuring these two factors and taking the product of these two variables gives us an amount for that particular form of energy. If we take the energy of expansion the intensive variable is pressure (P) and the extensive variable is the volume (V) we get PxV this is then the energy of expansion. Likewise one can do this for density/mass movement where density and velocity (intensive) and volume (extensive) essentially describe the energy of the movement of mass.\n\nOther energy forms can be derived from this relationship also such as electrical, thermal, sound, springs. Within the quantum realm, it appears that energy is made up of intensive factors mainly. For example, the frequency is intensive. It appears that as one passes to the subatomic realms the intensive factor is more dominant. The example is the quantum dot where color (intensive variable) is dictated by size, size is normally an extensive variable. There appears to be the integration of these variables. This then appears as the basis of the quantum effect.\n\nThe key insight to all this is that the difference in the intensive variable gives us the entropic force and the change in the extensive variable gives us the entropic flux for a particular form of energy. A series of entropy production formulas can be derived. \n\n: \u2206S <sub>heat</sub>= [(1/T)<sub>a</sub>-(1/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 thermal energy\n\n: \u2206S <sub>expansion</sub>= [(pressure/T)<sub>a</sub>-(pressure/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 volume\n\n: \u2206S <sub>electric</sub> = [(voltage/T)<sub>a</sub>-(voltage/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 current\n\nThese equations have the form \n\n: \u2206S<sub>s</sub> = [(intensive)<sub>a</sub>  -(intensive)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 extensive<br>where the a and b are two different regions. \n\nThis is the long version of Prigogine\u2019s equation\n\n: \u2206S<sub>s</sub> = X<sub>s</sub>J<sub>s</sub> <br>where X<sub>s</sub> is the entropic force and J<sub>s</sub> is the entropic flux. \n\nIt is possible to derive a number of different energy forms from Prigogine\u2019s equation. \n\nNote that in thermal energy in the entropy production equation the intensive factor\u2019s numerator is 1. Whilst the other equations we have a numerator of pressure and voltage and the denominator is still temperature. This means lower than the level of molecules there are no definite stable units.\n\n== Properties in geopraphic scale  ==\n:(stub section)\n\n''Spatially intensive properties'' and ''spatially extensive properties'', see article review of the theme, https://doi.org/10.1080/13658810600965271\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Intensive And Extensive Properties}}\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Thermodynamic properties]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Property (of a system or substance) that is intensive or is extensive}}\n{{Thermodynamics|expanded=sysprop}}\n[[Physical properties]] of materials and [[system]]s can often be categorized as being either '''intensive''' or '''extensive''', according to how the property changes when the size (or extent) of the system changes.

These composite properties can also be classified as intensive or extensive.{{dubious|date=April 2019}}  Suppose a composite property <math>F</math> is a function of a set of intensive properties <math>\\{a_i\\}</math> and a set of extensive properties <math>\\{A_j\\}</math>, which can be shown as <math>F(\\{a_i\\},\\{A_j\\})</math>.  If the size of the system is changed by some scaling factor, <math>\\alpha</math>, only the extensive properties will change, since intensive properties are independent of the size of the system.  The scaled system, then, can be represented as <math>F(\\{a_i\\},\\{\\alpha A_j\\})</math>.\n\nIntensive properties are independent of the size of the system, so the property F is an intensive property if for all values of the scaling factor, <math>\\alpha</math>,\n\n:<math>F(\\{a_i\\},\\{\\alpha A_j\\}) = F(\\{a_i\\},\\{A_j\\}).\\,</math>\n\n(This is equivalent to saying that intensive composite properties are [[homogeneous function]]s of degree 0 with respect to <math>\\{A_j\\}</math>.)\n\nIt follows, for example, that the [[ratio]] of two extensive properties is an intensive property.  To illustrate, consider a system having a certain mass, <math>m</math>, and volume, <math>V</math>.  The density, <math>\\rho</math> is equal to mass (extensive) divided by volume (extensive):  <math>\\rho=\\frac{m}{V}</math>.  If the system is scaled by the factor <math>\\alpha</math>, then the mass and volume become <math>\\alpha m</math> and <math>\\alpha V</math>, and the density becomes <math>\\rho=\\frac{\\alpha m}{\\alpha V}</math>; the two <math>\\alpha</math>s cancel, so this could be written mathematically as  <math>\\rho (\\alpha m, \\alpha V) = \\rho (m, V)</math>, which is analogous to the equation for <math>F</math> above.\n\nThe property <math>F</math> is an extensive property if for all <math>\\alpha</math>,\n\n:<math>F(\\{a_i\\},\\{\\alpha A_j\\})=\\alpha F(\\{a_i\\},\\{A_j\\}).\\,</math>\n\n(This is equivalent to saying that extensive composite properties are [[homogeneous function]]s of degree 1 with respect to <math>\\{A_j\\}</math>.)

For example, heat capacity is an extensive property of a system.  Dividing heat capacity, ''C<sub>p</sub>'', by the mass of the system gives the specific heat capacity, ''c<sub>p</sub>'', which is an intensive property.  When the extensive property is represented by an upper-case letter, the symbol for the corresponding intensive property is usually represented by a lower-case letter.

The symbol for molar quantities may be indicated by adding a subscript \"m\" to the corresponding extensive property.  For example, molar enthalpy is ''H''<sub>m</sub>.<ref name=\"IUPACgreen\" />  Molar Gibbs free energy is commonly referred to as [[chemical potential]], symbolized by ''\u03bc'', particularly when discussing a partial molar Gibbs free energy ''\u03bc<sub>i</sub>'' for a component ''i'' in a mixture.\n\nFor the characterization of substances or reactions, tables usually report the molar properties referred to a [[standard state]]. In that case an additional superscript \u00b0 is added to the symbol. Examples:\n* ''V''<sub>m</sub>\u00b0 = {{gaps|22.41|[[liter|L]]/mol}} is the molar volume of an [[ideal gas]] at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]]. \n* ''C''<sub>''P'',m</sub>\u00b0 is the standard molar heat capacity of a substance at constant pressure.\n* \u0394<sub>r</sub>''H''<sub>m</sub>\u00b0 is the standard enthalpy variation of a reaction (with subcases: formation enthalpy, combustion enthalpy...).\n* ''E''\u00b0 is the [[standard reduction potential]] of a [[redox couple]], i.e. Gibbs energy over charge, which is measured in [[volt]] = J/C.\n\n==Potential sources of confusion==\n\nThe use of the term {{em|intensive}} is potentially confusing. The meaning here is \"something within the area, length, or size of something\", and often constrained by it, as opposed to \"extensive\", \"something without the area, more than that\".\n\n==Limitations==\n\nThe general validity of the division of physical properties into extensive and intensive kinds has been addressed in the course of science.<ref name= \"Hatsopoulos\">{{cite book | title=Principles of General Thermodynamics | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | author=George N.

Redlich pointed out that the assignment of some properties as intensive or extensive may depend on the way subsystems are arranged. For example, if two identical [[galvanic cell]]s are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]], the [[voltage]] of the system is equal to the voltage of each cell, while the [[electric charge]] transferred (or the [[electric current]]) is extensive. However, if the same cells are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]], the charge becomes intensive and the voltage extensive.<ref name=Redlich/> The IUPAC definitions do not consider such cases.<ref name=IUPACgreen/>\n\nSome intensive properties do not apply at very small sizes.  For example, [[viscosity]] is a [[macroscopic]] [[quantity]] and is not relevant for extremely small systems.  Likewise, at a very small scale [[color]] is not independent of size, as shown by [[quantum dots]], whose color depends on the size of the \"dot\".\n\n==Complex systems and entropy production==\n[[Ilya Prigogine]]\u2019s <ref name=\"Prigogine\">{{cite book | title=Order Out of Chaos, MAN\u2019S NEW DIALOGUE WITH NATURE | publisher=Verso | author=Ilya Prigogine, Isabelle Stengers | year=2018 | isbn=9781786631008}}</ref> groundbreaking work shows that every form of energy is made up of an intensive variable and an extensive variable. Measuring these two factors and taking the product of these two variables gives us an amount for that particular form of energy. If we take the energy of expansion the intensive variable is pressure (P) and the extensive variable is the volume (V) we get PxV this is then the energy of expansion. Likewise one can do this for density/mass movement where density and velocity (intensive) and volume (extensive) essentially describe the energy of the movement of mass.\n\nOther energy forms can be derived from this relationship also such as electrical, thermal, sound, springs. Within the quantum realm, it appears that energy is made up of intensive factors mainly. For example, the frequency is intensive. It appears that as one passes to the subatomic realms the intensive factor is more dominant. The example is the quantum dot where color (intensive variable) is dictated by size, size is normally an extensive variable. There appears to be the integration of these variables. This then appears as the basis of the quantum effect.\n\nThe key insight to all this is that the difference in the intensive variable gives us the entropic force and the change in the extensive variable gives us the entropic flux for a particular form of energy. A series of entropy production formulas can be derived. \n\n: \u2206S <sub>heat</sub>= [(1/T)<sub>a</sub>-(1/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 thermal energy\n\n: \u2206S <sub>expansion</sub>= [(pressure/T)<sub>a</sub>-(pressure/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 volume\n\n: \u2206S <sub>electric</sub> = [(voltage/T)<sub>a</sub>-(voltage/T)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 current\n\nThese equations have the form \n\n: \u2206S<sub>s</sub> = [(intensive)<sub>a</sub>  -(intensive)<sub>b</sub>] x \u2206 extensive<br>where the a and b are two different regions. \n\nThis is the long version of Prigogine\u2019s equation\n\n: \u2206S<sub>s</sub> = X<sub>s</sub>J<sub>s</sub> <br>where X<sub>s</sub> is the entropic force and J<sub>s</sub> is the entropic flux. \n\nIt is possible to derive a number of different energy forms from Prigogine\u2019s equation. \n\nNote that in thermal energy in the entropy production equation the intensive factor\u2019s numerator is 1. Whilst the other equations we have a numerator of pressure and voltage and the denominator is still temperature. This means lower than the level of molecules there are no definite stable units.\n\n== Properties in geopraphic scale  ==\n:(stub section)\n\n''Spatially intensive properties'' and ''spatially extensive properties'', see article review of the theme, https://doi.org/10.1080/13658810600965271\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Intensive And Extensive Properties}}\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Thermodynamic properties]]\n", "name_user": "182.70.31.175", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200e{{anchor|\"Specific\" properties I think this is Important}} Specific properties)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties"}
