It is also one of the most important caves in the [[Dinaric Alps]] mountain range, which is famous worldwide for its [[karstic]] and [[speleogenesis|speleological riches]]. It is located in the [[Popovo field]] in [[Ravno]], [[East Herzegovina]] in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Popovo Polje.JPG|left|thumb|Popovo Polje, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]\n\n===Popovo Polje and cave location===\n\nVjetrenica is located in [[Popovo Polje]] (pronounced {{IPA-sh|p\u0254\u030cp\u0254\u028b\u0254 p\u0254\u0302\u028e\u025b|}}, meaning ''priest's field'', where [[polje]] stands for [[karstic]] plain), which is itself located in a southernmost regions of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[West Herzegovina]], near the [[Adriatic]] coast. \nIts entrance is near the [[village]] of [[Zavala, Bosnia-Herzegovina|Zavala]], in west - south-western corner of polje. In the warmer parts of the year a strong blast of cold air blows from its entrance, which is very attractive in the middle of the rocky, hot and waterless terrain.\n\nPopovo Polje is one of the largest polje (karstic plain) in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the world, famous for its [[karstic]] phenomenons and features, and particularly for its [[Trebi\u0161njica River]], which flows through the polje as largest [[sinking river]] (also ''losing stream'', or ''influent stream'') the world, as well as the Vjetrenica cave system, located to the west/south-western parts of the valley. \n\nThe cave has been explored and described to a total of 7,014 m in length; of this the main channel is about 2.47&nbsp;km long. It runs from the edge of [[Popovo Polje]] to the south, and on the basis of analysis of the terrain, [[geologist]]s have predicted that Vjetrenica could stretch right to the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the [[Republic of Croatia]], 15\u201320&nbsp;km away from its entrance. Along with the [[hydrological]] arguments, this assumption is also supported by the \"unnatural\" end of Vjetrenica in the form of a huge heap of stone blocks that have caved in.\n\nVjetrenica is the richest cave in the world in terms of subterranean biodiversity: among more than two hundred different species are registered in it, almost hundred are [[troglophile]]s, a great number of them are narrow endemic, 15 are stenoendemic, and about 37 were discovered and described in Vjetrenica for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vjetrenica (official
