Broadcast programming that has carried a TV-MA warning includes the pilot of the [[CBS]] police series ''[[Brooklyn South]]'' and documentaries such as [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[The Vietnam War (TV series)|The Vietnam War]]'' on [[PBS]], along with a few 10 p.m. ET drama series episodes with sensitive content. Programs with this rating commonly include dark humor, frequent use of profanity, intense violence (may include blood and gore), and/or strong sexual themes.\n\n===Content descriptors===\nSome thematic elements, according to the FCC, \"may call for parental guidance and/or the program may contain one or more of the following\" sub-ratings, designated with an alphabetic letter:\n*'''D''' \u2013 Sexual or suggestive dialogue (rarely used with the TV-MA rating)\n*'''L''' \u2013 Coarse or crude language\n*'''S''' \u2013 Sexual content\n*'''V''' \u2013 Violence\n**'''FV''' \u2013 Fantasy violence (exclusive to the TV-Y7 rating)\n\nUp to four content descriptors can be applied alongside an assigned rating, depending on the kind of suggestive content featured in a program; the FV descriptor is an exception due to its sole use for the TV-Y7 rating, which can have no descriptor other than FV. As the rating increases pertaining to the age, the content matters generally get more intensive. These descriptors allow for 44 possible combinations for all the ratings total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkansas.com/entertainment/features/ratings|title=TV Ratings|date=June 10, 2013|publisher=[[KSAS-TV]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721122653/http://www.foxkansas.com/entertainment/features/ratings|archive-date=July 21, 2013|url-status=bot: unknown|accessdate=July 24, 2013|quote=In all there are 44 combinations of symbols for the TV Parental Guideline system.|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The \"suggestive dialogue\" descriptor is used for TV-PG and TV-14 rated programs only.

A minimum of three hours of E/I-compliant programming must be broadcast per week by each television network; all E/I programs must air between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.\n\n==Design==\nFor the first 15 seconds of every rated program lasting a half-hour or less, a large rating icon appears in the upper-left hand corner of the screen; previously this had a common design using a universal icon, but now often goes with a network's branding scheme, or as [[Netflix]] does, merely denotes the rating in a straight line of text. The icon was much smaller until June 2005 and only appeared on-screen for 7.5 seconds. For every rated program running an hour or longer, a rating appears in the upper-left hand corner of the television screen at the beginning of each half-hour. Starting in June 2005, many networks now display the ratings after every commercial break, in addition to the beginning of the program. Ratings icons formerly appeared in the [[4:3]] [[safe area (television)|safe area]], even with a [[16:9]] [[high-definition television|HD-designed]] presentation, but have moved into the top-left corner of the 16:9 picture as time has gone on.\n\n==Viewer discretion advisories==\nSome programs may voluntarily display a disclaimer regarding the show's objectionable content with the TV rating prior to the program starting, along with audibly repeating the same, with the reason for the rating (e.g. suggestive dialogue, drug and alcohol abuse, language, sexual situations, violence, nudity) and strongly cautioning parents to decide whether the program is suitable for their children. Several channels (including [[USA Network]] and [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]) insert special caution boards for horror animated programs at the end of commercial breaks, almost always occurring before a series uses the word \"[[fuck]]\" in uncensored dialogue.\n\nViewer discretion advisories are mostly used for programs rated TV-MA or series where most episodes are TV-14-rated with lighter content, where content may be unusual for the tone the series or event may usually have or for strong content. They are also commonly used for television broadcasts of theatrical films; this, however, depends highly on the content and rating (alternatively, said content might also be edited out).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Television content rating systems]]\n*[[Pay television content descriptors]]\n*[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]]\n*[[Television content rating systems#Canada|Canadian TV rating systems]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tvguidelines.org/ratings.html TV Parental Guidelines] \u2013 Official site\n*[http://transition.fcc.gov/vchip/  V-Chip] at the FCC website\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tv Parental Guidelines}}\n[[Category:Media content ratings systems]]\n[[Category:Television in the United States]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1997]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|United States television age-based ratings\n}}\n{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{Infobox company\n|name = TV Parental Guidelines\n|type = [[Privately held company|Incentive]]\n|industry = [[television content rating system]]\n|foundation = 1997<br>[[United States]]\n|location = [[United States]]\n|homepage = [http://www.tvguidelines.org/ www.tvguidelines.org/]\n}}\nThe '''TV parental guidelines''' are a [[television content rating system]] in the United States that was first proposed on December 19, 1996, by the [[United States Congress]], the television industry and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), and went into effect by January 1, 1997, on most major [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[cable network]]s in response to public concerns<ref>{{cite news |title=Cable agrees to monitor violence |first=Richard |last=Katz |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15142788.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522233100/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15142788.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |newspaper=[[Multichannel News]] |publisher=[[NewBay Media]] |date=January 17, 1994 |accessdate=March 11, 2013}} {{Subscription required}}</ref> about increasingly explicit sexual content, graphic violence and strong profanity in television programs.

This rating was originally '''TV-M''' prior to the announced revisions to the rating system in August 1997 but was changed due to a trademark dispute and in order to remove confusion with the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]]'s (ESRB) \"M for Mature\" rating for [[video games]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Aversa |first=Jeannine |title=Trademark Problem: TV-M To Become TV-MA |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970313&slug=2528555 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=March 13, 1997}}</ref> This rating is very seldom used by broadcast networks or local television stations due to FCC restrictions on program content, although it is commonly applied to television programs featured on certain [[cable channel]]s (basic and premium networks) and streaming networks for both mainstream and [[softcore pornography|softcore]] programs. Broadcast programming that has carried a TV-MA warning includes the pilot of the [[CBS]] police series ''[[Brooklyn South]]'' and documentaries such as [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[The Vietnam War (TV series)|The Vietnam War]]'' on [[PBS]], along with a few 10 p.m. ET drama series episodes with sensitive content. Programs with this rating commonly include dark humor, frequent use of profanity, intense violence (may include blood and gore), and/or strong sexual themes.\n\n===Content descriptors===\nSome thematic elements, according to the FCC, \"may call for parental guidance and/or the program may contain one or more of the following\" sub-ratings, designated with an alphabetic letter:\n*'''D''' \u2013 Sexual or suggestive dialogue (rarely used with the TV-MA rating)\n*'''L''' \u2013 Coarse or crude language\n*'''S''' \u2013 Sexual content\n*'''V''' \u2013 Violence\n**'''FV''' \u2013 Fantasy violence (exclusive to the TV-Y7 rating)\n\nUp to four content descriptors can be applied alongside an assigned rating, depending on the kind of suggestive content featured in a program; the FV descriptor is an exception due to its sole use for the TV-Y7 rating, which can have no descriptor other than FV. As the rating increases pertaining to the age, the content matters generally get more intensive. These descriptors allow for 44 possible combinations for all the ratings total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkansas.com/entertainment/features/ratings|title=TV Ratings|date=June 10, 2013|publisher=[[KSAS-TV]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721122653/http://www.foxkansas.com/entertainment/features/ratings|archive-date=July 21, 2013|url-status=bot: unknown|accessdate=July 24, 2013|quote=In all there are 44 combinations of symbols for the TV Parental Guideline system.|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The \"suggestive dialogue\" descriptor is used for TV-PG and TV-14 rated programs only. The violence descriptor was used for TV-Y7 programs from August 1997 until the creation of the 'FV' descriptor later that year.<ref name=\"Mifflin 1997\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19970625&id=ur4wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v_wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4720,3158097 | title=Impasse Snags Proposed TV Rating System | work=[[The Ledger]] | date=June 25, 1997 | accessdate=February 13, 2014 | author=Mifflin, Lawrie | pages=A1, A4 | edition=Lakeland | location=Lakeland, Florida}}</ref>\n\nAn additional content descriptor, \"[[E/I]]\", is applied to select TV-Y, TV-Y7, and TV-G programs that are designed to meet the educational and informative needs of children. A minimum of three hours of E/I-compliant programming must be broadcast per week by each television network; all E/I programs must air between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.\n\n==Design==\nFor the first 15 seconds of every rated program lasting a half-hour or less, a large rating icon appears in the upper-left hand corner of the screen; previously this had a common design using a universal icon, but now often goes with a network's branding scheme, or as [[Netflix]] does, merely denotes the rating in a straight line of text. The icon was much smaller until June 2005 and only appeared on-screen for 7.5 seconds. For every rated program running an hour or longer, a rating appears in the upper-left hand corner of the television screen at the beginning of each half-hour. Starting in June 2005, many networks now display the ratings after every commercial break, in addition to the beginning of the program. Ratings icons formerly appeared in the [[4:3]] [[safe area (television)|safe area]], even with a [[16:9]] [[high-definition television|HD-designed]] presentation, but have moved into the top-left corner of the 16:9 picture as time has gone on.\n\n==Viewer discretion advisories==\nSome programs may voluntarily display a disclaimer regarding the show's objectionable content with the TV rating prior to the program starting, along with audibly repeating the same, with the reason for the rating (e.g. suggestive dialogue, drug and alcohol abuse, language, sexual situations, violence, nudity) and strongly cautioning parents to decide whether the program is suitable for their children. Several channels (including [[USA Network]] and [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]) insert special caution boards for horror animated programs at the end of commercial breaks, almost always occurring before a series uses the word \"[[fuck]]\" in uncensored dialogue.\n\nViewer discretion advisories are mostly used for programs rated TV-MA or series where most episodes are TV-14-rated with lighter content, where content may be unusual for the tone the series or event may usually have or for strong content. They are also commonly used for television broadcasts of theatrical films; this, however, depends highly on the content and rating (alternatively, said content might also be edited out).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Television content rating systems]]\n*[[Pay television content descriptors]]\n*[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]]\n*[[Television content rating systems#Canada|Canadian TV rating systems]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tvguidelines.org/ratings.html TV Parental Guidelines] \u2013 Official site\n*[http://transition.fcc.gov/vchip/  V-Chip] at the FCC website\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tv Parental Guidelines}}\n[[Category:Media content ratings systems]]\n[[Category:Television in the United States]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1997]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:4050:400:242d:8fcc:c65f:e4b3", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTV-Y:Tv y)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Parental_Guidelines"}
