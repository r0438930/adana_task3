Hamann and Kant held each other in mutual respect, although Hamann once declined an invitation by Kant to co-write a [[physics]] textbook for children. Hamann also introduced Kant to the work of Rousseau.\n\n=== Music ===\nHamann was a [[lutenist]], having studied this instrument with [[Timofey Belogradsky]] (a student of [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]]), a Ukrainian virtuoso then living in K\u00f6nigsberg.\n\n==Philosophical views==\nHis distrust of autonomous, disembodied [[reason]] and [[the Enlightenment]] (\"I look upon logical proofs the way a well-bred girl looks upon a love letter\" was one of his many witticisms) led him to conclude that faith in [[God]] was the only [[solution]] to the vexing problems of [[philosophy]].   \n\nOne of Kant's biographers compared him with Hamann: {{Quotation|Kant made reason the rule of his life and the source of his philosophy; Hamann found the source of both in his heart.

Hamann was greatly influenced by Hume. This is most evident in Hamann's conviction that faith and belief, rather than knowledge, determine human actions. Also, Hamann asserted that the efficacy of a concept arises from the habits it reflects rather than any inherent quality it possesses.  \n\n=== Works ===\nHamann's writings consist of small essays. They display two striking tendencies. The first is their brevity, in comparison with works by his contemporaries. The second is their breadth of allusion and delight in extended analogies. For example, his work ''Golgatha and Scheblimini! By a Preacher in the Wilderness'' (1784) was directed against [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''Jerusalem, or on Religious Might and Judaism'' (1782). His work was also significantly reactive; rather than advance a \u201cposition\u201d of his own, his principal mode of thinking was to respond to others' work. \n\nHamann famously used the image of [[Socrates]], who often proclaimed to know nothing, in his ''Socratic Memorabilia'', an essay in which Hamann critiques the Enlightenment's dependence on reason. In ''Aesthetica in nuce'', Hamann counters the Enlightenment by emphasizing the importance of aesthetic experience and the role of genius in intuiting nature. \n\n====Editions====\nFragments of his writings were published by Cramer, under the title of ''Sibyllinische Bl\u00e4tter des Magus aus Norden'' (1819), and a complete edition by Roth (7 vols., 1821\u201325, with a volume of additions and explanations by Wiener, 1843). ''Hamann's des Magus in Norden Leben und Schriften'', edited by Gildemeister, was published in 5 vols., 1857\u201368, and a new edition of his ''Schriften und Briefen'', edited by Petri, in 4 vols., 1872-74.\n\n===God===\nHamann argued that the [[communicatio idiomatum]], namely, the communication of divine messages through material embodiments, applies not just to Christ, but should be generalised to cover all human action: 'This communicatio of divine and human idiomatum is a fundamental law and the master-key of all our knowledge and of the whole visible economy.\"  Hamann believed all of creation were [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] from God for us to interpret.\n\n===Reason is language===\nHis most notable contributions to philosophy were his thoughts on language, which have often been considered as a forerunner to the linguistic turn in analytic philosophy such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s. He famously said that \"Reason is language\" (\"Vernunft ist Sprache\").<ref name=\"Brief\">Johann Georg Hamann, ''Brief an Herder'', v. 8. August 1784, in: Johann Georg Hamann, ''Briefwechsel'', 7 vols., Arthur Henkel (ed.), Wiesbaden: Insel Verlag, 1955\u201375, vol. 5, p. 177.</ref> Hamann thought the bridge between Kant's [[Noumenon|noumenal]] and [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] realms was language, with its noumenal [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and phenomenal [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]].<br />\n\n==Legacy==\nHamann was one of the precipitating forces for the [[Counter-Enlightenment]]. He was, moreover, a mentor to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and an admired influence on Goethe, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], Kierkegaard, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], and [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] devoted a chapter to Hamann in his volume, ''Studies in Theological Styles: Lay Styles'' (Volume III in the English language translation of ''The Glory of the Lord'' series). Most recently, Hamann's influence can be found in the work of the theologians [[Oswald Bayer]] ([[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]), [[John Milbank]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), and [[David Bentley Hart]] ([[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]). Finally, in [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s important summative work, ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity'' (Taylor, 2016),<ref>Taylor, Charles (2016) ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.</ref>  Hamann is given credit, along with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and Herder, for inspiring Taylor's \"HHH\" approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language.\n\nHowever, recent scholarship, such as that by Bayer, contradicts the usual interpretation by people such as historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]], and describes Hamann as a \"radical Enlightener\" who vigorously opposed dogmatic rationalism in matters of philosophy and faith.<ref>{{Cite book|title=After Enlightenment: The Post-Secular Vision of J.

Hamann|last=Betz|first=John|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2012|isbn=978-0-470-67492-5|location=Chicester|pages=2}}</ref> Bayer views him as less the proto-Romantic that Herder presented, and more a premodern-postmodern thinker who brought the consequences of Lutheran theology to bear upon the burgeoning Enlightenment and especially in reaction to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].<ref>Bayer, Oswald.

In ''Aesthetica in nuce'', Hamann counters the Enlightenment by emphasizing the importance of aesthetic experience and the role of genius in intuiting nature. \n\n====Editions====\nFragments of his writings were published by Cramer, under the title of ''Sibyllinische Bl\u00e4tter des Magus aus Norden'' (1819), and a complete edition by Roth (7 vols., 1821\u201325, with a volume of additions and explanations by Wiener, 1843). ''Hamann's des Magus in Norden Leben und Schriften'', edited by Gildemeister, was published in 5 vols., 1857\u201368, and a new edition of his ''Schriften und Briefen'', edited by Petri, in 4 vols., 1872-74.\n\n===God===\nHamann argued that the [[communicatio idiomatum]], namely, the communication of divine messages through material embodiments, applies not just to Christ, but should be generalised to cover all human action: 'This communicatio of divine and human idiomatum is a fundamental law and the master-key of all our knowledge and of the whole visible economy.\"  Hamann believed all of creation were [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] from God for us to interpret.\n\n===Reason is language===\nHis most notable contributions to philosophy were his thoughts on language, which have often been considered as a forerunner to the linguistic turn in analytic philosophy such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s. He famously said that \"Reason is language\" (\"Vernunft ist Sprache\").<ref name=\"Brief\">Johann Georg Hamann, ''Brief an Herder'', v. 8. August 1784, in: Johann Georg Hamann, ''Briefwechsel'', 7 vols., Arthur Henkel (ed.), Wiesbaden: Insel Verlag, 1955\u201375, vol. 5, p. 177.</ref> Hamann thought the bridge between Kant's [[Noumenon|noumenal]] and [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] realms was language, with its noumenal [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and phenomenal [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]].<br />\n\n==Legacy==\nHamann was one of the precipitating forces for the [[Counter-Enlightenment]]. He was, moreover, a mentor to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and an admired influence on Goethe, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], Kierkegaard, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], and [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] devoted a chapter to Hamann in his volume, ''Studies in Theological Styles: Lay Styles'' (Volume III in the English language translation of ''The Glory of the Lord'' series). Most recently, Hamann's influence can be found in the work of the theologians [[Oswald Bayer]] ([[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]), [[John Milbank]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), and [[David Bentley Hart]] ([[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]). Finally, in [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s important summative work, ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity'' (Taylor, 2016),<ref>Taylor, Charles (2016) ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.</ref>  Hamann is given credit, along with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and Herder, for inspiring Taylor's \"HHH\" approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language.\n\nHowever, recent scholarship, such as that by Bayer, contradicts the usual interpretation by people such as historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]], and describes Hamann as a \"radical Enlightener\" who vigorously opposed dogmatic rationalism in matters of philosophy and faith.<ref>{{Cite book|title=After Enlightenment: The Post-Secular Vision of J.
