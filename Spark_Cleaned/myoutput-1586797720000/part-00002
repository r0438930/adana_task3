Majumdar]] says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world. Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of [[Sindh]], their only conquest for nearly 300 years.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Ancient India: Earliest Times to 1000 A.

At the beginning of the 13th century, the most prominent and powerful state of Rajasthan was Mewar. The Rajputs resisted the Muslim incursions into India, although a number of Rajput kingdoms eventually became subservient to the [[Delhi Sultanate]].\n \nThe Rajputs put up resistance to the Islamic invasions with their warfare and chivalry for centuries.

[[Mount Abu]] lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the [[West Banas River]], although a series of broken ridges continues into [[Haryana]] in the direction of [[Delhi]] where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the [[Raisina Hill]] and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].\n\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important in defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbase in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur.\n\nThe [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer months or {{convert|129|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The [[Luni River]] and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great [[Rann of Kutch]] wetland in neighbouring [[Gujarat]]. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in Barmer district. The [[Ghaggar River]], which originates in [[Haryana]], is an intermittent stream that disappears into the sands of the Thar Desert in the northern corner of the state and is seen as a remnant of the primitive [[Sarasvati river]].\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{main|Wildlife of Rajasthan}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2013}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"margin:1em; float:right; width:25%;\"\n|+ '''State symbols of '''Rajasthan'''\n|-\n| '''Formation day'''\n| 1 November\n|-\n| '''State animal'''\n| [[Chinkara]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\">{{cite web|title=States and Union Territories Symbols|url=http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=16#raj|accessdate=7 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112080035/http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=16#raj|archivedate=12 November 2013}}</ref> and [[Camel]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Now the state animal camel|url=http://www.patrika.com/news/now-the-state-animal-camel/1015253|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=Patrika Group|date=1 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806141624/http://www.patrika.com/news/now-the-state-animal-camel/1015253|archivedate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''State bird'''\n| [[Great Indian bustard|Godavan (great Indian bustard)]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|-\n| '''State flower'''\n| Flower \u2013 [[Tecomella undulata|Rohida]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|-\n| '''State Tree'''\n| [[Prosopis cineraria|Khejri]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|}\n[[File:Sonchiriya.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[great Indian bustard]] has been classed as [[critically endangered]] since 2011.]]\nThough a large percentage of the total area is desert with little forest cover, Rajasthan has a rich and varied flora and fauna.

[[Mount Abu]] lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the [[West Banas River]], although a series of broken ridges continues into [[Haryana]] in the direction of [[Delhi]] where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the [[Raisina Hill]] and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].\n\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important in defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbase in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur. \n\nThe [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer months or {{convert|129|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur.

A Rajasthani traditional dress for females comprises an ankle-length skirt and a short top, known as ''[[chaniya choli]]''Mainly pure owned by traditional people . A piece of cloth is used to cover the head, both for protection from heat and maintenance of modesty. Rajasthani dresses are usually designed in bright colours like blue, yellow and orange.\n\nThe main religious festivals are [[Deepawali]], [[Holi]], [[Gangaur]], [[Teej]], [[Gogaji]], [[Devnarayan|Shri Devnarayan Jayanti]], [[Makar Sankranti]] and [[Janmashtami]], as the main religion is [[Hinduism]].
