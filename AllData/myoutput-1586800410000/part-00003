It is used to express the ratio of one value of a [[Power, root-power, and field quantities|power or field quantity]] to another, on a [[logarithmic scale]], the logarithmic quantity being called the power level or field level, respectively.\n\nIt can be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1&nbsp;dB or &minus;1&nbsp;dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a fixed reference value; when used in this way, a suffix that indicates the reference value is often appended to the decibel symbol. For example, if the reference value is 1&nbsp;[[volt]], then the suffix is \"[[#Voltage|V]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBV\"), and if the reference value is one [[milliwatt]], then the suffix is \"[[dBm|m]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBm\").<ref name=\"clqgmk\"/>\n\nTwo different scales are used when expressing a ratio in decibels, depending on the nature of the quantities: power and field (root-power). When expressing a power ratio, the number of decibels is ten times its [[Common logarithm|logarithm to base 10]].<ref>{{cite book |title=IEEE Standard 100: a dictionary of IEEE standards and terms |edition=7th |publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7381-2601-2 |page=288}}</ref> That is, a change in ''power'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10&nbsp;dB change in level. When expressing field (root-power) quantities, a change in ''amplitude'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20&nbsp;dB change in level. The decibel scales differ by a factor of two so that the related power and field levels change by the same number of decibels with linear loads.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in [[telephony]] of the early 20th&nbsp;century in the [[Bell System]] in the United States. One decibel is one tenth ([[deci-]]) of one '''bel''', named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and [[engineering]], most prominently in [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], and [[control theory]]. In electronics, the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]s of amplifiers, [[attenuation]] of signals, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]], the decibel is defined as a unit of measurement for quantities of type [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] or level difference, which are defined as the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.<ref name=\"standardization2006\">{{cite web |title=ISO 80000-3:2006 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31888 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2013-07-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|MSC|TU|bel}}History==\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits.

The standard telephone cable implied was \"a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88&nbsp;Ohms per loop-mile and uniformly distributed [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] [[capacitance]] of 0.054&nbsp;[[microfarad]]s per mile\" (approximately corresponding to 19&nbsp;[[wire gauge|gauge]] wire).<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Kenneth Simonds |title=Transmission Circuits for Telephonic Communication: Methods of analysis and design |date=1944 |publisher=[[D.

The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the \"mile of standard\" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the \"decibel\" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.\n\nThe decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>0.1</sup> and any two amounts of power differ by ''N'' decibels when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>''N''(0.1)</sup>. The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit&nbsp;...}}\n\nIn 1954, J. W. Horton argued that the use of the decibel as a unit for quantities other than transmission loss led to confusion, and suggested the name ''logit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by multiplication\", to contrast with the name ''unit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by addition\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

The bel (B) is {{1/2}}&nbsp;ln(10) [[neper]]s: {{nowrap|1=1 B = {{1/2}} ln(10) Np}}. The neper is the change in the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']], that is {{nowrap|1=1 Np = ln(e) = 1}}, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, {{nowrap|1=1 dB = 0.11513\u2026 Np = 0.11513\u2026}}.  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of {{radic|10}}:1.<ref>{{cite book |title=International Standard CEI-IEC 27-3 |chapter=Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology |at=Part 3: Logarithmic quantities and units |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission}}</ref>\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10<sup>1/10</sup>, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|20}}</sup> (1.12202).<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Mark |author-first=James E. |title=Physical Properties of Polymers Handbook |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=1025 |quote=[\u2026] the decibel represents a reduction in power of 1.258 times [\u2026]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-last=Yost |author-first=William |title=Fundamentals of Hearing: An Introduction |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost |url-access=registration |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |edition=Second |date=1985 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost/page/206 206] |isbn=978-0-12-772690-8 |quote=[\u2026] a pressure ratio of 1.122 equals + 1.0 dB [\u2026]}}</ref>\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with [[metric prefix|SI unit prefixes]] other than ''[[deci-|deci]]''; it is preferred, for example, to use ''hundredths of a decibel'' rather than ''millibels''.

''P'' and ''P''<sub>0</sub> must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If {{nowrap|1=''P'' = ''P''<sub>0</sub>}} in the above equation, then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> = 0. If ''P'' is greater than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is positive; if ''P'' is less than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for ''P'' in terms of ''P''<sub>0</sub> and ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>:\n:<math>\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\text{dB}} P_0.\n</math>\n\n===Field quantities and root-power quantities===\n{{main|Power, root-power, and field quantities}}\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of ''F'' (measured field) and ''F''<sub>0</sub> (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and historically their definitions were formulated to give the same value for relative ratios in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n:<math>\nL_F = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\,\\text{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n:<math>\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\text{dB}} F_0.\n</math>\n\nSimilarly, in [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation for power gain level ''L''<sub>''G''</sub>:\n:<math>\nL_G = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}}\\right)\\,\\text{dB},\n</math>\nwhere ''V''<sub>out</sub> is the [[root-mean-square]] (rms) output voltage, ''V''<sub>in</sub> is the rms input voltage. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term ''root-power quantity'' is introduced by ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-1:2009]] as a substitute of ''field quantity''.  The term ''field quantity'' is deprecated by that standard.\n\n===Relationship between power level and field level===\nAlthough power and field quantities are different quantities, their respective levels are historically measured in the same units, typically decibels.  A factor of 2 is introduced to make ''changes'' in the respective levels match under restricted conditions such as when the medium is linear and the ''same'' waveform is under consideration with changes in amplitude, or the medium impedance is linear and independent of both frequency and time.  This relies on the relationship\n:<math> \\frac{P(t)}{P_0} = \\left(\\frac{F(t)}{F_0}\\right)^2 </math>\nholding.<ref>{{citation |author=I M Mills |author2=B N Taylor |author3=A J Thor |title=Definitions of the units radian, neper, bel and decibel |year=2001 |journal=Metrologia |volume=38 |page=353 |number=4 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/38/4/8}}</ref>  In a nonlinear system, this relationship does not hold by the definition of linearity.  However, even in a [[linear system]] in which the power quantity is the product of two linearly related quantities (e.g. [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]]), if the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is frequency- or time-dependent, this relationship does not hold in general, for example if the energy spectrum of the waveform changes.\n\nFor differences in level, the required relationship is relaxed from that above to one of proportionality (i.e., the reference quantities ''P''{{sub|0}} and ''F''{{sub|0}} need not be related), or equivalently,\n:<math> \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{F_2}{F_1}\\right)^2 </math>\nmust hold to allow the power level difference to be equal to the field level difference from power ''P''{{sub|1}} and ''V''{{sub|1}} to ''P''{{sub|2}} and ''V''{{sub|2}}.  An example might be an amplifier with unity voltage gain independent of load and frequency driving a load with a frequency-dependent impedance: the relative voltage gain of the amplifier is always 0&nbsp;dB, but the power gain depends on the changing spectral composition of the waveform being amplified.  Frequency-dependent impedances may be analyzed by considering the quantities [[power spectral density]] and the associated field quantities via the [[Fourier transform]], which allows elimination of the frequency dependence in the analysis by analyzing the system at each frequency independently.\n\n===Conversions===\n\n\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion between units of level and a list of corresponding ratios\n!Unit !!

A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or {{frac|2}} is approximately a [[Half-power point|change of 3&nbsp;dB]]. More precisely, the change is \u00b13.0103&nbsp;dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3&nbsp;dB\" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of {{nowrap|{{sqrt|2}} \u2248 1.4142}}.  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6&nbsp;dB\" rather than \u00b16.0206&nbsp;dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional [[significant figures]].  3.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to a power ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|3|10}}</sup>, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly {{sqrt|2}}.  Similarly, an increase of 6.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to the power ratio is {{nowrap|10<sup>{{frac|6|10}}</sup> \u2248 3.9811}}, about 0.5% different from 4.\n\n==Properties==\nThe decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplied effects such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive.\n\n===Reporting large ratios===\nThe [[logarithmic scale]] nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a manner similar to [[scientific notation]]. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See ''[[Bode plot]]'' and ''[[Semi-log plot]]''.  For example, 120&nbsp;dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n\n===Representation of multiplication operations===\nLevel values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of [[amplifier]] stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, {{nowrap|log(''A'' \u00d7 ''B'' \u00d7 ''C'') }}= log(''A'') + log(''B'') + log(''C''). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1&nbsp;dB is a power gain of approximately 26%, 3&nbsp;dB is approximately 2\u00d7 power gain, and 10&nbsp;dB is 10\u00d7 power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10&nbsp;dB, 8&nbsp;dB, and 7&nbsp;dB respectively, for a total gain of 25&nbsp;dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1&nbsp;dB, this is:\n*:: 25&nbsp;dB = 10&nbsp;dB + 10&nbsp;dB + 3&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.26 \u00d7 1.26  \u2248 317.5&nbsp;W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10<sup>{{frac|25|10}}</sup> = 316.2&nbsp;W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value, which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\nHowever, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of [[slide rule]]s than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.<ref name=\"Hickling\">R.

To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.\" However, for the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations:<ref>R. J. Peters, ''Acoustics and Noise Control'', Routledge, 12 November 2013, 400 pages, p.&nbsp;13</ref> \"if two machines each individually produce a [[sound pressure]] level of, say, 90&nbsp;dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93&nbsp;dB, but certainly not to 180&nbsp;dB!\"; \"suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87&nbsp;dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83&nbsp;dBA.

(See also [[Stevens' power law]].)\n\n{{further|Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure}}\n\n===Electronics===\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (as for [[Gain (electronics)|gains]]) in preference to [[arithmetic]] ratios or [[percent]]ages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as [[amplifier]]s and [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]]) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium ([[free space optical communication|free space]], [[waveguide]], [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optics]], etc.) using a [[link budget]].\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a reference level, often indicated via a suffix, to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"[[dBm]]\".  A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259&nbsp;mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the [[dBu]].  This is relative to the [[root mean square]] voltage which delivers 1&nbsp;mW (0&nbsp;dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or {{sqrt|1&nbsp;mW&times;600&nbsp;\u03a9 }}\u2248 0.775&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are [[#dBu or dBv|identical]].\n\n===Optics===\nIn an [[optical link]], if a known amount of [[Optics|optical]] power, in [[dBm]] (referenced to 1&nbsp;mW), is launched into a [[Optical fiber|fiber]], and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Fiber optic installer's field manual\n | author-first = Bob |author-last=Chomycz\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n | year = 2000\n | isbn = 978-0-07-135604-6\n | pages = 123\u2013126\n | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=B810SYIAa4IC |page=123 }}\n }}</ref>\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the [[absorbance|blocking unit]] used to measure [[optical density]] is equivalent to \u22121&nbsp;B.\n\n===Video and digital imaging===\nIn connection with video and digital [[image sensor]]s, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20&nbsp;log of the ratio, even when the represented intensity (optical power) is directly proportional to the voltage generated by the sensor, not to its square, as in a [[CCD imager]] where response voltage is linear in intensity.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | title = The Colour Image Processing Handbook\n | author = Stephen J.

Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20&nbsp;log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the [[F-number#Stops.2C f-stop conventions.2C and exposure|stop]], to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\n=={{anchor|Suffixes}}Suffixes and reference values==\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1&nbsp;milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard [[SI prefix]]es.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside [[SI units]], the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.<ref name=NIST2008>Thompson, A. and Taylor, B.

It is used to express the ratio of one value of a [[Power, root-power, and field quantities|power or field quantity]] to another, on a [[logarithmic scale]], the logarithmic quantity being called the power level or field level, respectively.\n\nIt can be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1&nbsp;dB or &minus;1&nbsp;dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a fixed reference value; when used in this way, a suffix that indicates the reference value is often appended to the decibel symbol. For example, if the reference value is 1&nbsp;[[volt]], then the suffix is \"[[#Voltage|V]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBV\"), and if the reference value is one [[milliwatt]], then the suffix is \"[[dBm|m]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBm\").<ref name=\"clqgmk\"/>\n\nTwo different scales are used when expressing a ratio in decibels, depending on the nature of the quantities: power and field (root-power). When expressing a power ratio, the number of decibels is ten times its [[Common logarithm|logarithm to base 10]].<ref>{{cite book |title=IEEE Standard 100: a dictionary of IEEE standards and terms |edition=7th |publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7381-2601-2 |page=288}}</ref> That is, a change in ''power'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10&nbsp;dB change in level. When expressing field (root-power) quantities, a change in ''amplitude'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20&nbsp;dB change in level. The decibel scales differ by a factor of two so that the related power and field levels change by the same number of decibels with linear loads.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in [[telephony]] of the early 20th&nbsp;century in the [[Bell System]] in the United States. One decibel is one tenth ([[deci-]]) of one '''bel''', named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and [[engineering]], most prominently in [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], and [[control theory]]. In electronics, the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]s of amplifiers, [[attenuation]] of signals, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]], the decibel is defined as a unit of measurement for quantities of type [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] or level difference, which are defined as the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.<ref name=\"standardization2006\">{{cite web |title=ISO 80000-3:2006 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31888 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2013-07-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|MSC|TU|bel}}History==\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. The unit for loss was originally ''Miles of Standard Cable'' (MSC). 1&nbsp;MSC corresponded to the loss of power over a 1&nbsp;[[mile]] (approximately 1.6&nbsp;km) length of standard telephone cable at a frequency of 5000&nbsp;[[radian]]s per second (795.8&nbsp;Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to the average listener. The standard telephone cable implied was \"a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88&nbsp;Ohms per loop-mile and uniformly distributed [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] [[capacitance]] of 0.054&nbsp;[[microfarad]]s per mile\" (approximately corresponding to 19&nbsp;[[wire gauge|gauge]] wire).<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Kenneth Simonds |title=Transmission Circuits for Telephonic Communication: Methods of analysis and design |date=1944 |publisher=[[D.

The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the \"mile of standard\" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the \"decibel\" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.\n\nThe decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>0.1</sup> and any two amounts of power differ by ''N'' decibels when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>''N''(0.1)</sup>. The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit&nbsp;...}}\n\nIn 1954, J. W. Horton argued that the use of the decibel as a unit for quantities other than transmission loss led to confusion, and suggested the name ''logit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by multiplication\", to contrast with the name ''unit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by addition\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

The bel (B) is {{1/2}}&nbsp;ln(10) [[neper]]s: {{nowrap|1=1 B = {{1/2}} ln(10) Np}}. The neper is the change in the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']], that is {{nowrap|1=1 Np = ln(e) = 1}}, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, {{nowrap|1=1 dB = 0.11513\u2026 Np = 0.11513\u2026}}.  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of {{radic|10}}:1.<ref>{{cite book |title=International Standard CEI-IEC 27-3 |chapter=Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology |at=Part 3: Logarithmic quantities and units |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission}}</ref>\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10<sup>1/10</sup>, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|20}}</sup> (1.12202).<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Mark |author-first=James E. |title=Physical Properties of Polymers Handbook |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=1025 |quote=[\u2026] the decibel represents a reduction in power of 1.258 times [\u2026]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-last=Yost |author-first=William |title=Fundamentals of Hearing: An Introduction |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost |url-access=registration |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |edition=Second |date=1985 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost/page/206 206] |isbn=978-0-12-772690-8 |quote=[\u2026] a pressure ratio of 1.122 equals + 1.0 dB [\u2026]}}</ref>\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with [[metric prefix|SI unit prefixes]] other than ''[[deci-|deci]]''; it is preferred, for example, to use ''hundredths of a decibel'' rather than ''millibels''.

Thus, the ratio of ''P'' (measured power) to ''P''<sub>0</sub> (reference power) is represented by ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>, that ratio expressed in decibels,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microwave Engineering |author-first=David M. |author-last=Pozar |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-471-44878-5 |page=63}}</ref> which is calculated using the formula:<ref name=\"standardization2006\"/>\n\n:<math>\nL_P = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel).  ''P'' and ''P''<sub>0</sub> must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If {{nowrap|1=''P'' = ''P''<sub>0</sub>}} in the above equation, then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> = 0. If ''P'' is greater than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is positive; if ''P'' is less than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for ''P'' in terms of ''P''<sub>0</sub> and ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>:\n:<math>\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\text{dB}} P_0.\n</math>\n\n===Field quantities and root-power quantities===\n{{main|Power, root-power, and field quantities}}\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of ''F'' (measured field) and ''F''<sub>0</sub> (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and historically their definitions were formulated to give the same value for relative ratios in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n:<math>\nL_F = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\,\\text{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n:<math>\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\text{dB}} F_0.\n</math>\n\nSimilarly, in [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation for power gain level ''L''<sub>''G''</sub>:\n:<math>\nL_G = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}}\\right)\\,\\text{dB},\n</math>\nwhere ''V''<sub>out</sub> is the [[root-mean-square]] (rms) output voltage, ''V''<sub>in</sub> is the rms input voltage. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term ''root-power quantity'' is introduced by ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-1:2009]] as a substitute of ''field quantity''.  The term ''field quantity'' is deprecated by that standard.\n\n===Relationship between power level and field level===\nAlthough power and field quantities are different quantities, their respective levels are historically measured in the same units, typically decibels.  A factor of 2 is introduced to make ''changes'' in the respective levels match under restricted conditions such as when the medium is linear and the ''same'' waveform is under consideration with changes in amplitude, or the medium impedance is linear and independent of both frequency and time.  This relies on the relationship\n:<math> \\frac{P(t)}{P_0} = \\left(\\frac{F(t)}{F_0}\\right)^2 </math>\nholding.<ref>{{citation |author=I M Mills |author2=B N Taylor |author3=A J Thor |title=Definitions of the units radian, neper, bel and decibel |year=2001 |journal=Metrologia |volume=38 |page=353 |number=4 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/38/4/8}}</ref>  In a nonlinear system, this relationship does not hold by the definition of linearity.  However, even in a [[linear system]] in which the power quantity is the product of two linearly related quantities (e.g. [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]]), if the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is frequency- or time-dependent, this relationship does not hold in general, for example if the energy spectrum of the waveform changes.\n\nFor differences in level, the required relationship is relaxed from that above to one of proportionality (i.e., the reference quantities ''P''{{sub|0}} and ''F''{{sub|0}} need not be related), or equivalently,\n:<math> \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{F_2}{F_1}\\right)^2 </math>\nmust hold to allow the power level difference to be equal to the field level difference from power ''P''{{sub|1}} and ''V''{{sub|1}} to ''P''{{sub|2}} and ''V''{{sub|2}}.  An example might be an amplifier with unity voltage gain independent of load and frequency driving a load with a frequency-dependent impedance: the relative voltage gain of the amplifier is always 0&nbsp;dB, but the power gain depends on the changing spectral composition of the waveform being amplified.  Frequency-dependent impedances may be analyzed by considering the quantities [[power spectral density]] and the associated field quantities via the [[Fourier transform]], which allows elimination of the frequency dependence in the analysis by analyzing the system at each frequency independently.\n\n===Conversions===\n\n\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion between units of level and a list of corresponding ratios\n!Unit !!

A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or {{frac|2}} is approximately a [[Half-power point|change of 3&nbsp;dB]]. More precisely, the change is \u00b13.0103&nbsp;dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3&nbsp;dB\" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of {{nowrap|{{sqrt|2}} \u2248 1.4142}}.  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6&nbsp;dB\" rather than \u00b16.0206&nbsp;dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional [[significant figures]].  3.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to a power ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|3|10}}</sup>, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly {{sqrt|2}}.  Similarly, an increase of 6.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to the power ratio is {{nowrap|10<sup>{{frac|6|10}}</sup> \u2248 3.9811}}, about 0.5% different from 4.\n\n==Properties==\nThe decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplied effects such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive.\n\n===Reporting large ratios===\nThe [[logarithmic scale]] nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a manner similar to [[scientific notation]]. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See ''[[Bode plot]]'' and ''[[Semi-log plot]]''.  For example, 120&nbsp;dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n\n===Representation of multiplication operations===\nLevel values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of [[amplifier]] stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, {{nowrap|log(''A'' \u00d7 ''B'' \u00d7 ''C'') }}= log(''A'') + log(''B'') + log(''C''). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1&nbsp;dB is a power gain of approximately 26%, 3&nbsp;dB is approximately 2\u00d7 power gain, and 10&nbsp;dB is 10\u00d7 power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10&nbsp;dB, 8&nbsp;dB, and 7&nbsp;dB respectively, for a total gain of 25&nbsp;dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1&nbsp;dB, this is:\n*:: 25&nbsp;dB = 10&nbsp;dB + 10&nbsp;dB + 3&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.26 \u00d7 1.26  \u2248 317.5&nbsp;W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10<sup>{{frac|25|10}}</sup> = 316.2&nbsp;W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value, which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\nHowever, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of [[slide rule]]s than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.<ref name=\"Hickling\">R.

To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.\" However, for the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations:<ref>R. J. Peters, ''Acoustics and Noise Control'', Routledge, 12 November 2013, 400 pages, p.&nbsp;13</ref> \"if two machines each individually produce a [[sound pressure]] level of, say, 90&nbsp;dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93&nbsp;dB, but certainly not to 180&nbsp;dB!\"; \"suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87&nbsp;dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83&nbsp;dBA.

(See also [[Stevens' power law]].)\n\n{{further|Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure}}\n\n===Electronics===\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (as for [[Gain (electronics)|gains]]) in preference to [[arithmetic]] ratios or [[percent]]ages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as [[amplifier]]s and [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]]) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium ([[free space optical communication|free space]], [[waveguide]], [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optics]], etc.) using a [[link budget]].\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a reference level, often indicated via a suffix, to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"[[dBm]]\".  A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259&nbsp;mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the [[dBu]].  This is relative to the [[root mean square]] voltage which delivers 1&nbsp;mW (0&nbsp;dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or {{sqrt|1&nbsp;mW&times;600&nbsp;\u03a9 }}\u2248 0.775&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are [[#dBu or dBv|identical]].\n\n===Optics===\nIn an [[optical link]], if a known amount of [[Optics|optical]] power, in [[dBm]] (referenced to 1&nbsp;mW), is launched into a [[Optical fiber|fiber]], and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Fiber optic installer's field manual\n | author-first = Bob |author-last=Chomycz\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n | year = 2000\n | isbn = 978-0-07-135604-6\n | pages = 123\u2013126\n | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=B810SYIAa4IC |page=123 }}\n }}</ref>\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the [[absorbance|blocking unit]] used to measure [[optical density]] is equivalent to \u22121&nbsp;B.\n\n===Video and digital imaging===\nIn connection with video and digital [[image sensor]]s, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20&nbsp;log of the ratio, even when the represented intensity (optical power) is directly proportional to the voltage generated by the sensor, not to its square, as in a [[CCD imager]] where response voltage is linear in intensity.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | title = The Colour Image Processing Handbook\n | author = Stephen J.

Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20&nbsp;log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the [[F-number#Stops.2C f-stop conventions.2C and exposure|stop]], to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\n=={{anchor|Suffixes}}Suffixes and reference values==\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1&nbsp;milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard [[SI prefix]]es.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside [[SI units]], the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.<ref name=NIST2008>Thompson, A. and Taylor, B.

There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of \u03bcV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"\u03bb\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a [[hyphen]], as in \"dB{{nbhyph}}Hz\", or with a space, as in \"dB&nbsp;HL\", or with no intervening character, as in \"dBm\", or enclosed in parentheses, as in \"dB(sm)\".\n\n===Voltage===\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n\n[[File:Relationship between dBu and dBm.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A schematic showing the relationship between [[dBu]] (the [[voltage source]]) and [[dBm]] (the power dissipated as [[heat]] by the 600&nbsp;\u03a9 [[resistor]])]]\n\n;dBV: dB(V<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>)&nbsp;\u2013 [[volt]]age relative to 1&nbsp;volt, regardless of impedance.<ref name = \"clqgmk\">{{citation |url=http://designtools.analog.com/dt/dbconvert/dbconvert.html |publisher=Analog Devices |title=Utilities : V<sub>RMS</sub> / dBm / dBu / dBV calculator |access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref> This is used to measure microphone sensitivity, and also to specify the consumer [[Line level|line-level]] of {{nowrap|\u221210 dBV}}, in order to reduce manufacturing costs relative to equipment using a {{nowrap|+4 dBu}} line-level signal.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TIfOAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22%E2%88%9210+dBV%22+%221+kHz%22#v=onepage&q=pickup&f=false|title=The Audio Expert: Everything You Need to Know About Audio|last=Winer|first=Ethan|publisher=Focal Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-240-82100-9|location=|pages=107}}</ref>\n\n;dBu or dBv: [[root mean square|RMS]] [[volt]]age relative to {{nowrap|<math>\\sqrt{0.6}\\,\\text{V}\\, \\approx 0.7746\\,\\text{V}</math>.}} An [[root mean square|RMS]] voltage of 1&nbsp;V therefore corresponds to <math>20\\cdot\\log_{10}\\left ( \\frac{1\\,V_\\text{RMS}}{\\sqrt{0.6}\\,V} \\right )=2.218\\,\\text{dBu}.</math><ref name=\"clqgmk\" /> Originally dBv, it was changed to dBu to avoid confusion with dBV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/pro/3-3-What-is-the-difference-between-dBv-dBu-dBV-dBm-dB.html|title=3.3&nbsp;\u2013 What is the difference between dBv, dBu, dBV, dBm, dB SPL, and plain old dB?

Full-scale may be defined as the power level of a full-scale [[Sine wave|sinusoid]] or alternatively a full-scale [[square wave]]. A signal measured with reference to a full-scale sine-wave appears 3&nbsp;dB weaker when referenced to a full-scale square wave, thus: 0&nbsp;dBFS(fullscale sine wave) = \u22123&nbsp;dBFS(fullscale square wave).\n;dBG: G-weighted spectrum\n;dBi: dB(isotropic) \u2013 the forward [[Antenna gain|gain of an antenna]] compared with the hypothetical [[isotropic antenna]], which uniformly distributes energy in all directions. [[Linear polarization]] of the EM field is assumed unless noted otherwise.\n;dBiC: dB(isotropic circular) \u2013 the forward gain of an antenna compared to a [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] isotropic antenna. There is no fixed conversion rule between dBiC and dBi, as it depends on the receiving antenna and the field polarization.\n;dBJ: energy relative to 1 [[joule]]. 1 joule = 1 watt second = 1 watt per hertz, so [[power spectral density]] can be expressed in dBJ.\n;dBk: dB(kW) \u2013 power relative to 1 [[kilowatt]].\n;dBK:'''dB(K)''' \u2013 decibels relative to [[kelvin]]: Used to express [[noise temperature]].\n;[[dBm]]: dB(mW) \u2013 power relative to 1 [[milliwatt]]. \n;[[dBm0]]: Power in dBm measured at a zero transmission level point.\n;dBm0s: Defined by  Recommendation ITU-R V.574.\n;dBmV: dB(mV<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>) \u2013 [[volt]]age relative to 1 millivolt across 75 \u03a9.\n;dBo: dB optical. A change of 1 dBo in optical power can result in a change of up to 2 dBe in electrical signal power in system that is thermal noise limited.\n;dBO: see dBov \n;dBov or dBO: dB(overload) \u2013 the [[amplitude]] of a signal (usually audio) compared with the maximum which a device can handle before [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]] occurs.  \n;dBpp: relative to the peak to peak sound pressure.\n;dBpp: relative to the maximum value of the peak power.\n;dBq: dB(quarterwave) \u2013 the forward gain of an antenna compared to a quarter wavelength whip. Rarely used, except in some marketing material. 0&nbsp;dBq = \u22120.85&nbsp;dBi\n;dBr: dB(relative) \u2013 simply a relative difference from something else, which is made apparent in context.  The difference of a filter's response to nominal levels, for instance.\n;[[dBrn]]: dB above [[reference noise]].  See also '''dBrnC'''\n;dBrnC: '''dBrnC''' represents an audio level measurement, typically in a telephone circuit, relative to the [[circuit noise level]], with the measurement of this level frequency-weighted by a standard C-message weighting filter.  The C-message weighting filter was chiefly used in North America.  \n;dBsm: dB(m\u00b2) \u2013 decibel relative to one square meter\n;dBTP: dB(true peak) \u2013 [[peak amplitude]] of a signal compared with the maximum which a device can handle before clipping occurs.\n;dBu or dBv: [[root mean square|RMS]] [[volt]]age relative to {{nowrap|<math>\\sqrt{0.6}\\,\\text{V}\\, \\approx 0.7746\\,\\text{V}\\, \\approx -2.218\\,\\text{dBV}</math>}}.\n;dBu0s: Defined by  Recommendation ITU-R V.574.\n;dBuV: see dB\u03bcV\n;dBuV/m: see dB\u03bcV/m\n;dBv: see dBu \n;dBV: dB(V<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>) \u2013 [[volt]]age relative to 1 volt, regardless of impedance.\n;dBVU: dB volume unit\n;dBW: dB(W) \u2013 power relative to 1 [[watt]].\n;[[DBZ (meteorology)|dBZ]]: dB(Z) \u2013 decibel relative to Z = 1&nbsp;mm<sup>6</sup>\u22c5m<sup>\u22123</sup>\n;dB\u03bc: see dB\u03bcV/m\n;dB\u03bcV or dBuV: dB(\u03bcV<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>) \u2013 [[volt]]age relative to 1 microvolt.\n;dB\u03bcV/m, dBuV/m, or dB\u03bc: dB(\u03bcV/m) \u2013 [[electric field strength]] relative to 1 [[microvolt]] per [[meter]].\n\n====Suffixes preceded by a space====\n;dB HL: dB hearing level is used in [[audiogram]]s as a measure of hearing loss. \n;dB Q: sometimes used to denote weighted noise level\n;dB SIL: dB [[sound intensity level]] \u2013 relative to 10<sup>\u221212</sup>&nbsp;W/m\u00b2 \n;dB SPL: dB SPL ([[sound pressure level]]) \u2013 for sound in air and other gases, relative to 20&nbsp;\u03bcPa in air or 1&nbsp;\u03bcPa in water\n;dB SWL: dB [[sound power level]] \u2013 relative to 10<sup>\u221212</sup>&nbsp;W.\n\n====Suffixes within parentheses====\n;dB(A), dB(B), and dB(C): These symbols are often used to denote the use of different [[weighting filter]]s, used to approximate the human ear's [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] to sound, although the measurement is still in dB (SPL). These measurements usually refer to noise and its effects on humans and other animals, and they are widely used in industry while discussing noise control issues, regulations and environmental standards. Other variations that may be seen are dB<sub>A</sub> or [[A-weighting|dBA]].\n\n====Other suffixes====\n;dB-Hz: dB(Hz) \u2013 bandwidth relative to one hertz. \n;dB/K: dB(K<sup>\u22121</sup>) \u2013 decibels relative to [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of [[kelvin]]\n;dBm<sup>\u22121</sup>: dB(m<sup>\u22121</sup>) \u2013 decibel relative to reciprocal of meter: measure of the [[antenna factor]].\n\n==Related units==\n;mBm: mB(mW) \u2013 power relative to 1 [[milliwatt]], in millibels (one hundredth of a decibel). 100&nbsp;mBm = 1&nbsp;dBm. This unit is in the Wi-Fi drivers of the [[Linux]] kernel<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw#Setting_TX_power|title=en:users:documentation:iw [Linux Wireless]|author=|date=|website=wireless.kernel.org}}</ref> and the regulatory domain sections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penturalabs.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/is-your-wifi-ap-missing-channels-12-13/|title=Is your WiFi AP Missing Channels 12 & 13?|author=|date=16 May 2013|website=wordpress.com}}</ref>\n\n;Np: Another closely related unit is the [[neper]] (Np).  Like the decibel, the neper is a unit of [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]].<ref name=\"standardization2006\"/>\n\n:<math>1\\ {\\rm Np} = 20 \\log_{10} e \\ {\\rm dB} \\approx 8{.}685889638 \\ {\\rm dB} \\, </math>\n\n==Fractions==\n[[Attenuation]] constants, in fields such as [[optical fiber]] communication and [[radio propagation]] [[path loss]], are often expressed as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] or ratio to distance of transmission. dB/m represents decibel per meter, dB/mi represents decibel per mile, for example. These quantities are to be manipulated obeying the rules of [[dimensional analysis]], e.g., a 100-meter run with a 3.5&nbsp;dB/km fiber yields a loss of 0.35&nbsp;dB = 3.5&nbsp;dB/km \u00d7 0.1&nbsp;km.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apparent magnitude]]\n* [[Cent (music)]]\n* [[dB drag racing]]\n* [[Decade (log scale)]]\n* [[Loudness]]\n* {{Section link|One-third octave|Base 10}}\n* [[pH]]\n* [[Phon]]\n* [[Richter magnitude scale]]\n* [[Sone]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |author-last=Tuffentsammer |author-first=Karl |title=Das Dezilog, eine Br\u00fccke zwischen Logarithmen, Dezibel, Neper und Normzahlen |language=German |trans-title=The decilog, a bridge between logarithms, decibel, neper and preferred numbers |journal=VDI-Zeitschrift |volume=98 |date=1956 |pages=267\u2013274}}\n* {{cite book |title=Logarithmen, Normzahlen, Dezibel, Neper, Phon - nat\u00fcrlich verwandt! |language=German |trans-title=Logarithms, preferred numbers, decibel, neper, phon - naturally related! |author-first=Eugen |author-last=Paulin |date=2007-09-01 |url=http://www.rechenschieber.org/Normzahlen.pdf |access-date=2016-12-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218223050/http://www.rechenschieber.org/Normzahlen.pdf |archive-date=2016-12-18}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/dB.html What is a decibel?
