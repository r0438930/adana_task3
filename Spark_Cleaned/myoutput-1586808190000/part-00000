Such changes, caused for example by a dislocation, change the [[trabecula]]r patterns inside the bones.

Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body.<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />\nIn the upright position, it prevents the trunk from falling backward without the need for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The iliofemoral ligament prevents excessive adduction and internal rotation of the hip.

There is also a small contribution from the foveal artery, a small vessel in the ligament of the head of the femur which is a branch of the [[posterior division of the obturator artery]], which becomes important to avoid [[avascular necrosis]] of the [[femur head|head of the femur]] when the blood supply from the medial and lateral circumflex arteries are disrupted (e.g. through fracture of the neck of the femur along their course).<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-383\" />\n\nThe hip has two anatomically important [[Anastomosis|anastomoses]], the [[Cruciate anastomosis|cruciate]] and the [[Trochanteric anastomosis|trochanteric anastomoses]], the latter of which provides most of the blood to the head of the femur.

Additionally, the following thigh muscles extend the hip: [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]], [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and long head of [[Biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]].

Such changes, caused for example by a dislocation, change the [[trabecula]]r patterns inside the bones.

The other system emerges on the lower part of the auricular surface, converges at the level of the [[superior gluteal line]], and is reflected laterally onto the upper part of the acetabulum.\n* In the femur, the first system lines up with a system arising from the lateral part of the femoral shaft to stretch to the inferior portion of the femoral neck and head.

All three strengthen the capsule and prevent an excessive range of movement in the joint. Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />\nIn the upright position, it prevents the trunk from falling backward without the need for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position.

The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial (internal) rotation while the pubofemoral ligament restricts abduction and internal rotation of the hip joint.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-200\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=200}}</ref>\nThe [[zona orbicularis]], which lies like a collar around the most narrow part of the [[femur neck|femoral neck]], is covered by the other ligaments which partly radiate into it.

The [[iliofemoral ligament]] inhibits lateral rotation and extension, this is why the hip can rotate laterally to a greater degree when it is flexed.\n* '''Medial''' or '''internal rotation''' (40\u00b0): anterior fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; the part of [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] inserted into the [[adductor tubercle]]; and, with the leg abducted also the [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]].\n* '''Extension''' or '''retroversion''' (20\u00b0): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] (if put out of action, active standing from a sitting position is not possible, but standing and walking on a flat surface is); dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]]; and [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]. Additionally, the following thigh muscles extend the hip: [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]], [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and long head of [[Biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]]. Maximal extension is inhibited by the [[iliofemoral ligament]].\n* '''Flexion''' or '''anteversion''' (140\u00b0): the [[hip flexor]]s: [[iliopsoas]] (with psoas major from vertebral column); [[tensor fasciae latae]], [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], and [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]]. Thigh muscles acting as hip flexors: [[Rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]] and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. Maximal flexion is inhibited by the thigh coming in contact with the chest.\n* '''Abduction''' (50\u00b0 with hip extended, 80\u00b0 with hip flexed): [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[fascia lata]]; [[Gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]. Maximal abduction is inhibited by the neck of the femur coming into contact with the lateral pelvis. When the hips are flexed, this delays the impingement until a greater angle.\n* '''Adduction''' (30\u00b0 with hip extended, 20\u00b0 with hip flexed): [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] with [[Adductor minimus muscle|adductor minimus]]; [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[gluteal tuberosity]]; [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]] (extends to the tibia); [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; and [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]. Of the thigh muscles, [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] is especially involved in hip adduction. Maximal adduction is impeded by the thighs coming into contact with one another. This can be avoided by abducting the opposite leg, or having the legs alternately flexed/extended at the hip so they travel in different planes and do not intersect.\n\n==Clinical significance==\nA [[hip fracture]] is a  [[bone fracture|break]] that occurs in the upper part of the femur.<ref name=AO2009>{{Cite web|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00392|title=Hip Fractures|date=April 2009|website=OrthoInfo - AAOS|access-date=2017-09-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629225405/http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00392|archivedate=29 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Symptoms may include pain around the hip particularly with movement and shortening of the leg.<ref name=AO2009/> The hip joint can be replaced by a [[prosthesis]] in a [[hip replacement]] operation due to fractures or illnesses such as [[osteoarthritis]]. [[Hip pain]] can have multiple sources and can also be associated with [[lower back pain]].\n\n== Sexual dimorphism and cultural significance ==\n[[File:Canova-Dancer with her hands on her hips 45degree view.jpg|thumb|Dancers often stand with hands on hips.]]\nIn humans, unlike other animals, the hip bones are substantially different in the two sexes. The hips of human females widen during [[puberty]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/pubhealth/modules/reproductiveHealth/anatomy.html\n| title = Reproductive Anatomy and Physiology\n| publisher = The Harriet and Robert Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health\n| accessdate = June 2009\n}}</ref><!-- - ref does not support female hips are wider - --> The [[femur|femora]] are also more widely spaced in females, so as to widen the opening in the hip bone and thus facilitate childbirth. Finally, the ilium and its muscle attachment are shaped so as to situate the buttocks away from the birth canal, where contraction of the buttocks could otherwise damage the baby.\n\nThe female hips have long been associated with both [[fertility]] and general expression of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Since broad hips facilitate [[birth|child birth]] and also serve as an anatomical cue of sexual maturity, they have been seen as an attractive trait for women for thousands of years. Many of the classical poses women take when sculpted, painted or photographed, such as the ''[[Grande Odalisque]]'', serve to emphasize the prominence of their hips. Similarly, [[fashion|women's fashion]] through the ages has often drawn attention to the girth of the wearer's hips.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\nFile:Slide2DAD.JPG|Hip joint.
