Jovan Miletic, a wealthy Serb merchant in Trieste, donated 24,000 florins to build a Serbian Elementary School in 1787. On July 1, 1792, the local government approved its opening and the \"Jovan Mileti\u0107\" private school began official operation, located in the city center, right beside the Saint Spyridon Church. A night school and reading room were opened in 1911.<ref name=\"Medakovic 1987\"/> In 1911 an asylum was added to the school, for Serbian political refugees, due to the constant warfare and bloodshed occurring between the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires on the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. The school represented a pillar of the Serbian community of Trieste, where the children of the wealthy Serbian merchants went to school and integrated into the city's community. In 1973 the school was shut down due to lack of student enrollment and became a Sunday school for Serbian language and culture. Velimir Djerasimovi\u0107, the school's principal and teacher since 1927, retired in 1973. Djerasimovi\u0107 is the father of Italian film actors [[Ivan Rassimov]] and [[Rada Rassimov]].\n\n===Saint Spyridon Church===\n{{main|Saint Spyridon Church, Trieste}}\n[[File:Trieste Serb-orthodox church of San-Spiridione3.jpg|300px|thumbnail|right|The [[Saint Spyridon Church, Trieste|St. Spyridon Serbian Orthodox Church]]]]\nIn 1782 the [[Serbian Orthodox]] and [[Greek Orthodox]] communities of Trieste split due to major disagreements concerning church rituals and language-usage, at which point the Greek community built its own church, dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]] in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style, and the Serbs continued to use the original church of [[Saint Spyridon]]. In 1861 the Serb community demolished the original church, and rebuilt it in [[Serbo-Byzantine Revival]] style, in order to \"stamp their identity architecturally in the midst of a baroque Austro-Italian city\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neomagazine.com/2010_11_november/_hellenes.html|title=The Greeks of Trieste &#124; Neo Magazine|author=Alexander Billinis|accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref> {{irrelevant citation|reason= Trieste is not a baroque city; article's author cites an unnamed person. |date=December 2014}} The church's construction was completed seven years later, in 1868.

Due to the contentious national border with [[Slovenia]], Italian society became increasingly hostile towards all [[Slavs]] in Trieste including the Serbs, and anti-Slavic racism began to flourish in Italy.<ref name=\"Catalan 2011\"/> The anti-Slavic feelings in Trieste were present already before the War, embodied by the local Liberal-National Party, led by Giuseppe Cuzzi, whose aim was to make Trieste completely [[Catholic]] and Italian. The anti-Slavic propaganda focused on the idea that Slavic people were barbaric and could not integrate properly into a civilized society.<ref name=\"Catalan 2011\"/> Tensions came to a hilt in [[World War Two]], when the Germans, who had occupied Northern Italy in September 1943, built the only Nazi Extermination Camp in Italy, \"[[Risiera di San Sabba]]\", on the outskirts of Trieste. Three thousand Jews, Serbs and other Slavs were executed here in 1944 while thousands more were imprisoned awaiting transfer to other extermination camps.<ref>{{cite book |last=Poprzeczny|first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Poprzeczny|year=2004 |title=Odilo Globocnik Hitler's Man in the East}}</ref>\n\n===Monuments===\n[[File:Trieste-Canal Grande-DSCF1420.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|The Palazzo Gopcevich]]\nBesides the Saint Spyridon Church and the Jovan Mileti\u0107 Serbian School, the Serbs of Trieste contributed to several other important landmarks of the city. The Gop\u010devi\u0107 family built the \"Palazzo Gopcevich\" on the Canal Grande, near the Serbian Church, in 1850 in commemoration to the heroes who fought for the [[Second Serbian Uprising|independence of Serbia from the Ottoman Empire]] (1814). Cristoforo Popovich owned many famous merchant ships in Trieste, some of the largest in the Adriatic: the \"Tartana\", \"Il Feroce Dalmata\", \"La Forza\" and the \"Ripatriato\", and was instrumental to the Russian-side in the Crimean War (1853-1856). Cristoforo Scuglievich (Skuljevic) built the Palazzo Scuglievich in the mid-1800s along the banks of the city, and donated the palace in his will to the Serbian community of Trieste; today it is owned by the Serb community.<ref name=\"Medakovi\u0107 1987\"/>\n\n===Serbian Writers===\nThe Serbian community of Trieste had a deep and long-lasting relationship with Serbian writers from the 18th century to today. Iconic [[Serbian literature|Serbian writers]] and linguists such as [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]], [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], [[Zaharije Orfelin]] and [[Pavle Solari\u0107]] were inspired by Trieste and its developed Serbian community.<ref name=\"Gorup 2006\"/>  They wrote many works on Trieste's influence on Serbian \"pre-Romanticism\" and cultural development during a time when the Serbs lacked statehood and cultural expression. Serbian linguist and creator of the standardized Serbian language, [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], kept in constant contact with Trieste's Serb community from his home in [[Vienna]]. In 1813 Vuk called upon the Triestan Serbs to subscribe to the Serbian-language newspaper, \"Novine Serbske\" promoting the newly standardized Serbian language, and more than sixty copies of the standard Serbian dictionary were bought in 1814.<ref name=\"Gorup 2006\"/> [[Lukijan Mu\u0161icki]] wrote an ode to Serbian merchants of Trieste in 1835, and revolutionary writer Dositej Obradovi\u0107 tutored the children of the wealthy Serb merchants.<ref name=\"Gorup 2006\"/> Many [[Serbian epic poetry|Serbian poets]] and folklorists {{Who|date=December 2014}} even worked in the Saint Spyridon Church for a time. An almost universal feeling of inspiration and admiration of Trieste's wealthy Serb community was shared by their Balkan-Serb contemporaries.{{Who|date=December 2014}}\n\n=== Modern Day ===\nToday, Serbian-born Serbs represent the largest foreign-born community in Trieste, numbering around 10,000, although some figures state anywhere up to 18,000.<ref name=\"ISTAT 2010\">http://www.demo.istat.it/str2010/index03_e.html</ref> The overwhelming majority of Serbs in Trieste today descend from the immigration wave following the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the 90s.

Jovan Miletic, a wealthy Serb merchant in Trieste, donated 24,000 florins to build a Serbian Elementary School in 1787. On July 1, 1792, the local government approved its opening and the \"Jovan Mileti\u0107\" private school began official operation, located in the city center, right beside the Saint Spyridon Church. A night school and reading room were opened in 1911.<ref name=\"Medakovic 1987\"/> In 1911 an asylum was added to the school, for Serbian political refugees, due to the constant warfare and bloodshed occurring between the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires on the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. The school represented a pillar of the Serbian community of Trieste, where the children of the wealthy Serbian merchants went to school and integrated into the city's community. In 1973 the school was shut down due to lack of student enrollment and became a Sunday school for Serbian language and culture. Velimir Djerasimovi\u0107, the school's principal and teacher since 1927, retired in 1973. Djerasimovi\u0107 is the father of Italian film actors [[Ivan Rassimov]] and [[Rada Rassimov]].\n\n===Saint Spyridon Church===\n{{main|Saint Spyridon Church, Trieste}}\n[[File:Trieste Serb-orthodox church of San-Spiridione3.jpg|300px|thumbnail|right|The [[Saint Spyridon Church, Trieste|St. Spyridon Serbian Orthodox Church]]]]\nIn 1782 the [[Serbian Orthodox]] and [[Greek Orthodox]] communities of Trieste split due to major disagreements concerning church rituals and language-usage, at which point the Greek community built its own church, dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]] in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style, and the Serbs continued to use the original church of [[Saint Spyridon]]. In 1861 the Serb community demolished the original church, and rebuilt it in [[Serbo-Byzantine Revival]] style, in order to \"stamp their identity architecturally in the midst of a baroque Austro-Italian city\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neomagazine.com/2010_11_november/_hellenes.html|title=The Greeks of Trieste &#124; Neo Magazine|author=Alexander Billinis|accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref> {{irrelevant citation|reason= Trieste is not a baroque city; article's author cites an unnamed person. |date=December 2014}} The church's construction was completed seven years later, in 1868.

Due to the contentious national border with [[Slovenia]], Italian society became increasingly hostile towards all [[Slavs]] in Trieste including the Serbs, and anti-Slavic racism began to flourish in Italy.<ref name=\"Catalan 2011\"/> The anti-Slavic feelings in Trieste were present already before the War, embodied by the local Liberal-National Party, led by Giuseppe Cuzzi, whose aim was to make Trieste completely [[Catholic]] and Italian. The anti-Slavic propaganda focused on the idea that Slavic people were barbaric and could not integrate properly into a civilized society.<ref name=\"Catalan 2011\"/> Tensions came to a hilt in [[World War Two]], when the Germans, who had occupied Northern Italy in September 1943, built the only Nazi Extermination Camp in Italy, \"[[Risiera di San Sabba]]\", on the outskirts of Trieste. Three thousand Jews, Serbs and other Slavs were executed here in 1944 while thousands more were imprisoned awaiting transfer to other extermination camps.<ref>{{cite book |last=Poprzeczny|first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Poprzeczny|year=2004 |title=Odilo Globocnik Hitler's Man in the East}}</ref>\n\n===Monuments===\n[[File:Trieste-Canal Grande-DSCF1420.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|The Palazzo Gopcevich]]\nBesides the Saint Spyridon Church and the Jovan Mileti\u0107 Serbian School, the Serbs of Trieste contributed to several other important landmarks of the city. The Gop\u010devi\u0107 family built the \"Palazzo Gopcevich\" on the Canal Grande, near the Serbian Church, in 1850 in commemoration to the heroes who fought for the [[Second Serbian Uprising|independence of Serbia from the Ottoman Empire]] (1814). Cristoforo Popovich owned many famous merchant ships in Trieste, some of the largest in the Adriatic: the \"Tartana\", \"Il Feroce Dalmata\", \"La Forza\" and the \"Ripatriato\", and was instrumental to the Russian-side in the Crimean War (1853-1856). Cristoforo Scuglievich (Skuljevic) built the Palazzo Scuglievich in the mid-1800s along the banks of the city, and donated the palace in his will to the Serbian community of Trieste; today it is owned by the Serb community.<ref name=\"Medakovi\u0107 1987\"/>\n\n===Serbian Writers===\nThe Serbian community of Trieste had a deep and long-lasting relationship with Serbian writers from the 18th century to today. Iconic [[Serbian literature|Serbian writers]] and linguists such as [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]], [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], [[Zaharije Orfelin]] and [[Pavle Solari\u0107]] were inspired by Trieste and its developed Serbian community.<ref name=\"Gorup 2006\"/>  They wrote many works on Trieste's influence on Serbian \"pre-Romanticism\" and cultural development during a time when the Serbs lacked statehood and cultural expression. Serbian linguist and creator of the standardized Serbian language, [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], kept in constant contact with Trieste's Serb community from his home in [[Vienna]]. In 1813 Vuk called upon the Triestan Serbs to subscribe to the Serbian-language newspaper, \"Novine Serbske\" promoting the newly standardized Serbian language, and more than sixty copies of the standard Serbian dictionary were bought in 1814.<ref name=\"Gorup 2006\"/> [[Lukijan Mu\u0161icki]] wrote an ode to Serbian merchants of Trieste in 1835, and revolutionary writer Dositej Obradovi\u0107 tutored the children of the wealthy Serb merchants.<ref name=\"Gorup 2006\"/> Many [[Serbian epic poetry|Serbian poets]] and folklorists {{Who|date=December 2014}} even worked in the Saint Spyridon Church for a time.
