The words \"[[melancholia]]\", an old word for depression, and \"mania\" originated in Ancient Greece. The word melancholia is derived from ''melas'' ({{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2}}), meaning \"black\", and ''chole'' ({{lang|grc|\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae}}), meaning \"bile\" or \"gall\",{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1980}} indicative of the term's origins in pre-Hippocratic [[humoral theory]]. Within the humoral theories, mania was viewed as arising from an excess of yellow bile, or a mixture of black and yellow bile. The linguistic origins of mania, however, are not so clear-cut. Several etymologies were proposed by the Ancient Roman physician [[Caelius Aurelianus]], including the Greek word ''ania'', meaning \"to produce great mental anguish\", and ''manos'', meaning \"relaxed\" or \"loose\", which would contextually approximate to an excessive relaxing of the mind or soul.<ref name=\"Angst-2001\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Angst J, Marneros A | title = Bipolarity from ancient to modern times: conception, birth and rebirth | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 67 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 3\u201319 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11869749 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0327(01)00429-3 }}</ref> There are at least five other candidates, and part of the confusion surrounding the exact etymology of the word mania is its varied usage in the pre-Hippocratic poetry and mythology.<ref name=\"Angst-2001\" />\n\nIn the early 1800s, French psychiatrist [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol]]'s lypemania, one of his affective [[monomania]]s, was the first elaboration on what was to become modern depression.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Borch-Jacobsen M | title = Which came first, the condition or the drug? | journal = London Review of Books | volume = 32 | issue = 19 | pages = 31\u201333 | date = October 2010 | url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n19/mikkel-borch-jacobsen/which-came-first-the-condition-or-the-drug | quote = at the beginning of the 19th century with Esquirol's 'affective monomanias' (notably 'lypemania', the first elaboration of what was to become our modern depression) | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150313201452/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n19/mikkel-borch-jacobsen/which-came-first-the-condition-or-the-drug | archivedate = March 13, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The basis of the current conceptualization of bipolar illness can be traced back to the 1850s.
