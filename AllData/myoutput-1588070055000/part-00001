The third and final of the pair's albums for the label, it is a suite of selections from the [[George Gershwin]] [[opera]] '''[[Porgy and Bess]]'''. [[Arrangement|Orchestral arrangements]] are by [[Russell Garcia (composer)|Russell Garcia]], who had previously arranged the 1956 jazz vocal recording ''[[The Complete Porgy and Bess]]''.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1959, [[Porgy and Bess (film)|a big-budget film version]] produced by [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and directed [[Otto Preminger]] arrived in theaters. To coincide with the film, many jazz and vocal versions of the work were produced on [[LP album|records]], this one and the celebrated [[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Miles Davis and Gil Evans collaboration]] among them. The double album was released in both mono and stereo, and on [[compact disc]] in 1990. It is also part of the set ''[[The Complete Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong on Verve]]'' issued in 1997. Given the nature of the work, only five tracks feature vocals by both Armstrong and Fitzgerald.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2001, it was awarded a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]], a special achievement prize established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old, and that have \"qualitative or historical significance.\"<ref>[http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame Grammy Hall of Fame Database]</ref> The album is considered the most musically successful amongst the jazz vocal versions of the opera.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe [[AllMusic]] review of the album claimed \"What's really great about the Ella and Louis version is Ella, who handles each aria with disarming delicacy, clarion intensity, or usually a blend of both...
