The Taguig River, a tributary of the [[Pasig River]], cuts through the northern half of the city while the Napindan River, another tributary of the Pasig, forms the common border of Taguig with Pasig.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence they were referred to as \"''mga taga-giik'',\" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"rice thresher\") and the settlement as \"''pook ng mga taga-giik''.\" Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] who crossed [[Pasig River]] to reach the city's present site in 1571, found \"taga-giik\" difficult to pronounce. \"Tagui-ig\" was later shortened to its current form \"Taguig\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/our-city/history/|title=History|website=Official Website of The City of Taguig|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the [[Spaniards]] came, Taguig was a part of [[Namayan]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] ruled by [[Lakandula]]. There were also accounts that [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements were once present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nTaguig was one of the earliest known territories to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1571. Between the years 1582 and 1583, Taguig was part of the encomienda of Tondo headed by an alcalde mayor, Captain Vergara. It was in 1587 when Taguig was established as a separate \"[[pueblo]]\" (town) of the then province of [[Manila]]. Captain Juan Basi was its Kapitan from 1587 to 1588. According to records, Taguig had nine (9) barrios then namely, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy, Palingon, Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan, Ususan, and Wawa. Records show that Tipas had once petitioned to become an independent town but was denied by the Spanish government.\n\nDuring that time, Taguig was accessible via the [[Pasig River]], which was connected to two large bodies of water, the [[Manila Bay]] and [[Laguna de Bay]]. The population then was estimated to be 800 tributes. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and \"sawali\" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. During that early period of Spanish colonization. Don Juan Basi, \"Kapitan\" of Taguig from 1587 to 1588, took part in the [[Tondo Conspiracy]], an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. When the [[Katipunan]] was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898.\n\nDuring the [[United States|American]] occupation, they struggled against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1898, Filipino forces including Taguig \"revolutionarios\" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] and [[Fort Bonifacio]]. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.\n\nThe defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Meritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act. No. 137 on June 11, 1901. On October 12, 1903, Taguig, [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was segregated from it and made part of [[Bi\u00f1an]] when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. However it was returned to Taguig on March 22, 1905 with the promulgation Act. No. 1308. On February 29, 1908, Taguig was again declared an independent municipality through Executive Order No. 20. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig and both became independent municipalities of Rizal province on January 1, 1918.\n\nIt was also during the American Colonial Period that the US government acquired a 25.78&nbsp;km\u00b2 property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort McKinley (named after [[William McKinley]], 25th president of the U.S.). When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. They occupied the military camp until the end of the war in 1945. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the [[United States]] on July 4, 1946, the US surrendered the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, [[Fort William McKinley]] was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]] after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio.\n\nThe town's political subdivision was changed to barangays following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) in the 1970s when the country was under [[Martial Law]]. The IRP has increased its subdivisions into 18 barangays, namely, Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to form the [[National Capital Region]] through Presidential Decree No. 824.\n\nIn 1998, a bill was passed in Congress pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite in April showed that the citizens were against cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and the Supreme Court on February 19, 2004 ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city (21,105 'yes' and 19,460 'no'). Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004. In 2008, the City Council created 10 new barangays, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. Hence, in December 2008, after a successful plebiscite, the numbers of barangays in the city increased from 10 to 28 barangays. The 10 newly created barangays were Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag.\n\nIn 2011, doing 424th foundation day of Taguig, former Mayor (now Congresswoman) Lani Cayetano takes pride in calling the city a \u201cProbinSyudad\u201d because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city, yet has the feel and relaxing atmosphere of a province plus its people exude the values and magandang asal of the probinsyano, what with its more than 10 kilometers of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of pagtutulungan is still very much alive.\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Taguig\n| 1903 = 6829\n| 1918 = 8423\n| 1939 = 12087\n| 1948 = 15340\n| 1960 = 21856\n| 1970 = 55257\n| 1975 = 73702\n| 1980 = 134137\n| 1990 = 266637\n| 1995 = 381350\n| 2000 = 467375\n| 2007 = 613343\n| 2010 = 644473\n| 2015 = 804915\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\n==Local government==\n{{See also|Cities of the Philippines}}\nLike other cities in the Philippines, Taguig is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms.

A portion of the base, including the ''[[Heroes' Cemetery|Libingan ng mga Bayani]]'' (Heroes' Cemetery) and the [[Manila American Cemetery and Memorial]] lies within Taguig, while the northern portion where the development center is now located used to be considered part of Makati, but is currently and permanently considered part of Taguig.

The Taguig River, a tributary of the [[Pasig River]], cuts through the northern half of the city while the Napindan River, another tributary of the Pasig, forms the common border of Taguig with Pasig.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence they were referred to as \"''mga taga-giik'',\" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"rice thresher\") and the settlement as \"''pook ng mga taga-giik''.\" Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] who crossed [[Pasig River]] to reach the city's present site in 1571, found \"taga-giik\" difficult to pronounce. \"Tagui-ig\" was later shortened to its current form \"Taguig\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/our-city/history/|title=History|website=Official Website of The City of Taguig|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the [[Spaniards]] came, Taguig was a part of [[Namayan]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] ruled by [[Lakandula]]. There were also accounts that [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements were once present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nTaguig was one of the earliest known territories to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1571. Between the years 1582 and 1583, Taguig was part of the encomienda of Tondo headed by an alcalde mayor, Captain Vergara. It was in 1587 when Taguig was established as a separate \"[[pueblo]]\" (town) of the then province of [[Manila]]. Captain Juan Basi was its Kapitan from 1587 to 1588. According to records, Taguig had nine (9) barrios then namely, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy, Palingon, Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan, Ususan, and Wawa. Records show that Tipas had once petitioned to become an independent town but was denied by the Spanish government.\n\nDuring that time, Taguig was accessible via the [[Pasig River]], which was connected to two large bodies of water, the [[Manila Bay]] and [[Laguna de Bay]]. The population then was estimated to be 800 tributes. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and \"sawali\" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. During that early period of Spanish colonization. Don Juan Basi, \"Kapitan\" of Taguig from 1587 to 1588, took part in the [[Tondo Conspiracy]], an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. When the [[Katipunan]] was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898.\n\nDuring the [[United States|American]] occupation, they struggled against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1898, Filipino forces including Taguig \"revolutionarios\" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] and [[Fort Bonifacio]]. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.\n\nThe defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Meritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act. No. 137 on June 11, 1901. On October 12, 1903, Taguig, [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was segregated from it and made part of [[Bi\u00f1an]] when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. However it was returned to Taguig on March 22, 1905 with the promulgation Act. No. 1308. On February 29, 1908, Taguig was again declared an independent municipality through Executive Order No. 20. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig and both became independent municipalities of Rizal province on January 1, 1918.\n\nIt was also during the American Colonial Period that the US government acquired a 25.78&nbsp;km\u00b2 property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort McKinley (named after [[William McKinley]], 25th president of the U.S.). When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. They occupied the military camp until the end of the war in 1945. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the [[United States]] on July 4, 1946, the US surrendered the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, [[Fort William McKinley]] was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]] after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio.\n\nThe town's political subdivision was changed to barangays following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) in the 1970s when the country was under [[Martial Law]]. The IRP has increased its subdivisions into 18 barangays, namely, Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to form the [[National Capital Region]] through Presidential Decree No. 824.\n\nIn 1998, a bill was passed in Congress pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite in April showed that the citizens were against cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and the Supreme Court on February 19, 2004 ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city (21,105 'yes' and 19,460 'no'). Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004. In 2008, the City Council created 10 new barangays, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. Hence, in December 2008, after a successful plebiscite, the numbers of barangays in the city increased from 10 to 28 barangays. The 10 newly created barangays were Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag.\n\nIn 2011, doing 424th foundation day of Taguig, former Mayor (now Congresswoman) Lani Cayetano takes pride in calling the city a \u201cProbinSyudad\u201d because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city, yet has the feel and relaxing atmosphere of a province plus its people exude the values and magandang asal of the probinsyano, what with its more than 10 kilometers of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of pagtutulungan is still very much alive.\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Taguig\n| 1903 = 6829\n| 1918 = 8423\n| 1939 = 12087\n| 1948 = 15340\n| 1960 = 21856\n| 1970 = 55257\n| 1975 = 73702\n| 1980 = 134137\n| 1990 = 266637\n| 1995 = 381350\n| 2000 = 467375\n| 2007 = 613343\n| 2010 = 644473\n| 2015 = 804915\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\n==Local government==\n{{See also|Cities of the Philippines}}\nLike other cities in the Philippines, Taguig is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms.

This Philippine military base, most of which has been converted to a modern commercial and residential development area, lies in an ambiguous area. A portion of the base, including the ''[[Heroes' Cemetery|Libingan ng mga Bayani]]'' (Heroes' Cemetery) and the [[Manila American Cemetery and Memorial]] lies within Taguig, while the northern portion where the development center is now located used to be considered part of Makati, but is currently and permanently considered part of Taguig. A 2003 ruling by a judge in the Pasig Regional Trial Court has upheld the jurisdiction of Taguig over the whole of Fort Bonifacio, including Barangay Pinagsama and Bonifacio Global City.\n\n===Ruling===\nThe Supreme Court on June 27, 2008 per [[Leonardo Quisumbing]], dismissed the suit of the [[Makati]], seeking to nullify Special Patents 3595 and 3596 signed by [[Fidel Ramos]] conveying to the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] public land in [[Fort Bonifacio]], Taguig. Because of a pending civil case filed by the Taguig City government asking the court to define its territorial boundaries, Makati therefore cannot stop Taguig from collecting taxes on land located in Fort Bonifacio.<ref>[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=police2_june30_2008 Court junks Makati's suit to nullify Ramos patents], manilastandardtoday.com; accessed August 10, 2015.</ref><ref>[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2008/june2008/163175.htm Binay v Taguig, G.R.
