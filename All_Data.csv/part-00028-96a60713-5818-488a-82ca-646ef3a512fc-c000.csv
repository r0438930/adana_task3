==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] 
The two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>

=== Social life ===
There was one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L’Osservatore Romano]], which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements, including the existing marble floors and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factory for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>

Great efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discoveries of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>
[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]

=== Protestants and Jews ===
{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}
The Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time. At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>

In 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\".<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls to return the child to his parents, from [[The Times|''The Times'']], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont,<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> were politely rejected.

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists — both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution — saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

===Prisoner of the Vatican===
In 1929, the papacy — then under [[Pope Pius XI]] — renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists — both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution — saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

===Prisoner of the Vatican===
In 1929, the papacy — then under [[Pope Pius XI]] — renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>

The '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.

A view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th 
century is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book 
|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About
|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,
written by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at 
the time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's 
subjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] 
The two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

The '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] 
The two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>

=== Social life ===
Their one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L’Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>

Great efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discovers of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>
[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]

=== Protestants and Jews ===
{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}
The Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>

In 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists — both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution — saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854, a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve, and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only element, of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]]

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]].

The Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome.

He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents.

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists — both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution — saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

===Prisoner of the Vatican===

The '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.

A view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th 
century is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book

written by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at 
the time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's 
subjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance  [[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]] background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|thumb|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible, that the Northern Italians were more adapt to exploit economically the modern means of communication that the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed even poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities.

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

[[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists — both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution — saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

The '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.

A view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th 
century is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book 
|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About

written by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at 
the time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's 
subjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854, a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve, and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only element, of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] 
The two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission in.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>

=== Social life ===
Their one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L’Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>

Great efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discovers of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>
[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]

=== Protestants and Jews ===
{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}
The Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>

In 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].

The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===

In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|thumb|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854, a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve, and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only element, of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]]

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>

Great efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853.

[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]

=== Protestants and Jews ===
{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}
The Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>

In 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists — both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution — saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

===Prisoner of the Vatican===
In 1929, the papacy — then under [[Pope Pius XI]] — renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>

The '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.

A view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th 
century is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer.

Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]].

{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}
The Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome.

In 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died.

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists — both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution — saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

===Prisoner of the Vatican===
In 1929, the papacy — then under [[Pope Pius XI]] — renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>

The '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.

A view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th 
century is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book 
|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About
|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,
written by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at 
the time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's 
subjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] 
The two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission in.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>

=== Social life ===
Their one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L’Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]].

The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve, and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only element, of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] 
The two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission in.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>

=== Social life ===
Their one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L’Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>

Great efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discovers of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>
[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]

=== Protestants and Jews ===
{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}
The Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>

In 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists — both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution — saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy.

The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] 
The two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission in.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>

=== Social life ===
Their one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L’Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>

Great efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discovers of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>
[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]

=== Protestants and Jews ===
{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}
The Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>

In 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists — both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution — saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

===Prisoner of the Vatican===
In 1929, the papacy — then under [[Pope Pius XI]] — renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>

'''Lakas–CMD''' ('''Lakas–Christian Muslim Democrats''') is a [[centre-right politics|center-right]] political party in the [[Philippines]], influenced by [[Christian democracy]] and [[Islamic democracy]]. The current party originated in 2009 with the merger of the [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|original Lakas–CMD]] party with the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI); it was known as '''Lakas–Kampi–CMD''' until 2012. The party produced one president, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who was president when the two parties merged in 2009.

With Arroyo unable to run for a new term due to term limits, the party lost the [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010 presidential election]] with [[Gilberto Teodoro]] as its presidential nominee. The party retained its two [[Philippine Senate|senators]], both incumbents, in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|Senate election]] and became a part of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]-led majority coalition; in the [[2010 Philippine House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives election]], it won 47% of the seats contested in the district election, but most of its members were split into three groups, with many defecting to the Liberal Party, some formed the [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], and the remaining members were split into the majority and minority blocs, with its members heading the minority.

==Ideology==
Lakas–CMD has always focused on economic growth and development, stronger ties with the [[United States]], creation of jobs, and strong cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of government. It is known for its advocacy of a shift from the present [[presidential system]] to a parliamentary form of government through constitutional amendments and through establishing peace talks with [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] separatists and [[communism|communist]] rebels. The party democracy is distinct in its ecumenical inclusion of Muslim leaders in its political alliance.<ref name= \"Centre-right\" >{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCrTDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA195&|title=Southeast Asia In The New International Era|newspaper=|date=2016|author1=|author2=|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Lakas–CMD (1991)|Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino}}

===Ramos administration===
[[Image:Ramos Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|150px|President Fidel V. Ramos, co-founder of Lakas NUCD.]]
Lakas ng Tao was formed in December 1991 for the [[1992 Philippine general election|1992 elections]] as retired General, then-Defense Secretary, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] and former [[Cebu]] Governor [[Emilio Mario Osmeña|Emilio Mario \"Lito\" R. Osmeña]] were running for president and vice-president respectively. It was also formed when Ramos bolted from the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of Democratic Filipinos), after he had lost in the bid for the presidency under that said banner to Speaker [[Ramon Mitra]].

The party was formed out of two parties: Ramos's Partido Lakas ng Tao (People Power Party) and the National Union of Christian Democrats of [[Raul Manglapus]].  As they coalesced, the party became known as Lakas ng Tao-[[Lakas–CMD (1991)|National Union of Christian Democrats]], with Lakas ng Tao usually just shortened to \"Lakas\" and abbreviated as Lakas-NUCD.

In 1994, it formed a coalition government with the LDP for the [[1995 Philippine general election|1995 legislative elections]].  This coalition, dubbed the \"[[Lakas-Laban Coalition]]\", won a majority in both Houses of Congress. In the 1997 Lakas National Convention, the party nominated House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] of [[Pangasinan]] after a close nominal fight with then Defense Secretary [[Renato de Villa]] as its nominee to the presidency against the opposition's Vice President [[Joseph Estrada]] in the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  By this time, it was joined by the Union of Muslim Democrats of the Philippines of former ambassador to Egypt and Oman [[Sanchez Ali|Sanchez A. Ali]] to form Lakas ng EDSA-National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines.

Secretary de Villa eventually bolted the party and formed [[Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma]] (Democratic Reform Party) for the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  Lakas also nominated then-Senator [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] of [[Pampanga]] as its candidate as [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]]. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino|Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI). De Venecia lost to Vice President Estrada by a significant plurality, while Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner while her KAMPI party was in hiatus.

===Arroyo administration===
In the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 elections]], the name changed again to the current Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats, or Lakas–CMD.  However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name is usually now referred to as \"Lakas ng [[EDSA I|EDSA]]\" which means \"The Strength of EDSA\" than the original Lakas ng Tao which means \"The Strength of the People\" or \"People Power.\"  This is also the name that it used when it ran in 2004 elections under the K-4 coalition.  President Arroyo, who succeeded the deposed President [[Joseph Estrada]], was the K-4 Coalition candidate for president in the 2004 election, eventually winning over her opponents primarily [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] and Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]].<ref name= \"Centre-right\" />

At the onset of 2006, Lakas–CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]].  Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap mid-term elections (or \"no-el\") set for 2007 and calls for her to step down in time for the elections, which is related to the \"no-el\" controversy. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting on January 14, 2006 to discuss these matters.

There are no official results available of the 2007 [[elections in the Philippines|elections]] released by the party but according to the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], the party holds 79 out of 235 seats.

On January 16, 2008, Lakas spokesman and legal counsel [[Raul Lambino]] stated that Lakas–CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010—spokesman  in 2010. Except for Parañaque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified. But Lambino named incumbent Senators [[Ramon Revilla, Jr.]] and [[Lito Lapid]], former senator [[Ralph Recto]] and former Congressman [[Prospero Pichay]] as among those considered.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman  Inquirer.net, Lakas lists down 30 senatorial bets for 2010--spokesman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910230132/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman |date=2012-09-10 }}</ref>

Former Speaker of the House [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] (Pangasinan -4th District) resigned his post as president of Lakas–CMD on March 10, 2008; he rejected the proposition of former president [[Fidel Ramos]] to give him the title Chairman-emeritus. The current Speaker of the House [[Prospero Nograles]] (Davao -1st District) was sworn it as the new president of Lakas–CMD party and former Speaker of the house [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] as vice president for Metro Manila affairs on the same day.

[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on June 18, 2008, confirmed the historical [[merger]] of the [[Lakas-CMD (1991)|Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats]] (Lakas–CMD) and the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) parties. Both parties adopted the \"equity of the incumbent\" principle, as the merger would account for almost 200 national and 8,000 local officials, amid Mrs. Arroyo's prediction of  2010 elections victory. [[Prospero Nograles]], Lakas President and Kampi Chair [[Ronaldo Puno]] signed the covenant at the [[Davao City]] regional [[caucus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news4_june19_2008|title=Manila Standard Today - Latest News in the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/101994/Lakas-CMD-Kampi-merge|title=Lakas-CMD, Kampi merge|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> Former President and Lakas–CMD Chairman Emeritus [[Fidel V.

On August 9, 2009, Former House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] and Former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] led fifty members from the Lakas Kampi CMD in objecting to its merger with [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) on May 28, 2009. The faction made de Venecia its President with Ramos as the Chairman Emeritus of the new party, Ramos refused the offer of Chairman Emeritus of Lakas-Kampi after being named in interim party organization. De Venecia has filed a resolution at the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] to declare ''null and void'' the merger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090909-224323/Lakas-Kampi-CMD-merger-in-peril|title=Lakas-Kampi-CMD merger in peril - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos|accessdate=19 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162726/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090909-224323/Lakas-Kampi-CMD-merger-in-peril|archivedate=27 April 2015}}</ref> However, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] ultimately upheld the legality of the merger,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideNation.htm?f=2010/january/1/nation3.isx&d=/2010/january/1|title=Manila Standard Today - Latest News in the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> citing the failure of de Venecia \"to sufficiently show that any grave abuse of discretion was committed by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] in rendering the challenged resolution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=537212&publicationSubCategoryId=63|title=Taxi hinoldap|work=philstar.com|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>

===Aquino III administration===
Since [[Benigno Aquino III]] was sworn in as President of the Philippines on June 30, 2010, the majority of the former legislative member of Lakas-Kampi were sworn as a members of the reborn [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]. In 2011, the legislators led by [[Pablo P. Garcia]] established the neutral [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], which has many similarities with the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]]. In 2013, the party suffered its largest decline, due  to the arrest of the party's [[matriarchy|matriarch]], Gloria Arroyo; however the remaining party largely supports the [[United Nationalist Alliance]], with candidates from among its former members such as [[Migz Zubiri]], [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] and [[Mitos Magsaysay]].

===Duterte administration and dissolution===
{{main|Coalition for Change (Philippines)}}
In the [[2016 Philippine presidential election|2016 Presidential Elections]], Lakas supports the candidacy of [[Rodrigo Roa Duterte|Rodrigo \"Rody/Digong\" Duterte]] and [[Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.|Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, Jr.]] for President and Vice President respectively, which Duterte won and Marcos lost to Liberal Party candidate [[Leni Robredo|Ma. Leonora \"Leni\" Robredo]]. In July 2017, Revilla was sworn into Duterte's party [[PDP-Laban]], and in October, Macapagal Arroyo and her allies, also joins PDP-Laban, as a result Lakas has been dissolved.

===Proposed Comeback===

In September 2018 House Minority Leader and Quezon Rep. Danilo Suarez announced that Lakas–CMD is rebuilding and \"will soon regain the political dominance it lost after Arroyo stepped down as president in 2010.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/09/26/lakas-cmd-party-rebuilding-gma-return-being-anticipated/|title=Lakas-CMD party rebuilding; GMA return being anticipated|work=Manila Bulletin News|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}</ref>

'''Lakas–CMD''' ('''Lakas–Christian Muslim Democrats''') is a [[centre-right politics|center-right]] political party in the [[Philippines]], influenced by [[Christian democracy]] and [[Islamic democracy]]. The current party originated in 2009 with the merger of the [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|original Lakas–CMD]] party with the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI); it was known as '''Lakas–Kampi–CMD''' until 2012. The party produced one president, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who was president when the two parties merged in 2009.

With Arroyo unable to run for a new term due to term limits, the party lost the [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010 presidential election]] with [[Gilberto Teodoro]] as its presidential nominee. The party retained its two [[Philippine Senate|senators]], both incumbents, in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|Senate election]] and became a part of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]-led majority coalition; in the [[2010 Philippine House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives election]], it won 47% of the seats contested in the district election, but most of its members were split into three groups, with many defecting to the Liberal Party, some formed the [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], and the remaining members were split into the majority and minority blocs, with its members heading the minority. On May 11, 2012, the party decided to revert to its original name and drop Arroyo's KAMPI from the coalition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/22728-lakas-drops-gmas-kampi-from-coalition |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514081052/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/22728-lakas-drops-gmas-kampi-from-coalition |archivedate=2012-05-14 }} The Manila Times: Lakas drops GMA's Kampi from coalition</ref> Lakas–CMD is currently one of the parties in opposition.

==History==
{{see also|Lakas–CMD (1991)|Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino}}

===Ramos administration===
[[Image:Ramos Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|150px|President Fidel V. Ramos, co-founder of Lakas NUCD.]]
Lakas ng Tao was formed in December 1991 for the [[1992 Philippine general election|1992 elections]] as retired General, then-Defense Secretary, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] and former [[Cebu]] Governor [[Emilio Mario Osmeña|Emilio Mario \"Lito\" R. Osmeña]] were running for president and vice-president respectively. It was also formed when Ramos bolted from the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of Democratic Filipinos), after he had lost in the bid for the presidency under that said banner to Speaker [[Ramon Mitra]].

The party was formed out of two parties: Ramos's Partido Lakas ng Tao (People Power Party) and the National Union of Christian Democrats of [[Raul Manglapus]].  As they coalesced, the party became known as Lakas ng Tao-[[Lakas–CMD (1991)|National Union of Christian Democrats]], with Lakas ng Tao usually just shortened to \"Lakas\" and abbreviated as Lakas-NUCD.

In 1994, it formed a coalition government with the LDP for the [[1995 Philippine general election|1995 legislative elections]].  This coalition, dubbed the \"[[Lakas-Laban Coalition]]\", won a majority in both Houses of Congress. In the 1997 Lakas National Convention, the party nominated House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] of [[Pangasinan]] after a close nominal fight with then Defense Secretary [[Renato de Villa]] as its nominee to the presidency against the opposition's Vice President [[Joseph Estrada]] in the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  By this time, it was joined by the Union of Muslim Democrats of the Philippines of former ambassador to Egypt and Oman [[Sanchez Ali|Sanchez A. Ali]] to form Lakas ng EDSA-National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines.

Secretary de Villa eventually bolted the party and formed [[Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma]] (Democratic Reform Party) for the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  Lakas also nominated then-Senator [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] of [[Pampanga]] as its candidate as [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]]. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino|Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI). De Venecia lost to Vice President Estrada by a significant plurality, while Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner while her KAMPI party was in hiatus.

===Arroyo administration===
In the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 elections]], the name changed again to the current Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats, or Lakas–CMD.  However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name is usually now referred to as \"Lakas ng [[EDSA I|EDSA]]\" which means \"The Strength of EDSA\" than the original Lakas ng Tao which means \"The Strength of the People\" or \"People Power.\"  This is also the name that it used when it ran in 2004 elections under the K-4 coalition.  President Arroyo, who succeeded the deposed President [[Joseph Estrada]], was the K-4 Coalition candidate for president in the 2004 election, eventually winning over her opponents primarily [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] and Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]].<ref name= \"Centre-right\" />

At the onset of 2006, Lakas–CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]].  Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap mid-term elections (or \"no-el\") set for 2007 and calls for her to step down in time for the elections, which is related to the \"no-el\" controversy. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting on January 14, 2006 to discuss these matters.

There are no official results available of the 2007 [[elections in the Philippines|elections]] released by the party but according to the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], the party holds 79 out of 235 seats.

On January 16, 2008, Lakas spokesman and legal counsel [[Raul Lambino]] stated that Lakas–CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010—spokesman  in 2010. Except for Parañaque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified. But Lambino named incumbent Senators [[Ramon Revilla, Jr.]] and [[Lito Lapid]], former senator [[Ralph Recto]] and former Congressman [[Prospero Pichay]] as among those considered.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman  Inquirer.net, Lakas lists down 30 senatorial bets for 2010--spokesman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910230132/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman |date=2012-09-10 }}</ref>

Former Speaker of the House [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] (Pangasinan -4th District) resigned his post as president of Lakas–CMD on March 10, 2008; he rejected the proposition of former president [[Fidel Ramos]] to give him the title Chairman-emeritus. The current Speaker of the House [[Prospero Nograles]] (Davao -1st District) was sworn it as the new president of Lakas–CMD party and former Speaker of the house [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] as vice president for Metro Manila affairs on the same day.

[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on June 18, 2008, confirmed the historical [[merger]] of the [[Lakas-CMD (1991)|Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats]] (Lakas–CMD) and the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) parties. Both parties adopted the \"equity of the incumbent\" principle, as the merger would account for almost 200 national and 8,000 local officials, amid Mrs. Arroyo's prediction of  2010 elections victory. [[Prospero Nograles]], Lakas President and Kampi Chair [[Ronaldo Puno]] signed the covenant at the [[Davao City]] regional [[caucus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news4_june19_2008|title=Manila Standard Today - Latest News in the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/101994/Lakas-CMD-Kampi-merge|title=Lakas-CMD, Kampi merge|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> Former President and Lakas–CMD Chairman Emeritus [[Fidel V.

On August 9, 2009, Former House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] and Former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] led fifty members from the Lakas Kampi CMD in objecting to its merger with [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) on May 28, 2009. The faction made de Venecia its President with Ramos as the Chairman Emeritus of the new party, Ramos refused the offer of Chairman Emeritus of Lakas-Kampi after being named in interim party organization. De Venecia has filed a resolution at the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] to declare ''null and void'' the merger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090909-224323/Lakas-Kampi-CMD-merger-in-peril|title=Lakas-Kampi-CMD merger in peril - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos|accessdate=19 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162726/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090909-224323/Lakas-Kampi-CMD-merger-in-peril|archivedate=27 April 2015}}</ref> However, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] ultimately upheld the legality of the merger,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideNation.htm?f=2010/january/1/nation3.isx&d=/2010/january/1|title=Manila Standard Today - Latest News in the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> citing the failure of de Venecia \"to sufficiently show that any grave abuse of discretion was committed by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] in rendering the challenged resolution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=537212&publicationSubCategoryId=63|title=Taxi hinoldap|work=philstar.com|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>

===Aquino III administration===
Since [[Benigno Aquino III]] was sworn in as President of the Philippines on June 30, 2010, the majority of the former legislative member of Lakas-Kampi were sworn as a members of the reborn [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]. In 2011, the legislators led by [[Pablo P. Garcia]] established the neutral [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], which has many similarities with the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]]. In 2013, the party suffered its largest decline, due  to the arrest of the party's [[matriarchy|matriarch]], Gloria Arroyo; however the remaining party largely supports the [[United Nationalist Alliance]], with candidates from among its former members such as [[Migz Zubiri]], [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] and [[Mitos Magsaysay]].

===Duterte administration and dissolution===
{{main|Coalition for Change (Philippines)}}
In the [[2016 Philippine presidential election|2016 Presidential Elections]], Lakas supports the candidacy of [[Rodrigo Roa Duterte|Rodrigo \"Rody/Digong\" Duterte]] and [[Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.|Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, Jr.]] for President and Vice President respectively, which Duterte won and Marcos lost to Liberal Party candidate [[Leni Robredo|Ma. Leonora \"Leni\" Robredo]]. In July 2017, Revilla was sworn into Duterte's party [[PDP-Laban]], and in October, Macapagal Arroyo and her allies, also joins PDP-Laban, as a result Lakas has been dissolved.

== Plot ==
One morning in his house, Saravanan receives his ex-girlfriend Meera's wedding invitation. He and his friend Paarthasarathy aka Paartha leave for [[Pondicherry]] to attend the wedding via car. ''En route'', Saravanan recollects his past: He was a ruthless youth working in a film theatre with Paartha. He lives with his parents; his father, Varadharajan, who is educated and works as a college professor and his mother, Shenbagam, who is uneducated and is trying to pass an exam, just to get her college degree. One day in traffic, he sees Meera, a girl training to be an air hostess and [[Love at first sight|falls for her on site]]. He follows her to a cloth shop and also to her Air Hostess class. He saw her house and he and Partha go to her house, as Meera calls them. There, Meera threatens Saravanan by showing her father's photo, who is a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Mahendra Kumar. But still, Saravanan follows her and asks her to love him. Meera takes him to Mahendra Kumar's office and he asks Saravanan to stop following Meera. Meera tells Saravanan that she has some qualifications required by her lover like shaving regularly, dressing well, breaking his friendship with Paartha, coming on time, etc.  Saravanan tells this to Partha and Partha asks him if he or Meera is best for him. Saravanan tells him Meera is more important to him than Paartha, causing a break between Saravanan's and Paartha's friendship.

Later, Saravanan joins Paartha's broken love and asks him to rejoin his love. Partha agrees and then they go to [[Mumbai]], following Meera in a flight. There, Meera alas tells him that she loves Saravanan. After some months, Meera calls Saravanan once, but he does not pick up the phone and tells Paartha that Meera is not his real love and it is all nothing, but a drama. But, he really said that for fun. But, Paartha had accidentally switched on the phone while Saravanan told him all this. Meera, mistaking him for intentionally misusing her, comes there and breaks their love. Now, at Pondicherry, during Meera's marriage, both Saravanan and Partha end up drunk and tell a small story, in a comical way describing the broken love of Saravanan and Meera. Just as the marriage is going to happen, Rajini Murugan, a local don, comes there with a pregnant girl and his girlfriend and reveals that Meera's groom has a girlfriend, who is pregnant by him and that the girl Rajini Murugan is with, is that girl. The groom admits to his mistake and reunites with his old girlfriend. Saravanan and Paartha walk off the marriage hall, just then Meera comes and hugs Saravanan, hence reuniting with him.

One morning in his house, Saravanan receives his ex-girlfriend Meera's wedding invitation. He and his friend Paarthasarathy aka Paartha leave for [[Pondicherry]] to attend the wedding via car. ''En route'', Saravanan recollects his past: He was a ruthless youth working in a film theatre with Paartha. He lives with his parents; his father, Varadharajan, who is educated and works as a college professor and his mother, Shenbagam, who is uneducated and is trying to pass an exam, just to get her college degree. One day in traffic, he sees Meera, a girl training to be an air hostess and [[Love at first sight|falls for her on site]]. He follows her to a cloth shop and also to her Air Hostess class. He saw her house and he and Partha go to her house, as Meera calls them. There, Meera threatens Saravanan by showing her father's photo, who is a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Mahendra Kumar. But still, Saravanan follows her and asks her to love him. Meera takes him to Mahendra Kumar's office and he asks Saravanan to stop following Meera. Meera tells Saravanan that she has some qualifications required by her lover like shaving regularly, dressing well, breaking his friendship with Paartha, coming on time, etc.  Saravanan tells this to Partha and Partha asks him if he or Meera is best for him. Saravanan tells him Meera is more important to him than Paartha, causing a break between Saravanan's and Paartha's friendship.

Later, Saravanan joins Paartha's broken love and asks him to rejoin his love. Partha agrees and then they go to [[Mumbai]], following Meera in a flight. There, Meera alas tells him that she loves Saravanan. After some months, Meera calls Saravanan once, but he does not pick up the phone and tells Paartha that Meera is not his real love and it is all nothing, but a drama. But, he really said that for fun. But, Paartha had accidentally switched on the phone while Saravanan told him all this. Meera, mistaking him for intentionally misusing her, comes there and breaks their love. Now, at Pondicherry, during Meera's marriage, both Saravanan and Partha end up drunk and tell a small story, in a comical way describing the broken love of Saravanan and Meera. Just as the marriage is going to happen, Rajini Murugan, a local don, comes there with a pregnant girl and his girlfriend and reveals that Meera's groom has a girlfriend, who is pregnant by him and that the girl Rajini Murugan is with, is that girl. The groom admits to his mistake and reunites with his old girlfriend. Saravanan and Paartha walk off the marriage hall, just then Meera comes and hugs Saravanan, hence reuniting with him.

'''Nation in America'''

American political scientist [[Benedict Anderson]] characterised a nation as an \"[[imagined community]]\",<ref>{{cite book |last= Anderson |first= Benedict | title= Imagined Communities | publisher= Verso Publications | location= London |year= 1983}}</ref> and Australian academic [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] sees it as an \"abstract community\".<ref>{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community | url= https://www.academia.edu/40353321 |publisher= Sage Publications | location= London |year= 1996 | page= 34 | quote = A nation is at once an objectively abstract society of strangers, usually connected by a state, and a subjectively embodied community whose members experience themselves as an integrated group of compatriots.}}</ref> A nation is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections and that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences him or herself as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will likely never meet.<ref>{{cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) |title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 |date= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications |location= London }}</ref> Hence the phrase, \"a nation of strangers\" used by such writers as American journalist [[Vance Packard]]. So, a nation is an [[intersubjective]] reality and exists solely in the collective imagination of the citizens. Even if a person comes to believe that a nation does not exist, the nation will remain unharmed, as it is not a [[wikt:subjective|subjective]] reality which exists in the mind of a single person.

==Etymology and terminology==
The word ''nation'' came from the [[Old French]] word ''nacion'' – meaning \"birth\" (''naissance''), \"place of origin\" -, which in turn originates from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[wikt:Special:Search/natio|natio]]'' (''nātĭō'') literally meaning \"birth\".<ref name=\"etymonline\">{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nation |title=Nation |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=5 June 2011}}.</ref>

''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines a nation as follows:
<blockquote>'''nation''', ''n.'' (14c) '''1.''' A large group of people having a common origin, language, and tradition and usu. constituting a political entity. • When a nation is coincident with a state, the term ''nation-state'' is often used....
<P>...</P>
'''2.''' A community of people inhabiting a defined territory and organized under an independent government; a sovereign political state....<ref name = \"black\">{{cite book
|title=Black's Law Dictionary |title-link= Black's Law Dictionary |edition= 10th |date= 2014 |isbn= 978-0-314-61300-4
|chapter= nation |page= 1183
|editor-first= Bryan A. |editor-last= Garner|author-link= Bryan A. Garner}}</ref></blockquote>

The word \"nation\" is sometimes used as synonym for:
* [[State (polity)]] or [[sovereign state]]: a government which controls a specific territory, which may or may not be associated with any particular ethnic group
* [[Country]]: a geographic territory, which may or may not have an affiliation with a government or ethnic group

Thus the phrase \"nations of the world\" could be referring to the top-level governments (as in the name for the [[United Nations]]), various large geographical territories, or various large ethnic groups of the planet.

Depending on the meaning of \"nation\" used, the term \"[[nation state]]\" could be used to distinguish larger states from small [[city state]]s, or could be used to distinguish [[multinational state]]s from those with a single ethnic group.

==Medieval nations==
In her book ''Kingdoms and Communities in Western Europe 900–1300'', [[Susan Reynolds]] argues that many European medieval kingdoms were nations in the modern sense except that political participation in nationalism was available only to a limited prosperous and literate class.<ref>Susan Reynolds, Kingdoms and Communities in Western Europe 900–1300, Oxford, 1997.</ref> In his book ''The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism'', [[Adrian Hastings]] states that England's Anglo Saxon kings mobilized mass nationalism in their struggle to repel Norse invasions. He argues that [[Alfred the Great]], in particular, drew on [[biblical nationalism]], using biblical language in his law code and that during his reign selected books of the Bible were translated into [[Old English]] to inspire Englishmen to fight to turn back the Norse invaders. Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the [[Norman conquest]]) beginning with the [[Wycliffe's Bible|translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s]], positing that [[English nationalism]] and the English nation have been continuous since that time.<ref>Adrian Hastings, The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997</ref>

Another prudent example of Medieval nationalism is the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], a document produced by Scottish nobles and clergy during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]]. The purpose of the document was to demonstrate to the Pope that Scotland was indeed a nation of its own, with its own unique culture, history and language and that it was indeed an older nation than England. The document went on to justify the actions of [[Robert the Bruce]] and his forces in resisting the occupation and to chastise the English for having violated Scottish sovereignty without justification. The propaganda campaign supplemented a military campaign on the part of the Bruce, which after the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] was successful and eventually resulted in the end of England's occupation and recognition of Scottish independence on the part of the English crown. The document is widely seen as an early example of both [[Scottish nationalism]] and [[popular sovereignty]].

[[Anthony Kaldellis]] affirms in ''Hellenism in Byzantium'' (2008) that what is called the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the Roman Empire transformed into a [[nation-state]] in Middle Ages.

Azar Gat is among the scholars who argue that [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] were nations by the time of the European Middle Ages.<ref>Azar Gat, ''Nations: The Long History and Deep Roots of Political Ethnicity and Nationalism'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2013, China, p. 93 Korea, p. 104 and Japan p., 105.</ref>

===Use of term ''nationes'' by medieval universities and other medieval institutions===
{{main article| Nation (university)}}
A significant early use of the term ''nation'', as ''natio'', occurred at [[Medieval university|Medieval universities]]<ref>''see: [[nation (university)]]''</ref> to describe the colleagues in a college or students, above all at the [[University of Paris]], who were all born within a ''pays'', spoke the same language and expected to be ruled by their own familiar law. In 1383 and 1384, while studying theology at Paris, [[Jean Gerson]] was elected twice as a procurator for the French ''natio''. The [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] adopted the division of students into ''nationes'': from its opening in 1349 the ''[[studium generale]]'' which consisted of Bohemian, Bavarian, Saxon and Silesian ''nations''.

In a similar way, the ''nationes'' were segregated by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem]], who maintained at [[Rhodes]] the hostels from which they took their name \"where foreigners eat and have their places of meeting, each nation apart from the others, and a Knight has charge of each one of these hostels, and provides for the necessities of the inmates according to their religion\", as the Spanish traveller [[Pedro Tafur]] noted in 1436.<ref>Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch5 Andanças e viajes]''.</ref>

==Social science==
In the late 20th century, many social scientists argued that there were two types of nations, the [[civic nation]] of which France was the principal example and the [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nation]] exemplified by the German peoples. The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and [[ethnic origins]], that differentiate them from people of other nations.<ref name=Noiriel>{{cite book|last=Noiriel|first=Gérard|title=Population, immigration et identité nationale en France:XIX-XX siècle.|date=1992|publisher=Hachette|isbn=2010166779}}</ref> On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the [[French Revolution]] and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centered in a willingness to \"live together\", this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation.<ref>[[Rogers Brubaker]], Citizenship and nationhood in France and Germany, Harvard University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-674-13178-1}}</ref> This is the vision, among others, of [[Ernest Renan]].<ref name=Noiriel />

Present day analysis tend to be based in socio-historical studies about the building of [[national identity]] sentiments, trying to identify the individual and collective mechanisms, either conscient or non-conscient, intended or un-intended. According to some of these studies, it seems that the [[State (polity)|State]] often plays a significant role, and communications, particularly of economic content, also have a high significance.<ref name=Noiriel />

==Debate about a potential future of nations==
{{See also|Clash of Civilizations|City-state|Virtual community|Tribe (Internet)|Global citizenship|Geographic mobility|Transnationalism|Geo-fence|Decentralization|Collective problem solving|Sociocultural evolution}}
There is an ongoing debate about the future of nations − about whether this framework will persist as is and whether there are viable or developing alternatives.<ref name=news>{{cite magazine|title=End of nations: Is there an alternative to countries?|url=http://mpc-journal.org/blog/2016/11/09/end-of-nations-is-there-an-alternative-to-countries/|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref>

The theory of the [[clash of civilizations]] lies in direct contrast to [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] theories about an ever more-connected world that no longer requires nation states. According to [[political scientist]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]], people's cultural and religious [[Identity (social science)|identities]] will be the primary source of conflict in the post–[[Cold War]] world.

The theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |title=U.S. Trade Policy&nbsp;— Economics |publisher=AEI |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629170348/http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |archivedate=29 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], which was then developed in a 1993 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\",<ref name=\"FAarticle\">Official copy (free preview): {{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|title=The Clash of Civilizations?|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=Summer 1993|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629022856/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|archivedate=29 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in response to [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. Huntington later expanded his [[thesis]] in a 1996 book ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''.

Huntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post–[[Cold War]] period. Some theorists and writers argued that [[human rights]], [[liberal democracy]] and capitalist [[free market]] economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post–Cold War world. Specifically, [[Francis Fukuyama]], in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', argued that the world had reached a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] \"end of history\".

Huntington believed that while the age of [[ideology]] had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.
[[Postnationalism]] is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to its aspects including [[economic globalization]], a rise in importance of [[multinational corporation]]s, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of [[socio-political power]] from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the [[Internet]]. However attachment to citizenship and [[national identities]] often remains important.<ref>R. Koopmans and P. Statham; \"Challenging the liberal nation-state? Postnationalism, multiculturalism, and the collective claims making of migrants and ethnic minorities in Britain and Germany\"; ''American Journal of Sociology'' 105:652–96 (1999)</ref><ref>R.A. Hackenberg and R.R. Alvarez; \"Close-ups of postnationalism: Reports from the US-Mexico borderlands\"; ''Human Organization'' 60:97–104 (2001)</ref><ref>I. Bloemraad; \"Who claims dual citizenship? The limits of postnationalism, the possibilities of transnationalism, and the persistence of traditional citizenship\"; ''International Migration Review'' 38:389–426 (2004)</ref>

Jan Zielonka of the University of Oxford states that \"the future structure and exercise of political power will resemble the medieval model more than the Westphalian one\" with the latter being about \"concentration of power, sovereignty and clear-cut identity\" and [[neo-medievalism]] meaning \"overlapping authorities, divided sovereignty, multiple identities and governing institutions, and fuzzy borders\".<ref name=news/>
 We are, in the world today, heading towards globalization. The economy has already become global. The market is now one and our politics too is globalizing. Organizations like UN and other upcoming global political associations are also working towards a global nation.<ref name=news/>

==Etymology and terminology==
The word ''nation'' came from the [[Old French]] word ''nacion'' – meaning \"birth\" (''naissance''), \"place of origin\" -, which in turn originates from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[wikt:Special:Search/natio|natio]]'' (''nātĭō'') literally meaning \"birth\".<ref name=\"etymonline\">{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nation |title=Nation |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=5 June 2011}}.</ref>

''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines a nation as follows:
<blockquote>'''nation''', ''n.'' (14c) '''1.''' A large group of people having a common origin, language, and tradition and usu. constituting a political entity. • When a nation is coincident with a state, the term ''nation-state'' is often used....
<P>...</P>
'''2.''' A community of people inhabiting a defined territory and organized under an independent government; a sovereign political state....<ref name = \"black\">{{cite book
|title=Black's Law Dictionary |title-link= Black's Law Dictionary |edition= 10th |date= 2014 |isbn= 978-0-314-61300-4
|chapter= nation |page= 1183
|editor-first= Bryan A. |editor-last= Garner|author-link= Bryan A. Garner}}</ref></blockquote>

The word \"nation\" is sometimes used as synonym for:
* [[State (polity)]] or [[sovereign state]]: a government which controls a specific territory, which may or may not be associated with any particular ethnic group
* [[Country]]: a geographic territory, which may or may not have an affiliation with a government or ethnic group

Thus the phrase \"nations of the world\" could be referring to the top-level governments (as in the name for the [[United Nations]]), various large geographical territories, or various large ethnic groups of the planet.

Depending on the meaning of \"nation\" used, the term \"[[nation state]]\" could be used to distinguish larger states from small [[city state]]s, or could be used to distinguish [[multinational state]]s from those with a single ethnic group.

According to some of these studies, it seems that the [[State (polity)|State]] often plays a significant role, and communications, particularly of economic content, also have a high significance.<ref name=Noiriel />

==Debate about a potential future of nations==
{{See also|Clash of Civilizations|City-state|Virtual community|Tribe (Internet)|Global citizenship|Geographic mobility|Transnationalism|Geo-fence|Decentralization|Collective problem solving|Sociocultural evolution}}
There is an ongoing debate about the future of nations − about whether this framework will persist as is and whether there are viable or developing alternatives.<ref name=news>{{cite magazine|title=End of nations: Is there an alternative to countries?|url=http://mpc-journal.org/blog/2016/11/09/end-of-nations-is-there-an-alternative-to-countries/|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref>

The theory of the [[clash of civilizations]] lies in direct contrast to [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] theories about an ever more-connected world that no longer requires nation states. According to [[political scientist]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]], people's cultural and religious [[Identity (social science)|identities]] will be the primary source of conflict in the post–[[Cold War]] world.

The theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |title=U.S. Trade Policy&nbsp;— Economics |publisher=AEI |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629170348/http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |archivedate=29 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], which was then developed in a 1993 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\",<ref name=\"FAarticle\">Official copy (free preview): {{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|title=The Clash of Civilizations?|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=Summer 1993|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629022856/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|archivedate=29 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in response to [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. Huntington later expanded his [[thesis]] in a 1996 book ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''.

Huntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post–[[Cold War]] period. Some theorists and writers argued that [[human rights]], [[liberal democracy]] and capitalist [[free market]] economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post–Cold War world. Specifically, [[Francis Fukuyama]], in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', argued that the world had reached a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] \"end of history\".

Huntington believed that while the age of [[ideology]] had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.
[[Postnationalism]] is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to its aspects including [[economic globalization]], a rise in importance of [[multinational corporation]]s, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of [[socio-political power]] from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the [[Internet]]. However attachment to citizenship and [[national identities]] often remains important.<ref>R. Koopmans and P. Statham; \"Challenging the liberal nation-state? Postnationalism, multiculturalism, and the collective claims making of migrants and ethnic minorities in Britain and Germany\"; ''American Journal of Sociology'' 105:652–96 (1999)</ref><ref>R.A. Hackenberg and R.R. Alvarez; \"Close-ups of postnationalism: Reports from the US-Mexico borderlands\"; ''Human Organization'' 60:97–104 (2001)</ref><ref>I. Bloemraad; \"Who claims dual citizenship? The limits of postnationalism, the possibilities of transnationalism, and the persistence of traditional citizenship\"; ''International Migration Review'' 38:389–426 (2004)</ref>

Jan Zielonka of the University of Oxford states that \"the future structure and exercise of political power will resemble the medieval model more than the Westphalian one\" with the latter being about \"concentration of power, sovereignty and clear-cut identity\" and [[neo-medievalism]] meaning \"overlapping authorities, divided sovereignty, multiple identities and governing institutions, and fuzzy borders\".<ref name=news/>
 We are, in the world today, heading towards globalization. The economy has already become global. The market is now one and our politics too is globalizing. Organizations like UN and other upcoming global political associations are also working towards a global nation.<ref name=news/>

A '''skateboard''' is a type of [[sports equipment]] used for [[skateboarding]]. They are usually made of a specially designed 7-ply [[maple]] [[plywood]] deck with a [[Varnish#Polyurethane|polyurethane coating]] for smoothness and durability and wheels attached to the underside. Skateboards have difference in size, they could vary in length and width.  

The skateboarder moves by pushing with one foot with other foot balanced on the board, or by [[Pump (skateboarding)|pumping]] one's legs in structures such as a bowl or [[half pipe]]. A skateboard can also be used by simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope and allowing gravity to propel the board and rider. If the rider's leading foot is their right foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|goofy]];\" if the rider's leading foot is their left foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|regular]].\" If the rider is normally regular but chooses to ride goofy, they are said to be riding in \"[[Footedness#Switch,_Fakie_and_Nollie|switch]],\" and vice versa. A skater is typically more comfortable pushing with their back foot; choosing to push with the front foot is commonly referred to as riding \"mongo\", and has negative connotations of style and effectiveness in the skateboarding community.

In the early 2000s, [[electric skateboard]]s have also appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery. 

There is no governing body that declares any regulations on what constitutes a skateboard or the parts from which it is assembled. Historically, the skateboard has conformed both to contemporary trends and to the ever-evolving array of stunts performed by riders/users, who require a certain functionality from the board. The board shape depends largely upon its desired function. [[Longboard (skateboard)|Longboards]] are a type of skateboard with a longer [[wheelbase]] and larger, softer wheels. 

The two main types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. The shape of the board is also important: the skateboard must be concaved to perform tricks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |title=Skateboards: Fit & Types |publisher=LiveStrong |accessdate=June 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014011932/http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |archive-date=October 14, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing,  while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks and riding in skateparks.

==History==
{{Main|Skateboarding}}
Skateboarding started in California in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |title=Skateboarding: From Wooden Box Boards to Commercial Mainstream |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414144506/https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |archive-date=April 14, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first skateboards were made from [[roller skates]] (attached to a board).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |title=Scholastic News: Skateboarding|website=teacher.scholastic.com |access-date=March 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403111056/http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |archive-date=April 3, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Skateboarding gained in popularity because of surfing: in fact, skateboarding was initially referred to as \"sidewalk surfing\". Initially, skateboards were handmade from wooden boxes and planks by individuals. Companies started manufacturing skateboards in 1959, as the sport became more popular.<ref>{{Citation |title=The mix of sunshine and rebellion is really intoxicating|work=Skate Life|pages=27–77 |publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472900459|doi=10.2307/j.ctv65sw5s.5|year=2010}}</ref> In postwar America, society was carefree with children commonly playing in the streets.<ref>{{Citation |title=The mix of sunshine and rebellion is really intoxicating|work=Skate Life|pages=27–77 |publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472900459|doi=10.2307/j.ctv65sw5s.5|year=2010}}</ref> Boards were also continuing to evolve as companies tried to make them lighter, stronger and improve their performance.

Skateboarding is a very individual activity. Skateboarding still hasn't stopped evolving, and skaters are coming up with new tricks all the time. Since 2000, due to attention in the media and products like skateboarding video games, children's skateboards and commercialization, skateboarding has been pulled into the mainstream. As more interest and money has been invested into skateboarding, more skate parks, and better skateboards have become available. In addition, the continuing interest has motivated skateboarding companies have to keep innovating and inventing new things. In 2020, skateboarding will appear for the first time in the Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/08/03/skateboarding-olympics-2020-tokyo-games/| title=Skateboarding Will be in the 2020 Olympics| date=August 3, 2016| access-date=May 6, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507003554/https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/08/03/skateboarding-olympics-2020-tokyo-games/| archive-date=May 7, 2018| url-status=live}}</ref>

==Parts==
The following descriptions cover skateboard parts that are most prevalent in popular and modern forms of skateboarding. Many parts exist with exotic or alternative constructions. A traditional complete skateboard consists of the deck (often with griptape applied on top to enhance traction), trucks (with urethane bushings), wheels (with sealed bearings), bushings, nuts and bolts to fasten the truck and wheel assembly to the bottom of the deck. Older decks also included plastic parts such as side, tail, and nose guards.

===Deck===
[[Image:Skateboard.JPG|thumb|The side of a skateboard]] Modern decks vary in size, but most are {{convert|7|to|10.5|in|cm}} wide. Wider decks can be used for greater stability when skateboarding. Standard skateboard decks are usually between {{convert|28|and|33|in|cm}} long. The underside of the deck can be printed with a design by the manufacturer, blank, or decorated by any other means.

\"Long\" boards are usually over {{convert|36|in|cm}} long. Plastic [[Penny board|\"penny\"]] boards are typically about {{convert|22|in|cm}} long.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/arts-new-ideas/from-skateboard-and-longboard-to-penny-board-fall-2102 |title=From Skateboard and Longboard to Penny Board |date=February 2, 2010 |publisher=Historipedia |accessdate=December 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423012101/https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/arts-new-ideas/from-skateboard-and-longboard-to-penny-board-fall-2102 |archive-date=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }})</ref> Some larger penny boards over {{convert|27|in|cm}} long are called \"nickel\" boards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rideasf.com/lifestyle/penny-nickel-skateboard-review/ |title=Penny Nickel Skateboard Review |publisher=Ride as F*ck |accessdate=December 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213020301/http://rideasf.com/lifestyle/penny-nickel-skateboard-review/ |archive-date=December 13, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The longboard, a common variant of the skateboard, is used for higher speed and rough surface boarding, and they are much more expensive. \"Old school\" boards (those made in the 1970s–80s or modern boards that mimic their shape) are generally wider and often have only one kicktail. Variants of the 1970s often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |title= SKATEBOARDS |accessdate= August 30, 2017|date= June 15, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830010205/http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |archive-date= August 30, 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref>

===Grip tape===
Grip tape is a sheet of paper or fabric with adhesive on one side and a surface similar to fine sandpaper on the other. Rubber grip tape is also available, which has gathered some popularity due to the lack of damage it causes to skate shoes. Grip tape is applied to the top surface of a board to allow the rider's feet to grip the surface and help the skater stay on the board while doing tricks. Grip tape is usually black, but is also available in many different colors such as pink, red, yellow, checkered, camo, and even clear. Often, they have designs die-cut to show the color of the board, or to display the board's company logo. Grip tape accumulates dirt and other substances that will inhibit grip, so use of a grip eraser or rubber eraser is necessary after riding through mud or with dirty shoes. 

===Trucks===
[[File:Skateboard-truck.jpg|thumb|An [[Independent Truck Company|Independent]] brand skateboard truck]] 
Attached to the deck are two metal (usually made of [[aluminum alloy]]) trucks, which connect the wheels and bearings to the deck. The trucks are further composed of two parts.

The top part of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the ''baseplate'', and beneath it is the ''hanger''. The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are ''[[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]]'', also ''rubbers'' or ''[[grommet]]s'', that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. The ''bushings'' cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn. Bushings come in varying shapes and urethane formulas as well as [[durometer]]s, which may affect turning, rebound and durability. A bolt called a ''[[Kingpin (mechanics)|kingpin]]'' holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be loosened for increased turning or tightened for more stability. The standard kingpin nut size is {{frac|3|8}} - [[Threads per inch|24]] [[Unified Thread Standard#Designation|UNF]].
The position of the hanger with respect to the baseplate is determined by the ''pivot'', a rod that slots into the corresponding seat in the baseplate. The pivot stops the hanger from rotating around the kingpin. The pivot must allow some movement around the bushings and therefore is not a perfect fit. The space between the pivot and its seat in the baseplate is filled by a ''pivot cup'', a plastic part that takes most of the wear and tear of the pivot and assists in centering. The pivot cup should be periodically lubricated to ensure a smooth turn.

In general, an axle width should be chosen that is close to the width of the deck it will be used with.<ref>Has a guide to choosing the right size trucks for a skateboard deck http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426135324/http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck |date=April 26, 2010 }}</ref> For example, a {{convert|7.75|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide deck will usually be fitted with trucks that have axles between {{convert|7.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.0|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide. (Standard truck axle nut size is {{frac|5|16}} - 24 UNF, and the thinner \"jam\" style with an optional nylon lock.) Trucks that are too wide can make doing tricks difficult and can cause the wheels to get in the way when the skateboard is being ridden. Trucks that are too small reduce stability and can cause wheel bite to occur more easily when turning.

Longboard-specific trucks are a recent development. A longboard truck has the kingpin laid at a more obtuse angle (usually between 38 and 50 degrees<ref>Contains a list of dimensions for popular longboard truck manufacturer {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>) to the deck, giving a greater degree of turning for the same tilt of the deck. Many longboard-specific trucks also have a reverse kingpin arrangement with the kingpins facing outward.

===Wheels===
The [[wheel]]s of a skateboard are usually made of [[polyurethane]], and come in many different sizes and shapes to suit different types of skating. Larger diameters ({{convert|55–85|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) roll faster, and move more easily over cracks in pavement and are better for transition skateboarding. Smaller diameters ({{convert|48–54|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}) keep the board closer to the ground, require less force to accelerate and produce a lower center of gravity which allows for a better response time, but also make for a slower top speed and are better for street skateboarding. Wheels also are available in a variety of hardnesses usually measured on the [[Shore durometer]] \"A\" scale. Again like car tires, wheels range from the very soft (about Shore A 75) to the very hard (about Shore A 101). As the A scale stops at 100, any wheels labeled 101A or higher are harder, but do not use the appropriate durometer scale. Some wheel manufacturers now use the \"B\" or \"D\" scales, which have a larger and more accurate range of hardness. Modern street skaters prefer medium-sized wheels (usually {{convert|51–54|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as small wheels with lighter trucks can make [[Skateboarding trick|tricks]] like [[kickflip]]s and other flip tricks easier by keeping the center of gravity of the skateboard closer to the deck, thus making the deck easier to spin. Street wheels are harder (A 100/A 101). [[Vertical ramp]] or \"vert\" skating requires larger wheels (usually {{convert|55–65|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as it involves higher speeds. Vert wheels are also usually slightly softer (A 98/ A 99), allowing them to maintain high speed on ramps without sliding. Slalom skating requires even larger wheels ({{convert|60–75|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) to sustain the highest speeds possible. They also need to be soft and have better grip to make the tight and frequent turns in slalom racing. Even larger wheels are used in longboarding and downhill skateboarding. Sizes range from {{convert|60 to 100|mm|in|2|abbr=in}}. These extreme sizes of wheels almost always have cores of hard plastic that can be made thinner and lighter than a solid polyurethane wheel. They are often used by skateboard videographers as well, as they minimize noise and roll smoothly over most types of terrain.

===Bearings===
[[File:BallBearing.gif|thumb|An animation of the working principle for a [[ball bearing]]. ''N.B. The diagram shows an 8-balled-bearing whereas a skateboard bearing is typically 7-balled'']]

Each skateboard wheel is mounted on its axle via two [[ball bearing]]s. With few exceptions, the bearings are the industrial standard \"608\" size, with a bore of {{convert|8|mm|in|3|abbr=in}} (or {{convert|10|mm|in|3|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}} depending on the axle), an outer diameter of {{convert|22|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}, and a width of {{convert|7|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}. These are usually made of steel, though silicon nitride, a high-tech ceramic, is sometimes used. Many skateboard bearings are graded according to the [[ABEC scale]]. The starts with ABEC1 as the lowest, followed by 3, 5, 7, and 9. It is a common misconception that the higher ABECs are better for skateboarding, as the ABEC rating only measures [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], which do not necessarily apply to skateboards. Bearing performance is determined by how well maintained the bearings are. Maintenance on bearings includes periodically cleaning and lubricating them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance/ |title=Lubrication |access-date=June 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529023018/http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance |archive-date=May 29, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bearings that are kept unmaintained have their performance greatly lowered and will soon need to be replaced. Bearing cleaning kits are commonly available on the market. The ABEC rating does not determine the speed or durability of a skateboard bearing. In particular, the ABEC rating says nothing about how well a bearing handles axial (side-to-side) loads, which are severe in most skateboard applications. Many companies do not show the ABEC rating, such as [[Bones Bearings]], which makes bearings specifically for skateboarding, often marketed as \"Skate Rated\". Each bearing usually contains 7 steel or ceramic [[Ball (bearing)|bearing balls]], although other configurations are used as well.

===Hardware===
Mounting hardware is a set of eight 10-32 UNF bolts, usually an [[Allen wrench|Allen]] or [[Phillips (screw head)|Phillips]] head, and matching nylon [[locknut]]s. They are used to attach the trucks (and any type of risers) to the board. Some sets have one different colored bolt to show which side is the nose of the skateboard. Hardware is available in various lengths for mounting trucks with or without risers.

==Optional components==

===Risers/wedges===
Risers increase the space between the truck and the deck. This allows the truck to twist further without causing wheel bite (when the wheel touches the deck and stops rotating).
Wedges can be used to change the [[steering|turning]] characteristics of a truck.<ref>A guide describing turning characteristics of different Riser/Wedge types {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>

===Shock Pads===
Shock pads are made of polyurethane and rubber. They are very similar to risers but vary in the fact that their sole purpose is to cushion the board from the trucks. Since the trucks are metal and the board wood, whenever the board hits the ground after doing a trick, the energy goes through the truck to the board ─ this has caused boards to crack, split, or even break in half, and shock pads were created to prevent this.

===Rails/ribs===
Rails (or ribs), are narrow strips of plastic or metal that are attached under the deck lengthwise along the edges. They are used for additional grip for grabs, and to enhance sliding while protecting the deck's graphics at the same time. Rails also provide a more consistent feel for slides, as the slide of a regular skateboard will suffer from the wear of the paint or varnish on the bottom of the board. Although rarely used anymore, they are useful for experienced skaters that are capable of grabs.

===Sliptape===
Sliptape is a clear piece of self-adhesive plastic that sticks to the underside of a deck. It helps protect the board's graphics and allows the board to slide more easily. Another name for this is everslick.

===Lapper===
A lapper is a plastic cover that is fastened to the rear truck and serves to protect the kingpin when grinding. It also prevents hang-ups by providing a smoother transition for the truck when it hits an obstacle or a metal pipe or round bar.

===Nose guard===
A nose guard is a plastic bumper used to protect the front of a skateboard which was once popular but is now only commonly seen on older board models.

===Tail guard (a.k.a. skid plate)===
Bolted onto the underside of the tail end of a skateboard, the tail guard (also known as a \"skid plate\") protected the tail end from skid stops and other maneuvers that would otherwise wear away the wood (commonly known as razor tail) and decrease the longevity of the tail. Typically made of plastic, these were widely popular in the '80s but their usage quickly diminished with the arrival of two-tail board designs, which became increasingly popular in the 1990s.

===Tail Devil===
A \"tail devil\" is a sparking device made of flint which is placed either on the tail or nose of the skateboard (or both) to create a sparking effect mainly visible after dark when the tail or nose of the boards scrapes against the ground.

===Copers===
Plastic half tubing that protected the axles of the trucks. In the 1980–85 period, shopping cart handles were cut by some to fit as a makeshift coper.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Sublimated graphic===
[[Sublimation (phase transition)]] is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through an intermediate liquid phase. Sublimation is an endothermic phase transition that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram. In this case, ink is transferred to a base layer, fibreglass for example, through heat and pressure, the result is a full color graphic that will not come off as easily as the more common heat transfers. This application is often found with bamboo boards and composite construction longboards where fibreglass can allow for various degrees of flex or stiffness depending on the ride you're looking for, cruising and carving versus slalom and downhill.

===Skateboard Multi-tool===
While not part of a skateboard, an all in one skateboard tool capable of mounting and removing trucks & wheels and adjusting truck kingpins are commonly sold by [[skate shop]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fasttech.com/products/1921/10062128/9696858-multifunctional-t-type-roller-hex-socket-wrench |title=Multifunctional T-Type Roller Hex Socket Wrench Skateboard Repair Tool |publisher=fasttech.com |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> Some tools include a metal [[Skateboard#Grip_tape|grip-tape]] [[File_(tool)|file]] and can also be used as a [[bottle-opener]]. Tools which can be used for the purpose of re-threading wheel axles, working with bearings and even applying grip-tape have been developed.

A '''skateboard''' is a type of [[sports equipment]] used for [[skateboarding]]. They are usually made of a specially designed 7-ply [[maple]] [[plywood]] deck with a [[Varnish#Polyurethane|polyurethane coating]] for smoothness and durability and wheels attached to the underside.

The skateboarder moves by pushing with one foot with other foot balanced on the board, or by [[Pump (skateboarding)|pumping]] one's legs in structures such as a bowl or [[half pipe]]. A skateboard can also be used by simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope and allowing gravity to propel the board and rider. If the rider's leading foot is their right foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|goofy]];\" if the rider's leading foot is their left foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|regular]].\" If the rider is normally regular but chooses to ride goofy, they are said to be riding in \"[[Footedness#Switch,_Fakie_and_Nollie|switch]],\" and vice versa. A skater is typically more comfortable pushing with their back foot; choosing to push with the front foot is commonly referred to as riding \"mongo\", and has negative connotations of style and effectiveness in the skateboarding community.

In the early 2000s, [[electric skateboard]]s have also appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery. 

There is no governing body that declares any regulations on what constitutes a skateboard or the parts from which it is assembled. Historically, the skateboard has conformed both to contemporary trends and to the ever-evolving array of stunts performed by riders/users, who require a certain functionality from the board. The board shape depends largely upon its desired function. [[Longboard (skateboard)|Longboards]] are a type of skateboard with a longer [[wheelbase]] and larger, softer wheels. 

The two main types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. The shape of the board is also important: the skateboard must be concaved to perform tricks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |title=Skateboards: Fit & Types |publisher=LiveStrong |accessdate=June 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014011932/http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |archive-date=October 14, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing,  while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks and riding in skateparks.

==History==
{{Main|Skateboarding}}
Skateboarding started in California in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |title=Skateboarding: From Wooden Box Boards to Commercial Mainstream |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414144506/https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |archive-date=April 14, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first skateboards were made from [[roller skates]] (attached to a board).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |title=Scholastic News: Skateboarding|website=teacher.scholastic.com |access-date=March 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403111056/http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |archive-date=April 3, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Skateboarding gained in popularity because of surfing: in fact, skateboarding was initially referred to as \"sidewalk surfing\". Initially, skateboards were handmade from wooden boxes and planks by individuals. Companies started manufacturing skateboards in 1959, as the sport became more popular.<ref>{{Citation |title=The mix of sunshine and rebellion is really intoxicating|work=Skate Life|pages=27–77 |publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472900459|doi=10.2307/j.ctv65sw5s.5|year=2010}}</ref> In postwar America, society was carefree with children commonly playing in the streets.<ref>{{Citation |title=The mix of sunshine and rebellion is really intoxicating|work=Skate Life|pages=27–77 |publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472900459|doi=10.2307/j.ctv65sw5s.5|year=2010}}</ref> Boards were also continuing to evolve as companies tried to make them lighter, stronger and improve their performance.

Skateboarding is a very individual activity. Skateboarding still hasn't stopped evolving, and skaters are coming up with new tricks all the time. Since 2000, due to attention in the media and products like skateboarding video games, children's skateboards and commercialization, skateboarding has been pulled into the mainstream. As more interest and money has been invested into skateboarding, more skate parks, and better skateboards have become available. In addition, the continuing interest has motivated skateboarding companies have to keep innovating and inventing new things. In 2020, skateboarding will appear for the first time in the Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/08/03/skateboarding-olympics-2020-tokyo-games/| title=Skateboarding Will be in the 2020 Olympics| date=August 3, 2016| access-date=May 6, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507003554/https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/08/03/skateboarding-olympics-2020-tokyo-games/| archive-date=May 7, 2018| url-status=live}}</ref>

==Parts==
The following descriptions cover skateboard parts that are most prevalent in popular and modern forms of skateboarding. Many parts exist with exotic or alternative constructions. A traditional complete skateboard consists of the deck (often with griptape applied on top to enhance traction), trucks (with urethane bushings), wheels (with sealed bearings), bushings, nuts and bolts to fasten the truck and wheel assembly to the bottom of the deck. Older decks also included plastic parts such as side, tail, and nose guards.

===Deck===
[[Image:Skateboard.JPG|thumb|The side of a skateboard]] Modern decks vary in size, but most are {{convert|7|to|10.5|in|cm}} wide. Wider decks can be used for greater stability when skateboarding. Standard skateboard decks are usually between {{convert|28|and|33|in|cm}} long. The underside of the deck can be printed with a design by the manufacturer, blank, or decorated by any other means.

\"Long\" boards are usually over {{convert|36|in|cm}} long. Plastic [[Penny board|\"penny\"]] boards are typically about {{convert|22|in|cm}} long.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/arts-new-ideas/from-skateboard-and-longboard-to-penny-board-fall-2102 |title=From Skateboard and Longboard to Penny Board |date=February 2, 2010 |publisher=Historipedia |accessdate=December 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423012101/https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/arts-new-ideas/from-skateboard-and-longboard-to-penny-board-fall-2102 |archive-date=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }})</ref> Some larger penny boards over {{convert|27|in|cm}} long are called \"nickel\" boards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rideasf.com/lifestyle/penny-nickel-skateboard-review/ |title=Penny Nickel Skateboard Review |publisher=Ride as F*ck |accessdate=December 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213020301/http://rideasf.com/lifestyle/penny-nickel-skateboard-review/ |archive-date=December 13, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The longboard, a common variant of the skateboard, is used for higher speed and rough surface boarding, and they are much more expensive. \"Old school\" boards (those made in the 1970s–80s or modern boards that mimic their shape) are generally wider and often have only one kicktail. Variants of the 1970s often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |title= SKATEBOARDS |accessdate= August 30, 2017|date= June 15, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830010205/http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |archive-date= August 30, 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref>

===Grip tape===
Grip tape is a sheet of paper or fabric with adhesive on one side and a surface similar to fine sandpaper on the other. Rubber grip tape is also available, which has gathered some popularity due to the lack of damage it causes to skate shoes. Grip tape is applied to the top surface of a board to allow the rider's feet to grip the surface and help the skater stay on the board while doing tricks. Grip tape is usually black, but is also available in many different colors such as pink, red, yellow, checkered, camo, and even clear. Often, they have designs die-cut to show the color of the board, or to display the board's company logo. Grip tape accumulates dirt and other substances that will inhibit grip, so use of a grip eraser or rubber eraser is necessary after riding through mud or with dirty shoes. 

===Trucks===
[[File:Skateboard-truck.jpg|thumb|An [[Independent Truck Company|Independent]] brand skateboard truck]] 
Attached to the deck are two metal (usually made of [[aluminum alloy]]) trucks, which connect the wheels and bearings to the deck. The trucks are further composed of two parts.

The top part of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the ''baseplate'', and beneath it is the ''hanger''. The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are ''[[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]]'', also ''rubbers'' or ''[[grommet]]s'', that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. The ''bushings'' cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn. Bushings come in varying shapes and urethane formulas as well as [[durometer]]s, which may affect turning, rebound and durability. A bolt called a ''[[Kingpin (mechanics)|kingpin]]'' holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be loosened for increased turning or tightened for more stability. The standard kingpin nut size is {{frac|3|8}} - [[Threads per inch|24]] [[Unified Thread Standard#Designation|UNF]].
The position of the hanger with respect to the baseplate is determined by the ''pivot'', a rod that slots into the corresponding seat in the baseplate. The pivot stops the hanger from rotating around the kingpin. The pivot must allow some movement around the bushings and therefore is not a perfect fit. The space between the pivot and its seat in the baseplate is filled by a ''pivot cup'', a plastic part that takes most of the wear and tear of the pivot and assists in centering. The pivot cup should be periodically lubricated to ensure a smooth turn.

In general, an axle width should be chosen that is close to the width of the deck it will be used with.<ref>Has a guide to choosing the right size trucks for a skateboard deck http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426135324/http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck |date=April 26, 2010 }}</ref> For example, a {{convert|7.75|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide deck will usually be fitted with trucks that have axles between {{convert|7.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.0|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide. (Standard truck axle nut size is {{frac|5|16}} - 24 UNF, and the thinner \"jam\" style with an optional nylon lock.) Trucks that are too wide can make doing tricks difficult and can cause the wheels to get in the way when the skateboard is being ridden. Trucks that are too small reduce stability and can cause wheel bite to occur more easily when turning.

Longboard-specific trucks are a recent development. A longboard truck has the kingpin laid at a more obtuse angle (usually between 38 and 50 degrees<ref>Contains a list of dimensions for popular longboard truck manufacturer {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>) to the deck, giving a greater degree of turning for the same tilt of the deck. Many longboard-specific trucks also have a reverse kingpin arrangement with the kingpins facing outward.

===Wheels===
The [[wheel]]s of a skateboard are usually made of [[polyurethane]], and come in many different sizes and shapes to suit different types of skating. Larger diameters ({{convert|55–85|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) roll faster, and move more easily over cracks in pavement and are better for transition skateboarding. Smaller diameters ({{convert|48–54|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}) keep the board closer to the ground, require less force to accelerate and produce a lower center of gravity which allows for a better response time, but also make for a slower top speed and are better for street skateboarding. Wheels also are available in a variety of hardnesses usually measured on the [[Shore durometer]] \"A\" scale. Again like car tires, wheels range from the very soft (about Shore A 75) to the very hard (about Shore A 101). As the A scale stops at 100, any wheels labeled 101A or higher are harder, but do not use the appropriate durometer scale. Some wheel manufacturers now use the \"B\" or \"D\" scales, which have a larger and more accurate range of hardness. Modern street skaters prefer medium-sized wheels (usually {{convert|51–54|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as small wheels with lighter trucks can make [[Skateboarding trick|tricks]] like [[kickflip]]s and other flip tricks easier by keeping the center of gravity of the skateboard closer to the deck, thus making the deck easier to spin. Street wheels are harder (A 100/A 101). [[Vertical ramp]] or \"vert\" skating requires larger wheels (usually {{convert|55–65|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as it involves higher speeds. Vert wheels are also usually slightly softer (A 98/ A 99), allowing them to maintain high speed on ramps without sliding. Slalom skating requires even larger wheels ({{convert|60–75|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) to sustain the highest speeds possible. They also need to be soft and have better grip to make the tight and frequent turns in slalom racing. Even larger wheels are used in longboarding and downhill skateboarding. Sizes range from {{convert|60 to 100|mm|in|2|abbr=in}}. These extreme sizes of wheels almost always have cores of hard plastic that can be made thinner and lighter than a solid polyurethane wheel. They are often used by skateboard videographers as well, as they minimize noise and roll smoothly over most types of terrain.

===Bearings===
[[File:BallBearing.gif|thumb|An animation of the working principle for a [[ball bearing]]. ''N.B. The diagram shows an 8-balled-bearing whereas a skateboard bearing is typically 7-balled'']]

Each skateboard wheel is mounted on its axle via two [[ball bearing]]s. With few exceptions, the bearings are the industrial standard \"608\" size, with a bore of {{convert|8|mm|in|3|abbr=in}} (or {{convert|10|mm|in|3|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}} depending on the axle), an outer diameter of {{convert|22|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}, and a width of {{convert|7|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}. These are usually made of steel, though silicon nitride, a high-tech ceramic, is sometimes used. Many skateboard bearings are graded according to the [[ABEC scale]]. The starts with ABEC1 as the lowest, followed by 3, 5, 7, and 9. It is a common misconception that the higher ABECs are better for skateboarding, as the ABEC rating only measures [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], which do not necessarily apply to skateboards. Bearing performance is determined by how well maintained the bearings are. Maintenance on bearings includes periodically cleaning and lubricating them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance/ |title=Lubrication |access-date=June 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529023018/http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance |archive-date=May 29, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bearings that are kept unmaintained have their performance greatly lowered and will soon need to be replaced. Bearing cleaning kits are commonly available on the market. The ABEC rating does not determine the speed or durability of a skateboard bearing. In particular, the ABEC rating says nothing about how well a bearing handles axial (side-to-side) loads, which are severe in most skateboard applications. Many companies do not show the ABEC rating, such as [[Bones Bearings]], which makes bearings specifically for skateboarding, often marketed as \"Skate Rated\". Each bearing usually contains 7 steel or ceramic [[Ball (bearing)|bearing balls]], although other configurations are used as well.

===Hardware===
Mounting hardware is a set of eight 10-32 UNF bolts, usually an [[Allen wrench|Allen]] or [[Phillips (screw head)|Phillips]] head, and matching nylon [[locknut]]s. They are used to attach the trucks (and any type of risers) to the board. Some sets have one different colored bolt to show which side is the nose of the skateboard. Hardware is available in various lengths for mounting trucks with or without risers.

==Optional components==

===Risers/wedges===
Risers increase the space between the truck and the deck. This allows the truck to twist further without causing wheel bite (when the wheel touches the deck and stops rotating).
Wedges can be used to change the [[steering|turning]] characteristics of a truck.<ref>A guide describing turning characteristics of different Riser/Wedge types {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>

== Background ==

=== 2012–2015: ''Zaba'' and various EPs  ===
The band released their debut EP, ''Leaflings'', on 28 May 2012, which included the single \"Cocoa Hooves\". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of [[XL Recordings]] (part of the [[Beggars Group]] of labels). At the time, lead singer and guitarist Dave Bayley was attending medical school at King's College, London but left after [[Adele]]'s producer [[Paul Epworth]] saw Glass Animals performing in London and signed them to his label Wolf Tone.

In 2013, the band released ''Black Mambo / Exxus EP'' in Europe, and ''Glass Animals EP'' in the US. The digital release of the track \"Black Mambo\" brought the band their first attention through online reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypem.com/track/1wegy/Glass+Animals+-+Black+Mambo|title=Black Mambo|website=Hype Machine|accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> The ''Glass Animals'' EP also saw the band collaborating with Jean Deaux, a soulful hip-hop teenager from Chicago, on a song titled \"Woozy\".

In 2014, the band made their first visit to the USA, performing at ''[[South by Southwest]]'' in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: \"Pools\", \"Gooey\", and \"Hazey\", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer [[Tei Shi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

All five singles were included on the band's debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'', which was released on 6 June 2014. The band performed the single \"Gooey\" on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals Get \"Gooey\" Again on Late Night With Seth Meyers {{!}} The Lefort Report|url = http://www.thelefortreport.com/blog/2014-10/watch-glass-animals-get-gooey-again-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers/|website = www.thelefortreport.com|access-date = 21 January 2016}}</ref> in 2014, and again on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' with [[David Letterman]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals play 'Gooey' on Letterman|url = http://diymag.com/2015/02/26/watch-glass-animals-play-gooey-on-letterman|website = DIY|access-date = 21 January 2016}}</ref> on 24 February 2015, and toured extensively after ''Zaba'', visiting both hemispheres and played over 130 shows in 2015 alone. Their October 2015 US tour included two sold out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the [[Midland Theatre]] in [[Kansas City]].

A collaboration with American rapper [[Joey Badass|Joey Bada$$]], titled \"Lose Control\", was released on 6 October 2015. The idea for the song was apparently sparked during a randomly shared studio session. Following the collaboration, Bayley remarked that he would be interested in working with Joey again in the future. 

Bayley also worked with DJ Dahi, resulting in a writing cut on the track \"The Middle Finger\" on Wale's ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number one album, ''[[The Album About Nothing]]'' in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Wale - The Middle Finger Lyrics {{!}} Genius Lyrics |url= https://genius.com/Wale-the-middle-finger-lyrics |website= genius.com}}</ref>

=== 2016–2018: ''How to Be a Human Being'' and tour ===
[[File:Dave Studio.jpg|thumb|Glass Animals frontman Dave Bayley]]
On 16 May 2016, the band released the lead single, \"Life Itself\", from their second album ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/glass-animals-tickle-the-feet-with-new-single-life-itself-listen/|title=Glass Animals tickle the feet with new single \"Life Itself\" — listen|date=2016-05-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref> \"Life Itself\" peaked at number 14 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Alternative Songs chart and spent 26 weeks on Sirius XM's Alt-18 chart, peaking at number one.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/glass-animals-track-by-track-guide-to-how-to-be-a.html|title=Glass Animals: Track-By-Track Guide to How To Be A Human Being|newspaper=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref> A music video for the song was released on 7 June 2016. The band also created a website based on the character from \"Life Itself\".

On 25 July, a second single from the album, \"Youth\", was released along with its music video.<ref name=\":0\" /> Four days before the release of the album, on 22 August, the band released a third single, \"Season 2 Episode 3\", about a girl who \"spends her entire time watching TV, lounging around, not doing anything, being high, eating mayonnaise from a jar\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://howlandechoes.com/2016/08/interview-photo-shoot-glass-animals/|title=Glass Animals, Human Beings: Interview & Photos • Howl & Echoes|date=2016-08-26|newspaper=Howl & Echoes|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>

The full album ''How to Be a Human Being'' was released on 26 August 2016 by Wolf Tone and [[Caroline International]] in Europe, and [[Harvest Records]] in the United States. The album received critical acclaim for its \"sense of wonder\" and \"immediate impression\", though it was also met with some mixed reactions, for critics felt that it was somewhat premature. They played [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway Festivals]] in six different cities (Singapore, Sydney, and Auckland, among others). During their time in Australia, their three singles from ''How to Be a Human Being''—\"Youth\", \"Life Itself\", and \"Season 2 Episode 3\", respectively—came in at 38, 63 and 98 on [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2016|Triple J's Hottest 100]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In July 2018, drummer Joe Seaward was seriously injured when he was hit by a [[lorry]] while cycling in [[Dublin]]. Joe's accident and recovery resulted in the band canceling their remaining tour dates for rest of the year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Glass Animals Cancel Tour After Drummer Hit by Truck {{!}} Pitchfork |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/glass-animals-cancel-tour-after-drummer-hit-by-truck/ |website=pitchfork.com |accessdate=15 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

Since the tour, the band has released two singles; one in late 2019 named \"Tokyo Drifting\", a duet with [[Denzel Curry]], and the other in early 2020 named \"Your Love (Déjà Vu)\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Glass Animals 'Your Love (Deja Vu)' |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8551424/glass-animals-your-love-deja-vu |website=Billboard.com |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"tokyodriftingrepublicrecords\"></ref>

== Background ==

=== 2012–2015: ''Zaba'' and various EPs  ===
The band released their debut EP, ''Leaflings'', on 28 May 2012, which included the single \"Cocoa Hooves\". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of [[XL Recordings]] (part of the [[Beggars Group]] of labels). At the time, lead singer and guitarist Dave Bayley was attending medical school at King's College, London but left after [[Adele]]'s producer [[Paul Epworth]] saw Glass Animals performing in London and signed them to his label Wolf Tone.

In 2013, the band released ''Black Mambo / Exxus EP'' in Europe, and ''Glass Animals EP'' in the US. The digital release of the track \"Black Mambo\" brought the band their first attention through online reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypem.com/track/1wegy/Glass+Animals+-+Black+Mambo|title=Black Mambo|website=Hype Machine|accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> The ''Glass Animals'' EP also saw the band collaborating with Jean Deaux, a soulful hip-hop teenager from Chicago, on a song titled \"Woozy\".

In 2014, the band made their first visit to the USA, performing at ''[[South by Southwest]]'' in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: \"Pools\", \"Gooey\", and \"Hazey\", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer [[Tei Shi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

All five singles were included on the band's debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'', which was released on 6 June 2014. The band performed the single \"Gooey\" on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals Get \"Gooey\" Again on Late Night With Seth Meyers {{!}} The Lefort Report|url = http://www.thelefortreport.com/blog/2014-10/watch-glass-animals-get-gooey-again-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers/|website = www.thelefortreport.com|access-date = 21 January 2016}}</ref> in 2014, and again on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' with [[David Letterman]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals play 'Gooey' on Letterman|url = http://diymag.com/2015/02/26/watch-glass-animals-play-gooey-on-letterman|website = DIY|access-date = 21 January 2016}}</ref> on 24 February 2015, and toured extensively after ''Zaba'', visiting both hemispheres and played over 130 shows in 2015 alone. Their October 2015 US tour included two sold out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the [[Midland Theatre]] in [[Kansas City]].

A collaboration with American rapper [[Joey Badass|Joey Bada$$]], titled \"Lose Control\", was released on 6 October 2015. The idea for the song was apparently sparked during a randomly shared studio session. Following the collaboration, Bayley remarked that he would be interested in working with Joey again in the future. 

Bayley also worked with DJ Dahi, resulting in a writing cut on the track \"The Middle Finger\" on Wale's ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number one album, ''[[The Album About Nothing]]'' in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Wale - The Middle Finger Lyrics {{!}} Genius Lyrics |url= https://genius.com/Wale-the-middle-finger-lyrics |website= genius.com}}</ref>

=== 2016–2018: ''How to Be a Human Being'' and tour ===
[[File:Dave Studio.jpg|thumb|Glass Animals frontman Dave Bayley]]
On 16 May 2016, the band released the lead single, \"Life Itself\", from their second album ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/glass-animals-tickle-the-feet-with-new-single-life-itself-listen/|title=Glass Animals tickle the feet with new single \"Life Itself\" — listen|date=2016-05-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref> \"Life Itself\" peaked at number 14 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Alternative Songs chart and spent 26 weeks on Sirius XM's Alt-18 chart, peaking at number one.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/glass-animals-track-by-track-guide-to-how-to-be-a.html|title=Glass Animals: Track-By-Track Guide to How To Be A Human Being|newspaper=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref> A music video for the song was released on 7 June 2016. The band also created a website based on the character from \"Life Itself\".

On 25 July, a second single from the album, \"Youth\", was released along with its music video.<ref name=\":0\" /> Four days before the release of the album, on 22 August, the band released a third single, \"Season 2 Episode 3\", about a girl who \"spends her entire time watching TV, lounging around, not doing anything, being high, eating mayonnaise from a jar\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://howlandechoes.com/2016/08/interview-photo-shoot-glass-animals/|title=Glass Animals, Human Beings: Interview & Photos • Howl & Echoes|date=2016-08-26|newspaper=Howl & Echoes|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>

The full album ''How to Be a Human Being'' was released on 26 August 2016 by Wolf Tone and [[Caroline International]] in Europe, and [[Harvest Records]] in the United States. The album received critical acclaim for its \"sense of wonder\" and \"immediate impression\", though it was also met with some mixed reactions, for critics felt that it was somewhat premature. They played [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway Festivals]] in six different cities (Singapore, Sydney, and Auckland, among others). During their time in Australia, their three singles from ''How to Be a Human Being''—\"Youth\", \"Life Itself\", and \"Season 2 Episode 3\", respectively—came in at 38, 63 and 98 on [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2016|Triple J's Hottest 100]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In July 2018, drummer Joe Seaward was seriously injured when he was hit by a [[lorry]] while cycling in [[Dublin]]. Joe's accident and recovery resulted in the band canceling their remaining tour dates for rest of the year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Glass Animals Cancel Tour After Drummer Hit by Truck {{!}} Pitchfork |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/glass-animals-cancel-tour-after-drummer-hit-by-truck/ |website=pitchfork.com |accessdate=15 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

Since the tour, the band has released two singles; one in late 2019 named \"Tokyo Drifting\", a duet with [[Denzel Curry]], and the other in early 2020 named \"Your Love (Déjà Vu)\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Glass Animals 'Your Love (Deja Vu)' |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8551424/glass-animals-your-love-deja-vu |website=Billboard.com |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"tokyodriftingrepublicrecords\"></ref>

The '''geography of Texas''' is diverse and large. Occupying about 7% of the total water and land area of the U.S.,<ref name=\"Tx Almanac Area\">{{cite web|url= http://texasalmanac.com/topics/environment/environment|title= Texas Almanac|accessdate= 2016-06-25}}</ref> it is the second largest state after [[Alaska]], and is the southernmost part of the [[Great Plains]], which end in the south against the folded [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] of [[Mexico]]. [[Texas]] is in the [[South Central United States]] of America, and is considered to form part of the [[U.S. Southern States|U.S. South]] and also part of the [[Southwest United States|U.S. Southwest]].<ref>{{cite web | url = 
http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/is-texas-southern-western-or-truly-a-lone-star/ | website = [[Texas Monthly]] | title = Is Texas Southern, Western, or Truly a Lone Star? | last = Nova Lomax | first = John | date = M&777&&arch 3, 2015 | accessdate = September 6, 2016 }}</ref>

By residents, the state is generally divided into [[North Texas]], [[East Texas]], [[Central Texas]], [[South Texas]], [[West Texas]] (and sometimes the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]]), but according to the ''[[Texas Almanac]]'', Texas has four major physical regions: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province. This has been cited as the difference between [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]], although the fact that Texas was granted [[Texas divisionism|the prerogative to divide into as many as five U.S. states]] may be a historical motive for Texans defining their state as containing exactly five regions.<ref name=\"State division\">{{cite web|url= http://www.texasescapes.com/MikeCoxTexasTales/211Texas-County-Seats-and-Counties-Name-Confusion.htm| title= Texas Escapes.com|accessdate= 2006-07-15}}</ref>

Some [[List of geographical regions in Texas|regions in Texas]] are more associated with the Southeast than the Southwest (primarily East Texas, Central Texas, and North Texas), while other regions share more similarities with the Southwest (primarily far West Texas and lower South Texas). The [[Salient (geography)|upper Panhandle]] is considered by many to have more in common with parts of the [[Midwestern United States|plains Midwest]] than either the South or Southwest. The size of Texas prohibits easy categorization of the entire state wholly in any recognized region of the United States, and even [[cultural diversity]] among regions of the state make it difficult to treat Texas as a region in its own right.

===Great Plains===
[[Image:Texas Hill Country Near I-10, 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Texas Hill Country|Hill Country]]]]
The [[Great Plains]] include the [[Llano Estacado]], the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]], [[Edwards Plateau]], Toyah Basin, and the [[Llano Uplift]]. It is bordered on the east by the [[Caprock Escarpment]] in the panhandle and by the [[Balcones Fault]] to the southeast. Cities in this region include [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] and [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], and [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]]. The [[Texas Hill Country|Hill Country]] is a popular name for the area of hills along the [[Balcones Escarpment]] and is a transitional area between the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Gulf Coastal Plains]]. With about {{convert|15|to|31|in|mm}} annual rainfall, the southern end of the Great Plains are gently rolling plains of shrub and grassland, and home to the dramatic [[Caprock Canyons State Park and Trailway|Caprock Canyons]] and [[Palo Duro Canyon]] state parks.<ref name=\"Regions\"/> The largest concentration of [[playa lake]]s in the world (nearly 22,000) is on the Southern High Plains of Texas and Eastern [[New Mexico]].

Texas's [[Texas blackland prairies|blackland prairies]] were some of the first areas farmed in Texas. Highly expansive [[clay]]s with characteristic dark coloration, called the Houston Black series, occur on about 1.5 million acres (6,000&nbsp;km²) extending from north of Dallas south to San Antonio. The Professional Soil Scientists Association of Texas has recommended to the State Legislature that the [[Houston]] Black series be designated the State soil.

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of Texas}}
Texas is mostly [[sedimentary rocks]], with East Texas underlain by a [[Cretaceous]] and younger sequence of sediments, the trace of ancient shorelines east and south until the [[active continental margin]] of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] is met.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} This sequence is built atop the subsided crest of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]&ndash;[[Ouachita Mountains]]&ndash;[[Marathon Uplift|Marathon Mountains]] zone of [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] [[continental collision]], which [[post-orogenic collapse|collapsed]] when [[rifting]] in [[Jurassic]] time opened the Gulf of Mexico. West from this [[orogeny|orogenic]] crest, which is buried beneath the [[Dallas]]&ndash;[[Waco, Texas|Waco]]&ndash;[[Austin, Texas|Austin]]&ndash;[[San Antonio]] trend, the sediments are [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] in age. [[Petroleum|Oil]] is found in the Cretaceous sediments in the east, the Permian sediments in the west, and along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas [[continental shelf]]. A few exposures of [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s are found in the central and western parts of the state, and [[Oligocene]] [[volcanic]] rocks are found in far west Texas, in the [[Big Bend, Texas|Big Bend]] area. A blanket of [[Miocene]] sediments known as the [[Ogallala formation]] in the western high plains region is an important [[aquifer]]. Texas has no active or dormant volcanoes and few earthquakes, being situated far from an active [[plate tectonic]] boundary. The Big Bend area is the most seismically active; however, the area is sparsely populated and suffers minimal damages and injuries, and no known fatalities have been attributed to a Texas earthquake.

==Resources==
With a large supply of [[natural resource]]s, Texas is a major [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and [[Industry|industrial]] state, producing oil, cattle, sheep, and cotton. The state also produces poultry, eggs, dairy products, greenhouse and nursery products, wheat, hay, rice, sugar cane, and peanuts, and a range of fruits and vegetables.<ref name=\"InfoResources\">{{cite web|url= http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108277.html|title= infoplease.com|accessdate= 2006-07-14 }}</ref>
*[[Asphalt]]-bearing rocks, mainly cretaceous limestones, occur in [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar]], [[Burnet County, Texas|Burnet]], [[Kinney County, Texas|Kinney]], [[Uvalde County, Texas|Uvalde]], and other counties.
*[[Cement]] is produced in Bexar, Comal, Dallas, Ector, Ellis, El Paso, Harris, Hays, McLennan, Nolan, Nueces, Potter, and Tarrant counties. Historically, Texas' Portland cement output accounts for about 10% of the annual United States production.{{cn|date=September 2016}}
*With an abundance of various types of [[clay]]s, Texas is one of the leading producers of clays.
*[[Bituminous coal]] occurs primarily in Coleman, Eastland, Erath, Jack, McCulloch, Montague, Palo Pinto, Parker, Throckmorton, Wise, and Young counties of Texas. [[Lignite]], or brown coal, occurs in deposits in the Texas Coastal Plain.
*Fluorspar or [[fluorite]] is an important industrial mineral used in the manufacture of [[steel]], aluminum, [[glass]], and fluorocarbons. It occurs at several localities in the Trans-Pecos and Llano regions of Texas.
*Collecting [[gemstone]] rock and mineral specimens has proved quite profitable. [[Agate]], [[jasper]], [[cinnabar]], [[fluorite]], [[topaz]], [[calcite]], [[opal]], [[petrified wood]], and [[tektites]] are all commonly collected.

*Deposits of [[graphite]] occur in the Llano region and was previously produced in Burnet County.
*Bat [[guano]] occurs in numerous caverns in the Edwards Plateau and in the Trans-Pecos region and to a more limited extent in Central Texas.
*[[Gypsum]] is extensively developed in Texas where the main occurrences are in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], the Cretaceous [[Edwards Formation]] in Gillespie and Menard counties, and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] salt domes of Harris County and previously Brooks County.
*Texas is the leading producer of [[helium]] solely from the Cliffside gas field near Amarillo.
*Deposits of [[iron ore]] are present in northeastern Texas as well as several in Central Texas.
*Elements of the [[Lanthanide]] series are commonly termed rare-earth elements. Several of the rare earths have anomalous concentrations in the [[rhyolitic]] and related igneous rocks in the Trans-Pecos area of Texas. A deposit containing several rare-earth minerals was exposed at Barringer Hill in Llano County before it was covered by the waters of Lake Buchanan.
*[[Limestone]]s, abundant in many parts of Texas, are used in the manufacture of lime. Plants for the production of lime are operating in Bexar, Bosque, Burnet, Comal, Deaf Smith, Hill, Johnson, Nueces, and Travis counties.
*[[Magnesium chloride]], [[magnesium sulfate]] and other mineral salts are present in the Upper [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] and in the underlying playas of the High Plains.
*[[Manganese]] is known to occur in [[Precambrian]] rocks in Mason and Llano counties, in Val Verde County, in Jeff Davis County, and in Dickens County.
*[[Mica]] is present in Precambrian pegmatite in the Llano region.
*Common [[opal]] occurs on the Texas Coastal Plain.
*[[Salt]]s occurs in large quantities in salt domes in the Texas Coastal Plain and with other evaporites in the Permian Basin of West Texas, as well as near [[Grand Saline, Texas]].
*[[Sand]]s used for industrial purposes commonly have been found in the Texas Coastal Plains, East Texas, north central Texas, and Central Texas; and sand mines have opened in the Shinnery (dunes) ecosystem of northern West Texas and the eastern part of the West Wingtip.
*The discovery of [[silver]] in Texas has been credited by some to Franciscans who discovered and operated mines near El Paso about 1680. Documented silver production started in the late 1880s at the Presidio Mine, in [[Presidio_County,_Texas|Presidio County]]. Texas produced 32,663,405 troy ounces of silver between 1885 and 1955
*[[Sulfur]] occurs in the caprocks of salt domes in the Gulf Coastal Plain, in Permian-age bedded deposits in Trans-Pecos Texas.
*In the past, [[uranium]] was produced from surface mines in Atascosa, Gonzales, Karnes, and Live Oak counties. All uranium mines are closed and Texas is no longer a producer.<ref name=\"Resources\">{{cite web|url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/gpm01|title= The Handbook of Texas online|accessdate= 2006-07-11|last=Garner |first=L.

The '''geography of Texas''' is diverse and large. Occupying about 7% of the total water and land area of the U.S.,<ref name=\"Tx Almanac Area\">{{cite web|url= http://texasalmanac.com/topics/environment/environment|title= Texas Almanac|accessdate= 2016-06-25}}</ref> it is the second largest state after [[Alaska]], and is the southernmost part of the [[Great Plains]], which end in the south against the folded [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] of [[Mexico]]. [[Texas]] is in the [[South Central United States]] of America, and is considered to form part of the [[U.S. Southern States|U.S. South]] and also part of the [[Southwest United States|U.S. Southwest]].<ref>{{cite web | url =

By residents, the state is generally divided into [[North Texas]], [[East Texas]], [[Central Texas]], [[South Texas]], [[West Texas]] (and sometimes the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]]), but according to the ''[[Texas Almanac]]'', Texas has four major physical regions: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province. This has been cited as the difference between [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]], although the fact that Texas was granted [[Texas divisionism|the prerogative to divide into as many as five U.S. states]] may be a historical motive for Texans defining their state as containing exactly five regions.<ref name=\"State division\">{{cite web|url= http://www.texasescapes.com/MikeCoxTexasTales/211Texas-County-Seats-and-Counties-Name-Confusion.htm| title= Texas Escapes.com|accessdate= 2006-07-15}}</ref>

Some [[List of geographical regions in Texas|regions in Texas]] are more associated with the Southeast than the Southwest (primarily East Texas, Central Texas, and North Texas), while other regions share more similarities with the Southwest (primarily far West Texas and lower South Texas). The [[Salient (geography)|upper Panhandle]] is considered by many to have more in common with parts of the [[Midwestern United States|plains Midwest]] than either the South or Southwest. The size of Texas prohibits easy categorization of the entire state wholly in any recognized region of the United States, and even [[cultural diversity]] among regions of the state make it difficult to treat Texas as a region in its own right.

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of Texas}}
Texas is mostly [[sedimentary rocks]], with East Texas underlain by a [[Cretaceous]] and younger sequence of sediments, the trace of ancient shorelines east and south until the [[active continental margin]] of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] is met.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} This sequence is built atop the subsided crest of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]&ndash;[[Ouachita Mountains]]&ndash;[[Marathon Uplift|Marathon Mountains]] zone of [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] [[continental collision]], which [[post-orogenic collapse|collapsed]] when [[rifting]] in [[Jurassic]] time opened the Gulf of Mexico. West from this [[orogeny|orogenic]] crest, which is buried beneath the [[Dallas]]&ndash;[[Waco, Texas|Waco]]&ndash;[[Austin, Texas|Austin]]&ndash;[[San Antonio]] trend, the sediments are [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] in age. [[Petroleum|Oil]] is found in the Cretaceous sediments in the east, the Permian sediments in the west, and along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas [[continental shelf]]. A few exposures of [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s are found in the central and western parts of the state, and [[Oligocene]] [[volcanic]] rocks are found in far west Texas, in the [[Big Bend, Texas|Big Bend]] area. A blanket of [[Miocene]] sediments known as the [[Ogallala formation]] in the western high plains region is an important [[aquifer]]. Texas has no active or dormant volcanoes and few earthquakes, being situated far from an active [[plate tectonic]] boundary. The Big Bend area is the most seismically active; however, the area is sparsely populated and suffers minimal damages and injuries, and no known fatalities have been attributed to a Texas earthquake.

==Resources==
With a large supply of [[natural resource]]s, Texas is a major [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and [[Industry|industrial]] state, producing oil, cattle, sheep, and cotton. The state also produces poultry, eggs, dairy products, greenhouse and nursery products, wheat, hay, rice, sugar cane, and peanuts, and a range of fruits and vegetables.<ref name=\"InfoResources\">{{cite web|url= http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108277.html|title= infoplease.com|accessdate= 2006-07-14 }}</ref>

{{Contains Vietnamese text}}
'''Ho Chi Minh Thought''', or '''Ho Chi Minh Ideology''', ({{lang-vi|Tư tưởng Hồ Chí Minh}}) is a [[political philosophy]] that builds upon [[Marxism–Leninism]] and the ideology of [[Ho Chi Minh]]. It was first formalised by the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] in 1991. Ho Chi Minh Thought is a broad term for political theories and policies that are seen by their proponents as representing Marxism–Leninism adapted to Vietnamese circumstances and specific time periods. The ideology includes views on the basic issues of the Vietnamese Revolution, specifically the application and development of Marxism-Leninism to the material conditions of Vietnam. The contents of Ho Chi Minh Thought was codified and developed by the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/searc/Data/FileUpload/325/WP121_12_Vu.pdf|title=The persistence of Single-Party Dictatorships: The Case of Vietnam|number=121|date=January 2012|first=Vu|last=Tuong|publisher=Southeast Asia Research Centre, City University of Hong Kong|series=SEARC Working Paper Series|page=14}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Organization of the Practice of the Ho Chi Minh Movement and the Learning of its Moral Codes|url=http://www.haugiang.gov.vn/Portal/DATA/sites/10/chuyende/HOCTAPGUONGDAODUCHOCHIMINH/|publisher=[[Vietnam Communist Party]]|accessdate=24 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320012632/http://www.haugiang.gov.vn/Portal/DATA/sites/10/chuyende/HOCTAPGUONGDAODUCHOCHIMINH/|archive-date=20 March 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Origins ==
Ho Chi Minh Thought was influenced by [[Vietnamese culture]], the [[French revolution]], and [[Marxism–Leninism]]. Similar to [[Maoism]], at the core of Ho Chi Minh Thought is that the peasantry is the [[Vanguardism|revolutionary vanguard]] in pre-industrial societies, rather than the [[proletariat]].<ref>Hồ Chí Minh Toàn tập, tập 3, Nhà xuất bản Chính trị Quốc gia, trang 3.</ref>

Ho Chi Minh Thought is rooted in:<ref name=Curriculum />

=== Influence of Confucianism ===
Ho Chi Minh, the son of a Confucian scholar, studied [[Confucianism]] throughout his life and was a strong critic of Confucian ethics and ideals.<ref name=\"Confucian\">{{cite journal |last1=Son |first1=Bui Ngoc |title=The Confucian Foundations of Hổ Chí Minh's Vision of Government / 胡志明政治思想中的儒學基礎 |journal=Journal of Oriental Studies |date=2013 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=35–59 |jstor=43498666 }}</ref> Despite this public criticism, scholars have argued that Confucianism remains part of both the personal ideology of Ho Chi Minh, and within Ho Chi Minh Thought, arguing that Confucian morality and the principle of self-cultivation are a central part of the party's platform and the ideology of Ho Chi Minh Thought.<ref name=\"Confucian\" /> The Communist Party rejects this, arguing that this proposition is a distortion of the historical record of both Ho Chi Minh and the Communist Party of Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web |author=Snr Col Nguyen Sy Hoa, PhD |title=A bold distortion of Ho Chi Minh's thought |url=https://hcma.vn/english/news/Pages/features.aspx?CateID=200&ItemID=9010 |publisher=Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics}}</ref>

Summarizing 30 years of studying Confucianism, Ho Chi Minh concluded:

<blockquote>
Học thuyết của Khổng Tử có ưu điểm của nó là sự tu dưỡng đạo đức cá nhân. Tôn giáo Giêsu có ưu điểm của nó là lòng nhân ái cao cả. Chủ nghĩa Mác có ưu điểm của nó là phương pháp làm việc biện chứng. Chủ nghĩa Tôn Dật Tiên có ưu điểm của nó, chính sách của nó phù hợp với điều kiện nước ta. Khổng Tử, Giêsu, Mác, Tôn Dật Tiên chẳng có những ưu điểm chung đó sao? Họ đều muốn mưu hạnh phúc cho mọi người, mưu phúc lợi cho xã hội. Nếu hôm nay họ còn sống trên cõi đời này, nếu họ hợp lại một chỗ, tôi tin rằng họ nhất định chung sống với nhau rất hoàn mỹ như những người bạn thân thiết. Tôi cố gắng làm người học trò nhỏ của các vị ấy.<ref>[https://baomoi.com/nhung-quan-diem-cua-chu-tich-ho-chi-minh-ve-ton-giao/c/29998796.epi Những quan điểm của Chủ tịch Hồ Chí Minh về tôn giáo], BÁO MỚI, 16 March 2019</ref>

The doctrine of Confucius has its advantage of personal moral cultivation. The religion of Jesus has its advantage of great kindness. Marxism has its advantage of a dialectical method. The tenets of Sun Yat-sen has its advantages, its policy being suitable with our country's conditions. Confucius, Jesus, Marx, Sun Yat-sen, what advantage did they share in common? They all want happiness for everyone, striving for the welfare of society. If they were still alive in this world today, if they had gathered together, I believe they would definitely live together perfectly as close friends. I try to be their little student.

== Ideology ==
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar}}
Ho Chi Minh Thought, as codified by the Communist Party of Vietnam, describes the following as the core of ideological system of Ho Chi Minh Thought:

* People's ownership, building the true State of the people, by the people, for the people;
* National defense of all people, building of the people's armed forces;
* Economic and cultural development, constantly improving the material and spiritual life of the people;
* Revolutionary ethics needs, thrifty, integrity, righteousness and impartiality;
* Take care of fostering revolutionary generations for the next life;
* Building a clean, strong Party, cadres and party members who are both leaders and loyal servants of the people

Central to Ho Chi Minh Thought is the importance of the Communist Party being the center of a [[self-determination|national liberation]] movement.<ref name=thayer /> Ho Chi Minh Thought argues that revolutionary violence and humanitarian peace are dialectical opposed to each other, however the synthesis of their conflict would inevitably be the preservation of peace, independence and national liberation.<ref name=Curriculum>Curriculum Ho Chi Minh ideology. National political publishing house. Second edition, 2006, pages 48, 29, 50</ref>

Related to socialism and economics, Ho Chi Minh Thought details the following about socialist construction and characteristics of a socialist society and economy:<ref name=Curriculum />

*Socialism is a society with highly developed production force, associated with the progressive development of science - technology and culture, the rich, and the strong country.<ref name=\"National Academy\">{{cite web |title=Undeniable values of Ho Chi Minh Thought |url=https://hcma.vn/english/news/Pages/features.aspx?CateID=200&ItemID=9008 |website=Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics |publisher=Communist Party of Vietnam |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>
*Implementation of workers ownership of the means of production and implementing the principle of labor distribution.
* A [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] based on the unity of industrial, agricultural, and intellectual workers under the leadership of the Communist Party.
* A socialist society has a system of social relations that is healthy, fair and equal, with no opposition between intellectual and manual labor, and between urban and rural areas.

Ho Chi Minh Thought emphasizes a gradual transition to socialism.<ref name=\"transition\">{{cite web |title=The pathway in the transition to socialism in Vietnam |url=http://english.hochiminh.vn/ideology-and-morality/the-pathway-in-the-transition-to-socialism-in-vietnam-3 }}</ref><ref name=\"National Academy\" /> Similar to [[Socialism with Chinese Characteristics]], Ho Chi Minh Thought places emphasis on the role of the development of the [[productive forces]] towards the development of socialism. According to Ho Chi Minh, when entering the period of transition to socialism, the Vietnamese economy was described as a largely outdated agricultural economy that had not yet underwent capitalist development.

'''Ho Chi Minh Thought''', or '''Ho Chi Minh Ideology''', ({{lang-vi|Tư tưởng Hồ Chí Minh}}) is a [[political philosophy]] that builds upon [[Marxism–Leninism]] and the ideology of [[Ho Chi Minh]]. It was first formalised by the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] in 1991. Ho Chi Minh Thought is a broad term for political theories and policies that are seen by their proponents as representing Marxism–Leninism adapted to Vietnamese circumstances and specific time periods. The ideology includes views on the basic issues of the Vietnamese Revolution, specifically the application and development of Marxism-Leninism to the material conditions of Vietnam. The contents of Ho Chi Minh Thought was codified and developed by the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/searc/Data/FileUpload/325/WP121_12_Vu.pdf|title=The persistence of Single-Party Dictatorships: The Case of Vietnam|number=121|date=January 2012|first=Vu|last=Tuong|publisher=Southeast Asia Research Centre, City University of Hong Kong|series=SEARC Working Paper Series|page=14}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Organization of the Practice of the Ho Chi Minh Movement and the Learning of its Moral Codes|url=http://www.haugiang.gov.vn/Portal/DATA/sites/10/chuyende/HOCTAPGUONGDAODUCHOCHIMINH/|publisher=[[Vietnam Communist Party]]|accessdate=24 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320012632/http://www.haugiang.gov.vn/Portal/DATA/sites/10/chuyende/HOCTAPGUONGDAODUCHOCHIMINH/|archive-date=20 March 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Origins ==
Ho Chi Minh Thought was influenced by [[Vietnamese culture]], the [[French revolution]], and [[Marxism–Leninism]]. Similar to [[Maoism]], at the core of Ho Chi Minh Thought is that the peasantry is the [[Vanguardism|revolutionary vanguard]] in pre-industrial societies, rather than the [[proletariat]].<ref>Hồ Chí Minh Toàn tập, tập 3, Nhà xuất bản Chính trị Quốc gia, trang 3.</ref>

Ho Chi Minh Thought is rooted in:<ref name=Curriculum />

*[[Marxism-Leninism]]{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

*Western ideologies, specifically French and American political philosophy{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}
*Ho Chi Minh 's personal morality

=== Influence of Confucianism ===
Ho Chi Minh, the son of a Confucian scholar, studied [[Confucianism]] throughout his life and was a strong critic of Confucian ethics and ideals.<ref name=\"Confucian\">{{cite journal |last1=Son |first1=Bui Ngoc |title=The Confucian Foundations of Hổ Chí Minh's Vision of Government / 胡志明政治思想中的儒學基礎 |journal=Journal of Oriental Studies |date=2013 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=35–59 |jstor=43498666 }}</ref> Despite this public criticism, scholars have argued that Confucianism remains part of both the personal ideology of Ho Chi Minh, and within Ho Chi Minh Thought, arguing that Confucian morality and the principle of self-cultivation are a central part of the party's platform and the ideology of Ho Chi Minh Thought.<ref name=\"Confucian\" /> The Communist Party rejects this, arguing that this proposition is a distortion of the historical record of both Ho Chi Minh and the Communist Party of Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web |author=Snr Col Nguyen Sy Hoa, PhD |title=A bold distortion of Ho Chi Minh's thought |url=https://hcma.vn/english/news/Pages/features.aspx?CateID=200&ItemID=9010 |publisher=Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics}}</ref>

Summarizing 30 years of studying Confucianism, Ho Chi Minh concluded:

<blockquote>
Học thuyết của Khổng Tử có ưu điểm của nó là sự tu dưỡng đạo đức cá nhân. Tôn giáo Giêsu có ưu điểm của nó là lòng nhân ái cao cả. Chủ nghĩa Mác có ưu điểm của nó là phương pháp làm việc biện chứng. Chủ nghĩa Tôn Dật Tiên có ưu điểm của nó, chính sách của nó phù hợp với điều kiện nước ta. Khổng Tử, Giêsu, Mác, Tôn Dật Tiên chẳng có những ưu điểm chung đó sao? Họ đều muốn mưu hạnh phúc cho mọi người, mưu phúc lợi cho xã hội. Nếu hôm nay họ còn sống trên cõi đời này, nếu họ hợp lại một chỗ, tôi tin rằng họ nhất định chung sống với nhau rất hoàn mỹ như những người bạn thân thiết. Tôi cố gắng làm người học trò nhỏ của các vị ấy.<ref>[https://baomoi.com/nhung-quan-diem-cua-chu-tich-ho-chi-minh-ve-ton-giao/c/29998796.epi Những quan điểm của Chủ tịch Hồ Chí Minh về tôn giáo], BÁO MỚI, 16 March 2019</ref>

The doctrine of Confucius has its advantage of personal moral cultivation. The religion of Jesus has its advantage of great kindness. Marxism has its advantage of a dialectical method. The tenets of Sun Yat-sen has its advantages, its policy being suitable with our country's conditions. Confucius, Jesus, Marx, Sun Yat-sen, what advantage did they share in common? They all want happiness for everyone, striving for the welfare of society. If they were still alive in this world today, if they had gathered together, I believe they would definitely live together perfectly as close friends. I try to be their little student.

Ho Chi Minh Thought, as codified by the Communist Party of Vietnam, describes the following as the core of ideological system of Ho Chi Minh Thought:

* Revolutionary ethics needs, thrifty, integrity, righteousness and impartiality;
* Take care of fostering revolutionary generations for the next life;
* Building a clean, strong Party, cadres and party members who are both leaders and loyal servants of the people

Central to Ho Chi Minh Thought is the importance of the Communist Party being the center of a [[self-determination|national liberation]] movement.<ref name=thayer /> Ho Chi Minh Thought argues that revolutionary violence and humanitarian peace are dialectical opposed to each other, however the synthesis of their conflict would inevitably be the preservation of peace, independence and national liberation.<ref name=Curriculum>Curriculum Ho Chi Minh ideology. National political publishing house. Second edition, 2006, pages 48, 29, 50</ref>

Related to socialism and economics, Ho Chi Minh Thought details the following about socialist construction and characteristics of a socialist society and economy:<ref name=Curriculum />

*Socialism is a society with highly developed production force, associated with the progressive development of science - technology and culture, the rich, and the strong country.<ref name=\"National Academy\">{{cite web |title=Undeniable values of Ho Chi Minh Thought |url=https://hcma.vn/english/news/Pages/features.aspx?CateID=200&ItemID=9008 |website=Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics |publisher=Communist Party of Vietnam |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>
*Implementation of workers ownership of the means of production and implementing the principle of labor distribution.
* A [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] based on the unity of industrial, agricultural, and intellectual workers under the leadership of the Communist Party.
* A socialist society has a system of social relations that is healthy, fair and equal, with no opposition between intellectual and manual labor, and between urban and rural areas.

The '''Cambridge Film Festival''' is the third-longest-running [[film festival]] in the [[UK]]. The festival historically took place during early July, but now takes place annually during Autumn in [[Cambridge]]. It is organised by the registered charity Cambridge Film Trust.

Established in 1977 and re-launched in 2001 after a 5-year hiatus, the Cambridge Film Festival shows a range of UK and international films that debuted at leading film festivals, including the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Berlin Film Festival]], as well as hosting UK premieres of films, alongside a broad range of specialist interest, archive, and retrospective strands. All films are open to the public to watch.

Each year the Festival awards audience awards to the Best Feature (The Golden Punt Award), Best Documentary (Silver Punt Award), and Best Short Film (Crystal Punt Award).

==About==

The Cambridge Film Festival is a celebration of film – past, present and future that prides itself on showing film from all over the world from all different kinds of filmmakers.

The Festival has a long running relationship with [[Woody Allen]] which has seen him offer the UK [[premiere]]s of many of his films, including ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'', ''[[Blue Jasmine]]'' and in 2014, ''[[Magic in the Moonlight]]'' which marked Allen's 20th preview at the Cambridge Film Festival.

Other UK premieres at the Festival have included [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' in 1992, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' starring [[Johnny Depp]], and [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Broken Flowers]]'' with [[Bill Murray]].

The Festival also has touring events across the Eastern region of England including [[Norwich]], [[Ipswich]] and [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]. Notably in 2006 the Festival held an outdoors screening of ''[[A Cock and Bull Story]]'' at [[Felbrigg Hall]], one of that film's shooting locations.

In 2006 the Cambridge Film Trust was launched, a new charity aiming to support and promote the film festival and film culture in Cambridge.

Originally based at the much loved single-screen Arts Cinema in Cambridge city centre's Market Passage, the Festival quickly developed from modest beginnings to become an important date in the international film festival calendar which would draw broad audiences from across the region and beyond.

====1978====
The second Cambridge Film Festival in 1978 hosted the UK Premiere of THE CHESS PLAYERS. It was the centrepiece of a Satyajit Ray retrospective and marks the establishment of the Retrospective Strand. The programme also included Rudolph's WELCOME TO LA, Jarman's JUBILEE and HARLAN COUNTY, USA.

The '''geography of Texas''' is diverse and large. Occupying about 7% of the total water and land area of the U.S.,<ref name=\"Tx Almanac Area\">{{cite web|url= http://texasalmanac.com/topics/environment/environment|title= Texas Almanac|accessdate= 2016-06-25}}</ref> it is the second largest state after [[Alaska]], and is the southernmost part of the [[Great Plains]], which end in the south against the folded [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] of [[Mexico]]. [[Texas]] is in the [[South Central United States]] of America, and is considered to form part of the [[U.S. Southern States|U.S. South]] and also part of the [[Southwest United States|U.S. Southwest]].<ref>{{cite web | url = 
http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/is-texas-southern-western-or-truly-a-lone-star/ | website = [[Texas Monthly]] | title = Is Texas Southern, Western, or Truly a Lone Star? | last = Nova Lomax | first = John | date = March 3, 2015 | accessdate = September 6, 2016 }}</ref>

By residents, the state is generally divided into [[North Texas]], [[East Texas]], [[Central Texas]], [[South Texas]], [[West Texas]] (and sometimes the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]]), but according to the ''[[Texas Almanac]]'', Texas has four major physical regions: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province. This has been cited as the difference between [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]], although the fact that Texas was granted [[Texas divisionism|the prerogative to divide into as many as five U.S. states]] may be a historical motive for Texans defining their state as containing exactly five regions.<ref name=\"State division\">{{cite web|url= http://www.texasescapes.com/MikeCoxTexasTales/211Texas-County-Seats-and-Counties-Name-Confusion.htm| title= Texas Escapes.com|accessdate= 2006-07-15}}</ref>

Some [[List of geographical regions in Texas|regions in Texas]] are more associated with the Southeast than the Southwest (primarily East Texas, Central Texas, and North Texas), while other regions share more similarities with the Southwest (primarily far West Texas and lower South Texas). The [[Salient (geography)|upper Panhandle]] is considered by many to have more in common with parts of the [[Midwestern United States|plains Midwest]] than either the South or Southwest. The size of Texas prohibits easy categorization of the entire state wholly in any recognized region of the United States, and even [[cultural diversity]] among regions of the state make it difficult to treat Texas as a region in its own right.

==Physical geography==
Texas covers a total area of {{convert|268581|sqmi|km2|0}}.

[[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]], in the northeastern corner of the state, is about the same distance from [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], as it is from El Paso, and [[Dalhart, Texas|Dalhart]], in the northwestern corner of the state, is closer to the [[List of capitals in the United States|state capitals]] of [[Topeka, Kansas|Kansas]], [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[Denver|Colorado]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma]] and [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Wyoming]] than it is to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], its own state capital.<ref name=\"Stats\">{{cite web|url= http://www.statemaster.com/state/TX-texas/geo-geography|title= StateMaster|accessdate= 2006-07-11}}</ref>

===Coast and estuaries===
Much of the {{Convert|367|mi|km|adj=on}} Gulf coastline of Texas is paralleled by the [[Texas barrier islands]], many of which enclose a [[Estuaries of Texas|series of estuaries]] where the state's rivers mix with water from the Gulf of Mexico. These water bodies include some of the largest and most ecologically productive coastal estuaries in the United States and contribute significantly to the ecological and economic resources of Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bays & Estuaries|website=[[Texas Water Development Board]]|url=https://www.twdb.texas.gov/surfacewater/bays/index.asp|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>

[[Image:Caddo Lake- Cypress.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Caddo Lake]]]]
The [[Gulf Coastal Plains]] extends from the Gulf of Mexico inland to the [[Balcones Fault]] and the [[Cross Timbers|Eastern Cross Timbers]]. This large area stretches from the cities of [[Paris, Texas|Paris]] to [[San Antonio]] to [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]] but shows a large variety in vegetation. Ranging from {{Convert|20|to|58|in|mm}} of annual rainfall, this is a nearly level, drained plain dissected by streams and rivers flowing into coastal estuaries and [[marsh]]es. Windblown sands and dunes, grasslands, oak mottes and salt marshes make up the seaward areas.<ref name=\"Regions\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lone-star.net/mall/txtrails/regions.htm |title= LoneStarInternet|accessdate= 2006-07-14}}</ref> [[National Park]]s include [[Big Thicket National Preserve]], [[Padre Island National Seashore]] and the [[Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site]].<ref name=\"NatParks\">{{cite web |url=http://www.texasep.org/html/lnd/lnd_5pub.html |title= Tx Environmental Profiles|accessdate= 2006-07-14}}</ref>

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of Texas}}
Texas is mostly [[sedimentary rocks]], with East Texas underlain by a [[Cretaceous]] and younger sequence of sediments, the trace of ancient shorelines east and south until the [[active continental margin]] of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] is met.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} This sequence is built atop the subsided crest of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]&ndash;[[Ouachita Mountains]]&ndash;[[Marathon Uplift|Marathon Mountains]] zone of [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] [[continental collision]], which [[post-orogenic collapse|collapsed]] when [[rifting]] in [[Jurassic]] time opened the Gulf of Mexico. West from this [[orogeny|orogenic]] crest, which is buried beneath the [[Dallas]]&ndash;[[Waco, Texas|Waco]]&ndash;[[Austin, Texas|Austin]]&ndash;[[San Antonio]] trend, the sediments are [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] in age. [[Petroleum|Oil]] is found in the Cretaceous sediments in the east, the Permian sediments in the west, and along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas [[continental shelf]]. A few exposures of [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s are found in the central and western parts of the state, and [[Oligocene]] [[volcanic]] rocks are found in far west Texas, in the [[Big Bend, Texas|Big Bend]] area. A blanket of [[Miocene]] sediments known as the [[Ogallala formation]] in the western high plains region is an important [[aquifer]]. Texas has no active or dormant volcanoes and few earthquakes, being situated far from an active [[plate tectonic]] boundary. The Big Bend area is the most seismically active; however, the area is sparsely populated and suffers minimal damages and injuries, and no known fatalities have been attributed to a Texas earthquake.

==Resources==
With a large supply of [[natural resource]]s, Texas is a major [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and [[Industry|industrial]] state, producing oil, cattle, sheep, and cotton. The state also produces poultry, eggs, dairy products, greenhouse and nursery products, wheat, hay, rice, sugar cane, and peanuts, and a range of fruits and vegetables.<ref name=\"InfoResources\">{{cite web|url= http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108277.html|title= infoplease.com|accessdate= 2006-07-14 }}</ref>
*[[Asphalt]]-bearing rocks, mainly cretaceous limestones, occur in [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar]], [[Burnet County, Texas|Burnet]], [[Kinney County, Texas|Kinney]], [[Uvalde County, Texas|Uvalde]], and other counties.
*[[Cement]] is produced in Bexar, Comal, Dallas, Ector, Ellis, El Paso, Harris, Hays, McLennan, Nolan, Nueces, Potter, and Tarrant counties. Historically, Texas' Portland cement output accounts for about 10% of the annual United States production.{{cn|date=September 2016}}
*With an abundance of various types of [[clay]]s, Texas is one of the leading producers of clays.
*[[Bituminous coal]] occurs primarily in Coleman, Eastland, Erath, Jack, McCulloch, Montague, Palo Pinto, Parker, Throckmorton, Wise, and Young counties of Texas. [[Lignite]], or brown coal, occurs in deposits in the Texas Coastal Plain.
*Fluorspar or [[fluorite]] is an important industrial mineral used in the manufacture of [[steel]], aluminum, [[glass]], and fluorocarbons. It occurs at several localities in the Trans-Pecos and Llano regions of Texas.
*Collecting [[gemstone]] rock and mineral specimens has proved quite profitable. [[Agate]], [[jasper]], [[cinnabar]], [[fluorite]], [[topaz]], [[calcite]], [[opal]], [[petrified wood]], and [[tektites]] are all commonly collected.

*Deposits of [[graphite]] occur in the Llano region and was previously produced in Burnet County.
*Bat [[guano]] occurs in numerous caverns in the Edwards Plateau and in the Trans-Pecos region and to a more limited extent in Central Texas.
*[[Gypsum]] is extensively developed in Texas where the main occurrences are in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], the Cretaceous [[Edwards Formation]] in Gillespie and Menard counties, and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] salt domes of Harris County and previously Brooks County.
*Texas is the leading producer of [[helium]] solely from the Cliffside gas field near Amarillo.
*Deposits of [[iron ore]] are present in northeastern Texas as well as several in Central Texas.
*Elements of the [[Lanthanide]] series are commonly termed rare-earth elements. Several of the rare earths have anomalous concentrations in the [[rhyolitic]] and related igneous rocks in the Trans-Pecos area of Texas. A deposit containing several rare-earth minerals was exposed at Barringer Hill in Llano County before it was covered by the waters of Lake Buchanan.
*[[Limestone]]s, abundant in many parts of Texas, are used in the manufacture of lime. Plants for the production of lime are operating in Bexar, Bosque, Burnet, Comal, Deaf Smith, Hill, Johnson, Nueces, and Travis counties.
*[[Magnesium chloride]], [[magnesium sulfate]] and other mineral salts are present in the Upper [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] and in the underlying playas of the High Plains.
*[[Manganese]] is known to occur in [[Precambrian]] rocks in Mason and Llano counties, in Val Verde County, in Jeff Davis County, and in Dickens County.
*[[Mica]] is present in Precambrian pegmatite in the Llano region.
*Common [[opal]] occurs on the Texas Coastal Plain.
*[[Salt]]s occurs in large quantities in salt domes in the Texas Coastal Plain and with other evaporites in the Permian Basin of West Texas, as well as near [[Grand Saline, Texas]].
*[[Sand]]s used for industrial purposes commonly have been found in the Texas Coastal Plains, East Texas, north central Texas, and Central Texas; and sand mines have opened in the Shinnery (dunes) ecosystem of northern West Texas and the eastern part of the West Wingtip.
*The discovery of [[silver]] in Texas has been credited by some to Franciscans who discovered and operated mines near El Paso about 1680. Documented silver production started in the late 1880s at the Presidio Mine, in [[Presidio_County,_Texas|Presidio County]]. Texas produced 32,663,405 troy ounces of silver between 1885 and 1955
*[[Sulfur]] occurs in the caprocks of salt domes in the Gulf Coastal Plain, in Permian-age bedded deposits in Trans-Pecos Texas.
*In the past, [[uranium]] was produced from surface mines in Atascosa, Gonzales, Karnes, and Live Oak counties. All uranium mines are closed and Texas is no longer a producer.<ref name=\"Resources\">{{cite web|url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/gpm01|title= The Handbook of Texas online|accessdate= 2006-07-11|last=Garner |first=L.

[[Texas]] is in the [[South Central United States]] of America, and is considered to form part of the [[U.S. Southern States|U.S. South]] and also part of the [[Southwest United States|U.S. Southwest]].<ref>{{cite web | url =

By residents, the state is generally divided into [[North Texas]], [[East Texas]], [[Central Texas]], [[South Texas]], [[West Texas]] (and sometimes the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]]), but according to the ''[[Texas Almanac]]'', Texas has four major physical regions: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province. This has been cited as the difference between [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]], although the fact that Texas was granted [[Texas divisionism|the prerogative to divide into as many as five U.S. states]] may be a historical motive for Texans defining their state as containing exactly five regions.<ref name=\"State division\">{{cite web|url= http://www.texasescapes.com/MikeCoxTexasTales/211Texas-County-Seats-and-Counties-Name-Confusion.htm| title= Texas Escapes.com|accessdate= 2006-07-15}}</ref>

Some [[List of geographical regions in Texas|regions in Texas]] are more associated with the Southeast than the Southwest (primarily East Texas, Central Texas, and North Texas), while other regions share more similarities with the Southwest (primarily far West Texas and lower South Texas). The [[Salient (geography)|upper Panhandle]] is considered by many to have more in common with parts of the [[Midwestern United States|plains Midwest]] than either the South or Southwest. The size of Texas prohibits easy categorization of the entire state wholly in any recognized region of the United States, and even [[cultural diversity]] among regions of the state make it difficult to treat Texas as a region in its own right.

==Resources==
With a large supply of [[natural resource]]s, Texas is a major [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and [[Industry|industrial]] state, producing oil, cattle, sheep, and cotton. The state also produces poultry, eggs, dairy products, greenhouse and nursery products, wheat, hay, rice, sugar cane, and peanuts, and a range of fruits and vegetables.<ref name=\"InfoResources\">{{cite web|url= http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108277.html|title= infoplease.com|accessdate= 2006-07-14 }}</ref>

*[[Cement]] is produced in Bexar, Comal, Dallas, Ector, Ellis, El Paso, Harris, Hays, McLennan, Nolan, Nueces, Potter, and Tarrant counties. Historically, Texas' Portland cement output accounts for about 10% of the annual United States production.{{cn|date=September 2016}}
*With an abundance of various types of [[clay]]s, Texas is one of the leading producers of clays.
*[[Bituminous coal]] occurs primarily in Coleman, Eastland, Erath, Jack, McCulloch, Montague, Palo Pinto, Parker, Throckmorton, Wise, and Young counties of Texas. [[Lignite]], or brown coal, occurs in deposits in the Texas Coastal Plain.
*Fluorspar or [[fluorite]] is an important industrial mineral used in the manufacture of [[steel]], aluminum, [[glass]], and fluorocarbons. It occurs at several localities in the Trans-Pecos and Llano regions of Texas.
*Collecting [[gemstone]] rock and mineral specimens has proved quite profitable. [[Agate]], [[jasper]], [[cinnabar]], [[fluorite]], [[topaz]], [[calcite]], [[opal]], [[petrified wood]], and [[tektites]] are all commonly collected.

*Deposits of [[graphite]] occur in the Llano region and was previously produced in Burnet County.
*Bat [[guano]] occurs in numerous caverns in the Edwards Plateau and in the Trans-Pecos region and to a more limited extent in Central Texas.
*[[Gypsum]] is extensively developed in Texas where the main occurrences are in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], the Cretaceous [[Edwards Formation]] in Gillespie and Menard counties, and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] salt domes of Harris County and previously Brooks County.
*Texas is the leading producer of [[helium]] solely from the Cliffside gas field near Amarillo.
*Deposits of [[iron ore]] are present in northeastern Texas as well as several in Central Texas.
*Elements of the [[Lanthanide]] series are commonly termed rare-earth elements. Several of the rare earths have anomalous concentrations in the [[rhyolitic]] and related igneous rocks in the Trans-Pecos area of Texas. A deposit containing several rare-earth minerals was exposed at Barringer Hill in Llano County before it was covered by the waters of Lake Buchanan.
*[[Limestone]]s, abundant in many parts of Texas, are used in the manufacture of lime. Plants for the production of lime are operating in Bexar, Bosque, Burnet, Comal, Deaf Smith, Hill, Johnson, Nueces, and Travis counties.

*[[Sand]]s used for industrial purposes commonly have been found in the Texas Coastal Plains, East Texas, north central Texas, and Central Texas; and sand mines have opened in the Shinnery (dunes) ecosystem of northern West Texas and the eastern part of the West Wingtip.
*The discovery of [[silver]] in Texas has been credited by some to Franciscans who discovered and operated mines near El Paso about 1680. Documented silver production started in the late 1880s at the Presidio Mine, in [[Presidio_County,_Texas|Presidio County]]. Texas produced 32,663,405 troy ounces of silver between 1885 and 1955
*[[Sulfur]] occurs in the caprocks of salt domes in the Gulf Coastal Plain, in Permian-age bedded deposits in Trans-Pecos Texas.
*In the past, [[uranium]] was produced from surface mines in Atascosa, Gonzales, Karnes, and Live Oak counties. All uranium mines are closed and Texas is no longer a producer.<ref name=\"Resources\">{{cite web|url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/gpm01|title= The Handbook of Texas online|accessdate= 2006-07-11|last=Garner |first=L.

The Cavan County Board of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) ({{lang-ga|Cumann Lúthchleas Gael Coiste Chontae an Chabháin}}) or '''Cavan GAA''' is one of the 32 [[GAA county|county boards]] of the GAA in Ireland, and is responsible for [[Gaelic games]] in [[County Cavan|Cavan]].

== Governance ==
{{See also|Gaelic Athletic Association county}}
Cavan GAA has jurisdiction over the area that is associated with the traditional [[Counties of Ireland|county]] of [[County Cavan]]. There are 8 officers on the Board. For details on the Board's clubs, see [[:Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan|Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan]] and [[List of Gaelic games clubs in Ireland#Cavan]].
The Board is subject to the [[Ulster GAA]] Provincial Council.
{{Cavan GAA clubs|state=collapsed}}
The teams of Cavan GAA play home games at [[Kingspan Breffni Park]], [[Cavan]]. The current football manager is Mickey Graham, who took over following the resignation of Mattie McGleenan in 2018.

===Sponsorship===
The following is a list of sponsors of the Cavan Senior Football team
* 1992: Holybrook Construction
* 1993: Atlanta Conservatories
* 1994: Cavan Co-op Mart 
* 1995 – present: [[Kingspan Group]]
Cavan have had only 4 sponsorship deals since sponsors on jerseys were permitted by the GAA in 1991. There was no sponsorship on GAA jerseys until the 2nd game of the Meath V Dublin 4 in a row in 1991 so only a handful of teams had sponsorship in 1991. In 1992 Holybrook Construction sponsored the jerseys although it was only for 1 game. For the 1993-94 seasons Cavan Co-op Mart took over sponsorship. Kingspan has continuously sponsored Cavan since 1995.

===Crest and symbols===
[[File:Cavan Coat of Arms.png|left|thumb|100px|Coat of Arms of County Cavan]]
The first crest that adorned the Cavan jerseys was the Coat of Arms for [[County Cavan]]. The crest was split into four quadrants and included
* the red hand of Ulster encased in an outline of the Franciscan Abbey which is situated in Cavan town and where the O'Reilly chieftains are buried. Here also lies the remains of an Ulster leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill. 
*The Rampant Lion from the coat of arms of the O’Reilly clans, who were the local lords.
In 2004 Cavan released a new crest for the Breifne County. The crest was designed by the [[List of Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association|38th President]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] Aogán Farrell and Cavan Central Council rep. George Cartwright. The crest draws on cultural, physical and historical influences. The primary colours are blue and white with Ulster's red hand and G.A.A. yellow also prominent. The designers wanted to reflect the following elements
*Breifne: The ancient Gaelic territory. Modern Cavan was once \"O Reilly country\" and the ancient Gaelic kingdom of Breifne is preserved in the name of the home pitch in Cavan and now on its crest
*Franciscan Abbey: The mediaeval tower from the Abbey in Cavan Town fills the lower quadrant. Here the O' Reilly’s invited the Franciscans to establish a monastery. The O'Reilly chieftains are buried here. Here also lie the remains of Ulster's great leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill
*GAA Logo: The GAA modern logo fills the right quadrant. The logo is representative of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].
*Red Hand 1886:  The first GAA club founded in the province of Ulster was formed in Cavan. [[Ballyconnell First Ulsters GFC|Ballyconnell First Ulsters]] formed in 1885 and affiliated in 1886. The date is preserved in the crest. A red hand has always appeared on Cavan crests. 
*Lakes and Hills: Our landscape is dominated by \"wee lakes and hills\". The environment shapes us and this is reflected on the new crest.

===History===
[[File:Cavan vs Queens - 2009.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cavan (blue) in action against [[Queen's University Belfast]] in the 2009 [[Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]
The first GAA club in Cavan and in Ulster was founded in [[Ballyconnell]] in late 1885 called Ballyconnell Joe Biggars in honour of west Cavan Nationalist MP Joe Biggar. The name of the club was later changed to Ballyconnell First Ulsters.

The very first Cavan County Final, under GAA rules was played in a field outside Cavan Town on 30 April 1887. The final was contested by Ballyconnell First Ulster’s and Maghera MacFinns. MacFinns recorded a famous victory on a score line of 1-4 to First Ulster’s 0-1, thus entering the history books as Cavan’s first Champions.

Cavan are the most successful football county in Ulster, having won the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] 5 times, the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] 39 times, and the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] once.
Cavan's first All-Ireland victory came in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1933]]. They foiled [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]'s five-in-a-row bid with a last minute goal from Vincent McGovern in the All-Ireland Semi-Final at Breffni Park 1933, and went on to beat [[Galway GAA|Galway]] by a point in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|the final]], to become the first Ulster county to win the Sam Maguire Cup. Two years later, Cavan beat [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in the [[1935 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1935 final]] to bring home their second title in three years.

Cavan's third, and most famous All-Ireland title came in [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1947]], defeating [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the famous [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]], the only time the final was held outside of Ireland. They followed this up with a one-point win over [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in [[1948 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1948]], to win back-to-back titles for the first time. They reached their third successive [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1949]], but they were denied a three-in-a-row by [[Meath GAA|Meath]], losing by four points.
Cavan later gained revenge for this defeat, beating Meath after a replay in [[1952 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1952]] to bring home their fifth, and so far last, All-Ireland title. Cavan have not appeared in another All-Ireland final since.

Historically, Cavan have dominated the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]], winning a record 39 titles. Despite this, Cavan have won only one Ulster Championship since 1969, this success coming in the [[1997 Ulster Senior Football Championship Final|1997 final]], after beating [[Derry GAA|Derry]] by a point. Cavan's most recent Ulster Final appearance was in [[2019 Ulster Senior Football Championship|2019]], losing to [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]].

The current Cavan manager is Mickey Graham.

==Hurling==

===History===
Traditionally the County board has actively discouraged hurling through their policies football but Hurling has been present in the county. The championship has never been held consistently and at times wasn’t finished. Belturbet won the first [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] in 1908. Hurling was revived in Cavan in 1917. Cavan Slashers were the standout Hurling team of the early period winning the championship in 1922, 1924, 1927 and 1928.  They also won 4-in-a-row between 1933 and 1936.

Again hurling died away in the county with only eight championships been finished between 1937 and 1981. Ballyhaise won successive championships in 1948 and 1949. Granard won their first championship in 1950 and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] and Cavan Gaels dominated the 1970s and the early 1980s. Bailieborough were victorious in 1966. Cavan Gaels won in 1973 and 1974. Bailieborough won their second championship ten years after the first in 1976 and won again in 1977.

1982 saw the start of Cavan’s most successful period in their Hurling history due to the influence of soldiers from hurling counties such as Kilkenny, Clare and Cork who were stationed at the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the troubles. From 1982 to 1985 Cavan Gaels and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] won 2 Championships each. Bailieborough won in 1982 and 1984 and Cavan Gaels in 1983 and 1985. The County team also had success winning the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985. In-between both Championships they won the [[National Hurling League]] Division 4 in 1984.

Woodford Gaels broke the Cavan Gaels/Bailieborough dominance and won the next 3 championships 1986-1988. No championship was held in 1989 but the 1990s saw the start of the Mullahoran dominance. Mulllahoran won an amazing 21 [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] between 1990 and 2010. Mullahoran’s dominance was finally broken by Ballymachugh who were runners up to Mullahoran 2005, 2008 and 2009. They beat Mullahoran in 2011 on a score of 4-08 to 1-06. No championship took place in 2012 and Mullahoran won their 22nd championship in 2013 beating Cootehill Celtic 0-13 to 0-04. 

In 2011 after a disastrous Division 4 league campaign where they ended with a -157 scoring difference the decision was made to discontinue the senior hurling team resulting in Cavan being the only county in Ireland without a senior hurling representative team for nearly 6 years. 

Cavan turned out a team for the first time in six years in 2017, and played in the [[Lory Meagher Cup]] in [[2017 Lory Meagher Cup|2017]], and re-entered the [[National Hurling League]] in [[2018 National Hurling League|2018]].

{{Cavan GAA clubs|state=collapsed}}
The teams of Cavan GAA play home games at [[Kingspan Breffni Park]], [[Cavan]]. The current football manager is Mickey Graham, who took over following the resignation of Mattie McGleenan in 2018.

===Sponsorship===
The following is a list of sponsors of the Cavan Senior Football team
* 1992: Holybrook Construction
* 1993: Atlanta Conservatories
* 1994: Cavan Co-op Mart 
* 1995 – present: [[Kingspan Group]]
Cavan have had only 4 sponsorship deals since sponsors on jerseys were permitted by the GAA in 1991. There was no sponsorship on GAA jerseys until the 2nd game of the Meath V Dublin 4 in a row in 1991 so only a handful of teams had sponsorship in 1991. In 1992 Holybrook Construction sponsored the jerseys although it was only for 1 game. For the 1993-94 seasons Cavan Co-op Mart took over sponsorship. Kingspan has continuously sponsored Cavan since 1995.

===Crest and symbols===
[[File:Cavan Coat of Arms.png|left|thumb|100px|Coat of Arms of County Cavan]]
The first crest that adorned the Cavan jerseys was the Coat of Arms for [[County Cavan]]. The crest was split into four quadrants and included
* the red hand of Ulster encased in an outline of the Franciscan Abbey which is situated in Cavan town and where the O'Reilly chieftains are buried. Here also lies the remains of an Ulster leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill. 
*The Rampant Lion from the coat of arms of the O’Reilly clans, who were the local lords.
In 2004 Cavan released a new crest for the Breifne County. The crest was designed by the [[List of Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association|38th President]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] Aogán Farrell and Cavan Central Council rep. George Cartwright. The crest draws on cultural, physical and historical influences. The primary colours are blue and white with Ulster's red hand and G.A.A. yellow also prominent. The designers wanted to reflect the following elements
*Breifne: The ancient Gaelic territory. Modern Cavan was once \"O Reilly country\" and the ancient Gaelic kingdom of Breifne is preserved in the name of the home pitch in Cavan and now on its crest
*Franciscan Abbey: The mediaeval tower from the Abbey in Cavan Town fills the lower quadrant. Here the O' Reilly’s invited the Franciscans to establish a monastery. The O'Reilly chieftains are buried here. Here also lie the remains of Ulster's great leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill
*GAA Logo: The GAA modern logo fills the right quadrant. The logo is representative of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].
*Red Hand 1886:  The first GAA club founded in the province of Ulster was formed in Cavan. [[Ballyconnell First Ulsters GFC|Ballyconnell First Ulsters]] formed in 1885 and affiliated in 1886. The date is preserved in the crest. A red hand has always appeared on Cavan crests. 
*Lakes and Hills: Our landscape is dominated by \"wee lakes and hills\". The environment shapes us and this is reflected on the new crest.

===History===
[[File:Cavan vs Queens - 2009.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cavan (blue) in action against [[Queen's University Belfast]] in the 2009 [[Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]
The first GAA club in Cavan and in Ulster was founded in [[Ballyconnell]] in late 1885 called Ballyconnell Joe Biggars in honour of west Cavan Nationalist MP Joe Biggar. The name of the club was later changed to Ballyconnell First Ulsters.

The very first Cavan County Final, under GAA rules was played in a field outside Cavan Town on 30 April 1887. The final was contested by Ballyconnell First Ulster’s and Maghera MacFinns. MacFinns recorded a famous victory on a score line of 1-4 to First Ulster’s 0-1, thus entering the history books as Cavan’s first Champions.

Cavan are the most successful football county in Ulster, having won the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] 5 times, the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] 39 times, and the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] once.
Cavan's first All-Ireland victory came in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1933]]. They foiled [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]'s five-in-a-row bid with a last minute goal from Vincent McGovern in the All-Ireland Semi-Final at Breffni Park 1933, and went on to beat [[Galway GAA|Galway]] by a point in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|the final]], to become the first Ulster county to win the Sam Maguire Cup. Two years later, Cavan beat [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in the [[1935 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1935 final]] to bring home their second title in three years.

Cavan's third, and most famous All-Ireland title came in [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1947]], defeating [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the famous [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]], the only time the final was held outside of Ireland. They followed this up with a one-point win over [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in [[1948 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1948]], to win back-to-back titles for the first time. They reached their third successive [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1949]], but they were denied a three-in-a-row by [[Meath GAA|Meath]], losing by four points.
Cavan later gained revenge for this defeat, beating Meath after a replay in [[1952 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1952]] to bring home their fifth, and so far last, All-Ireland title. Cavan have not appeared in another All-Ireland final since.

Historically, Cavan have dominated the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]], winning a record 39 titles. Despite this, Cavan have won only one Ulster Championship since 1969, this success coming in [[1997_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship#Ulster_Senior_Football_Championship|1997]], after upsetting [[Derry GAA|Derry]] in the final by a point. Cavan's most recent Ulster Final appearance was in [[2019 Ulster Senior Football Championship|2019]], losing to [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]].

The current Cavan manager is Mickey Graham.

==Hurling==

===History===
Traditionally the County board has actively discouraged hurling through their policies football but Hurling has been present in the county. The championship has never been held consistently and at times wasn’t finished. Belturbet won the first [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] in 1908. Hurling was revived in Cavan in 1917. Cavan Slashers were the standout Hurling team of the early period winning the championship in 1922, 1924, 1927 and 1928.  They also won 4-in-a-row between 1933 and 1936.

Again hurling died away in the county with only eight championships been finished between 1937 and 1981. Ballyhaise won successive championships in 1948 and 1949. Granard won their first championship in 1950 and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] and Cavan Gaels dominated the 1970s and the early 1980s. Bailieborough were victorious in 1966. Cavan Gaels won in 1973 and 1974. Bailieborough won their second championship ten years after the first in 1976 and won again in 1977.

1982 saw the start of Cavan’s most successful period in their Hurling history due to the influence of soldiers from hurling counties such as Kilkenny, Clare and Cork who were stationed at the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the troubles. From 1982 to 1985 Cavan Gaels and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] won 2 Championships each. Bailieborough won in 1982 and 1984 and Cavan Gaels in 1983 and 1985. The County team also had success winning the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985. In-between both Championships they won the [[National Hurling League]] Division 4 in 1984.

Woodford Gaels broke the Cavan Gaels/Bailieborough dominance and won the next 3 championships 1986-1988. No championship was held in 1989 but the 1990s saw the start of the Mullahoran dominance. Mulllahoran won an amazing 21 [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] between 1990 and 2010. Mullahoran’s dominance was finally broken by Ballymachugh who were runners up to Mullahoran 2005, 2008 and 2009. They beat Mullahoran in 2011 on a score of 4-08 to 1-06. No championship took place in 2012 and Mullahoran won their 22nd championship in 2013 beating Cootehill Celtic 0-13 to 0-04. 

In 2011 after a disastrous Division 4 league campaign where they ended with a -157 scoring difference the decision was made to discontinue the senior hurling team resulting in Cavan being the only county in Ireland without a senior hurling representative team for nearly 6 years. 

Cavan turned out a team for the first time in six years in 2017, and played in the [[Lory Meagher Cup]] in [[2017 Lory Meagher Cup|2017]], and re-entered the [[National Hurling League]] in [[2018 National Hurling League|2018]].

{{Nihongo|'''Ryo Kawasaki'''|川崎 燎|Kawasaki Ryō|February 25, 1947 – April 13, 2020}} was a Japanese [[jazz fusion]] guitarist, composer and band leader, best known as one of the first musicians to develop and popularise the fusion genre and for helping to develop the [[guitar synthesizer]] in collaboration with [[Roland Corporation]] and [[Korg]]. His album ''Ryo Kawasaki and the Golden Dragon Live'' was one of the first all-digital recordings and he created the [[Kawasaki Synthesizer]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. During the 1960s, he played with various Japanese jazz groups and also formed his own bands. In the early 1970s, he moved to New York City, where he settled and worked with [[Gil Evans]], [[Elvin Jones]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[Ted Curson]], [[Joanne Brackeen]] amongst others. In the mid-1980s, Kawasaki drifted out of performing music in favour of writing music software for computers. He also produced several techno dance singles, formed his own record company called Satellites Records, and later returned to jazz-fusion in 1991.

==Life==

===Early life (1947–1968)===
Ryo Kawasaki was born on February 25, 1947, in [[Kōenji]], Tokyo, while Japan was still struggling and recovering from the early post World War II period. His father, Torao Kawasaki, was a Japanese [[diplomat]] who had worked for The [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] since 1919. Torao worked at several Japanese consulates and embassies, including San Francisco, [[Honolulu]], Fengtian (then capital of [[Manchuria]], now [[Shenyang]] in China), [[Shanghai]], and [[Beijing]] while active as an English teacher and translator for official diplomatic conferences. Ryo's mother, Hiroko, was also multilingual, and spoke German, Russian, English, and Chinese aside from her native tongue Japanese. Hiroko grew up in [[Manchuria]] and then met Torao in [[Shanghai]]. Torao was already 58 years old when Ryo was born as an only child.

Kawasaki's mother encouraged him to take piano and ballet lessons, and he took voice lessons and [[solfege]] at age four and violin lessons at five, and was reading music before elementary school. As a grade scholar, he began a lifelong fascination with [[astronomy]] and electronics (he built his own radios, TVs and audio systems including amplifiers and speakers as well as telescopes). When Ryo was 10, he bought a [[ukulele]] and, at 14, he got his first [[acoustic guitar]]. The album ''Midnight Blue'' by [[Kenny Burrell]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]] inspired Ryo to study jazz.

In high school, he began hanging out at coffee-houses that featured live music, formed a jazz ensemble and built an [[electronic organ]] that served as a primitive [[synthesizer]]. By the time he was 16, his band was playing professionally in cabarets and strip joints. Although he continued to play music regularly, he attended Nippon University, majored in [[quantum physics]] and earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] Degree. Although he has failed to prove his main interest and intuitive belief at that time, which is to prove that speed (acceleration) of gravity must be much greater than speed of light. He also did some teaching and contest judging at the [[Yamaha]] musical instrument manufacturer's jazz school. Additionally he worked as a [[sound engineer]] for Japanese [[Victor Records]] and [[Gazell|BGM]]/[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] Music where he learned [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and editing.

===Early career in Japan (1969–1973)===
He recorded his first solo album for [[Polydor Records]] when he was 22. Although he continued to perform with his jazz group, and at a young age was voted the No.&nbsp;3 [[jazz guitarist]] in a Japanese jazz poll, Kawasaki spent most of the next three years working as [[studio musician]] on everything from advertising jingles to pop songs including countless radio and TV appearances. He recorded his second album for [[Toshiba]] when he was 24. He played with [[B.B. King]] at a blues festival and also met [[George Benson]] (they jammed for five hours at Kawasaki's house).

He also has recorded and worked with notable Japanese jazz musicians such as drummer Takeshi Inomata and Sound limits, saxophonist Jiro Inagaki and Soul Mates, saxophonist Keiichiro Ebisawa, saxophonist Seiichi Nakamura, pianist Masahiko Sato ([[:ja:佐藤允彦|佐藤允彦]]), saxophonist Hidehiko Matsumoto ([[:ja:松本英彦|松本英彦]]) and many others.

===Developments in New York City (1973–2002)===

====1973–1979 (as guitarist)====
[[File:Ryo-gil.jpg|thumb|Ryo Kawasaki with [[Gil Evans]] at Sweet Basil in New York City, 1982]]
[[File:David Williams, Elvin Jones and Ryo Kawasaki.jpg|right|thumb|David Williams, [[Elvin Jones]] and Kawasaki in Rochester, N.Y. 1976]]
In 1973, Kawasaki arrived in New York. A friend picked him up at the airport and offered him an immediate gig with [[Joe Lee Wilson]] playing at the [[Lincoln Center]] as part of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]]. Soon Kawasaki was jamming regularly as part of the jazz community's \"loft scene\", and was invited to play with [[Bobbi Humphrey]]. A few months later, Kawasaki walked up to his apartment and found a stranger waiting for him at his front door. It was [[Gil Evans]] and he invited Kawasaki to join The Gil Evans Orchestra ([[David Sanborn]], [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], [[Lew Soloff]]) which was then working on a jazz recording of [[Jimi Hendrix]] compositions, ''[[The Gil Evans Orchestra Plays the Music of Jimi Hendrix]]''. Hendrix had dreamed up the concept with Evans, but Jimi died a week before the project started in 1970. Kawasaki also played on another Gil Evans album on [[RCA Records|RCA]], ''[[There Comes a Time (album)|There Comes a Time]]'', with [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] on drums. Kawasaki rehearsed for a month with the third edition of Tony Williams' Lifetime with trio format with bassist [[Doug Rauch]] working with [[Carlos Santana]] at that time, but Tony left to spend a year in Europe before the band got the chance to perform in public.

Kawasaki followed in the footsteps of [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], [[Gábor Szabó]] and [[Larry Coryell]] by becoming the [[guitarist]] in the [[Chico Hamilton]] Band, playing on a U.S. tour and working on various film scores that Chico recorded in [[Hollywood]]. Kawasaki made his debut U.S. album, ''Juice'', in 1976 for RCA and was one of the first Japanese jazz artists to sign with a major label in the States. Sidemen on the project included [[Tom Coster]] ([[Carlos Santana]]) and [[Sam Morrison]] ([[Miles Davis]]). Kawasaki followed that recording with two more albums, ''Prism'' and ''Eight Mile Road'', for the Japanese [[record label|label]] East Wind. He also joined the [[Elvin Jones]] Band for a year-long tour of North and South America and Europe. By 1978, Kawasaki was tired of touring with other bands and returned to his own projects.

He explored [[Music of India]], learned [[ragas]] and recorded an Audio Fidelity album, Ring Toss, that combined eastern and western music. With [[Dave Liebman]] he recorded Nature's Revenge for the German [[MPS Records|MPS]] [[label]] and they toured Europe. Ryo also toured European jazz festivals with [[Joanne Brackeen]] as piano – guitar duo, and they recorded a pair of albums—AFT and Trinkets and Things—for Timeless Records in the Netherlands. In Japan, [[Sony]]'s Open Sky label signed Ryo for three albums—Mirror of my Mind, Little Tree and Live—the latter, recorded in a Tokyo club, was one of the first all-digital recordings. Notable musicians participated on those recordings include [[Michael Brecker]], [[Harvey Mason]], [[Leon Pendarvis]], [[Azar Lawrence]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], [[Lincoln Goines]], [[Badal Roy]], [[Nana Vasconcelos]], [[Buddy Williams (jazz drummer)|Buddy Williams]], [[Larry Willis]], and [[Alex Blake]]. He also recorded an album called ''Sapporo'' for Swiss label America Sound in 1980 while touring Switzerland and Germany.

====1979–1990 (as inventor and programmer)====
Kawasaki invented his own [[guitar synthesizer]] in 1979, and used it to perform numerous solo shows at [[planetarium]]s from 1980 to 1983. He also formed the jazz-rock group The Golden Dragon and performed concerts regularly in early 1980s. [[Fostex]] developed the first quarter- inch-tape, eight-track recorder called A8 along with 2 track mastering machine A2 and asked Kawasaki to be the first artist to use it. He recorded the album Ryo in 1981 for [[Philips Records]] and gained notoriety for creating all the music himself. He played only a nylon-string acoustic guitar with all his backing tracks created on his guitar synthesizer including the entire original [[orchestration]] of [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s well known [[Concierto de Aranjuez]] – [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]] movement. He did another similar recording, Lucky Lady, the next year.

When the [[Commodore 64]] computer came out with a sound-chip in it, Kawasaki became fascinated by the possibilities. He learned to write [[computer programs]] and devoted 16 hours a day for two years creating four [[Music video game#Free form music games|music software programs]]—''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker|Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Magical Musiquill|Kawasaki Magical Musicquill]]'', and ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki MIDI Workstation|Kawasaki MIDI Workstation]]''—distributed by Sight and Sound Music. The first three programs were for school and home use, and the last one was for professional studios. He created an all-synthesized album, ''Images'', in 1987; and the soundtrack, Pleasure Garden, in 1990, for an [[IMAX]] film about the preservation of the Earth's endangered tropical rain forests.

From 1986 to 1990, Kawasaki produced a series of high-charting [[12 inch single|12 inch]] dance  singles—\"Electric World\", \"One Kiss\", \"No Expectations\", \"Say Baby I Love You\", \"Don't Tell Me\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Life is The Rhythm\", \"Pleasure Garden\", and \"Acid Heat\"—that mixed free-style, house, acid house and ambient sounds. All of the production was done at his home studio, The Satellite Station, and the records were released on his own label, Satellites Records. His band and a dance troupe also performed extensively in New York dance clubs. In addition, for five years (1988 to 1993), Kawasaki was the New York producer and director of two Japanese national weekly music radio programs, ''The Music Now'' and ''Idex Music Jam''. In 1991. He also collaborated with Japanese [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] master Kicho Takano and produced \"Crystallization\" in 1986.

====1991–2000 (return to jazz guitarist)====
Kawasaki's musical direction took another dramatic turn when he was signed by the new jazz and adult contemporary Japanese label One Voice as an artist and record producer. Kawasaki's return to jazz, and his first album for the label, was the 1992 acoustic solo guitar album ''[[Here, There and Everywhere]]'' (released on One Voice in Japan and on Satellites Records in the U.S.). Kawasaki has produced and performed on three albums by Brazilian singer and guitarist [[Camila Benson]] for this label. Ryo has continued to release a steady string of albums—the acoustic ''My Reverie'' (music from [[Bill Evans]], [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]] and [[Gershwin]]), the electric jazz guitar-oriented ''Love Within The Universe'' (which received considerable airplay across the country), \"Remixes Remixes Vol. 1\" (also featuring Benson), \"Sweet Life\" and CD releases of \"Mirror of my Mind\" (a jazz ensemble recording with [[Harvey Mason]], [[Michael Brecker]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], Leon Pendarvis and vocalist Radha Shottam).

His 1999 release ''Cosmic Rhythm'' features British singer lyricist [[Clare Foster]] along with Kawasaki's rhythm section Victor Jones on drums, [[Lincoln Goines]] on bass. The album also features [[David Kikoski]] on piano and [[Shunzo Ohno]] on flugelhorn. All the songs were arranged and recorded by Kawasaki including original ten songs by Ro himself.

During 1995–1999, three [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists, [[Puff Daddy]], [[Kool G Rap]], and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], recorded Kawasaki's original composition \"[[Bamboo Child]]\" on their latest albums more than twenty years after its original recording.

===Developments in Estonia and beyond (2000–2020)===
In 2001, Kawasaki released live a studio trio album \"Reval\", recorded in [[Tallinn]], Estonia with Estonian musicians [[Toivo Unt]] on bass, [[Aivar Vassiljev]] on drums, and Kristi Keel on [[English horn]].

His other projects include being a composer, music director as well as a guitarist for the jazz ballet \"Still Point\" for the Estonian National Opera House during 2000-2002. This ballet is choreographed by [[Russell Adamson]], a native Jamaican who resides in [[Helsinki]].

Kawasaki released his third [[acoustic guitar]] solo album 'E' in 2002.

From the year 2000 on, Kawasaki further expanded his live appearances into Russia and [[Baltic region]] Jazz Festivals. His quartet has appeared at Rigas Ritmi Jazz Festival in [[Riga]]/[[Latvia]], [[Pori Jazz|Pori]] and other jazz festivals in Finland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and [[Saransk]] Jazz Ark Festival. He also appeared numerous times at [[Nõmme]] Jazz Festival in Estonia while assisting the production of this jazz festival.

Kawasaki's projects during 2005–2008 included guitar trio project with American drummer [[Brian Melvin]] and Estonian bassist [[Toivo Unt]] under the \"Art of Trio\" name, performing in a variety of venues in Finland, Sweden, and the Baltic states, and performing with Estonian vocalist Jaanika Ventsel, while also touring and recording in Japan for the duo project with bassist Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:鈴木良雄|鈴木良雄]]), their duo CD \"[[Agana]]\" was released in February 2007.

In 2008, Kawasaki formed jazz ensemble with Estonian pianist/keyboardist [[Tõnu Naissoo]].<ref>[http://www.tonunaissoo.com]</ref> Also, his second duo CD with Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:鈴木良雄|鈴木良雄]]) and first CD with \"Art of Trio\" were completed and released during 2009, while his composition \"Raisins\" was included on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' radio station Fusion FM in 2008.

From 2009 - 2011, Kawasaki further expanded his performing activities in Lebanon with Syrian bassist, Omar Harb and Lebanese drummer, Fouad Afra. The album \"Live in Beirut\" which Kawasaki recorded with Lebanese organist, Arthur Satyan and drummer, Fouad Afra was released in 2011.

Overlapping the same time period, beginning in 2007, Kawasaki gradually developed his 4th acoustic guitar solo album \"Spain\" in Tallinn, Estonia, which was finally released in 2012.
In 2014, Ryo discovered a younger generation of Estonian musicians who inspired him to further develop a fusion, jazz-rock sound using his own compositions. Ryo's attention on these directions had somewhat faded away after their recording and release in the early 1980s with his group \"Golden Dragon\". As of spring 2016, Kawasaki has formed a new quartet called, \"Level 8\" exclusively with Estonian musicians: keyboardist, Raun Juurikas; electric bassist, Kaarel Liiv; and drummer, Eno Kollom. \"Level 8\" has now finished recording a new self-titled album focusing on Ryo's compositions both from the past and present utilizing a funk/fusion/jazz-rock sound. The album \"Level 8\" was released in March 2017.

In April 2016, UK independent label Nunorthernsoul released a vinyl EP titled \"Selected Works 1979 to 1983 by Ryo Kawasaki.\" A follow-up vinyl EP titled \"Selected Works Part 2 - 1976 to 1980 by Ryo Kawasaki\" is scheduled to be released in April 2017.

He died in Tallinn, Estonia in April 2020 at the age of 73.<ref>[https://kultuur.err.ee/1076803/suri-ryo-kawasaki Suri Ryo Kawasaki]</ref>

==Life==

===Early life (1947–1968)===
Ryo Kawasaki was born on February 25, 1947, in [[Kōenji]], Tokyo, while Japan was still struggling and recovering from the early post World War II period. His father, Torao Kawasaki, was a Japanese [[diplomat]] who had worked for The [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] since 1919. Torao worked at several Japanese consulates and embassies, including San Francisco, [[Honolulu]], Fengtian (then capital of [[Manchuria]], now [[Shenyang]] in China), [[Shanghai]], and [[Beijing]] while active as an English teacher and translator for official diplomatic conferences. Ryo's mother, Hiroko, was also multilingual, and spoke German, Russian, English, and Chinese aside from her native tongue Japanese. Hiroko grew up in [[Manchuria]] and then met Torao in [[Shanghai]]. Torao was already 58 years old when Ryo was born as an only child.

Kawasaki's mother encouraged him to take piano and ballet lessons, and he took voice lessons and [[solfege]] at age four and violin lessons at five, and was reading music before elementary school. As a grade scholar, he began a lifelong fascination with [[astronomy]] and electronics (he built his own radios, TVs and audio systems including amplifiers and speakers as well as telescopes). When Ryo was 10, he bought a [[ukulele]] and, at 14, he got his first [[acoustic guitar]]. The album ''Midnight Blue'' by [[Kenny Burrell]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]] inspired Ryo to study jazz.

In high school, he began hanging out at coffee-houses that featured live music, formed a jazz ensemble and built an [[electronic organ]] that served as a primitive [[synthesizer]]. By the time he was 16, his band was playing professionally in cabarets and strip joints. Although he continued to play music regularly, he attended Nippon University, majored in [[quantum physics]] and earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] Degree. Although he has failed to prove his main interest and intuitive belief at that time, which is to prove that speed (acceleration) of gravity must be much greater than speed of light. He also did some teaching and contest judging at the [[Yamaha]] musical instrument manufacturer's jazz school. Additionally he worked as a [[sound engineer]] for Japanese [[Victor Records]] and [[Gazell|BGM]]/[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] Music where he learned [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and editing.

===Early career in Japan (1969–1973)===
He recorded his first solo album for [[Polydor Records]] when he was 22. Although he continued to perform with his jazz group, and at a young age was voted the No.&nbsp;3 [[jazz guitarist]] in a Japanese jazz poll, Kawasaki spent most of the next three years working as [[studio musician]] on everything from advertising jingles to pop songs including countless radio and TV appearances. He recorded his second album for [[Toshiba]] when he was 24. He played with [[B.B. King]] at a blues festival and also met [[George Benson]] (they jammed for five hours at Kawasaki's house).

He also has recorded and worked with notable Japanese jazz musicians such as drummer Takeshi Inomata and Sound limits, saxophonist Jiro Inagaki and Soul Mates, saxophonist Keiichiro Ebisawa, saxophonist Seiichi Nakamura, pianist Masahiko Sato ([[:ja:佐藤允彦|佐藤允彦]]), saxophonist Hidehiko Matsumoto ([[:ja:松本英彦|松本英彦]]) and many others.

===Developments in New York City (1973–2002)===

====1973–1979 (as guitarist)====
[[File:Ryo-gil.jpg|thumb|Ryo Kawasaki with [[Gil Evans]] at Sweet Basil in New York City, 1982]]
[[File:David Williams, Elvin Jones and Ryo Kawasaki.jpg|right|thumb|David Williams, [[Elvin Jones]] and Kawasaki in Rochester, N.Y. 1976]]
In 1973, Kawasaki arrived in New York. A friend picked him up at the airport and offered him an immediate gig with [[Joe Lee Wilson]] playing at the [[Lincoln Center]] as part of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]]. Soon Kawasaki was jamming regularly as part of the jazz community's \"loft scene\", and was invited to play with [[Bobbi Humphrey]]. A few months later, Kawasaki walked up to his apartment and found a stranger waiting for him at his front door. It was [[Gil Evans]] and he invited Kawasaki to join The Gil Evans Orchestra ([[David Sanborn]], [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], [[Lew Soloff]]) which was then working on a jazz recording of [[Jimi Hendrix]] compositions, ''[[The Gil Evans Orchestra Plays the Music of Jimi Hendrix]]''. Hendrix had dreamed up the concept with Evans, but Jimi died a week before the project started in 1970. Kawasaki also played on another Gil Evans album on [[RCA Records|RCA]], ''[[There Comes a Time (album)|There Comes a Time]]'', with [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] on drums. Kawasaki rehearsed for a month with the third edition of Tony Williams' Lifetime with trio format with bassist [[Doug Rauch]] working with [[Carlos Santana]] at that time, but Tony left to spend a year in Europe before the band got the chance to perform in public.

Kawasaki followed in the footsteps of [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], [[Gábor Szabó]] and [[Larry Coryell]] by becoming the [[guitarist]] in the [[Chico Hamilton]] Band, playing on a U.S. tour and working on various film scores that Chico recorded in [[Hollywood]]. Kawasaki made his debut U.S. album, ''Juice'', in 1976 for RCA and was one of the first Japanese jazz artists to sign with a major label in the States. Sidemen on the project included [[Tom Coster]] ([[Carlos Santana]]) and [[Sam Morrison]] ([[Miles Davis]]). Kawasaki followed that recording with two more albums, ''Prism'' and ''Eight Mile Road'', for the Japanese [[record label|label]] East Wind. He also joined the [[Elvin Jones]] Band for a year-long tour of North and South America and Europe. By 1978, Kawasaki was tired of touring with other bands and returned to his own projects.

He explored [[Music of India]], learned [[ragas]] and recorded an Audio Fidelity album, Ring Toss, that combined eastern and western music. With [[Dave Liebman]] he recorded Nature's Revenge for the German [[MPS Records|MPS]] [[label]] and they toured Europe. Ryo also toured European jazz festivals with [[Joanne Brackeen]] as piano – guitar duo, and they recorded a pair of albums—AFT and Trinkets and Things—for Timeless Records in the Netherlands. In Japan, [[Sony]]'s Open Sky label signed Ryo for three albums—Mirror of my Mind, Little Tree and Live—the latter, recorded in a Tokyo club, was one of the first all-digital recordings. Notable musicians participated on those recordings include [[Michael Brecker]], [[Harvey Mason]], [[Leon Pendarvis]], [[Azar Lawrence]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], [[Lincoln Goines]], [[Badal Roy]], [[Nana Vasconcelos]], [[Buddy Williams (jazz drummer)|Buddy Williams]], [[Larry Willis]], and [[Alex Blake]]. He also recorded an album called ''Sapporo'' for Swiss label America Sound in 1980 while touring Switzerland and Germany.

====1979–1990 (as inventor and programmer)====
Kawasaki invented his own [[guitar synthesizer]] in 1979, and used it to perform numerous solo shows at [[planetarium]]s from 1980 to 1983. He also formed the jazz-rock group The Golden Dragon and performed concerts regularly in early 1980s. [[Fostex]] developed the first quarter- inch-tape, eight-track recorder called A8 along with 2 track mastering machine A2 and asked Kawasaki to be the first artist to use it. He recorded the album Ryo in 1981 for [[Philips Records]] and gained notoriety for creating all the music himself. He played only a nylon-string acoustic guitar with all his backing tracks created on his guitar synthesizer including the entire original [[orchestration]] of [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s well known [[Concierto de Aranjuez]] – [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]] movement. He did another similar recording, Lucky Lady, the next year.

When the [[Commodore 64]] computer came out with a sound-chip in it, Kawasaki became fascinated by the possibilities. He learned to write [[computer programs]] and devoted 16 hours a day for two years creating four [[Music video game#Free form music games|music software programs]]—''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker|Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Magical Musiquill|Kawasaki Magical Musicquill]]'', and ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki MIDI Workstation|Kawasaki MIDI Workstation]]''—distributed by Sight and Sound Music. The first three programs were for school and home use, and the last one was for professional studios. He created an all-synthesized album, ''Images'', in 1987; and the soundtrack, Pleasure Garden, in 1990, for an [[IMAX]] film about the preservation of the Earth's endangered tropical rain forests.

From 1986 to 1990, Kawasaki produced a series of high-charting [[12 inch single|12 inch]] dance  singles—\"Electric World\", \"One Kiss\", \"No Expectations\", \"Say Baby I Love You\", \"Don't Tell Me\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Life is The Rhythm\", \"Pleasure Garden\", and \"Acid Heat\"—that mixed free-style, house, acid house and ambient sounds. All of the production was done at his home studio, The Satellite Station, and the records were released on his own label, Satellites Records. His band and a dance troupe also performed extensively in New York dance clubs. In addition, for five years (1988 to 1993), Kawasaki was the New York producer and director of two Japanese national weekly music radio programs, ''The Music Now'' and ''Idex Music Jam''. In 1991. He also collaborated with Japanese [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] master Kicho Takano and produced \"Crystallization\" in 1986.

====1991–2000 (return to jazz guitarist)====
Kawasaki's musical direction took another dramatic turn when he was signed by the new jazz and adult contemporary Japanese label One Voice as an artist and record producer. Kawasaki's return to jazz, and his first album for the label, was the 1992 acoustic solo guitar album ''[[Here, There and Everywhere]]'' (released on One Voice in Japan and on Satellites Records in the U.S.). Kawasaki has produced and performed on three albums by Brazilian singer and guitarist [[Camila Benson]] for this label. Ryo has continued to release a steady string of albums—the acoustic ''My Reverie'' (music from [[Bill Evans]], [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]] and [[Gershwin]]), the electric jazz guitar-oriented ''Love Within The Universe'' (which received considerable airplay across the country), \"Remixes Remixes Vol. 1\" (also featuring Benson), \"Sweet Life\" and CD releases of \"Mirror of my Mind\" (a jazz ensemble recording with [[Harvey Mason]], [[Michael Brecker]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], Leon Pendarvis and vocalist Radha Shottam).

His 1999 release ''Cosmic Rhythm'' features British singer lyricist [[Clare Foster]] along with Kawasaki's rhythm section Victor Jones on drums, [[Lincoln Goines]] on bass. The album also features [[David Kikoski]] on piano and [[Shunzo Ohno]] on flugelhorn. All the songs were arranged and recorded by Kawasaki including original ten songs by Ro himself.

During 1995–1999, three [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists, [[Puff Daddy]], [[Kool G Rap]], and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], recorded Kawasaki's original composition \"[[Bamboo Child]]\" on their latest albums more than twenty years after its original recording.

===Developments in Estonia and beyond (2000–2020)===
In 2001, Kawasaki released live a studio trio album \"Reval\", recorded in [[Tallinn]], Estonia with Estonian musicians [[Toivo Unt]] on bass, [[Aivar Vassiljev]] on drums, and Kristi Keel on [[English horn]].

His other projects include being a composer, music director as well as a guitarist for the jazz ballet \"Still Point\" for the Estonian National Opera House during 2000-2002. This ballet is choreographed by [[Russell Adamson]], a native Jamaican who resides in [[Helsinki]].

Kawasaki released his third [[acoustic guitar]] solo album 'E' in 2002.

From the year 2000 on, Kawasaki further expanded his live appearances into Russia and [[Baltic region]] Jazz Festivals. His quartet has appeared at Rigas Ritmi Jazz Festival in [[Riga]]/[[Latvia]], [[Pori Jazz|Pori]] and other jazz festivals in Finland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and [[Saransk]] Jazz Ark Festival. He also appeared numerous times at [[Nõmme]] Jazz Festival in Estonia while assisting the production of this jazz festival.

Kawasaki's projects during 2005–2008 included guitar trio project with American drummer [[Brian Melvin]] and Estonian bassist [[Toivo Unt]] under the \"Art of Trio\" name, performing in a variety of venues in Finland, Sweden, and the Baltic states, and performing with Estonian vocalist Jaanika Ventsel, while also touring and recording in Japan for the duo project with bassist Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:鈴木良雄|鈴木良雄]]), their duo CD \"[[Agana]]\" was released in February 2007.

In 2008, Kawasaki formed jazz ensemble with Estonian pianist/keyboardist [[Tõnu Naissoo]].<ref>[http://www.tonunaissoo.com]</ref> Also, his second duo CD with Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:鈴木良雄|鈴木良雄]]) and first CD with \"Art of Trio\" were completed and released during 2009, while his composition \"Raisins\" was included on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' radio station Fusion FM in 2008.

From 2009 - 2011, Kawasaki further expanded his performing activities in Lebanon with Syrian bassist, Omar Harb and Lebanese drummer, Fouad Afra. The album \"Live in Beirut\" which Kawasaki recorded with Lebanese organist, Arthur Satyan and drummer, Fouad Afra was released in 2011.

Overlapping the same time period, beginning in 2007, Kawasaki gradually developed his 4th acoustic guitar solo album \"Spain\" in Tallinn, Estonia, which was finally released in 2012.
In 2014, Ryo discovered a younger generation of Estonian musicians who inspired him to further develop a fusion, jazz-rock sound using his own compositions. Ryo's attention on these directions had somewhat faded away after their recording and release in the early 1980s with his group \"Golden Dragon\". As of spring 2016, Kawasaki has formed a new quartet called, \"Level 8\" exclusively with Estonian musicians: keyboardist, Raun Juurikas; electric bassist, Kaarel Liiv; and drummer, Eno Kollom. \"Level 8\" has now finished recording a new self-titled album focusing on Ryo's compositions both from the past and present utilizing a funk/fusion/jazz-rock sound. The album \"Level 8\" was released in March 2017.

In April 2016, UK independent label Nunorthernsoul released a vinyl EP titled \"Selected Works 1979 to 1983 by Ryo Kawasaki.\" A follow-up vinyl EP titled \"Selected Works Part 2 - 1976 to 1980 by Ryo Kawasaki\" is scheduled to be released in April 2017.

He died in Tallinn, Estonia in April 2020 at the age of 73.<ref>[https://kultuur.err.ee/1076803/suri-ryo-kawasaki Suri Ryo Kawasaki]</ref>

'''Joseph Evans Brown''' (July 28, 1891&nbsp;– July 6, 1973) was an American actor and comedian, remembered for his amiable screen persona, comic timing, and enormous elastic-mouth smile.<ref name=NYT1/> He was one of the most popular American comedians in the 1930s and 1940s, with films like ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935), ''[[Earthworm Tractors]]'' (1936), and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935). In his later career Brown starred in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), as Osgood Fielding III, in which he utters the film's famous punchline \"Well, nobody's perfect.\"

==Early life==
Brown was born on July 28, 1891, in [[Holgate, Ohio]], near Toledo, into a large family largely of Welsh descent. He spent most of his childhood in Toledo. In 1902, at the age of ten, he joined a troupe of circus tumblers known as the Five Marvelous Ashtons, who toured the country on both the circus and [[vaudeville]] circuits. Later he became a professional baseball player. Despite his skill, he declined an opportunity to sign with the New York Yankees to pursue his career as an entertainer. After three seasons he returned to the circus, then went into vaudeville and finally starred on Broadway. He gradually added comedy to his act, and transformed himself into a comedian. He moved to Broadway in the 1920s, first appearing in the musical comedy ''Jim Jam Jems''.

==Film career==
[[File:Earthworm Tractors (1936) 1.jpg|thumb|left|with [[June Travis]] in ''[[Earthworm Tractors]]'' (1936)]]
In late 1928, Brown began making films, starting the next year with [[Warner Brothers]]. He quickly became a favorite with child audiences,<ref name=NYT1/> and shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show]]'' (1929). He starred in a number of lavish [[Technicolor]] musical comedies, including ''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929), ''[[Hold Everything (1930 film)|Hold Everything]]'' (1930), ''[[Song of the West]]'' (1930), and ''[[Going Wild]]'' (1930). By 1931, Brown had become such a star that his name was billed above the title in the films in which he appeared.

He appeared in ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1932 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1932), a comedy in which he played a member of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], and in ''[[Elmer, the Great]]'' (1933) with [[Patricia Ellis]] and [[Claire Dodd]] and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935) with [[Olivia de Havilland]], in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the Chicago Cubs.

In 1933 he starred in ''[[Son of a Sailor]]'' with [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]] and [[Thelma Todd]]. In 1934, Brown starred in ''[[A Very Honorable Guy]]'' with [[Alice White]] and [[Robert Barrat]], in ''[[The Circus Clown]]'' again with Patricia Ellis and with [[Dorothy Burgess]], and with Maxine Doyle in ''Six-Day Bike Rider''.

Brown was one of the few vaudeville comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played [[Francis Flute]] in the [[Max Reinhardt]]/[[William Dieterle]] film version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935) and was highly praised for his performance.<ref name=NYT1/> He starred in ''[[Polo Joe]]'' (1936) with [[Carol Hughes (actress)|Carol Hughes]] and [[Richard \"Skeets\" Gallagher]], and in ''[[Sons o' Guns]]''. In 1933 and 1936, he became one of the top 10 earners in films. He was sufficiently well known internationally by this point to be depicted in comic strips in the British comic ''[[Film Fun]]'' for 20 years from 1933.

He left Warner Brothers to work for producer [[David L. Loew]], starring in ''[[When's Your Birthday?]]'' (1937). In 1938, he starred in ''[[The Gladiator (1938 film)|The Gladiator]]'', a loose adaptation of [[Philip Gordon Wylie]]'s 1930 novel ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]'' that influenced the creation of ''[[Superman]]''.<ref>Jones, Gerard. ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book''. New York: Basic Books, 2004 ({{ISBN|0465036562}}), p. 80. Also see Moskowitz, Sam ''Explorers of the Infinite: Shapers of Science Fiction'', Cleveland, Ohio: The World Publishing Co., 1963 ({{ISBN|0-88355-130-6}}), pp.278–295</ref> He gradually switched to making \"B\" pictures.

==World War II==
[[Image:ressbrown.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Brown and [[Irving Leroy Ress]] (right) c. 1950]]
In 1939, Brown testified before the House Immigration Committee in support of a bill that would allow 20,000 German-Jewish refugee children into the U.S.  He later adopted two refugee children.<ref>''The Holocaust Chronicle''.  Publications International Ltd., 2000 ({{ISBN|0-7853-2963-3}}), p. 162</ref>

At age 50 when the U.S. entered World War II, Brown was too old to enlist. Both of his biological sons served in the military during the war. In 1942, Captain Don E. Brown, was killed when his [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] crashed near Palm Springs, California.<ref name=cdt>{{cite news |title=Capt. Don Brown, Actor's Son, Dies In Bomber Crash. |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/468627642.html?dids=468627642:468627642&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&date=Oct+09%2C+1942&author=&pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune&desc=CAPT.+DON+BROWN%2C+ACTOR'S+SON%2C+DIES+IN+BOMBER+CRASH&pqatl=google |quote= |work=Chicago Tribune |date=October 9, 1942 |accessdate=April 17, 2008 }}</ref> 

Even before the [[USO]] was organized, Brown spent a great deal of time traveling, at his own expense, to entertain troops in the South Pacific, including Guadalcanal, New Zealand and Australia, as well as the Caribbean and Alaska. He was the first to tour in this way and before [[Bob Hope]] made similar journeys. Brown also spent many nights working and meeting servicemen at the [[Hollywood Canteen]].<ref name=NYT1/> He wrote of his experiences entertaining the troops in his book ''Your Kids and Mine''. <!-- Commented out due under WP:OR and WP:RS <blockquote>While big USO names like Bob Hope did not visit the Leyte, Philippine area my father was in (housing was not good), Leyte received any number of entertainers during the war. Dad said the entertainers were all just a bunch of nice people. One group in particular was the top actors from a very popular and large musical of the times. Dad and a few of his buddies would walk back to the tents that housed the USO performers and would visit with them. Mostly, the USO performers were curious about the events on the islands and how the men were handling things. One performer, a \"wonderful comedian\" named Joe E. Brown, would commandeer a military vehicle and be driven around the island. The entertainer would stop military pedestrians, \"ream\" them for some inconsequential matter, start laughing, then invite them into the cab so they could be driven to their destinations. Joe E. Brown was greatly appreciated. (Memories of Capt. Donald Courtright, told to his daughter Mary in 2011){{citation needed|date=November 2014}}</blockquote> --> On his return to the U.S., Brown brought sacks of letters, making sure they were delivered by the Post Office. He gave shows in all weather conditions, many in hospitals, sometimes doing his entire show for a single dying soldier. He signed autographs for everyone. For his services to morale, Brown became one of only two civilians to be awarded the [[Bronze Star]] during World War II.

==Postwar work==
His concern for the troops continued into the Korean War, as evidenced by a newsreel featuring his appeal for blood donations to aid the U.S. and UN troops there that was featured in the season 4 episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' titled \"Deluge\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638293/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title = \"M*A*S*H\" Deluge (TV Episode 1976)}}</ref>

In 1948, he was awarded a Special [[Tony Award]] for his work in the touring company of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]''.<ref name=NYT1/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1948|title=1948 Tony Award Winners (BroadwayWorld.com)|work=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}</ref>

He had a cameo appearance in ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956), as the [[Fort Kearney]] stationmaster talking to Fogg ([[David Niven]]) and his entourage in a small town in Nebraska. In the similarly epic film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), he had a cameo as a union official giving a speech at a construction site in the climactic scene. On television, he was the mystery guest on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' during the episode on January 11, 1953.

His best known postwar role was that of aging millionaire Osgood Fielding III in [[Billy Wilder]]'s 1959 comedy ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Fielding falls for Daphne (Jerry), played by [[Jack Lemmon]] in drag; at the end of the film, Lemmon takes off his wig and reveals to Brown that he is a man, to which Brown responds \"Well, nobody's perfect\", one of the more celebrated punchlines in film.

Another of his notable postwar roles was that of Cap'n Andy Hawks in [[MGM]]'s 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]'', a role that he reprised onstage in the 1961 [[New York City Center]] revival of the musical and on tour. Brown performed several dance routines in the film, and famed choreographer [[Gower Champion]] appeared along with first wife [[Marge Champion|Marge]]. Brown's final film appearance was in ''[[The Comedy of Terrors]]'' (1964).

Brown was a sports enthusiast, both in film and personally. Some of his best films were the \"baseball trilogy\" which consisted of ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1932 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1932), ''[[Elmer, the Great]]'' (1933) and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935). He was a television and radio broadcaster for the New York Yankees in 1953. His son [[Joe L. Brown]] became the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the Pittsburgh Pirates for more than 20 years. Brown spent [[Ty Cobb]]'s last days with him, discussing his life.

Brown's sports enthusiasm also led to him becoming the first president of [[PONY Baseball and Softball]] (at the time named Pony League) when the organization was incorporated in 1953. He continued in the post until late 1964, when he retired. Later he traveled additional thousands of miles telling the story of PONY League, hoping to interest adults in organizing baseball programs for young people. He was a fan of Thoroughbred horse racing, a regular at the racetracks in Del Mar and Santa Anita.

==In popular culture==
He was caricatured in the [[Disney]] cartoons ''[[Mickey's Gala Premiere]]'' (1933), ''[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]'' (1938), and ''[[The Autograph Hound]]'' (1939); all contain a scene in which he is seen laughing so loud that his mouth opens extremely wide. According to the official biography ''Daws Butler: Characters Actor'', [[Daws Butler]] used Joe E. Brown as inspiration for the voices of two [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon characters: [[Lippy the Lion]] (1962) and [[Peter Potamus]] (1963{{ndash}}1966).<ref>{{Cite book|asin=1593930151|title=Daws Butler, Characters Actor: Ben Ohmart, Joe Bevilacqua: 9781593930158: Amazon.com: Books}}</ref>

==Later life and family==
Brown married Kathryn Francis McGraw in 1915. The marriage lasted until his death in 1973. The couple had four children: two sons, Don Evan Brown (December 25, 1916 {{ndash}} October 8, 1942; Captain in the United States Army Air Force, who was killed in the crash of an [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20B Havoc]] bomber while serving as a ferry pilot)<ref>Associated Press, \"Flying Son Of Film Star Crash Victim\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Friday 9 October 1942, Volume 49, page 1.</ref> and [[Joe L.

Both daughters were adopted as infants.

Joe L. Brown shared his father's love of baseball, serving as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1976, and briefly in 1985, also building the 1960 and 1971 [[World Series]] champions. Brown's '71 Pirates featured baseball's first all-black starting nine.

'''Joseph Evans Brown''' (July 28, 1891&nbsp;– July 6, 1973) was an American actor and comedian, remembered for his amiable screen persona, comic timing, and enormous elastic-mouth smile.<ref name=NYT1/> He was one of the most popular American comedians in the 1930s and 1940s, with films like ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935), ''[[Earthworm Tractors]]'' (1936), and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935). In his later career Brown starred in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), as Osgood Fielding III, in which he utters the film's famous punchline \"Well, nobody's perfect.\"

==Early life==
Brown was born on July 28, 1891, in [[Holgate, Ohio]], near Toledo, into a large family largely of Welsh descent. He spent most of his childhood in Toledo. In 1902, at the age of ten, he joined a troupe of circus tumblers known as the Five Marvelous Ashtons, who toured the country on both the circus and [[vaudeville]] circuits. Later he became a professional baseball player. Despite his skill, he declined an opportunity to sign with the New York Yankees to pursue his career as an entertainer. After three seasons he returned to the circus, then went into vaudeville and finally starred on Broadway. He gradually added comedy to his act, and transformed himself into a comedian. He moved to Broadway in the 1920s, first appearing in the musical comedy ''Jim Jam Jems''.

==Film career==
[[File:Earthworm Tractors (1936) 1.jpg|thumb|left|with [[June Travis]] in ''[[Earthworm Tractors]]'' (1936)]]
In late 1928, Brown began making films, starting the next year with [[Warner Brothers]]. He quickly became a favorite with child audiences,<ref name=NYT1/> and shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show]]'' (1929). He starred in a number of lavish [[Technicolor]] musical comedies, including ''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929), ''[[Hold Everything (1930 film)|Hold Everything]]'' (1930), ''[[Song of the West]]'' (1930), and ''[[Going Wild]]'' (1930). By 1931, Brown had become such a star that his name was billed above the title in the films in which he appeared.

He appeared in ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1932 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1932), a comedy in which he played a member of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], and in ''[[Elmer, the Great]]'' (1933) with [[Patricia Ellis]] and [[Claire Dodd]] and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935) with [[Olivia de Havilland]], in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the Chicago Cubs.

In 1933 he starred in ''[[Son of a Sailor]]'' with [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]] and [[Thelma Todd]]. In 1934, Brown starred in ''[[A Very Honorable Guy]]'' with [[Alice White]] and [[Robert Barrat]], in ''[[The Circus Clown]]'' again with Patricia Ellis and with [[Dorothy Burgess]], and with Maxine Doyle in ''Six-Day Bike Rider''.

Brown was one of the few vaudeville comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played [[Francis Flute]] in the [[Max Reinhardt]]/[[William Dieterle]] film version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935) and was highly praised for his performance.<ref name=NYT1/> He starred in ''[[Polo Joe]]'' (1936) with [[Carol Hughes (actress)|Carol Hughes]] and [[Richard \"Skeets\" Gallagher]], and in ''[[Sons o' Guns]]''. In 1933 and 1936, he became one of the top 10 earners in films. He was sufficiently well known internationally by this point to be depicted in comic strips in the British comic ''[[Film Fun]]'' for 20 years from 1933.

He left Warner Brothers to work for producer [[David L. Loew]], starring in ''[[When's Your Birthday?]]'' (1937). In 1938, he starred in ''[[The Gladiator (1938 film)|The Gladiator]]'', a loose adaptation of [[Philip Gordon Wylie]]'s 1930 novel ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]'' that influenced the creation of ''[[Superman]]''.<ref>Jones, Gerard. ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book''. New York: Basic Books, 2004 ({{ISBN|0465036562}}), p. 80. Also see Moskowitz, Sam ''Explorers of the Infinite: Shapers of Science Fiction'', Cleveland, Ohio: The World Publishing Co., 1963 ({{ISBN|0-88355-130-6}}), pp.278–295</ref> He gradually switched to making \"B\" pictures.

==World War II==
[[Image:ressbrown.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Brown and [[Irving Leroy Ress]] (right) c. 1950]]
In 1939, Brown testified before the House Immigration Committee in support of a bill that would allow 20,000 German-Jewish refugee children into the U.S.  He later adopted two refugee children.<ref>''The Holocaust Chronicle''.  Publications International Ltd., 2000 ({{ISBN|0-7853-2963-3}}), p. 162</ref>

At age 50 when the U.S. entered World War II, Brown was too old to enlist. Both of his biological sons served in the military during the war. In 1942, Captain Don E. Brown, was killed when his [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] crashed near Palm Springs, California.<ref name=cdt>{{cite news |title=Capt. Don Brown, Actor's Son, Dies In Bomber Crash. |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/468627642.html?dids=468627642:468627642&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&date=Oct+09%2C+1942&author=&pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune&desc=CAPT.+DON+BROWN%2C+ACTOR'S+SON%2C+DIES+IN+BOMBER+CRASH&pqatl=google |quote= |work=Chicago Tribune |date=October 9, 1942 |accessdate=April 17, 2008 }}</ref> 

Even before the [[USO]] was organized, Brown spent a great deal of time traveling, at his own expense, to entertain troops in the South Pacific, including Guadalcanal, New Zealand and Australia, as well as the Caribbean and Alaska. He was the first to tour in this way and before [[Bob Hope]] made similar journeys. Brown also spent many nights working and meeting servicemen at the [[Hollywood Canteen]].<ref name=NYT1/> He wrote of his experiences entertaining the troops in his book ''Your Kids and Mine''. <!-- Commented out due under WP:OR and WP:RS <blockquote>While big USO names like Bob Hope did not visit the Leyte, Philippine area my father was in (housing was not good), Leyte received any number of entertainers during the war. Dad said the entertainers were all just a bunch of nice people. One group in particular was the top actors from a very popular and large musical of the times. Dad and a few of his buddies would walk back to the tents that housed the USO performers and would visit with them. Mostly, the USO performers were curious about the events on the islands and how the men were handling things. One performer, a \"wonderful comedian\" named Joe E. Brown, would commandeer a military vehicle and be driven around the island. The entertainer would stop military pedestrians, \"ream\" them for some inconsequential matter, start laughing, then invite them into the cab so they could be driven to their destinations. Joe E. Brown was greatly appreciated. (Memories of Capt. Donald Courtright, told to his daughter Mary in 2011){{citation needed|date=November 2014}}</blockquote> --> On his return to the U.S., Brown brought sacks of letters, making sure they were delivered by the Post Office. He gave shows in all weather conditions, many in hospitals, sometimes doing his entire show for a single dying soldier. He signed autographs for everyone. For his services to morale, Brown became one of only two civilians to be awarded the [[Bronze Star]] during World War II.

==Postwar work==
His concern for the troops continued into the Korean War, as evidenced by a newsreel featuring his appeal for blood donations to aid the U.S. and UN troops there that was featured in the season 4 episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' titled \"Deluge\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638293/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title = \"M*A*S*H\" Deluge (TV Episode 1976)}}</ref>

In 1948, he was awarded a Special [[Tony Award]] for his work in the touring company of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]''.<ref name=NYT1/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1948|title=1948 Tony Award Winners (BroadwayWorld.com)|work=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}</ref>

He had a cameo appearance in ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956), as the [[Fort Kearney]] stationmaster talking to Fogg ([[David Niven]]) and his entourage in a small town in Nebraska. In the similarly epic film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), he had a cameo as a union official giving a speech at a construction site in the climactic scene. On television, he was the mystery guest on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' during the episode on January 11, 1953.

His best known postwar role was that of aging millionaire Osgood Fielding III in [[Billy Wilder]]'s 1959 comedy ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Fielding falls for Daphne (Jerry), played by [[Jack Lemmon]] in drag; at the end of the film, Lemmon takes off his wig and reveals to Brown that he is a man, to which Brown responds \"Well, nobody's perfect\", one of the more celebrated punchlines in film.

Another of his notable postwar roles was that of Cap'n Andy Hawks in [[MGM]]'s 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]'', a role that he reprised onstage in the 1961 [[New York City Center]] revival of the musical and on tour. Brown performed several dance routines in the film, and famed choreographer [[Gower Champion]] appeared along with first wife [[Marge Champion|Marge]]. Brown's final film appearance was in ''[[The Comedy of Terrors]]'' (1964).

Brown was a sports enthusiast, both in film and personally. Some of his best films were the \"baseball trilogy\" which consisted of ''[[Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1932), ''[[Elmer, the Great]]'' (1933) and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935). He was a television and radio broadcaster for the New York Yankees in 1953. His son [[Joe L. Brown]] became the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the Pittsburgh Pirates for more than 20 years. Brown spent [[Ty Cobb]]'s last days with him, discussing his life.

Brown's sports enthusiasm also led to him becoming the first president of [[PONY Baseball and Softball]] (at the time named Pony League) when the organization was incorporated in 1953. He continued in the post until late 1964, when he retired. Later he traveled additional thousands of miles telling the story of PONY League, hoping to interest adults in organizing baseball programs for young people. He was a fan of Thoroughbred horse racing, a regular at the racetracks in Del Mar and Santa Anita.

==In popular culture==
He was caricatured in the [[Disney]] cartoons ''[[Mickey's Gala Premiere]]'' (1933), ''[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]'' (1938), and ''[[The Autograph Hound]]'' (1939); all contain a scene in which he is seen laughing so loud that his mouth opens extremely wide. According to the official biography ''Daws Butler: Characters Actor'', [[Daws Butler]] used Joe E. Brown as inspiration for the voices of two [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon characters: [[Lippy the Lion]] (1962) and [[Peter Potamus]] (1963{{ndash}}1966).<ref>{{Cite book|asin=1593930151|title=Daws Butler, Characters Actor: Ben Ohmart, Joe Bevilacqua: 9781593930158: Amazon.com: Books}}</ref>

==Later life and family==
Brown married Kathryn Francis McGraw in 1915. The marriage lasted until his death in 1973. The couple had four children: two sons, Don Evan Brown (December 25, 1916 {{ndash}} October 8, 1942; Captain in the United States Army Air Force, who was killed in the crash of an [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20B Havoc]] bomber while serving as a ferry pilot)<ref>Associated Press, \"Flying Son Of Film Star Crash Victim\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Friday 9 October 1942, Volume 49, page 1.</ref> and [[Joe L. Brown|Joe LeRoy \"Joe L.\" Brown]] (September 1, 1918 {{ndash}} August 15, 2010), and two daughters, Mary Katherine Ann (b. 1930) and Kathryn Francis (b. 1934). Both daughters were adopted as infants.

Joe L. Brown shared his father's love of baseball, serving as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1976, and briefly in 1985, also building the 1960 and 1971 [[World Series]] champions. Brown's '71 Pirates featured baseball's first all-black starting nine.

The '''Volkswagen Type 3''' is a [[compact car]] that was manufactured and marketed by [[Volkswagen]] from 1961 to 1973. Introduced at the 1961 [[Frankfurt Motor Show|Frankfurt Motor Show, ''Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung (IAA)'']], the Type 3 was marketed as the '''Volkswagen 1500''' and later as the '''Volkswagen 1600''', in three body styles: two-door [[Notchback]], [[Fastback]] and [[station wagon|Variant]], the latter marketed as the 'Squareback' in the United States.

The Type 3 diversified Volkswagen's product range beyond the existing models&nbsp;– the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Type 1]] Beetle, Type 14 [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]], [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2 (Bus)]]&nbsp;– while retaining several of the Beetle's key engineering principles, notably the [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooled]] [[rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout]] and all-round torsion bar suspension on the same {{convert|2400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The concept of the Type 3 was to be more of a [[family car]] than the Beetle, offering more passenger and luggage space and a larger engine.<ref>[https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/volkswagen-type-3-flat-four/ Volkswagen Type 3 Flat-Four | Hemmings Daily]</ref>

==History==
The Type 3 followed the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Type 1]] Beetle, utilizing a low-profile version of Volkswagen's rear-engined, 4-cylinder air-cooled engine, as well as body-on-chassis construction (the body bolts to a frame that includes the floor pan),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/this-1968-volkswagen-fastback-is-actually-a-miata-1825036646|title=This 1968 Volkswagen Fastback Is Actually A Miata|first=Stef|last=Schrader|website=Jalopnik}}</ref> retaining the same wheelbase – but featuring [[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]] (slab sided) styling, in contrast to the Type 1's articulated fenders and running boards. VW finalized the design by 1959 with prototypes ready for testing by 1960. Secrecy was such that even at the 1960 Geneva Auto Show, VW denied they were readying a new design. In 1961 VW announced the new line as the \"VW 1500\".

Production began in August 1961, a month before launch, of the Volkswagen 1500 Notchback, encompassing [[Three-box styling|three-box]] styling in a [[notchback]] [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] body.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 52\">[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 52</ref> Production of the '''Karmann Ghia 1500''' (also known as the '''[[Karmann Ghia|Type 34 Karmann Ghia]]''') with a [[coupé]] body commenced in November 1961 and deliveries started in January 1962.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 52\"/> The [[station wagon|station wagon/estate]]-bodied Variant (marketed as the '''Squareback''' in the USA) followed, with the first cars produced in February 1962.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 52\"/> Two convertibles based on the 1500 Notchback were also announced with the original models, but did not enter production.<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 54</ref>

The '''Fastback''', or '''TL''' version, a [[fastback]] [[coupé]], arrived in August 1965, at the same time the 1600 engine was introduced. Volkswagen's intention was that this model should replace the Notchback, which is what happened in the UK market. However, in other markets, including the German domestic market, the number of customers preferring the older Notchback shaped car was higher than foreseen, and in the end both Notchback and Fastback body shapes remained in production until July 1973.<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], pp 52, 53 & 61</ref> The Type 3 also featured wall-to-wall carpeting, and was available with [[air conditioning]] in the US.

[[Volkswagen of America]] began importing the Type 3 in 1966 in the \"Squareback\" ('Variant' badges were not used in the US market) and \"Fastback\" but not the Notchback configurations. The Type 3 was competing in the market with the [[Chevrolet Corvair]] that had been previously introduced in the United States in 1960, which incorporated a 6-cylinder rear-mounted air-cooled engine in notchback and station wagon body style, as well as [[Chevrolet Greenbrier|a compact van derived from the platform]].

In 1968, the Type 3 'E' (''Einspritzung'') became the first German automobile in series production with electronic fuel injection (Bosch [[Jetronic|D-Jetronic]]) as standard equipment. The larger [[Volkswagen Type 4]] was introduced in 1969 which had a similar mechanical layout with further engineering refinements.

For the 1968 model year, 1969 in the USA, a three-speed fully automatic transaxle became available, noted for extremely low internal friction. With the automatic came CV-jointed independent rear suspension (IRS), replacing the swing axle (also IRS) set-up. For 1969, the CV-jointed rear axle was standard with both automatic and manual transmissions.

The model received a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 1970, when a {{convert|115|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer front nose added {{convert|1.5|cuft|L|abbr=on}} to the luggage capacity.<ref name=DailyExpressMotorShowReviewOct1969re1970>{{cite journal|journal =Daily Express Motor Show Review 1969 on 1970 Cars |volume = | editor-first = Basil |editor-last = Cardew | publisher=Daily Express Newspaper |location= London |page = 53 | title = Volkswagen 1600 TL | date = October 1969}}</ref> At the same time it received revised square-section bumpers, as well as larger tail lamps and front indicators.

Volkswagen offered the Type 3 in a lower trim level in Europe, marketed as the '''1600A''' trim level. In the US, and for 1973 only, Volkswagen offered two trim levels of the Type 3 Fastback in the USA, marketed as the Type 3 Sedan and Type 3 Basic Compact. The Basic Compact featured reduced content, including limited color and upholstery availability and without belt line chrome, a clock, or electric-heated rear window defogger. it had painted frames around the vent windows, a black cardboard front trunk liner over the gas tank without a liner on the sides of the trunk or over the firewall, plain vinyl door panels without door pockets and rubber mats in lieu of interior carpet.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

While the Type 3 was a more modern design, it never reached the same level of popularity as the Beetle. As Volkswagen started to produce front-wheel-drive water-cooled designs, production ended in 1973 at the [[Wolfsburg]] plant. The Wolfsburg production facilities were then retooled to build the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], which eventually replaced the Type 1 as Volkswagen's best selling sedan. Production of the Type 3 moved to VW's new [[Emden]] plant, which was retooled later in 1973 to build the first generation [[Volkswagen Passat#Passat Mk1 (B1, 1973–1981)|Passat]] (marketed variously, also as the \"Dasher\").

==Engine and drivetrain==
{{main|Volkswagen air-cooled engine}}

The Type 3 was initially equipped with a 1.5&nbsp;L (1493&nbsp;cc) engine based on the air-cooled 1192&nbsp;cc [[flat-4]] found in the Type 1, but given a 69&nbsp;mm stroke it became the basis for the 1300&nbsp;cc and 1600&nbsp;cc engines that followed in the later Beetle (Type 1) and [[Volkswagen Type 2]] T1 and T2.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} While the [[long block]] remained the same as the Type 1, the engine cooling was redesigned by putting the fan on the end of the crankshaft instead of on the generator. This reduced the height of the engine profile, allowing greater cargo volume and earning its nicknames: the ''pancake'' or ''suitcase'' engine. The engine's displacement would eventually increase to 1.6&nbsp;L (1584&nbsp;cc).

It used a similar transmission to the Beetle but with higher ratios (4.125 R&P v 4.375 R&P) and longer axles. Unlike the Beetle (Type 1), the Type 3 engine and transmission unit was mounted into a subframe (which contained the complete rear suspension), in turn rubber-mounted to the floorpan and body, thereby isolating vibration and road noise from the passenger space.

The original Volkswagen 1500 used a single side-draught 32&nbsp;mm Solex PHN carburetor. In August 1963 VW introduced single- and twin-carburetor versions, respectively the Volkswagen 1500 'N' (Normal), rated at {{convert|45|PS|kW hp|lk=on|abbr=on}}, and the 1500 'S' (Super), {{convert|54|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} which had high-compression (8.5:1) domed 83&nbsp;mm pistons and twin downdraught 32&nbsp;mm Solex PDSIT carburetors for more power.

The Type 3 engine received a larger displacement (1.6&nbsp;L) for 1966 (August '65) and in 1968 became the world's first volume production car to feature [[electronic fuel injection]]&nbsp;&ndash; pioneered by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]. The Bosch [[Jetronic|D-Jetronic]] system was offered on the Volkswagen 1600 TE & LE version (E designating \"''Einspritzung''\" or \"injection\" in German). A similar Bosch injection system was used in the later [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4 VW 411]], some models of the Porsche 914, Opel Admiral, Diplomat and Commodore, and available for the Volvo 1800E/ES, 142E, and certain 1972-75 140 and 164 series cars (see [[Volvo P1800]])as well as certain Citroen DS21. Also introduced for 1968 was a fully [[automatic transmission]].

A notable advance from the Type 1 to the Type 3 was the front suspension&nbsp;— although similar to the Type 1, it was the first Volkswagen front suspension to incorporate transverse round torsion bars, as opposed to the Type 1's torsion leaves. The Type 3's torsion bars are cross-mounted in the lower tube, so that each individual torsion bar spans the full width of the car, the upper tube containing an anti-roll bar that connects the upper trailing links to each other. The complete front suspension unit is rubber-mounted to the car's floorpan. In 1968 the rear suspension was upgraded to double jointed [[CV joint]] semi trailing arm suspension (sometimes called IRS by VW enthusiasts to differentiate it from the previous ( IRS ) swing-axle type), a design feature that previously appeared on the VW Type 2 in 1967.

The Type 3 offered both front and rear enclosed luggage areas, with greater volume and cargo accessibility via both the boot (trunk) and the bonnet (hood). In each of the 3 variants (Notchback, Squareback, and Fastback) as well as the Type 2's from 1968 on, the engine was located under a panel in the rear trunk.

This unusual placement was highlighted in a period Volkswagen television [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3RD-hG4nbc commercial] for the American market. It featured actor [[Dustin Hoffman]] showing the interior of the Fastback model and explaining the car's technical features but unable to locate the engine. The ad closed with the copy, \"Your VW dealer will show you where the motor is.\"

The original Type 3 with 5-stud wheels (5 x 205&nbsp;mm PCD) used twin leading shoe drum brakes at the front. In August '65 (the '66 model year) these were replaced by disc brakes, coinciding with the introduction of the Fastback and 1600 engine (Australian built models retained drum front brakes until August 1967). These have 4-stud wheels (4 x 130&nbsp;mm PCD) with 8 cooling slots. Rear brakes were always leading / trailing shoe drums.

===Australian production===
The Type 3 was manufactured at [[Clayton, Victoria|Clayton]] in [[Victoria, Australia]], from 1963 in [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], [[station wagon]] and [[Panel van|sedan delivery]] body styles. In 1965, the [[fastback]] was introduced, fully imported from Germany.<ref name=\"VW Chassis Numbers\">[http://www.clubvw.org.au/vwchassis Volkswagen Cars in Australia] Retrieved on 17 October 2013</ref>

Panel van versions (based on the 1500 'N') feature a marine ply wood loading area with zinc plated steel protector strips, 1 x sun visor (for the driver), a clock delete panel and no side windows. All Australian assembled panel vans were fitted with a metal ID tag behind the spare wheel with a prefix of PV then the number hand stamped in. There are approximately 10 known surviving panel vans from the estimated original production run of 500 and a further 10 to 15 from German manufacture.

Following the cessation of all local manufacturing by Volkswagen Australasia in 1968, the Type 3 was assembled from [[Complete knock down|CKD]] kits by Motor Producers Limited at the same Clayton facility through to 1973.<ref name=Matthews004>[http://www.clubvw.org.au/history/reference/history004.html Phil Matthews, Australian Volkswagen History&nbsp;– 1971–1975] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007051926/http://www.clubvw.org.au/history/reference/history004.html |date=2011-10-07 }} Retrieved on 12 August 2011</ref>

In 1961, Volkswagen introduced the VW 1500 Karmann Ghia,<ref name=\"samba-342\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/historyt34.php|title=Type 3 Ghia (Type 34) History|last=Hedges|first=Lee Thomas|accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref> or Type 34, based on its new Type 3 platform, featuring Volkswagen's new flat 1500cc engine design, and styling by Italian engineer [[Sergio Sartorelli]] at [[Carrozzeria Ghia]].<ref name=\"karmannghia.it\">{{cite web|url=http://www.karmannghia.it/Sartorelli.htm|title=Karmann Ghia Italia&nbsp;– Karmann Ghia Italy|date=2008-10-18|publisher=Karmannghia.it|language=it|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref> 

Until it was replaced by the VW-[[Porsche 914]], it was the fastest, most expensive, and most luxurious passenger car VW manufactured in the 1960s &#x2014. 42,505 (plus 17 prototype convertibles) were manufactured from 1962-1969.

Although the Type 34 was available in most countries, it was not offered officially in the U.S., VW's largest and most important export market.

The [[Three-box styling|three-box]] Type 3 was launched in [[Brazil]] in 1968 with unique styling (similar to the [[Volkswagen Brasilia|Brasilia]]) penned by [[Marcio Piancastelli]], and four doors. It met with little success, nicknamed ''Zé do Caixão'' (meaning \"Coffin Joe\", after a popular Brazilian horror [[José Mojica Marins|movie maker]]) for its boxy shape.<ref name=VoNe>{{cite web | url = http://www.team.net/www/ktud/saspeci/dkwbr08.html | title = DKW-Vemag | last1 = Vogel | first1 = Jason | last2 = Negyesi | first2 = Pal | publisher = KTUD Online Automotive Archive | access-date = 2013-09-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061024214104/http://www.team.net/www/ktud/saspeci/dkwbr08.html | archive-date = 2006-10-24 | url-status = dead }}</ref> It was discontinued in 1970.

The fastback version, the Volkswagen TL, fared somewhat better, remaining in production from 1970 to 1976, originally as a two-door and later as a four-door version.

As in Germany, the original Karmann Ghia was replaced with the Type 3-based Karmann Ghia TC (Touring Coupé), but with a distinct look from the German Karmann Ghia Type 34.

Neither enjoyed as much success as its estate-bodied sibling, the Variant. The 3-door Variant was produced from 1969 to 1977, followed by an updated successor with squarer body, the Variant II, which was produced from 1977 to 1980.

Brazilian Type 3s used the front suspension from the Type 1 with its laminated half-width torsion bars in top and bottom tubes and solidly mounted to the floorpan, unlike the German Type 3's rubber mounted unit with full-width crossed round bars in the lower tube and anti-roll bar in the top one.

[[File:Volkswagen 1500 Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|Argentinian Volkswagen 1500]]

A \"Volkswagen 1500\" unrelated to the Type 3 model 1500 was sold during the 1980s in [[Argentina]] based upon the Dodge 1500 manufactured in that country.

In 1980, Volkswagen bought the Argentinian company ''Chrysler Fevre Argentina SAIC'', inheriting some [[Dodge]] / [[Chrysler]] models and renaming the company ''Volkswagen Argentina SA''. One of the models was the Dodge 1500 (also the Dodge 1800) which the newly taken-over company re-badged as Volkswagen 1500 for the Argentinian market. The estate was known as the Volkswagen 1500 Rural. Both variants continued to be sold until 1988.

The car, which was based on the [[Chrysler Avenger]], had also been sold in Brazil, where it was known as the [[Dodge Polara]] — this version ceased in 1981, shortly after Volkswagen's purchase of the tooling in Argentina. The same car was available earlier in the 1970s in North America as the [[Plymouth Cricket]].

No parts of the Dodge 1500/\"Volkswagen 1500\" overlap with the Volkswagen Type 3 model 1500, or any other Volkswagen product.

The '''Volkswagen Type 3''' is a [[compact car]] that was manufactured and marketed by [[Volkswagen]] from 1961 to 1973. Introduced at the 1961 [[Frankfurt Motor Show|Frankfurt Motor Show, ''Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung (IAA)'']], the Type 3 was marketed as the '''Volkswagen 1500''' and later as the '''Volkswagen 1600''', in three body styles: two-door [[Notchback]], [[Fastback]] and [[station wagon|Variant]], the latter marketed as the 'Squareback' in the United States.

The Type 3 diversified Volkswagen's product range beyond the existing models&nbsp;– the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Type 1]] Beetle, Type 14 [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]], [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2 (Bus)]]&nbsp;– while retaining several of the Beetle's key engineering principles, notably the [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooled]] [[rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout]] and all-round torsion bar suspension on the same {{convert|2400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The concept of the Type 3 was to be more of a [[family car]] than the Beetle, offering more passenger and luggage space and a larger engine.<ref>[https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/volkswagen-type-3-flat-four/ Volkswagen Type 3 Flat-Four | Hemmings Daily]</ref>

==History==
The Type 3 followed the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Type 1]] Beetle, utilizing a low-profile version of Volkswagen's rear-engined, 4-cylinder air-cooled engine, as well as body-on-chassis construction (the body bolts to a frame that includes the floor pan),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/this-1968-volkswagen-fastback-is-actually-a-miata-1825036646|title=This 1968 Volkswagen Fastback Is Actually A Miata|first=Stef|last=Schrader|website=Jalopnik}}</ref> retaining the same wheelbase – but featuring [[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]] (slab sided) styling, in contrast to the Type 1's articulated fenders and running boards. VW finalized the design by 1959 with prototypes ready for testing by 1960. Secrecy was such that even at the 1960 Geneva Auto Show, VW denied they were readying a new design. In 1961 VW announced the new line as the \"VW 1500\".

Production began in August 1961, a month before launch, of the Volkswagen 1500 Notchback, encompassing [[Three-box styling|three-box]] styling in a [[notchback]] [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] body.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 52\">[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 52</ref> Production of the '''Karmann Ghia 1500''' (also known as the '''[[Karmann Ghia|Type 34 Karmann Ghia]]''') with a [[coupé]] body commenced in November 1961 and deliveries started in January 1962.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 52\"/> The [[station wagon|station wagon/estate]]-bodied Variant (marketed as the '''Squareback''' in the USA) followed, with the first cars produced in February 1962.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 52\"/> Two convertibles based on the 1500 Notchback were also announced with the original models, but did not enter production.<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 54</ref>

The '''Fastback''', or '''TL''' version, a [[fastback]] [[coupé]], arrived in August 1965, at the same time the 1600 engine was introduced. Volkswagen's intention was that this model should replace the Notchback, which is what happened in the UK market. However, in other markets, including the German domestic market, the number of customers preferring the older Notchback shaped car was higher than foreseen, and in the end both Notchback and Fastback body shapes remained in production until July 1973.<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], pp 52, 53 & 61</ref> The Type 3 also featured wall-to-wall carpeting, and was available with [[air conditioning]] in the US.

[[Volkswagen of America]] began importing the Type 3 in 1966 in the \"Squareback\" ('Variant' badges were not used in the US market) and \"Fastback\" but not the Notchback configurations. The Type 3 was competing in the market with the [[Chevrolet Corvair]] that had been previously introduced in the United States in 1960, which incorporated a 6-cylinder rear-mounted air-cooled engine in notchback and station wagon body style, as well as [[Chevrolet Greenbrier|a compact van derived from the platform]].

In 1968, the Type 3 'E' (''Einspritzung'') became the first German automobile in series production with electronic fuel injection (Bosch [[Jetronic|D-Jetronic]]) as standard equipment. The larger [[Volkswagen Type 4]] was introduced in 1969 which had a similar mechanical layout with further engineering refinements.

For the 1968 model year, 1969 in the USA, a three-speed fully automatic transaxle became available, noted for extremely low internal friction. With the automatic came CV-jointed independent rear suspension (IRS), replacing the swing axle (also IRS) set-up. For 1969, the CV-jointed rear axle was standard with both automatic and manual transmissions.

The model received a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 1970, when a {{convert|115|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer front nose added {{convert|1.5|cuft|L|abbr=on}} to the luggage capacity.<ref name=DailyExpressMotorShowReviewOct1969re1970>{{cite journal|journal =Daily Express Motor Show Review 1969 on 1970 Cars |volume = | editor-first = Basil |editor-last = Cardew | publisher=Daily Express Newspaper |location= London |page = 53 | title = Volkswagen 1600 TL | date = October 1969}}</ref> At the same time it received revised square-section bumpers, as well as larger tail lamps and front indicators.

Volkswagen offered the Type 3 in a lower trim level in Europe, marketed as the '''1600A''' trim level. In the US, and for 1973 only, Volkswagen offered two trim levels of the Type 3 Fastback in the USA, marketed as the Type 3 Sedan and Type 3 Basic Compact. The Basic Compact featured reduced content, including limited color and upholstery availability and without belt line chrome, clock, electric-heated rear window defogger&nbsp;&ndash; and with painted frames around the vent windows, a black cardboard front trunk liner over the gas tank without a liner on the sides of the trunk or over the firewall, plain vinyl door panels without door pockets and rubber mats in lieu of interior carpet.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

While the Type 3 was a more modern design, it never reached the same level of popularity as the Beetle. As Volkswagen started to produce front-wheel-drive water-cooled designs, production ended in 1973 at the [[Wolfsburg]] plant, with production moving to VW's new [[Emden]] plant, which was later retooled in 1973 to build the first generation [[Volkswagen Passat#Passat Mk1 (B1, 1973–1981)|Passat]] (marketed variously, also as the \"Dasher\"). The Wolfsburg plant was retooled to build the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], which eventually replaced the Type 1 as Volkswagen's best selling sedan.

==Engine and drivetrain==
{{main|Volkswagen air-cooled engine}}

The Type 3 was initially equipped with a 1.5&nbsp;L (1493&nbsp;cc) engine based on the air-cooled 1192&nbsp;cc [[flat-4]] found in the Type 1, but given a 69&nbsp;mm stroke it became the basis for the 1300&nbsp;cc and 1600&nbsp;cc engines that followed in the later Beetle (Type 1) and [[Volkswagen Type 2]] T1 and T2.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} While the [[long block]] remained the same as the Type 1, the engine cooling was redesigned by putting the fan on the end of the crankshaft instead of on the generator. This reduced the height of the engine profile, allowing greater cargo volume and earning its nicknames: the ''pancake'' or ''suitcase'' engine. The engine's displacement would eventually increase to 1.6&nbsp;L (1584&nbsp;cc).

It used a similar transmission to the Beetle but with higher ratios (4.125 R&P v 4.375 R&P) and longer axles. Unlike the Beetle (Type 1), the Type 3 engine and transmission unit was mounted into a subframe (which contained the complete rear suspension), in turn rubber-mounted to the floorpan and body, thereby isolating vibration and road noise from the passenger space.

The original Volkswagen 1500 used a single side-draught 32&nbsp;mm Solex PHN carburetor. In August 1963 VW introduced single- and twin-carburetor versions, respectively the Volkswagen 1500 'N' (Normal), rated at {{convert|45|PS|kW hp|lk=on|abbr=on}}, and the 1500 'S' (Super), {{convert|54|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} which had high-compression (8.5:1) domed 83&nbsp;mm pistons and twin downdraught 32&nbsp;mm Solex PDSIT carburetors for more power.

The Type 3 engine received a larger displacement (1.6&nbsp;L) for 1966 (August '65) and in 1968 became the world's first volume production car to feature [[electronic fuel injection]]&nbsp;&ndash; pioneered by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]. The Bosch [[Jetronic|D-Jetronic]] system was offered on the Volkswagen 1600 TE & LE version (E designating \"''Einspritzung''\" or \"injection\" in German). A similar Bosch injection system was used in the later [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4 VW 411]], some models of the Porsche 914, Opel Admiral, Diplomat and Commodore, and available for the Volvo 1800E/ES, 142E, and certain 1972-75 140 and 164 series cars (see [[Volvo P1800]])as well as certain Citroen DS21. Also introduced for 1968 was a fully [[automatic transmission]].

A notable advance from the Type 1 to the Type 3 was the front suspension&nbsp;— although similar to the Type 1, it was the first Volkswagen front suspension to incorporate transverse round torsion bars, as opposed to the Type 1's torsion leaves. The Type 3's torsion bars are cross-mounted in the lower tube, so that each individual torsion bar spans the full width of the car, the upper tube containing an anti-roll bar that connects the upper trailing links to each other. The complete front suspension unit is rubber-mounted to the car's floorpan. In 1968 the rear suspension was upgraded to double jointed [[CV joint]] semi trailing arm suspension (sometimes called IRS by VW enthusiasts to differentiate it from the previous ( IRS ) swing-axle type), a design feature that previously appeared on the VW Type 2 in 1967.

The Type 3 offered both front and rear enclosed luggage areas, with greater volume and cargo accessibility via both the boot (trunk) and the bonnet (hood). In each of the 3 variants (Notchback, Squareback, and Fastback) as well as the Type 2's from 1968 on, the engine was located under a panel in the rear trunk.

This unusual placement was highlighted in a period Volkswagen television [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3RD-hG4nbc commercial] for the American market. It featured actor [[Dustin Hoffman]] showing the interior of the Fastback model and explaining the car's technical features but unable to locate the engine. The ad closed with the copy, \"Your VW dealer will show you where the motor is.\"

The original Type 3 with 5-stud wheels (5 x 205&nbsp;mm PCD) used twin leading shoe drum brakes at the front. In August '65 (the '66 model year) these were replaced by disc brakes, coinciding with the introduction of the Fastback and 1600 engine (Australian built models retained drum front brakes until August 1967). These have 4-stud wheels (4 x 130&nbsp;mm PCD) with 8 cooling slots. Rear brakes were always leading / trailing shoe drums.

===Australian production===
The Type 3 was manufactured at [[Clayton, Victoria|Clayton]] in [[Victoria, Australia]], from 1963 in [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], [[station wagon]] and [[Panel van|sedan delivery]] body styles. In 1965, the [[fastback]] was introduced, fully imported from Germany.<ref name=\"VW Chassis Numbers\">[http://www.clubvw.org.au/vwchassis Volkswagen Cars in Australia] Retrieved on 17 October 2013</ref>

Panel van versions (based on the 1500 'N') feature a marine ply wood loading area with zinc plated steel protector strips, 1 x sun visor (for the driver), a clock delete panel and no side windows. All Australian assembled panel vans were fitted with a metal ID tag behind the spare wheel with a prefix of PV then the number hand stamped in. There are approximately 10 known surviving panel vans from the estimated original production run of 500 and a further 10 to 15 from German manufacture.

Following the cessation of all local manufacturing by Volkswagen Australasia in 1968, the Type 3 was assembled from [[Complete knock down|CKD]] kits by Motor Producers Limited at the same Clayton facility through to 1973.<ref name=Matthews004>[http://www.clubvw.org.au/history/reference/history004.html Phil Matthews, Australian Volkswagen History&nbsp;– 1971–1975] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007051926/http://www.clubvw.org.au/history/reference/history004.html |date=2011-10-07 }} Retrieved on 12 August 2011</ref>

===Type 34 Karmann Ghia===
{{main|Volkswagen Karmann Ghia#34}}

In 1961, Volkswagen introduced the VW 1500 Karmann Ghia,<ref name=\"samba-342\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/historyt34.php|title=Type 3 Ghia (Type 34) History|last=Hedges|first=Lee Thomas|accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref> or Type 34, based on its new Type 3 platform, featuring Volkswagen's new flat 1500cc engine design, and styling by Italian engineer [[Sergio Sartorelli]] at [[Carrozzeria Ghia]].<ref name=\"karmannghia.it\">{{cite web|url=http://www.karmannghia.it/Sartorelli.htm|title=Karmann Ghia Italia&nbsp;– Karmann Ghia Italy|date=2008-10-18|publisher=Karmannghia.it|language=it|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref> 

Until it was replaced by the VW-[[Porsche 914]], it was the fastest, most expensive, and most luxurious passenger car VW manufactured in the 1960s &#x2014. 42,505 (plus 17 prototype convertibles) were manufactured from 1962-1969.

Although the Type 34 was available in most countries, it was not offered officially in the U.S., VW's largest and most important export market.

==={{anchor|Coffin|Brazil}} Brazilian Type 3===
The [[Three-box styling|three-box]] Type 3 was launched in [[Brazil]] in 1968 with unique styling (similar to the [[Volkswagen Brasilia|Brasilia]]) penned by [[Marcio Piancastelli]], and four doors. It met with little success, nicknamed ''Zé do Caixão'' (meaning \"Coffin Joe\", after a popular Brazilian horror [[José Mojica Marins|movie maker]]) for its boxy shape.<ref name=VoNe>{{cite web | url = http://www.team.net/www/ktud/saspeci/dkwbr08.html | title = DKW-Vemag | last1 = Vogel | first1 = Jason | last2 = Negyesi | first2 = Pal | publisher = KTUD Online Automotive Archive | access-date = 2013-09-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061024214104/http://www.team.net/www/ktud/saspeci/dkwbr08.html | archive-date = 2006-10-24 | url-status = dead }}</ref> It was discontinued in 1970.

The fastback version, the Volkswagen TL, fared somewhat better, remaining in production from 1970 to 1976, originally as a two-door and later as a four-door version.

As in Germany, the original Karmann Ghia was replaced with the Type 3-based Karmann Ghia TC (Touring Coupé), but with a distinct look from the German Karmann Ghia Type 34.

Neither enjoyed as much success as its estate-bodied sibling, the Variant. The 3-door Variant was produced from 1969 to 1977, followed by an updated successor with squarer body, the Variant II, which was produced from 1977 to 1980.

Brazilian Type 3s used the front suspension from the Type 1 with its laminated half-width torsion bars in top and bottom tubes and solidly mounted to the floorpan, unlike the German Type 3's rubber mounted unit with full-width crossed round bars in the lower tube and anti-roll bar in the top one.

==Argentinian Dodge 1500-based Volkswagen 1500==
{{main|Hillman Avenger#Argentina}}
[[File:Volkswagen 1500 Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|Argentinian Volkswagen 1500]]

A \"Volkswagen 1500\" unrelated to the Type 3 model 1500 was sold during the 1980s in [[Argentina]] based upon the Dodge 1500 manufactured in that country.

In 1980, Volkswagen bought the Argentinian company ''Chrysler Fevre Argentina SAIC'', inheriting some [[Dodge]] / [[Chrysler]] models and renaming the company ''Volkswagen Argentina SA''. One of the models was the Dodge 1500 (also the Dodge 1800) which the newly taken-over company re-badged as Volkswagen 1500 for the Argentinian market. The estate was known as the Volkswagen 1500 Rural. Both variants continued to be sold until 1988.

The car, which was based on the [[Chrysler Avenger]], had also been sold in Brazil, where it was known as the [[Dodge Polara]] — this version ceased in 1981, shortly after Volkswagen's purchase of the tooling in Argentina. The same car was available earlier in the 1970s in North America as the [[Plymouth Cricket]].

No parts of the Dodge 1500/\"Volkswagen 1500\" overlap with the Volkswagen Type 3 model 1500, or any other Volkswagen product.

{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}
'''Josiah Edward Spurr''' (1870–1950) was an American geologist, explorer, and author.
Born in Gloucester, Massachusetts, he was considered something of a failure as a youth, unsuited for the family fishing business, since on a voyage he invariably became seasick. Since he could not be a productive fisherman like his brothers, his parents decided he might as well go to college. After working his way through Harvard, he began his career with the Minnesota Geological Survey, making the first-ever geological map of the great Mesabi iron range in Minnesota.

J. E. Spurr led two expeditions of historic importance in [[Alaska]] for the [[United States Geological Survey]] in 1896 and 1898, made without the benefit of telephones, airplanes, the internal combustion engine, or electrical appliances. In 1896 he led the first expedition to map and chart the interior of [[Alaska]], exploring the Yukon Territory, where gold had been discovered. In 1898 Spurr went down the length of the Kuskokwim River, naming as he traveled previously undiscovered mountains, mountain ranges, creeks, rivers, lakes and glaciers.  At the end of the Kuskokwim expedition he made the first scientific observations of the Mount Katmai volcano, and the valley that later became known as the \"Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.\"  During these expeditions he encountered Native Americans, Aleuts, traders, missionaries, prospectors, whiskey smugglers and various con artists. His books were seen as the definitive work on Alaskan minerals during the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Alaska Gold Rush]]. They read like an adventure including the expedition's experiences with ice dams bearing down on them and lost provisions, as well as interactions with native Indians and missionaries.

After charting these regions, Spurr became the world's leading geological consultant, working for clients including the Sultan of Turkey, Bernard Baruch, and the Guggenheims. He was generally regarded as one of the world's foremost geologists, and probably the leader in the field of economic geology (the application of geology to mining). At the age of 68 he became interested in the origin of craters of the moon, and published four books that made a major contribution to the field.  His last book, \"Geology as applied to Selenology\", published just a year before his death, has been criticised, but was influential in the new field. He was considered a superb and pithy writer.

He published well over a hundred articles in scientific journals, books and monographs, as well as poetry and books for a general audience. He has named after him, [[Mount Spurr]], a very active volcano near Anchorage; [[Spurr (crater)|Spurr crater]] on the moon; and a mineral, [[spurrite]]. Many of his papers, correspondence and photographs are in the American Heritage Center of the University of Wyoming; others are preserved in the Anchorage office of the United States Geological Survey.

His children were Edward \"Ted\" Spurr, an entrepreneur; John Spurr, a publishing executive; William Alfred Spurr, Professor of Statistics at [[Stanford]]; Robert A. Spurr, professor of chemistry at the University of Maryland; and Stephen H. Spurr, an authority on forestry and [[forest ecology]] and former president of the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

There is a recent biography of him by Stephen J. Spurr, an economist who is his grandson.<ref>Stephen J. Spurr, In Search of the Kuskokwim and Other Great Endeavors: The Life and Times of J. Edward Spurr (Kenmore, WA: Epicenter Press, 2011).</ref>

'''Josiah Edward Spurr''' (1870–1950) was an American geologist, explorer, and author.
Born in Gloucester, Massachusetts, he was considered something of a failure as a youth, unsuited for the family fishing business, since on a voyage he invariably became seasick. Since he could not be a productive fisherman like his brothers, his parents decided he might as well go to college. After working his way through Harvard, he began his career with the Minnesota Geological Survey, making the first-ever geological map of the great Mesabi iron range in Minnesota.

J. E. Spurr led two expeditions of historic importance in [[Alaska]] for the [[United States Geological Survey]] in 1896 and 1898, made without the benefit of telephones, airplanes, the internal combustion engine, or electrical appliances. In 1896 he led the first expedition to map and chart the interior of [[Alaska]], exploring the Yukon Territory, where gold had been discovered. In 1898 Spurr went down the length of the Kuskokwim River, naming as he traveled previously undiscovered mountains, mountain ranges, creeks, rivers, lakes and glaciers.  At the end of the Kuskokwim expedition he made the first scientific observations of the Mount Katmai volcano, and the valley that later became known as the \"Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.\"  During these expeditions he encountered Native Americans, Aleuts, traders, missionaries, prospectors, whiskey smugglers and various con artists. His books were seen as the definitive work on Alaskan minerals during the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Alaska Gold Rush]]. They read like an adventure including the expedition's experiences with ice dams bearing down on them and lost provisions, as well as interactions with native Indians and missionaries.

After charting these regions, Spurr became the world's leading geological consultant, working for clients including the Sultan of Turkey, Bernard Baruch, and the Guggenheims. He was generally regarded as one of the world's foremost geologists, and probably the leader in the field of economic geology (the application of geology to mining). At the age of 68 he became interested in the origin of craters of the moon, and published four books that made a major contribution to the field.  His last book, \"Geology as applied to Selenology\", published just a year before his death, has been criticised, but was influential in the new field. He was considered a superb and pithy writer.

He published well over a hundred articles in scientific journals, books and monographs, as well as poetry and books for a general audience. He has named after him, [[Mount Spurr]], a very active volcano near Anchorage; [[Spurr (crater)|Spurr crater]] on the moon; and a mineral, [[spurrite]]. Many of his papers, correspondence and photographs are in the American Heritage Center of the University of Wyoming; others are preserved in the Anchorage office of the United States Geological Survey.

His children were Edward \"Ted\" Spurr, an entrepreneur; John Spurr, a publishing executive; William Alfred Spurr, Professor of Statistics at [[Stanford]]; Robert A. Spurr, professor of chemistry at the University of Maryland; and Stephen H. Spurr, an authority on forestry and [[forest ecology]] and former president of the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

There is a recent biography of him by Stephen J. Spurr, an economist who is his grandson.<ref>Stephen J. Spurr, In Search of the Kuskokwim and Other Great Endeavors: The Life and Times of J. Edward Spurr (Kenmore, WA: Epicenter Press, 2011).</ref>

The '''Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package''' ('''HP<sup>3</sup>''') is a science payload onboard the ''[[InSight]]'' lander that features instruments to study the heat flow and other thermal properties of [[Mars]]. One of the instruments, a burrowing probe nicknamed \"the mole\", is designed to penetrate {{Cvt|5|m}} below Mars' surface. In March 2019, the mole successfully burrowed a few centimeters, but then became unable to continue. In the following year further efforts were made to resolve the issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/307933-nasa-uses-insights-robotic-arm-to-push-heat-probe-into-mars|title=NASA Uses InSight's Robotic Arm to Push Heat Probe Into Mars - ExtremeTech|website=www.extremetech.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>

HP<sup>3</sup> was provided by the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR). The hammering mechanism inside the mole was designed by the Polish company [[Astronika]] and the Space Research Centre of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] under contract and in cooperation with DLR.<ref name='Hammering mechanism'/><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://scienceinpoland.pap.pl/en/news/news,414002,polish-kret-will-fly-to-mars.html |title=Polish Kret will fly to Mars |work=Science in Poland |access-date=2018-05-05 |language=en}}</ref>

==Mole penetrometer==
The mole is described as a \"self-hammering nail\" and was designed to burrow below the Martian surface while trailing a tether with embedded heaters and temperature sensors. The goal is to measure the thermal properties of Mars' interior, and thus reveal unique information about the planet's geologic history.<ref name='Hammering mechanism'>[http://esmats.eu/amspapers/pastpapers/pdfs/2016/grygorczuk2.pdf Hammering Mechanism for HP3 Experiment (InSight)].

''European Space Mechanisms and Tribology Symposium''; 2016.</ref>

The burrowing mole is a pointed cylinder with a smooth outer surface approximately {{cvt|35|cm}} in length and {{cvt|3.5|cm}} in diameter. It contains a heater to determine thermal conductivity during descent, and it trails a tether equipped with precise heat sensors placed at {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on}} intervals to measure the temperature profile of the subsurface.{{r|octoberpres|Home HP3}}

The mole penetrator unit is designed to be placed near the lander in an area about 3-m long and 2-m wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seis-insight.eu/en/public-2/the-insight-mission/instruments-deployment|title=Instruments Deployment - SEIS / Mars InSight|website=www.seis-insight.eu|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> The total mass of the system is approximately {{cvt|3|kg|abbr=on}} and it consumes a maximum of {{Val|2|u=[[watt]]s}} while the mole is active.<ref name=\"Home HP3\">{{cite web |title=Heat Probe {{!}} Instruments |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/hp3 |website=NASA's InSight Mars Lander |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

For displacement, the mole uses a motor and a gearbox (provided by [[Maxon Motor AG|Maxon]]) and a cammed roller that periodically loads a spring connected to a rod that functions as a hammer. After release from the cam, the hammer accelerates downwards to hit the outer casing and cause its penetration through the [[regolith]]. Meanwhile a suppressor mass travels upwards and its kinetic energy is compensated by gravitational potential and compression of a brake spring and wire helix on the opposite side of the mole.<ref name='Hammering mechanism'/> 

In principle, every {{cvt|50|cm}} the probe puts out a pulse of heat and its sensors measure how the heat pulse changes with time. If the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] material is a thermal conductor, like metal, the pulse will decay quickly.<ref name=\"Home HP3\" />  The mole is first allowed to cool down for two days, then it is heated to about {{cvt|10|C|F|abbr=on}} over 24 hours. Temperature sensors within the tether measure how rapidly this happens, which tells scientists the thermal conductivity of the soil.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA's InSight Prepares to Take Mars' Temperature |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7335 |website=NASA/JPL |accessdate=13 April 2020 |date=February 13, 2019}}</ref> Together, these measurements yield the rate of heat flowing from the interior. 

The HP<sup>3</sup> mole was originally expected to take about 40 days to reach {{cvt|5|m|abbr=on}} deep.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surface Operations |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/timeline/surface-operations/ |website=NASA's InSight Mars Lander |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> As the mole burrows, it also generates vibrations that SEIS can detect, which may yield information about the Martian subsurface.<ref name=\"mars.nasa.gov\" />

===Penetration efforts===
In March 2019, the HP<sup>3</sup> began burrowing into the surface sand, but became stalled after several centimeters by what was initially suspected to be a large rock.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dickinson |first1=David |title=Mars Insight's \"Mole\" Hits a Snag |url=https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/mars-insight-drill-hits-snag/ |website=Sky & Telescope |publisher=AAS Sky Publishing, LLC. |accessdate=1 September 2019 |date=11 March 2019}}</ref> Further analysis and testing with a replica model on Earth suggested the problem may be due to insufficient friction. In June 2019, more evidence for this was revealed when the support structure was lifted off of the HP<sup>3</sup> mole. The Martian regolith appeared to be compressed, leaving a gap around the probe. 

A technique was implemented then, using the lander's robotic arm to press on the soil near the probe to increase soil friction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/nasas-strategy-mars-insight-back-drilling/|title=A Strategy to Get the Mars Insight Lander Back in the Drilling Business|last=Dickinson|first=David|date=2019-07-03|website=Sky & Telescope |publisher=AAS Sky Publishing, LLC. |language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7441|title=NASA's InSight Uncovers the 'Mole'|website=NASA/JPL|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-nasa-might-rescue-insight-s-extremely-stuck-1838750453|title=Here's How NASA Might Rescue InSight's Extremely Stuck Heat Probe|last=Dvorsky|first=George|website=Gizmodo|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Utimately, this method was not able to generate enough downward force, since the HP<sup>3</sup> probe was at the limit of the arm's range.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.universetoday.com/143782/success-nasa-confirms-the-mole-is-working-again/|title=Success!

Instead, the team used the robotic scoop to pin the probe against the edge of its hole. This method appeared successful initially, as the probe continued to dig for two weeks, until it was flush with the surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-mars-lander-may-be-able-to-save-its-stuck-mole/|title=NASA Mars lander may be able to save its stuck 'mole'|last=Kooser|first=Amanda|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/mars-insights-mole-is-moving-again|title=Mars InSight's 'Mole' Is Moving Again|last=Greicius|first=Tony|date=2019-10-17|website=NASA|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> At this time, the exposed top of the probe was too small for the scoop to press against, so the scoop was re-positioned to press down on the soil near the probe.

In February 2020, the team reevaluated the risks of pushing the scoop directly against the back cap of the mole, and determined the procedure to be acceptable.

The '''Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package''' ('''HP<sup>3</sup>''') is a science payload onboard the ''[[InSight]]'' lander that features instruments to study the heat flow and other thermal properties of [[Mars]]. One of the instruments, a burrowing probe nicknamed \"the mole\", is designed to penetrate {{Cvt|5|m}} below Mars' surface. In March 2019, the mole successfully burrowed a few centimeters, but then became unable to continue.

==Mole penetrometer==
The mole is described as a \"self-hammering nail\" and was designed to burrow below the Martian surface while trailing a tether with embedded heaters and temperature sensors. The goal is to measure the thermal properties of Mars' interior, and thus reveal unique information about the planet's geologic history.<ref name='Hammering mechanism'>[http://esmats.eu/amspapers/pastpapers/pdfs/2016/grygorczuk2.pdf Hammering Mechanism for HP3 Experiment (InSight)]. (PDF) Jerzy Grygorczuk1, Łukasz Wiśniewski1, Bartosz Kędziora1, Maciej Borys, Rafał Przybyła1, Tomasz Kuciński1, Maciej Ossowski, Wojciech Konior,Olaf Krömer, Tilman Spohn, Marta Tokarz and Mateusz Białek. ''European Space Mechanisms and Tribology Symposium''; 2016.</ref>

The burrowing mole is a pointed cylinder with a smooth outer surface approximately {{cvt|35|cm}} in length and {{cvt|3.5|cm}} in diameter. It contains a heater to determine thermal conductivity during descent, and it trails a tether equipped with precise heat sensors placed at {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on}} intervals to measure the temperature profile of the subsurface.{{r|octoberpres|Home HP3}}

The mole penetrator unit is designed to be placed near the lander in an area about 3-m long and 2-m wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seis-insight.eu/en/public-2/the-insight-mission/instruments-deployment|title=Instruments Deployment - SEIS / Mars InSight|website=www.seis-insight.eu|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> The total mass of the system is approximately {{cvt|3|kg|abbr=on}} and it consumes a maximum of {{Val|2|u=[[watt]]s}} while the mole is active.<ref name=\"Home HP3\">{{cite web |title=Heat Probe {{!}} Instruments |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/hp3 |website=NASA's InSight Mars Lander |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

For displacement, the mole uses a motor and a gearbox (provided by [[Maxon Motor AG|Maxon]]) and a cammed roller that periodically loads a spring connected to a rod that functions as a hammer. After release from the cam, the hammer accelerates downwards to hit the outer casing and cause its penetration through the [[regolith]]. Meanwhile a suppressor mass travels upwards and its kinetic energy is compensated by gravitational potential and compression of a brake spring and wire helix on the opposite side of the mole.<ref name='Hammering mechanism'/> 

In principle, every {{cvt|50|cm}} the probe puts out a pulse of heat and its sensors measure how the heat pulse changes with time. If the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] material is a thermal conductor, like metal, the pulse will decay quickly.<ref name=\"Home HP3\" />  The mole is first allowed to cool down for two days, then it is heated to about {{cvt|10|C|F|abbr=on}} over 24 hours. Temperature sensors within the tether measure how rapidly this happens, which tells scientists the thermal conductivity of the soil.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA's InSight Prepares to Take Mars' Temperature |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7335 |website=NASA/JPL |accessdate=13 April 2020 |date=February 13, 2019}}</ref> Together, these measurements yield the rate of heat flowing from the interior. 

The HP<sup>3</sup> mole was originally expected to take about 40 days to reach {{cvt|5|m|abbr=on}} deep.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surface Operations |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/timeline/surface-operations/ |website=NASA's InSight Mars Lander |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> As the mole burrows, it also generates vibrations that SEIS can detect, which may yield information about the Martian subsurface.<ref name=\"mars.nasa.gov\" />

===Penetration efforts===
In March 2019, the HP<sup>3</sup> began burrowing into the surface sand, but became stalled after several centimeters by what was initially suspected to be a large rock.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dickinson |first1=David |title=Mars Insight's \"Mole\" Hits a Snag |url=https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/mars-insight-drill-hits-snag/ |website=Sky & Telescope |publisher=AAS Sky Publishing, LLC. |accessdate=1 September 2019 |date=11 March 2019}}</ref> Further analysis and testing with a replica model on Earth suggested the problem may be due to insufficient friction. In June 2019, more evidence for this was revealed when the support structure was lifted off of the HP<sup>3</sup> mole. The Martian regolith appeared to be compressed, leaving a gap around the probe. 

A technique was implemented then, using the lander's robotic arm to press on the soil near the probe to increase soil friction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/nasas-strategy-mars-insight-back-drilling/|title=A Strategy to Get the Mars Insight Lander Back in the Drilling Business|last=Dickinson|first=David|date=2019-07-03|website=Sky & Telescope |publisher=AAS Sky Publishing, LLC. |language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7441|title=NASA's InSight Uncovers the 'Mole'|website=NASA/JPL|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-nasa-might-rescue-insight-s-extremely-stuck-1838750453|title=Here's How NASA Might Rescue InSight's Extremely Stuck Heat Probe|last=Dvorsky|first=George|website=Gizmodo|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Utimately, this method was not able to generate enough downward force, since the HP<sup>3</sup> probe was at the limit of the arm's range.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.universetoday.com/143782/success-nasa-confirms-the-mole-is-working-again/|title=Success!

Instead, the team used the robotic scoop to pin the probe against the edge of its hole. This method appeared successful initially, as the probe continued to dig for two weeks, until it was flush with the surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-mars-lander-may-be-able-to-save-its-stuck-mole/|title=NASA Mars lander may be able to save its stuck 'mole'|last=Kooser|first=Amanda|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/mars-insights-mole-is-moving-again|title=Mars InSight's 'Mole' Is Moving Again|last=Greicius|first=Tony|date=2019-10-17|website=NASA|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> At this time, the exposed top of the probe was too small for the scoop to press against, so the scoop was re-positioned to press down on the soil near the probe. Unfortunately, this caused the probe to back out again due to unusual soil properties and low atmospheric pressure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8529/mars-insights-mole-has-partially-backed-out-of-its-hole?site=insight|title=Mars InSight's Mole Has Partially Backed Out of Its Hole|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=NASA's InSight Mars Lander|language=en|access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref> As the probe bounced, loose soil filled the area beneath it and lifted the probe halfway out again.<ref name=\"NPR Nov29\">{{cite web |last1=Palca |first1=Joe |title=A 'Mole' Isn't Digging Mars: NASA Engineers Are Trying To Find Out Why |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/11/29/783278261/a-mole-isn-t-digging-mars-nasa-engineers-are-trying-to-find-out-why |website=NPR.org |accessdate=29 November 2019 |language=en |date=Nov 29, 2019}}</ref> In January 2020, the team used the pinning method again, but once again the probe ejected after the scoop was repositioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/insight-to-try-to-push-mole-into-martian-surface/|title=InSight to try to push mole into Martian surface|date=2020-02-21|website=SpaceNews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>

In February 2020, the team reevaluated the risks of pushing the scoop directly against the back cap of the mole, and determined the procedure to be acceptable.

* Persons are confined to their places of residence during curfew hours
* Limited movement during the day
* Continue to practise physical distancing of six feet between persons
* The plan is being implemented in a phased manner based on the intensity of spread

Businesses in the private sector will be closed from 28 March 2020 by 8:00 pm until 15 April 2020, except for those excluded by the government such as groceries, pharmacies, gas stations and farms, with specific allowed operating hours for each type of business. Restaurants can open but only for drive-through and take away services.

People contravening the order without a reasonable explanation will be liable to a fine of BBD $50,000, one year in prison, or both.

===24-hour curfew===

On 2 April 2020, acting Prime Minister Santia Bradshaw announced that because people were still congregating in large groups despite previous measures, Barbados would be placed under a 24-hour curfew from 3 April 2020 at 6:00 pm. From that date, all supermarkets, mini marts, restaurants, government offices, departments and statutory corporations would be closed, the sale of alcohol would be prohibited, and people would only be allowed to leave their homes to \"go to the pharmacy, to seek medical assistance, or if you are part of the essential services, or if you are doing business with any of the businesses, which are exempted under this Order\". Some food sellers, such as bakeries, bread depots and \"village shops\" would be allowed to operate during designated hours, but could have no more than three people congregating at a time.<ref name=\"gis-2april\">{{Cite web|url=https://gisbarbados.gov.bb/blog/24-hour-curfew-for-barbados-from-friday/ |title=24-Hour Curfew For Barbados From 6:00 p.m. Friday |date=2 April 2020 |accessdate=3 April 2020 | work=GIS Barbados}}</ref> The following day the start of the curfew was delayed till 8:00 pm. to allow workers time to go home after shutting up.<ref>{{cite news |title=51 cases of COVID-19, curfew start extended |url=https://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/barbados-now-has-51-confirmed-cases-covid-19 |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=www.loopnewsbarbados.com |language=en}}</ref>

On 7 April 2020, it was announced that on 8, 9 and 11 April, supermarkets would reopen from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm to take orders online or over the phone for curbside pickup or delivery, though customers would not be allowed to enter the supermarket. Some supermarkets would offer pre-packaged bundles with items of their choosing at [[Barbadian_dollar|BBD]] $25, $50, $100 or $150. Village shops and mini-marts would also be able to take orders and offer pre-packaged bundles.<ref name=\"nation-7april\">{{cite news |title=Guidelines for collecting groceries |url=https://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/244872/guidelines-collecting-groceries |date=7 April 2020 |work=Nation News}}</ref>

===Extension to curfew===

On 11 April 2020, Prime Minister Mia Mottley announced that the 24-hour curfew would be extended to end at midnight on the night of 3 May, instead of 14 April.<ref name=\"nation-11april\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/244948/curfew-extended |title=Curfew extended |date=11 April 2020 |work=Nation News}}</ref>

The extension to the curfew meant that schools would no longer be able to reopen on 14 April, so the ministry of education would be meeting with principals to discuss e-learning and distance learning, as well a possible deferred date for the common entrance exams. Regional discussions would also be held to discuss plans for CXC exams.<ref name=\"nation-11april\" />

The prime minister reminded the population that there was no shortage of food supplies in the country, and that from 15 April hardwares and vendors of fruits and vegetables would once again be able to open. While curbside pickups and deliveries would continue, supermarkets, fish markets, hardwares and banks would also be implementing a new approach where customers would be allowed to do business on property on specific days and times of the week based on the first letter of their surname. The schedule would also allot special times for healthcare and other essential workers, senior citizens and the disabled.<ref name=\"gis-shopping-schedule-11april\">{{cite web |url=https://gisbarbados.gov.bb/blog/shopping-schedule-during-covid-19-curfew/ |title=Shopping Schedule During COVID -19 Curfew |date=11 April 2020 |work=GIS Barbados}}</ref><ref name=\"nation-11april\" />

* A public health emergency has been declared
* A curfew from Saturday, March 28, to Tuesday, April 14, 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.
* Persons are confined to their places of residence during curfew hours
* Limited movement during the day
* Continue to practise physical distancing of six feet between persons
* The plan is being implemented in a phased manner based on the intensity of spread

Businesses in the private sector will be closed from 28 March 2020 by 8:00 pm until 15 April 2020, except for those excluded by the government such as groceries, pharmacies, gas stations and farms, with specific allowed operating hours for each type of business. Restaurants can open but only for drive-through and take away services.

People contravening the order without a reasonable explanation will be liable to a fine of BBD $50,000, one year in prison, or both.

===24-hour curfew===

On 2 April 2020, acting Prime Minister Santia Bradshaw announced that because people were still congregating in large groups despite previous measures, Barbados would be placed under a 24-hour curfew from 3 April 2020 at 6:00 pm. From that date, all supermarkets, mini marts, restaurants, government offices, departments and statutory corporations would be closed, the sale of alcohol would be prohibited, and people would only be allowed to leave their homes to \"go to the pharmacy, to seek medical assistance, or if you are part of the essential services, or if you are doing business with any of the businesses, which are exempted under this Order\". Some food sellers, such as bakeries, bread depots and \"village shops\" would be allowed to operate during designated hours, but could have no more than three people congregating at a time.<ref name=\"gis-2april\">{{Cite web|url=https://gisbarbados.gov.bb/blog/24-hour-curfew-for-barbados-from-friday/ |title=24-Hour Curfew For Barbados From 6:00 p.m. Friday |date=2 April 2020 |accessdate=3 April 2020 | work=GIS Barbados}}</ref> The following day the start of the curfew was delayed till 8:00 pm. to allow workers time to go home after shutting up.<ref>{{cite news |title=51 cases of COVID-19, curfew start extended |url=https://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/barbados-now-has-51-confirmed-cases-covid-19 |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=www.loopnewsbarbados.com |language=en}}</ref>

On 7 April 2020, it was announced that on 8, 9 and 11 April, supermarkets would reopen from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm to take orders online or over the phone for curbside pickup or delivery, though customers would not be allowed to enter the supermarket. Some supermarkets would offer pre-packaged bundles with items of their choosing at [[Barbadian_dollar|BBD]] $25, $50, $100 or $150. Village shops and mini-marts would also be able to take orders and offer pre-packaged bundles.<ref name=\"nation-7april\">{{cite news |title=Guidelines for collecting groceries |url=https://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/244872/guidelines-collecting-groceries |date=7 April 2020 |work=Nation News}}</ref>

===Extension to curfew===

On 11 April 2020, Prime Minister Mia Mottley announced that the 24-hour curfew would be extended to end at midnight on the night of 3 May, instead of 14 April.<ref name=\"nation-11april\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/244948/curfew-extended |title=Curfew extended |date=11 April 2020 |work=Nation News}}</ref>

The extension to the curfew meant that schools would no longer be able to reopen on 14 April, so the ministry of education would be meeting with principals to discuss e-learning and distance learning, as well a possible deferred date for the common entrance exams. Regional discussions would also be held to discuss plans for CXC exams.<ref name=\"nation-11april\" />

The prime minister reminded the population that there was no shortage of food supplies in the country, and that from 15 April hardwares and vendors of fruits and vegetables would once again be able to open. While curbside pickups and deliveries would continue, supermarkets, fish markets, hardwares and banks would also be implementing a new approach where customers would be allowed to do business on property on specific days and times of the week based on the first letter of their surname. The schedule would also allot special times for healthcare and other essential workers, senior citizens and the disabled.<ref name=\"gis-shopping-schedule-11april\">{{cite web |url=https://gisbarbados.gov.bb/blog/shopping-schedule-during-covid-19-curfew/ |title=Shopping Schedule During COVID -19 Curfew |date=11 April 2020 |work=GIS Barbados}}</ref><ref name=\"nation-11april\" />

The first cheques would be available within 10 days, and would cover 4 weeks instead of 1.<ref name=\"nation-11april\" />
