Hopkins, Arizona, USA.  The project monitors the brightness of thousands of [[red dwarf]] stars with the goal of finding [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit method|transiting planets]]. As red dwarf stars are small, any transiting planet blocks a larger portion of starlight than transits around a Sun-like star would. This allows smaller planets to be detected through ground-based observations. \n\n; MEarth-North\nConsists of eight [[RC Optical Systems]] {{Convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on }} f/9 [[Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien telescope]]s consists of eight (on Paramount ME robotic mounts) paired with commercially available cameras with 2048 \u00d7 2048 Apogee U42 CCDs.<ref name=\"merth\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~zberta/mearth/ |title=MEarth: looking for transiting, habitable super-Earths around small stars |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2009-12-16}}</ref>\n\n; MEarth-South\nConsists of eight additional 40cm telescopes, each equipped with a CCD camera sensitive to red optical and near-infrared light.
