Troops from [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] continued to support rebel groups against the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and rifts also grew between Rwanda and Uganda as they accused each other of supporting rival rebel groups as well. [[Laurent Kabila]], president of the DRC, was assassinated in January 2001 and his son, [[Joseph Kabila]], took power. Throughout 2002 steps were made towards peace and Rwanda and Uganda both removed their troops from the country. On December 17, 2002, a massive treaty officially ended the war. However, the DRC only holds power in less than half of the country, with most of the eastern and northern portions still controlled by rebel groups, where there is still significant infighting. In addition, Rwanda still supports anti-DRC rebels and anti-Rwandan rebels continue to operate from the DRC.

The [[United Nations]] [http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/24/un.population/ estimates] that [[world population]] will reach 9.2 billion by mid-century. Such growth raises questions of ecological [[sustainability]] and creates many [[economic]] and [[political]] disruptions. In response, many countries have adopted policies which either force or encourage their citizens to have fewer children, and others have limited [[immigration]]. Considerable debate exists over what the ultimate carrying capacity of the planet may be; whether or not population growth containment policies are necessary; to what degree growth can safely occur thanks to increased economic and [[ecological efficiency]]; and how distribution mechanisms should accommodate demographic shifts. Many developed countries (most notably Japan) will experience [[population decline]], and the population debate is strongly tied with discussions about the [[distribution of wealth]].\n* '''[[Poverty]].''' Poverty remains the root cause of many of the world's other ills, including [[famine]], [[disease]], and insufficient [[education]]. Poverty contains many self-reinforcing elements (for instance, poverty can make education an unaffordable luxury, which tends to result in continuing poverty) that various aid groups hope to rectify in this century.

Increasingly, the legal, social and military battle led by governments against drug cartels around the world show little results in ending drug trading and consumption, and a constant increase in the lives taken from this struggle. Notably, after 2006 in the [[Mexican Drug War]], more than 100,000 human lives have been lost to this conflict. Some jurisdictions have enacted some degree of legalization or decriminalization of some kinds of drugs, notably including several U.S. states legalizing [[marijuana]] either for recreational or medical use.\n* '''[[Intellectual property]].'''

Much debate is proceeding about the proper bounds between protection of [[copyright]], [[trademark]] and [[patent]] rights versus [[fair use]] and the [[public domain]], where some argue that such laws have shifted greatly towards intellectual property owners and away from the interests of the general public in recent years, while others say that such legal change is needed to deal with a perceived threat of new technologies against the rights of authors and artists (or, as others put it, against the outmoded business models of the current entertainment industry). [[Domain name]] \"cybersquatting\" and access to patented drugs and generics to combat epidemics in third-world countries are other IP concerns.\n* '''[[Technology]]''' developments continue to change society. [[Cybernetics|Communications and control]] technology continues to augment the intelligence of individual humans, collections of humans, and machines. Some, notably [[Ray Kurzweil]], have predicted that by the middle of the century there will be a [[technological singularity]] if [[artificial intelligence]] that outsmarts humans is created. In addition, some [[economists]] have expressed concerns over [[technological unemployment]].[[File:World laws pertaining to homosexual relationships and expression.svg|thumb|{{legend|#025|Marriage open to same-sex couples}}{{legend|#800000|[[Death penalty for homosexuality]]}}]]  \n* '''[[Civil and political rights|Civil rights]]''', including [[women's rights]], [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]], [[racial equality]] and the rights of [[disability rights|disabled]] and [[neurodiversity|neurodiverse]] people are still a work in progress. [[Women]] are not able to realize or are outright denied their rights in many countries, including [[India]], [[China]]<ref>https://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/china/WomenChina.pdf</ref> and [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[sexual violence]] against women is still an enormous problem everywhere in the world. [[Sex-selective abortion]] has reduced the number of women born worldwide since 1990, mostly because of [[son preference]] in [[China]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Vietnam]], [[South Korea]] and some other smaller countries. In many countries attitudes towards [[homosexuality]] have become more tolerant. [[Same-sex marriage]] was legalized in several jurisdictions during the first two decades of the century, but outlawed by constitutional amendment in other places. Meanwhile, some countries such as [[Uganda]] and [[Russia]] moved to toughen their laws against any sort of [[homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior or expression. Political battles over pro- or anti-gay legislation provoked much activism in the streets and on the Internet. [[Hate group]]s remain a serious problem, and ethnic minorities have a lower status in many countries, including the United States. Neurological conditions such as [[autism]] are slowly becoming more understood and recognized.\n\n==Astronomical events==\n\n===List of the long central solar eclipses===\n* [[Solar eclipse of July 22, 2009]], total of 6 min 38.8 s, [[saros cycle|saros]] 136.\n* [[Solar eclipse of January 15, 2010]], annular of 11 min 08 s, [[saros (astronomy)|saros]] 141.

A 1999 ceasefire quickly broke down and a UN peacekeeping mission, [[MONUC]], was unable to control the fighting. Troops from [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] continued to support rebel groups against the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and rifts also grew between Rwanda and Uganda as they accused each other of supporting rival rebel groups as well. [[Laurent Kabila]], president of the DRC, was assassinated in January 2001 and his son, [[Joseph Kabila]], took power. Throughout 2002 steps were made towards peace and Rwanda and Uganda both removed their troops from the country. On December 17, 2002, a massive treaty officially ended the war. However, the DRC only holds power in less than half of the country, with most of the eastern and northern portions still controlled by rebel groups, where there is still significant infighting. In addition, Rwanda still supports anti-DRC rebels and anti-Rwandan rebels continue to operate from the DRC. The war killed an estimated 3.9 million people, displaced nearly 5.5 million, and led to a widespread and ongoing famine that continues to result in deaths. Severe human rights violations continue to be reported.\n*2001 \u2013 The [[Nepalese royal massacre]] occurred on 1 June 2001, at a house on the grounds of the [[Narayanhity Palace|Narayanhity Royal Palace]], the residence of the Nepalese monarchy.

In 2005, the ICC decided that Darfur war criminals would be tried, and on July 14, 2008, Sudanese president [[Omar al-Bashir]] was charged with 5 accounts of [[crimes against humanity]] and 2 accounts of war crimes, although the ICC has no power to enforce these charges.\n*2003\u20132010 \u2013 The [[Multinational force in Iraq|U.S.-led coalition]] [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded]] [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] on March 20, 2003, and overthrew the government of [[Saddam Hussein]] (who was executed by the Iraqi government on December 30, 2006). Coalition troops remain in the country to install a democratic government and fight an escalating insurgency. In addition to an insurgency against the American presence, Iraq also suffered from a [[Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201311)|civil war]] for several years. The war was soon seen as the central front of the War on Terror by many governments, despite growing international dissatisfaction with the war. The [[Casualties of the Iraq War|total death toll]] has been estimated at near 150,000 but these estimations are highly disputed, with one highly disputed study guessing even over 1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antiwar.com/casualties/|title=Estimated casualties in Iraq|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref> After the U.S.-led coalition initiated a [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|troop surge]] in 2007, casualty numbers have decreased significantly.

Advances in [[telecommunications]] and [[transportation]], the expansion of [[capitalism]] and [[democratization|democracy]]{{disputed inline|discuss=Talk:21st century#democratization|date=April 2019}} since the late 1980s, and [[free trade]] agreements have resulted in unprecedented global economic and cultural integration.

CNN. August 12, 2009.</ref>]]\n* '''[[Population]].''' The world's population demographics will shift considerably in this century, with the population of [[Europe]] and [[East Asia]] to decline considerably and the population of [[Africa]] and to a lesser extent [[South Asia]] to grow considerably. The [[United Nations]] estimates that [[world population]] will reach 9.8 billion by the year 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2017.html|title=World population projected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in 2100|date=June 21, 2017|website=UN DESA - United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}</ref> Most of this growth will take place in the world's poorer countries, which may slow down the global reduction of poverty and combined with the effects of [[global warming]] may lead to large migrations. \n** '''[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]].''' The [[United Nations]] [http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/24/un.population/ estimates] that [[world population]] will reach 9.2 billion by mid-century. Such growth raises questions of ecological [[sustainability]] and creates many [[economic]] and [[political]] disruptions. In response, many countries have adopted policies which either force or encourage their citizens to have fewer children, and others have limited [[immigration]]. Considerable debate exists over what the ultimate carrying capacity of the planet may be; whether or not population growth containment policies are necessary; to what degree growth can safely occur thanks to increased economic and [[ecological efficiency]]; and how distribution mechanisms should accommodate demographic shifts. Many developed countries (most notably Japan) will experience [[population decline]], and the population debate is strongly tied with discussions about the [[distribution of wealth]].\n* '''[[Poverty]].''' Poverty remains the root cause of many of the world's other ills, including [[famine]], [[disease]], and insufficient [[education]]. Poverty contains many self-reinforcing elements (for instance, poverty can make education an unaffordable luxury, which tends to result in continuing poverty) that various aid groups hope to rectify in this century. Immense progress has been made in reducing poverty, especially in China and India but increasingly in Africa as well. [[Microcredit]] lending has also started to gain a profile as a useful anti-poverty tool.\n* '''[[Disease]].''' [[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[malaria]] each kill over a million people annually. [[HIV]] remains without a cure or vaccine, and while new cases are declining it remains a major problem, especially for women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/global-hiv-and-aids-statistics|title=Global HIV and AIDS statistics|date=July 16, 2015|website=AVERT}}</ref> [[Antibiotic resistance]] is a growing concern for organisms such as [[tuberculosis]]. Other diseases, such as [[SARS]], [[ebola]], the [[Zika virus]] and [[flu]] variations, are also causes for concern. The [[World Health Organization]] has [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3524824.stm warned] of a possible coming flu [[pandemic]] resulting from [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] [[mutation]]s. In 2009, there was an outbreak of [[2009 flu pandemic|swine flu]] whose country of origin is still unknown.[[File:World nuclear weapons.png|thumb|right|In early 2019, more than 90% of world's 13,865 [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons]] were owned by Russia and the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=Global Nuclear Arsenal Declines, But Future Cuts Uncertain Amid U.S.-Russia Tensions |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/nuclear-weapons-russia-start-inf-warheads/30003088.html |work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=17 June 2019}}</ref> ]]\n* '''[[War]] and [[terrorism]].'''

The [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] triggered invasions of [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and partially and controversially [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]. The [[War on Terror]] has seen controversies over [[civil liberties]], accusations of [[torture]], continued terrorist attacks and ongoing instability, violence, and military occupation. Violence continues in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]. Considerable concern remains about [[nuclear proliferation]], especially in [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]], and the availability of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to rogue groups.\n**'''[[War on drugs]].''' Increasingly, the legal, social and military battle led by governments against drug cartels around the world show little results in ending drug trading and consumption, and a constant increase in the lives taken from this struggle. Notably, after 2006 in the [[Mexican Drug War]], more than 100,000 human lives have been lost to this conflict. Some jurisdictions have enacted some degree of legalization or decriminalization of some kinds of drugs, notably including several U.S. states legalizing [[marijuana]] either for recreational or medical use.\n* '''[[Intellectual property]].''' The increasing popularity of digital formats for entertainment media such as movies and music, and the ease of copying and distributing it via the [[Internet]] and [[peer-to-peer]] networks, has raised concerns in the media industry about [[copyright infringement]]. Much debate is proceeding about the proper bounds between protection of [[copyright]], [[trademark]] and [[patent]] rights versus [[fair use]] and the [[public domain]], where some argue that such laws have shifted greatly towards intellectual property owners and away from the interests of the general public in recent years, while others say that such legal change is needed to deal with a perceived threat of new technologies against the rights of authors and artists (or, as others put it, against the outmoded business models of the current entertainment industry). [[Domain name]] \"cybersquatting\" and access to patented drugs and generics to combat epidemics in third-world countries are other IP concerns.\n* '''[[Technology]]''' developments continue to change society. [[Cybernetics|Communications and control]] technology continues to augment the intelligence of individual humans, collections of humans, and machines. Some, notably [[Ray Kurzweil]], have predicted that by the middle of the century there will be a [[technological singularity]] if [[artificial intelligence]] that outsmarts humans is created. In addition, some [[economists]] have expressed concerns over [[technological unemployment]].[[File:World laws pertaining to homosexual relationships and expression.svg|thumb|{{legend|#025|Marriage open to same-sex couples}}{{legend|#800000|[[Death penalty for homosexuality]]}}]]  \n* '''[[Civil and political rights|Civil rights]]''', including [[women's rights]], [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]], [[racial equality]] and the rights of [[disability rights|disabled]] and [[neurodiversity|neurodiverse]] people are still a work in progress. [[Women]] are not able to realize or are outright denied their rights in many countries, including [[India]], [[China]]<ref>https://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/china/WomenChina.pdf</ref> and [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[sexual violence]] against women is still an enormous problem everywhere in the world. [[Sex-selective abortion]] has reduced the number of women born worldwide since 1990, mostly because of [[son preference]] in [[China]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Vietnam]], [[South Korea]] and some other smaller countries. In many countries attitudes towards [[homosexuality]] have become more tolerant. [[Same-sex marriage]] was legalized in several jurisdictions during the first two decades of the century, but outlawed by constitutional amendment in other places. Meanwhile, some countries such as [[Uganda]] and [[Russia]] moved to toughen their laws against any sort of [[homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior or expression. Political battles over pro- or anti-gay legislation provoked much activism in the streets and on the Internet. [[Hate group]]s remain a serious problem, and ethnic minorities have a lower status in many countries, including the United States. Neurological conditions such as [[autism]] are slowly becoming more understood and recognized.\n\n==Astronomical events==\n\n===List of the long central solar eclipses===\n* [[Solar eclipse of July 22, 2009]], total of 6 min 38.8 s, [[saros cycle|saros]] 136.\n* [[Solar eclipse of January 15, 2010]], annular of 11 min 08 s, [[saros (astronomy)|saros]] 141.
