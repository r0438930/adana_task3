{"title_page": "Dorf (character)", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=June 2019}}\n'''Dorf''' is a fictional character created by comedy writer and performer [[Tim Conway]].  He was the main character in a series of [[direct-to-video]] films during the 1980s and 1990s.  Dorf was characterized by his diminutive height (he was performed by Conway standing in a hole with fake shoes attached to his knees), [[toup\u00e9e]], toothbrush [[moustache|mustache]], pot belly, unusual accent (modeled by Conway on a [[Swedish language|Swedish]] accent), and frequent [[pratfall]]s.  Each film focused on a particular sport, with Dorf humorously giving instructions on the history and play of the sport.  \n\n==History==\nThe character was created by Conway for a sketch on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' as a horse jockey.  Based on the popularity of the sketch, he produced a set of direct-to-video comedy films, each focusing on a different sport, most of which were released through [[J2 Communications]], which later became known for its purchase of the ''[[National Lampoon Inc.|National Lampoon]]'' franchise.  These included:\n\n*''[[Dorf on Golf]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Dorf's Golf Bible]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Dorf and the First Games of Mount Olympus]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Dorf Goes Auto Racing]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Dorf Goes Fishing]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Dorf on the Diamond]]'' (1996)\n*''Dorf's Christmas Specials'' (2009\u20132015)\n*''Chip & Bernie Save Christmas with Dorf'' (2016)\n\nIn the first four entries, Dorf is \"assisted\" by Boom-Boom LaRue ([[Michele Smith (actress)|Michele Smith]]), a mute [[dumb blonde]], and by either the perpetually spaced-out Leonard ([[Vincent Schiavelli]]) or nerdy Waldo ([[Eddie Deezen]]), who each serve as [[comic foil]]. Other characters replace them in later entries. Dorf serves mainly as a [[straight man|stooge]] in the dialogue, with much of the humor on his part coming from his pratfalls.\n\nOther than the main series of films, Dorf has made numerous guest appearances on talk shows, award shows and television commercials.  \n\n{{Dorf}}\n[[Category:Dorf series]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with dwarfism]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=June 2019}}\n'''Dorf''' is a fictional character created by comedy writer and performer [[Tim Conway]].
