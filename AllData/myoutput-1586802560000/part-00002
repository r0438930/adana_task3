Davies, which was published in 1980 by Springer Verlag.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783642814587 |title= The first comprehensive treatment of the subject 'Superplasticity'|isbn= 9783642814587|publisher= Springer|year= 1980|series= Materials Research and Engineering}}</ref> In 2012, it was identified as one of about 40 books out of a few thousand books published by [[Springer-Verlag]] during 1843 \u2013 2005 (163 Years) and published in both print and e-book form. Two other books on the same subject, \u2018Superplastic Flow: Phenomenology and Mechanics\u2019<ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783540678427|title= Superplastic Flow: Phenomenology and Mechanics|isbn= 9783540678427|publisher= Springer|year= 2001|series= Engineering Materials}}</ref> and \u2018Superplasticity: Common Basis for a Near-Ubiquitous Phenomenon\u2019 <ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783642319563 |title= Superplasticity: Common Basis for a Near-Ubiquitous Phenomenon|isbn= 9783642319563|publisher= Springer|year= 2018|series= Engineering Materials}}</ref> were also published in 2001 and 2018. Additionally, Padmanabhan has contributed 6 book chapters and more than 280 research publications, with a majority on Superplasticity.\n\n=== Mechanical processing ===\nA procedure for the superplastic forming of hemispherical domes of Titanium-6 Aluminum-4 Vanadium alloy ([[Ti-6Al-4V]]) was developed by Padmanabhan for the Integrated Missiles Technology Program of the Defense R&D Laboratory, Government of India.\nHe developed a multi-stage closed die forging technology for the production of undercarriage base plate fitting component for the air frame of high-performance (supersonic) Aircraft for the Indian Aeronautical Development Agency([[Aeronautical Development Agency]]).\n\n=== Materials development ===\nPadmanabhan developed for the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO), an alloy equivalent to [[AFNOR]] 7020 alloy (a French alloy) for use as construction material for water tankages. The technology was transferred to an ordnance factory for productionization.\n\nThe development of an austenitic steel having only 1% nickel for the Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA) was successfully completed and today nearly 800,000 tonnes of this grade of steel is made by Indian industries.\n\n=== Materials plasticity under different loading conditions ===\nHis work for the [[Department of Atomic Energy]] (DAE) was mainly concerned with the physical and mechanical metallurgy aspects (deformation, fracture, stress corrosion cracking and low cycle fatigue) of AISI 304, 304 LN, 316 and 316 LN austenitic stainless steels and an improved grade D9, all construction materials for the Fast Breeder Reactor program.\n\nHe was a consultant to the R & D Centre for Iron and Steel, [[Steel Authority of India]] Limited (SAIL), when they produced for the first time in the country both Extra Deep Drawing (EDD) and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) grades of steel.\n\nHe was a consultant to Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (now known as [[Tata Motors]]) when they introduced the micro-alloyed ferrite - pearlite steel (first generation), 49MnVS3, for the first time in India for the forging of crankshafts.\n\n=== Basic research and nanostructured materials ===\nPadmanabhan proposed a new concept \u2018mesoscopic grain boundary sliding\u2019 for explaining the origins of the phenomenon of Superplasticity (K.A. Padmanabhan and J. Schlipf 1996).<ref> K.A. Padmanabhan and J. Schlipf (1996): A Model for Grain Boundary Sliding and its Relevance to Optimal Structural Superplasticity: 1. Theory. In Mater. Sci. Technol., 12, pp. 391\u2013399.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28\u201338.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2012) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2012): A Mechanism for the Deformation of Disordered States of Matter. In Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science 16, pp. 243\u2013253.</ref>, (H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan 1997) <ref> H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan (1997): A Model for the Deformation of Nanocrystalline Materials. In Philos. Mag. (76B), pp. 559\u2013571.</ref>.\n\nHis model for grain boundary sliding and its application to superplastic flow in micro-crystalline metallic materials and ceramics questioned the dominant idea of the time in high-temperature deformation modelling that Grain Boundary Sliding is an inherently fast process, which at no stage could be controlling the rate of high-temperature deformation (K. A. Padmanabhan 2009) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan (2009): Grain Boundary Sliding Controlled Flow and its Relevance to Superplasticity in Metals, Alloys, Ceramics and Intermetallics and Strain-Rate Dependent Flow in Nanostructured Materials.

Raviathul Basariya (2019): A theory of steady state structural superplasticity in different classes of materials. A materials-agnostic analysis. In Materials Science & Engineering A (744), pp. 704\u2013715.</ref>. \n\nHis model for inverse Hall-Petch effect in nano-crystalline and quasi-crystalline materials extends the ideas contained in the above model to explain why when the grain size in a nano-crystalline material goes below a value ~ 10-15&nbsp;nm, there is grain size softening, rather than the usual increase in hardness with decreasing grain size. At the international conference on \"[[Severe plastic deformation]]\" held in Russia in 2011 this paper of 1997 was named the most significant publication in this area (H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan 1997) <ref> H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan (1997): A Model for the Deformation of Nanocrystalline Materials. In Philos. Mag. (76B), pp. 559\u2013571. </ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan, G. P.

Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28\u201338. </ref>.\n\nHis model with H. Gleiter extends the above ideas to cover superplastic deformation in metals and ceramics of micro-crystalline, sub-micron and nano-crystalline grain sizes. Using Herring's equation a physical justification is given for mesoscopic boundary sliding/plane interface formation using the minimization of the total free energy as the key criterion. This paper was described by Nature Materials as a \"break-through from India\" (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28\u201338. </ref>.\n\nHe developed a model for predicting the [[formability]] of steels and aluminium alloys under different stress states (A. Kanni Raj and K. A. Padmanabhan 1997a) <ref> A. Kanni Raj and K. A. Padmanabhan (1997a): Room Temperature Plastic Flow and Strain-Induced Martensitic Transformation in 1.2 % Ni Metastable Austenitic Stainless Steel Sheets. In J. Mater. Sci.

Padmanabhan and G.J. Davies, which was published in 1980 by Springer Verlag.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783642814587 |title= The first comprehensive treatment of the subject 'Superplasticity'|isbn= 9783642814587|publisher= Springer|year= 1980|series= Materials Research and Engineering}}</ref> In 2012, it was identified as one of about 40 books out of a few thousand books published by [[Springer-Verlag]] during 1843 \u2013 2005 (163 Years) and published in both print and e-book form. Two other books on the same subject, \u2018Superplastic Flow: Phenomenology and Mechanics\u2019<ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783540678427|title= Superplastic Flow: Phenomenology and Mechanics|isbn= 9783540678427|publisher= Springer|year= 2001|series= Engineering Materials}}</ref> and \u2018Superplasticity: Common Basis for a Near-Ubiquitous Phenomenon\u2019 <ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783642319563 |title= Superplasticity: Common Basis for a Near-Ubiquitous Phenomenon|isbn= 9783642319563|publisher= Springer|year= 2018|series= Engineering Materials}}</ref> were also published in 2001 and 2018. Additionally, K. A. Padmanabhan has contributed 6 book chapters and more than 280 research publications, with a majority on Superplasticity.\n\n=== Mechanical processing ===\nA procedure for the superplastic forming of hemispherical domes of Titanium-6 Aluminum-4 Vanadium alloy ([[Ti-6Al-4V]]) was developed by Prof. Padmanabhan for the Integrated Missiles Technology Program of the Defense R&D Laboratory, Government of India.\nHe developed a multi-stage closed die forging technology for the production of undercarriage base plate fitting component for the air frame of high-performance (supersonic) Aircraft for the Indian Aeronautical Development Agency([[Aeronautical Development Agency]]).\n\n=== Materials Development ===\nProf. Padmanabhan developed for the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO), an alloy equivalent to [[AFNOR]] 7020 alloy (a French alloy) for use as construction material for water tankages. The technology was transferred to an ordnance factory for productionization.\n\nThe development of an austenitic steel having only 1% nickel for the Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA) was successfully completed and today nearly 800,000 tonnes of this grade of steel is made by Indian industries.\n\n=== Materials Plasticity Under Different Loading Conditions ===\nHis work for the [[Department of Atomic Energy]] (DAE) was mainly concerned with the physical and mechanical metallurgy aspects (deformation, fracture, stress corrosion cracking and low cycle fatigue) of AISI 304, 304 LN, 316 and 316 LN austenitic stainless steels and an improved grade D9, all construction materials for the Fast Breeder Reactor program.\n\nHe was a consultant to the R & D Centre for Iron and Steel, [[Steel Authority of India]] Limited (SAIL), when they produced for the first time in the country both Extra Deep Drawing (EDD) and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) grades of steel.\n\nHe was a consultant to Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (now known as [[Tata Motors]]) when they introduced the micro-alloyed ferrite - pearlite steel (first generation), 49MnVS3, for the first time in India for the forging of crankshafts.\n\n=== Basic Research and Nanostructured Materials ===\nProf. K. A. Padmanabhan proposed a new concept \u2018mesoscopic grain boundary sliding\u2019 for explaining the origins of the phenomenon of Superplasticity (K.A. Padmanabhan and J. Schlipf 1996).<ref> K.A. Padmanabhan and J. Schlipf (1996): A Model for Grain Boundary Sliding and its Relevance to Optimal Structural Superplasticity: 1. Theory. In Mater. Sci. Technol., 12, pp. 391\u2013399.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28\u201338.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2012) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2012): A Mechanism for the Deformation of Disordered States of Matter. In Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science 16, pp. 243\u2013253.</ref>, (H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan 1997) <ref> H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan (1997): A Model for the Deformation of Nanocrystalline Materials. In Philos. Mag. (76B), pp. 559\u2013571.</ref>.\n\nHis model for grain boundary sliding and its application to superplastic flow in micro-crystalline metallic materials and ceramics questioned the dominant idea of the time in high-temperature deformation modelling that Grain Boundary Sliding is an inherently fast process, which at no stage could be controlling the rate of high-temperature deformation (K. A. Padmanabhan 2009) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan (2009): Grain Boundary Sliding Controlled Flow and its Relevance to Superplasticity in Metals, Alloys, Ceramics and Intermetallics and Strain-Rate Dependent Flow in Nanostructured Materials.

Raviathul Basariya (2019): A theory of steady state structural superplasticity in different classes of materials. A materials-agnostic analysis. In Materials Science & Engineering A (744), pp. 704\u2013715.</ref>. \n\nHis model for inverse Hall-Petch effect in nano-crystalline and quasi-crystalline materials extends the ideas contained in the above model to explain why when the grain size in a nano-crystalline material goes below a value ~ 10-15&nbsp;nm, there is grain size softening, rather than the usual increase in hardness with decreasing grain size. At the international conference on \"[[Severe plastic deformation]]\" held in Russia in 2011 this paper of 1997 was named the most significant publication in this area (H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan 1997) <ref> H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan (1997): A Model for the Deformation of Nanocrystalline Materials. In Philos. Mag. (76B), pp. 559\u2013571. </ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan, G. P. Dinda, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter 2007) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan, G. P. Dinda, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter (2007): On the inverse Hall - Petch Effect and Related Phenomena in Nano- and Microcrystalline Materials. In Mater. Sci. Eng A, pp. 452\u2013453.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan, S. Sripathi, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter 2014) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan, S. Sripathi, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter (2014): Inverse Hall-Petch Effect in Quasi- and Nanocrystalline Materials.

Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28\u201338. </ref>.\n\nHis model with H. Gleiter extends the above ideas to cover superplastic deformation in metals and ceramics of micro-crystalline, sub-micron and nano-crystalline grain sizes. Using Herring's equation a physical justification is given for mesoscopic boundary sliding/plane interface formation using the minimization of the total free energy as the key criterion. This paper was described by Nature Materials as a \"break-through from India\" (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28\u201338. </ref>.\n\nHe developed a model for predicting the [[formability]] of steels and aluminium alloys under different stress states (A. Kanni Raj and K. A. Padmanabhan 1997a) <ref> A. Kanni Raj and K. A. Padmanabhan (1997a): Room Temperature Plastic Flow and Strain-Induced Martensitic Transformation in 1.2 % Ni Metastable Austenitic Stainless Steel Sheets. In J. Mater. Sci.
