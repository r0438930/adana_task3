''The Legend of the Sacred Sword 3: Trials of Mana''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}}} is a 2020 [[action role-playing game]] developed by Xeen and [[Square Enix]], and published by Square Enix for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]]. It is a 3D remake of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] [[Trials of Mana|title of the same name]], the third game in the ''[[Mana (series)|Mana]]'' series.{{efn|The original game was known prior to 2019 by its native title ''Seiken Densetsu 3''.<ref name=\"TrialsTitle\"/><ref name=\"NIfeature\"/>}} The story follows six possible protagonists in their respective quests, which lead them to obtain the Mana Sword and fight a world-ending threat. In gameplay, the player controls three out of six characters, navigating field environments and fighting enemies in real-time combat.\n\nConceived during the production of the remake for ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' amid public demand for a Western release, production began in 2017. Originally a near-direct remake with plans for multiplayer as in the original, the team instead went for a 3D single-player experience which tweaked some aspects and added content while remaining faithful overall. The soundtrack by [[Hiroki Kikuta]] was arranged by a large team, with Kikuta supervising.\n\n== Content ==\n{{See also|Trials of Mana#Plot}}\n[[File:Trials of Mana 2020 gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|While carrying over the basic gameplay and premise, ''Trials of Mana'' changes several elements such as camera position, and adds new mechanics.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/><ref name=\"NWRreview\"/>]]\n''Trials of Mana'' is an [[action role-playing game]] in which the player controls a selection of three out of six protagonists; while each begins with their own narrative, they are drawn into a single quest to defeat the Benevodons and save the Mana Tree.<ref name=\"TrialsTitle\"/> The game is a 3D remake of the 1995 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] [[Trials of Mana|title of the same name]].<ref name=\"TrialsTitle\"/><ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> The overall narrative and basic gameplay principles remain the same, but redesigned for a navigable 3D overworld.<ref name=\"TrialsTitle\"/> During exploration, the player can meet with other playable characters both before their recruitment and in various locations if they remain unselected.<ref name=\"TrialsGameplayB\"/> Upon meeting a selected playble character, the player has the option of either viewing an explanatory cutscene, or playing through that character's prologue.<ref name=\"NWRreview\"/>\n\nThe chosen player characters navigate the overworld\u2014split between town and country environments\u2014and fight enemies roaming it in real-time combat.<ref name=\"NWRreview\"/><ref name=\"TrialsTips\"/> During exploration, the player can find items, treasure chests and hidden areas; a common reward is lucca, the in-game currency.<ref name=\"TrialsTips\"/> The party fights using light and heavy melee attacks when within range, character-specific special skills unlocked through a distinct levelling system, tiered [[character class]] skills, and combined attacks between all three characters.<ref name=\"NWRreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"TrialsGameplayA\"/> Fighting enemies is rewarded with [[experience point]]s, which raise a character's health (HP) and magic (MP). It also earns Training Points, which are fed into specific attributes to unlock new skills. The new \"Ability\" system, moves and buffs dubbed abilities can be equipped to a character; Link Abilities are unlocked by more than one character sharing that ability, while Class Abilities are automatically unlocked and applied upon changing class.<ref name=\"TrialsGameplayB\"/>\n\nDuring the game, the player finds various items, ranging from healing items to money and items that impact player or enemy statistics. Also found are Item Seeds, which can be planted in special pots in towns. There are different classes of Item Seed which produce better quality items, and a \"Planter Level\" which impacts the frequency of Item Seed drops and the quality of items.<ref name=\"TrialsGameplayB\"/> Within the environment, a recurring series character called Li\u2019l Cactus is hidden, with finding them in each location granting rewards to the party. Once the main story is completed, a post-game storyline with its own class is unlocked, and after this is completed players can select [[New Game+]] to carry over their level, common items, and some collectables.<ref name=\"TrialsGameplayC\"/>\n\n== Development ==\nWhen originally released, ''Trials of Mana'' was not localized outside of Japan, where it was released as ''Seiken Densetsu 3''. Over the years, particularly following the 2017 release of the ''Collection of Mana'' compilation of the first three ''Mana'' titles in Japan, the demand for a Western version increased. During production of the [[Secret of Mana#Re-releases|3D remake]] of ''[[Secret of Mana]]'', series producer Masaru Oyamada decided with the remake's producer Shinichi Tatsuki to bring the game overseas as a remake.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> Production began in 2017. While the remake for ''Secret of Mana'' was fairly faithful to the original, ''Trials of Mana'' was designed to be more like a new game due to its previous lack of localization.<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> The remake was developed by Square Enix and Xeen.<ref name=\"TrialsCredits\"/> A large part of creating the remake was capturing the nostalgia of the original while innovating and adapting to the new design. The game was built using the [[Unreal Engine]].<ref name=\"PSBlog\"/> The English title was decided in consultation with series creator [[Koichi Ishii]]; the title both referred to the trials of the protagonists, and the letters \"tri\" standing for the number 3.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/><ref name=\"FamInterview\"/>\n\nWhen designing ''Trials of Mana'', the team took fan feedback from the ''Secret of Mana'' remake into account.<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> They approached development as if it were a new game.<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/> An early prototype of the game was more faithful to the original, featuring a top-down view of environments. Dissatisfied with this, the team opted to redesign the game completely.<ref name=\"PSBlog\"/><ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> The battle system was recreated in basics, but the team added new elements such as strong and weak attacks, combos, jumping and dodging, the ability to change weapons, and other elements such as the class system.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/><ref name=\"4Ginterview\"/><ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> The prototype battle system was similarly more faithful to the original, but \"felt off\" in practise.<ref name=\"PSUinterview\"/> The game's AI system was redesigned compared to the original, which received criticism.<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/> While principally in 3D, the team included side-scrolling sections in homage to similar scenes in the original game.<ref name=\"PSUinterview\"/> [[Multiplayer]], a feature from the original game, was considered for inclusion in the remake. After going through several concepts that incorporated online multiplayer, the team realised they were pulling the project in too many directions. Aiming to make a polished single-player experience, the team discarded their multiplayer plans.<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/><ref name=\"SQEX\"/>\n\nThe basic narrative remained the same, new interactions between characters and other elements were introduced to flesh out the narrative.<ref name=\"NIfeature\"/><ref name=\"4Ginterview\"/> A key goal was fleshing out the protagonists.<ref name=\"USGamer\"/> While the original script was fairly simple and featured sudden jumps in emotional mood, the revised script for the remake introduced more nuances into dialogue.<ref name=\"CGM\"/> An important element the team had to check was the voice actors. Several checks were made both to the scripts and during the recording process so the performances would not be out of character.<ref name=\"4Ginterview\"/> The characters were redesigned by artist Haccan, who had acted as character designer for the ''Secret of Mana'' remake.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> Haccan adapted the original designs by Ishii and [[Nobuteru Y\u016bki]], reworking the designs for modern graphics with input from Ishii.<ref name=\"PSUinterview\"/> The character models were created with the aim of directly translating Haccan's artwork into the game. While the original game used pixel art and allowed for exaggerated expressions using large heads on smaller bodies, the team were uncomfortable replicating it in full 3D and so expressions and interactions had to be completely redone.<ref name=\"4Ginterview\"/> The character classes were redesigned using the original pixel art as a base, with the colours adjusted to better fit the personalities of the different protagonists.<ref name=\"PSBlogClass\"/>\n\nThe soundtrack, composed originally by [[Hiroki Kikuta]], was arranged by [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]], Koji Yamaoka, Ryo Yamazaki, and Sachiko Miyano.<ref name=\"TrialOST\"/> Kikuta acted as a supervisor for arrangements, and the original versions of tracks were included as an option for players.<ref name=\"NIfeature\"/><ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> A few tracks were recorded with a full orchestra, but most used synthesised instruments.<ref name=\"PSBlog\"/> An official soundtrack album will release on April 22, 2020.<ref name=\"TrialOST\"/> The physical version was released on that day in North America and Europe, but it got delayed in Japan due to disruptions caused by the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]].<ref name=\"TrialsAlbumDelay\"/>\n\n== Release ==\nThe remake of ''Trials of Mana'' was announced in June 2019 at that year's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]].<ref name=\"TrialsAnnounce\"/> The game was released worldwide on April 24, 2020.<ref name=\"TrialsRemakeDate\"/> The localization was a challenge for the team, as it required a simultaneous release in eight languages.<ref name=\"GemInterview\"/> A [[game demo]] was released across all platforms on March 18, 2020. The demo covers the opening section of the game, where the player chooses their characters and reaches the first boss fight, and allows players to transfer save data into the full game.<ref name=\"TrialsDemo\"/> The original ''Trials of Mana'' had received a fan translation prior to the remake's development, and the team aimed to both acknowledge and surpass their efforts.<ref name=\"USGamer\"/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"TrialsTitle\">{{cite web|url=https://trialsofmana.square-enix-games.com/en-gb?|title=Trials of Mana

TRIALS of MANA||lit. ''The Legend of the Sacred Sword 3: Trials of Mana''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}}} is a 2020 [[action role-playing game]] developed by Xeen and [[Square Enix]], and published by Square Enix for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]]. It is a 3D remake of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] [[Trials of Mana|title of the same name]], the third game in the ''[[Mana (series)|Mana]]'' series.{{efn|The original game was known prior to 2019 by its native title ''Seiken Densetsu 3''.<ref name=\"TrialsTitle\"/><ref name=\"NIfeature\"/>}} The story follows six possible protagonists in their respective quests, which lead them to obtain the Mana Sword and fight a world-ending threat. In gameplay, the player controls three out of six characters, navigating field environments and fighting enemies in real-time combat.\n\nConceived during the production of the remake for ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' amid public demand for a Western release, production began in 2017. Originally a near-direct remake with plans for multiplayer as in the original, the team instead went for a 3D single-player experience which tweaked some aspects and added content while remaining faithful overall. The soundtrack by [[Hiroki Kikuta]] was arranged by a large team, with Kikuta supervising.\n\n== Content ==\n{{See also|Trials of Mana#Plot}}\n[[File:Trials of Mana 2020 gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|While carrying over the basic gameplay and premise, ''Trials of Mana'' changes several elements such as camera position, and adds new mechanics.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/><ref name=\"NWRreview\"/>]]\n''Trials of Mana'' is an [[action role-playing game]] in which the player controls a selection of three out of six protagonists; while each begins with their own narrative, they are drawn into a single quest to defeat the Benevodons and save the Mana Tree.<ref name=\"TrialsTitle\"/> The game is a 3D remake of the 1995 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] [[Trials of Mana|title of the same name]].<ref name=\"TrialsTitle\"/><ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> The overall narrative and basic gameplay principles remain the same, but redesigned for a navigable 3D overworld.<ref name=\"TrialsTitle\"/> During exploration, the player can meet with other playable characters both before their recruitment and in various locations if they remain unselected.<ref name=\"TrialsGameplayB\"/> Upon meeting a selected playble character, the player has the option of either viewing an explanatory cutscene, or playing through that character's prologue.<ref name=\"NWRreview\"/>\n\nThe chosen player characters navigate the overworld\u2014split between town and country environments\u2014and fight enemies roaming it in real-time combat.<ref name=\"NWRreview\"/><ref name=\"TrialsTips\"/> During exploration, the player can find items, treasure chests and hidden areas; a common reward is lucca, the in-game currency.<ref name=\"TrialsTips\"/> The party fights using light and heavy melee attacks when within range, character-specific special skills unlocked through a distinct levelling system, tiered [[character class]] skills, and combined attacks between all three characters.<ref name=\"NWRreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"TrialsGameplayA\"/> Fighting enemies is rewarded with [[experience point]]s, which raise a character's health (HP) and magic (MP). It also earns Training Points, which are fed into specific attributes to unlock new skills. The new \"Ability\" system, moves and buffs dubbed abilities can be equipped to a character; Link Abilities are unlocked by more than one character sharing that ability, while Class Abilities are automatically unlocked and applied upon changing class.<ref name=\"TrialsGameplayB\"/>\n\nDuring the game, the player finds various items, ranging from healing items to money and items that impact player or enemy statistics. Also found are Item Seeds, which can be planted in special pots in towns. There are different classes of Item Seed which produce better quality items, and a \"Planter Level\" which impacts the frequency of Item Seed drops and the quality of items.<ref name=\"TrialsGameplayB\"/> Within the environment, a recurring series character called Li\u2019l Cactus is hidden, with finding them in each location granting rewards to the party. Once the main story is completed, a post-game storyline with its own class is unlocked, and after this is completed players can select [[New Game+]] to carry over their level, common items, and some collectables.<ref name=\"TrialsGameplayC\"/>\n\n== Development ==\nWhen originally released, ''Trials of Mana'' was not localized outside of Japan, where it was released as ''Seiken Densetsu 3''. Over the years, particularly following the 2017 release of the ''Collection of Mana'' compilation of the first three ''Mana'' titles in Japan, the demand for a Western version increased. During production of the [[Secret of Mana#Re-releases|3D remake]] of ''[[Secret of Mana]]'', series producer Masaru Oyamada decided with the remake's producer Shinichi Tatsuki to bring the game overseas as a remake.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> Production began in 2017. While the remake for ''Secret of Mana'' was fairly faithful to the original, ''Trials of Mana'' was designed to be more like a new game due to its previous lack of localization.<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> The remake was developed by Square Enix and Xeen.<ref name=\"TrialsCredits\"/> A large part of creating the remake was capturing the nostalgia of the original while innovating and adapting to the new design. The game was built using the [[Unreal Engine]].<ref name=\"PSBlog\"/> The English title was decided in consultation with series creator [[Koichi Ishii]]; the title both referred to the trials of the protagonists, and the letters \"tri\" standing for the number 3.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/><ref name=\"FamInterview\"/>\n\nWhen designing ''Trials of Mana'', the team took fan feedback from the ''Secret of Mana'' remake into account.<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> They approached development as if it were a new game.<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/> An early prototype of the game was more faithful to the original, featuring a top-down view of environments. Dissatisfied with this, the team opted to redesign the game completely.<ref name=\"PSBlog\"/><ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> The battle system was recreated in basics, but the team added new elements such as strong and weak attacks, combos, jumping and dodging, the ability to change weapons, and other elements such as the class system.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/><ref name=\"4Ginterview\"/><ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> The prototype battle system was similarly more faithful to the original, but \"felt off\" in practise.<ref name=\"PSUinterview\"/> The game's AI system was redesigned compared to the original, which received criticism.<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/> While principally in 3D, the team included side-scrolling sections in homage to similar scenes in the original game.<ref name=\"PSUinterview\"/> [[Multiplayer]], a feature from the original game, was considered for inclusion in the remake. After going through several concepts that incorporated online multiplayer, the team realised they were pulling the project in too many directions. Aiming to make a polished single-player experience, the team discarded their multiplayer plans.<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/><ref name=\"SQEX\"/>\n\nThe basic narrative remained the same, new interactions between characters and other elements were introduced to flesh out the narrative.<ref name=\"NIfeature\"/><ref name=\"4Ginterview\"/> A key goal was fleshing out the protagonists.<ref name=\"USGamer\"/> While the original script was fairly simple and featured sudden jumps in emotional mood, the revised script for the remake introduced more nuances into dialogue.<ref name=\"CGM\"/> An important element the team had to check was the voice actors. Several checks were made both to the scripts and during the recording process so the performances would not be out of character.<ref name=\"4Ginterview\"/> The characters were redesigned by artist Haccan, who had acted as character designer for the ''Secret of Mana'' remake.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> Haccan adapted the original designs by Ishii and [[Nobuteru Y\u016bki]], reworking the designs for modern graphics with input from Ishii.<ref name=\"PSUinterview\"/> The character models were created with the aim of directly translating Haccan's artwork into the game. While the original game used pixel art and allowed for exaggerated expressions using large heads on smaller bodies, the team were uncomfortable replicating it in full 3D and so expressions and interactions had to be completely redone.<ref name=\"4Ginterview\"/> The character classes were redesigned using the original pixel art as a base, with the colours adjusted to better fit the personalities of the different protagonists.<ref name=\"PSBlogClass\"/>\n\nThe soundtrack, composed originally by [[Hiroki Kikuta]], was arranged by [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]], Koji Yamaoka, Ryo Yamazaki, and Sachiko Miyano.<ref name=\"TrialOST\"/> Kikuta acted as a supervisor for arrangements, and the original versions of tracks were included as an option for players.<ref name=\"NIfeature\"/><ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> A few tracks were recorded with a full orchestra, but most used synthesised instruments.<ref name=\"PSBlog\"/> An official soundtrack album will release on April 22, 2020.<ref name=\"TrialOST\"/> The physical version was released on that day in North America and Europe, but it got delayed in Japan due to disruptions caused by the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]].<ref name=\"TrialsAlbumDelay\"/>\n\n== Release ==\nThe remake of ''Trials of Mana'' was announced in June 2019 at that year's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]].<ref name=\"TrialsAnnounce\"/> The game is set for worldwide release on April 24, 2020.<ref name=\"TrialsRemakeDate\"/> The localization was a challenge for the team, as it required a simultaneous release in eight languages.<ref name=\"GemInterview\"/> A [[game demo]] was released across all platforms on March 18, 2020. The demo covers the opening section of the game, where the player chooses their characters and reaches the first boss fight, and allows players to transfer save data into the full game.<ref name=\"TrialsDemo\"/> The original ''Trials of Mana'' had received a fan translation prior to the remake's development, and the team aimed to both acknowledge and surpass their efforts.<ref
