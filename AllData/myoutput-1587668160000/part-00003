The female builds a nest and lays a clutch of 10\u201350 eggs<ref name=\"Animal\" /> about two months later. The sex of the young depends on the temperature at which the eggs are incubated. Nests are typically excavated at least 50 yards from the water's edge to prevent them from being flooded and drowned. Incubation takes from 100 to 140 days, and hatchlings emerge in the early fall.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nashvillezoo.org/asturtle.htm | title=Nashville Zoo: Alligator Snapping Turtle | accessdate=March 26, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060221084138/http://www.nashvillezoo.org/asturtle.htm |archivedate = February 21, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThough their potential lifespans in the wild are unknown, alligator snapping turtles are believed to be capable of living to 200 years of age, but 80 to 120 is more likely.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gibbons|first=J.

Due to their potential size and specific needs, they do not make particularly good pets for any but the most experienced aquatic turtle keepers.<ref>[http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/cs-allisnapper.htm AST Care Sheet].

Retrieved on August 22, 2012.</ref>\n\nThey prefer to feed on live fish which they catch with their special technique, but will readily feed on other types of meat or leafy vegetables if offered. Hand feeding is dangerous. Extreme temperatures are known to affect the turtle's appetite and would result in the turtle refusing to feed until it has been remedied.\n\nDue to their sheer size, handling adult specimens can pose significant problems. Small turtles can be held by the sides of the shell with relative safety, but large individuals must be held by grasping the turtle's shell just behind the head and in front of the tail.\n\nDespite their reputation, alligator snapping turtles are typically not prone to biting. However, if provoked they are quite capable of delivering a powerful bite which can easily [[Amputation|amputate]] fingers or cause other significant injuries.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=1227 | title=NAS&nbsp;\u2014 Species FactSheet | accessdate=March 26, 2006}}</ref> Some U.S. states where alligator snapping turtles do not naturally occur (such as [[California]]) prohibit them from being kept as pets by residents.\n\n==Invasive species==\nSome alligator snapping turtles were released or escaped into waters of the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]] and [[Hungary]].
