After [[quality control]], sugarcane is washed, chopped, and shredded by revolving knives; the feedstock is fed to and extracted by a set of mill combinations to collect a juice, called [[Sugarcane juice|garapa]] in Brazil, that contain 10\u201315% sucrose, and [[bagasse]], the fiber residue. The main objective of the milling process is to extract the largest possible amount of sucrose from the cane, and a secondary but important objective is the production of bagasse with a low moisture content as boiler fuel, as bagasse is burned for electricity generation (see [[#Electricity generation from bagasse|below]]), allowing the plant to be self-sufficient in energy and to generate electricity for the local power grid.<ref name=\"SusDutch\"/>\nThe cane juice or garapa is then filtered and treated by chemicals and [[Pasteurization|pasteurize]]d. Before [[evaporation]], the juice is filtered once again, producing [[vinasse]], a fluid rich in organic compounds. The syrup resulting from evaporation is then [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] by [[crystallization]] producing a mixture of clear crystals surrounded by [[molasses]]. A [[centrifuge]] is used to separate the sugar from molasses, and the crystals are washed by addition of steam, after which the crystals are dried by an airflow. Upon cooling, sugar crystallizes out of the syrup.<ref name=\"SusDutch\"/> From this point, the sugar [[refining]] process continues to produce different grades of sugar, and the molasses continue a separate process to produce ethanol.\n\n==== Fermentation, distillation and dehydration ====\n{{See also|Ethanol fermentation|Azeotropic distillation}}\n\nThe resulting molasses are treated to become a sterilized molasse free of impurities, ready to be fermented. In the [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] process sugars are transformed into ethanol by addition of [[yeast (wine)|yeast]]. Fermentation time varies from four to twelve hours resulting in an alcohol content of 7-10% by total volume ([[degrees Gay-Lussac|\u00b0GL]]), called fermented wine. The yeast is recovered from this wine through a centrifuge. Making use of the different boiling points the alcohol in the fermented wine is separated from the main resting solid components.

In the agricultural sector, 35.98 GJ of energy are used to plant, maintain, and harvest one hectare (10,000 m2) of sugarcane for usable biofuel. This includes energy from numerous inputs, including nitrogen, phosphate, potassium oxide, lime, seed, herbicides, insecticides, labor and diesel fuel. The industrial sector, which includes the milling and refining sugarcane and the production of ethanol fuel, uses 3.63 GJ of energy and generates 155.57 GJ of energy per hectare of sugarcane plantation. Scientists estimate that the potential power generated from the cogeneration of bagasse could range from 1,000 to 9,000 MW, depending on harvest and technology factors. In Brazil, this is about 3% of the total energy needed. The burning of bagasse can generate 18 kilowatt-hours, or 64.7 MJ per Mg of sugarcane. Distillery facilities require about 45 MJ to operate, leaving a surplus energy supply of 19.3 MJ, or 5.4 kWh. In terms of distribution, researchers calculates sugarcane ethanol's transport energy requirement to be .44 GJ per cubic-meter, thus one hectare of land would require 2.82 GJ of energy for successful transport and distribution.  After taking all three sectors into account, the EROEI (Energy Return over Energy Invested) for sugarcane ethanol is about 8.<ref>De Oliveira, Marcelo E. Dias de, Burton E. Vaughan & Edward J.

According to Brazilian producers, ethanol can remain competitive if the price of oil does not fall below US$30 a barrel.<ref name=\"NYT100406\"/>\n\nBy 2008 consumption of ethanol fuel by the Brazilian fleet of light vehicles, as pure ethanol and in gasohol, is replacing gasoline at the rate of about 27,000 cubic meters per day, and by February 2008 the combined consumption of anhydrous and hydrated ethanol fuel surpassed 50 percent of the fuel that would be needed to run the light vehicle fleet on pure gasoline alone. Monthly consumption of anhydrous ethanol for the mandatory E25 blend, together with hydrous ethanol used by flex vehicles, reached 1.432 billion liters, while pure gasoline consumption was 1.411 billion liters.<ref name=\"ANP07_2008\"/><ref name=\"50consumo\"/> Despite this volumetric parity, when expressed in terms of energy equivalent ([[Tonne of oil equivalent|toe]]), sugarcane ethanol represented 17.6 percent of the country's total [[energy consumption]] by the transport sector in 2008, while gasoline represented 23.3 percent and diesel 49.2 percent.<ref name=BEN2009/>\n\nFor the first time since 2003 sales of hydrous ethanol fell in 2010, with a decrease of 8.5 percent as compared to 2009. Total consumption of both hydrous and anhydrous ethanol fell by 2.9 percent while gasoline consumption increased by 17.5 percent. Despite the reduction in ethanol consumption, total ethanol sales reached 22.2 billion liters while pure gasoline consumption was 22.7 billion liters, keeping the market share for each fuel close to 50 percent. The decrease in hydrous ethanol consumption was due mainly to high sugar prices in the international markets, which reached a 30-year high in 2010. This peak in sugar prices caused sugarcane processing plants to produce more sugar than ethanol, and as supply contracted, E100 prices increased to the point that several times during 2010 the price of hydrous ethanol was less than 30 percent cheaper than gasoline. Another factor that contributed to this shift was the increase sales of imported gasoline only vehicles that took place during 2010.<ref name=NYT061711/><ref name=Crisis01>{{cite web|url=http://unica.com.br/clipping/show.asp?cppCode=37BAD16D-EB23-4F9E-B13B-C7758232B52A#|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154719/http://unica.com.br/clipping/show.asp?cppCode=37BAD16D-EB23-4F9E-B13B-C7758232B52A|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-06|title=Combust\u00edvel mais barato e poluente|publisher=[[UNICA, Brazil]]|author=O Globo|language=Portuguese|date=2011-02-16|accessdate=2011-02-16|author-link = O Globo}}</ref><ref name=Crisis02>{{cite news|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/economia/consumo-de-etanol-no-brasil-cai-pela-1a-vez-desde-2003|title=Consumo de etanol no Brasil cai pela 1\u00aa vez desde 2003|work=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|agency=Reuters|language=Portuguese|date=2011-02-16|accessdate=2011-02-16|author-link=Reuters}}</ref>\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:#f2f2f4; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:15px; font-size:84%; width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n! rowspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#fff; width:23%;\"|[[File:Brazil Ethanol Price Ranking by State Oct2008 with titles.png|thumb|240px|center|Consumer price spread between [[E20 fuel|E25]] gasoline and [[Neat ethanol fuel|E100]] by state.

The average number workers with 3 or less school years in Brazil is 58.8%, while in the Southeast this percentage is 46.2%, in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast region]] is 76,4%.<ref name=\"MacedoCH12\"/> Therefore, earnings in the Center-South are not surprisingly higher than those in the North-Northeast for comparable levels of education.<ref name=\"SusDutch\"/> In 2005 sugarcane harvesting workers in the Center-South region received an average wage 58.7% higher than the average wage in the North-Northeast region.<ref name=\"MacedoCH12\"/> The main social problems are related to cane cutters which do most of the low-paid work related to ethanol production.<ref name=\"SusDutch\"/>\n\nThe total number of permanent employees in the sector fell by one-third between 1992 and 2003, in part due to the increasing reliance on mechanical harvesting, especially from the richer and more mature sugarcane producers of S\u00e3o Paulo state.

A key problem in working conditions is the high work load.

The assessment calls on governments for more open markets in biofuels and feedstocks in order to improve efficiency and lower costs.<ref name=\"OECDweb08\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/28/0,3343,en_2649_37401_41013916_1_1_1_1,00.html|title=Biofuel policies in OECD countries costly and ineffective, says report|author1=Directorate for Trade  |author2=Agriculture, OECD|publisher=[[OECD]]|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2008-08-01}}</ref>\n\nA study by the Brazilian research unit of the [[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas]] regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices.<ref name=\"FGV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fgv.br/fgvprojetos/arq/JUBRASILICO_34_5_18_28_11_2008.pdf |title=Fatores Determinantes dos Pre\u00e7os dos Alimentos: O Impacto dos Biocombust\u00edveis |language=Portuguese |date=November 2008 |publisher=[[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas]] |author=FGV Projetos |accessdate=2008-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319183537/http://www.fgv.br/fgvprojetos/arq/JUBRASILICO_34_5_18_28_11_2008.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-19 }} ''Most of the text, graphs and tables included in the report are presented in Portuguese and English.''</ref> concluded that the major driver behind the [[2007\u20132008 world food price crisis|2007\u20132008 rise in food prices]] was speculative activity on [[Futures exchange|futures markets]] under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks.

After [[quality control]], sugarcane is washed, chopped, and shredded by revolving knives; the feedstock is fed to and extracted by a set of mill combinations to collect a juice, called [[Sugarcane juice|garapa]] in Brazil, that contain 10\u201315% sucrose, and [[bagasse]], the fiber residue. The main objective of the milling process is to extract the largest possible amount of sucrose from the cane, and a secondary but important objective is the production of bagasse with a low moisture content as boiler fuel, as bagasse is burned for electricity generation (see [[#Electricity generation from bagasse|below]]), allowing the plant to be self-sufficient in energy and to generate electricity for the local power grid.<ref name=\"SusDutch\"/>\nThe cane juice or garapa is then filtered and treated by chemicals and [[Pasteurization|pasteurize]]d. Before [[evaporation]], the juice is filtered once again, producing [[vinasse]], a fluid rich in organic compounds. The syrup resulting from evaporation is then [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] by [[crystallization]] producing a mixture of clear crystals surrounded by [[molasses]]. A [[centrifuge]] is used to separate the sugar from molasses, and the crystals are washed by addition of steam, after which the crystals are dried by an airflow. Upon cooling, sugar crystallizes out of the syrup.<ref name=\"SusDutch\"/> From this point, the sugar [[refining]] process continues to produce different grades of sugar, and the molasses continue a separate process to produce ethanol.\n\n==== Fermentation, distillation and dehydration ====\n{{See also|Ethanol fermentation|Azeotropic distillation}}\n\nThe resulting molasses are treated to become a sterilized molasse free of impurities, ready to be fermented. In the [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] process sugars are transformed into ethanol by addition of [[yeast (wine)|yeast]]. Fermentation time varies from four to twelve hours resulting in an alcohol content of 7-10% by total volume ([[degrees Gay-Lussac|\u00b0GL]]), called fermented wine. The yeast is recovered from this wine through a centrifuge. Making use of the different boiling points the alcohol in the fermented wine is separated from the main resting solid components.

In the agricultural sector, 35.98 GJ of energy are used to plant, maintain, and harvest one hectare (10,000 m2) of sugarcane for usable biofuel. This includes energy from numerous inputs, including nitrogen, phosphate, potassium oxide, lime, seed, herbicides, insecticides, labor and diesel fuel. The industrial sector, which includes the milling and refining sugarcane and the production of ethanol fuel, uses 3.63 GJ of energy and generates 155.57 GJ of energy per hectare of sugarcane plantation. Scientists estimate that the potential power generated from the cogeneration of bagasse could range from 1,000 to 9,000 MW, depending on harvest and technology factors. In Brazil, this is about 3% of the total energy needed. The burning of bagasse can generate 18 kilowatt-hours, or 64.7 MJ per Mg of sugarcane. Distillery facilities require about 45 MJ to operate, leaving a surplus energy supply of 19.3 MJ, or 5.4 kWh. In terms of distribution, researchers calculates sugarcane ethanol's transport energy requirement to be .44 GJ per cubic-meter, thus one hectare of land would require 2.82 GJ of energy for successful transport and distribution.  After taking all three sectors into account, the EROEI (Energy Return over Energy Invested) for sugarcane ethanol is about 8.<ref>De Oliveira, Marcelo E. Dias de, Burton E. Vaughan & Edward J.

Despite the reduction in ethanol consumption, total ethanol sales reached 22.2 billion liters while pure gasoline consumption was 22.7 billion liters, keeping the market share for each fuel close to 50 percent. The decrease in hydrous ethanol consumption was due mainly to high sugar prices in the international markets, which reached a 30-year high in 2010. This peak in sugar prices caused sugarcane processing plants to produce more sugar than ethanol, and as supply contracted, E100 prices increased to the point that several times during 2010 the price of hydrous ethanol was less than 30 percent cheaper than gasoline.
