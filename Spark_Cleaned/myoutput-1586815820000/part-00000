The site covers an area of two square miles and comprises more than 200 nuclear facilities and more than 1,000 buildings.<ref>Sellafield Ltd, annual report 2017-2018, retrieved Sept 2019</ref> It is Europe's largest nuclear site and has the most diverse range of nuclear facilities in the world situated on a single site.<ref>Sellafield context plan, published May 2017 by assets.publishing.service.gov.uk, retrieved Sept 2019</ref>\n\nSellafield incorporates the UK's first generation [[nuclear reactor]]s and associated re-processing site at '''Windscale''', and the world's first nuclear power station to generate electricity on an industrial scale at '''Calder Hall'''. The UK's [[National Nuclear Laboratory]] has its Central Laboratory and headquarters on the site.\n\nOriginally built as a Royal Ordnance Factory in 1942, the site briefly passed into the ownership of [[Courtaulds]] for [[rayon]] manufacture following [[WW2]], but was re-acquired by the [[Ministry of Supply]] in 1947 for the production of [[plutonium]] for nuclear weapons, and was given the name \"Windscale Works\". Subsequent key developments include the building of Calder Hall nuclear power station, the [[b205|Magnox fuel reprocessing plant]], the prototype [[Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor]] (AGR) and the [[Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant]] (THORP).\n\nCurrent (2019) activities at the Sellafield site are primarily decommissioning of historic plants, and reprocessing of spent fuel from UK and international nuclear reactors which will completely cease when the Magnox fuel reprocessing plant closes in 2020.

Construction of the nuclear facilities commenced in September 1947 and the site was renamed Windscale Works. The building of the nuclear plant was a huge construction project, requiring a peak effort of 5,000 workers. The two air-cooled and open-circuit, [[graphite]]-moderated Windscale reactors (the \"[[Windscale Piles]]\") and the associated first generation reprocessing plant, producing the first British weapons grade [[plutonium-239]] were central to the UK nuclear weapons programme of the 1950s.\n\nWindscale Pile No. 1 became operational in October 1950, just over three years from the start of construction, and Pile No. 2 became operational in June 1951. Later in 1957 Pile 1 suffered a major accident; the [[Windscale fire]], the worst nuclear accident in UK history, ranked in severity at level 5 out of a possible 7 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].\n\n===Calder Hall power station===\n[[File:Calder Hall, Queen opening.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opening Calder Hall nuclear power station on 17 October 1956]]\nWith the creation of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) in 1954, ownership of Windscale Works passed to the UKAEA. The first of four [[Magnox]] reactors became operational in 1956 at Calder Hall, a site \nextension across the River Calder, and the whole site became known as Windscale and Calder Works.\n\n===British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL)===\nFollowing the break-up of the UKAEA into a research division (UKAEA) and a newly-created company for nuclear production [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd]] (BNFL) in 1971, a major part of the site was transferred to BNFL ownership and management. In 1981 BNFL's Windscale and Calder Works was renamed Sellafield as part of a major reorganisation of the site and there was a consolidation of management under one head of the entire BNFL Sellafield site. The remainder of the site remained in the hands of the UKAEA and was still called Windscale.<ref>Cassidy, Nick, and Patrick Green. 1993. ''Sellafield: The contaminated legacy''.

Construction of the nuclear facilities commenced in September 1947 and the site was renamed Windscale Works. The building of the nuclear plant was a huge construction project, requiring a peak effort of 5,000 workers. The two air-cooled and open-circuit, [[graphite]]-moderated Windscale reactors (the \"[[Windscale Piles]]\") and the associated first generation reprocessing plant, producing the first British weapons grade [[plutonium-239]] were central to the UK nuclear weapons programme of the 1950s.\n\nWindscale Pile No. 1 became operational in October 1950, just over three years from the start of construction, and Pile No. 2 became operational in June 1951. Later in 1957 Pile 1 suffered a major accident; the [[Windscale fire]], the worst nuclear accident in UK history, ranked in severity at level 5 out of a possible 7 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].\n\n===Calder Hall power station===\n[[File:Calder Hall, Queen opening.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opening Calder Hall nuclear power station on 17 October 1956]]\nWith the creation of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) in 1954, ownership of Windscale Works passed to the UKAEA. The first of four [[Magnox]] reactors became operational in 1956 at Calder Hall, a site \nextension across the River Calder, and the whole site became known as Windscale and Calder Works.\n\n===British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL)===\nFollowing the break-up of the UKAEA into a research division (UKAEA) and a newly-created company for nuclear production [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd]] (BNFL) in 1971, a major part of the site was transferred to BNFL ownership and management. In 1981 BNFL's Windscale and Calder Works was renamed Sellafield as part of a major reorganisation of the site and there was a consolidation of management under one head of the entire BNFL Sellafield site. The remainder of the site remained in the hands of the UKAEA and was still called Windscale.<ref>Cassidy, Nick, and Patrick Green. 1993. ''Sellafield: The contaminated legacy''.

sea, using a [[flocculation]] process to remove radioactivity from liquid effluent before discharge. Metals dissolved in acidic effluents were made to produce a metal hydroxide flocculant [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] following the addition of [[ammonium hydroxide]]. The suspension was then transferred to settling tanks where the precipitate would settle out, and the remaining clarified liquid, or [[supernate]], would be discharged to the [[Irish Sea]]. As an improvement to that process, in 1994 the Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant (EARP) became operational.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In EARP the effectiveness of the process is enhanced by the addition of reagents to remove the remaining soluble radioactive species. EARP was enhanced further in 2004 to further reduce the quantities of [[technetium-99]] released to the environment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treating a 50-year-old legacy of radioactive sludge waste |author=Ben Irons |work=Engineer Live |url=http://www.engineerlive.com/power-engineer/nuclear-power/14432/treating-a-50yearold-legacy-of-radioactive-sludge-waste.thtml |accessdate=21 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126051749/http://www.engineerlive.com/power-engineer/nuclear-power/14432/treating-a-50yearold-legacy-of-radioactive-sludge-waste.thtml |archivedate=26 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Radioactive waste stores===\nSellafield has a number of radioactive waste stores, mostly working on an interim basis while a [[deep geological repository]] plan is developed and implemented.\n\nThe stores include:\n<ref name=\"NDA-site-summary-2006\">{{cite report |url=http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&pageid=4007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110103707/http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/loader.cfm?url=%2Fcommonspot%2Fsecurity%2Fgetfile.cfm&pageid=4007 |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 November 2007 |title=Sellafield Site Summary \u2013 2006/07 Lifetime Plan (Rev.
