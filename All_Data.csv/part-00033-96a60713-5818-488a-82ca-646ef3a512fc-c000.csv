== Biography ==
===Childhood and education===
Tyra Kleen was born in Sweden to Swedish diplomat and author [[Fredrik Herman Rikard Kleen]] (1841–1923) and Maria Charlotte Amalia née Wattrang (1842–1929). She had two siblings; an older brother [[Nils Rikardsson af Kleen]] (1872–1965) and  sister [[Ingeborg Kleen]] (1870–1911). Due to the frequent absence of the parents, the children were primarily educated by their grandfather, marshall [[Nils Adolf Wattrang]], who died in 1890 when Kleen was 16 years old. 

Kleen studied painting in [[Karlsruhe]] between 1892 and 1893, at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts Munich]] 1894 and then at [[Académie Delécluse|Académie Delecluse]], [[Académie Colarossi]], [[Académie Julian]] and [[Académie Vitti]] between 1895 and 1897.<ref name=\"Månsson 2018\">{{Cite web|url=https://tidningenkulturen.se/arkiv/92-konst/konst-portratt/15784-tyra-kleen-en-konstnaerlig-kosmopolit|title=Tyra Kleen – en konstnärlig kosmopolit - Tidningen Kulturen|last=Månsson|first=Lena|website=tidningenkulturen.se|language=sv-se|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> She devoted her work mainly to drawing, etching and lithography, held her first exhibition in Paris in 1896 and made her debut in illustration in 1897.<ref name=\"Månsson 2018\" /> In Paris she illustrated the book ''Drömmer'' translated by her sister from the book ''Dreams'', written by the South-African author [[Olive Schreiner]]. Her figurative style was inspired by [[art nouveau]], [[jugendstil]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. During her years abroad with influences from artists such as Böcklin and Puvis de Chavannes and from [[Theosophy]], she picked up a continental symbolistic style, unique among Swedish artists.<ref>Walking in the footsteps of Tyra Kleen- a study over the Symbolist Artist's life in Paris and Rome. 1892-1908. Master thesis by Karin Ström Lehander. Dep. Art History, Uppsala University. no date.</ref>

As an adolescent, Kleen felt as though she was an outsider, not connected with her social surroundings. She filled this existential void not only with her professional ambitions but also with the theosophical-inspired world of oriental myths and rituals and tried to be part of it by dancing and drawing what she saw. Her cognitive, mental and emotional conceptions were inspired by [[feminism]], the \"[[New Woman]]\";  and by [[exotism]], especially the [[Theosophical mysticism]] of [[Annie Besant]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]. The latter founded the [[\"Orde van de Ster in het Oosten\"]] [https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orde_van_de_Ster_in_het_Oosten]  (a so-called mixed non-Masonic lodge), which became very popular in the Netherlands and  the Dutch East Indies.<ref>Messias verwachting in onze dagen, J.H. Bolt, Amersfoort, 1926</ref>

===Europe===
When she moved to Rome in 1898 because she was not accepted in Paris by the Theosophic movement, she joined a theosophical society in Rome and attended its meetings and lectures. She befriended persons like [[Anna Maria Roos]] and [[Mary and Jean Karadja Pascha]].

[[File:Tyra-Kleen-1912.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in 1912]]
She spent ten years in [[Rome]] as part of the contemporary cultural elite. She met Anders and Emma Zorn, Ellen Key, Carl Milles, Helena Nygren, Hjalmar Söderberg and Ottilia Adelborg; and later also went to live in [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]]. She traveled extensively, in 1910 to [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] and in 1919–1921 in [[Java]] and [[Bali]], where she studied dance, being inspired in Paris by the performances of [[Mata Hari]]. She exhibited her work in Berlin, [[Vienna]], [[Milan]], [[Rome]], Paris, [[London]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]].<ref>Karin Ström Lehander, Tyra Kleen- artist and woman at the fin de siècle.  in: Tyra Kleen, Her life and work rediscovered.Stockholm 2018, s. 50-51.</ref> She visited the [[Caribbean]] and the [[United States]] and organized an exhibition in [[New York City|New York]] in 1917. Kleen was very well equipped in organising and networking using contacts and relatives in the world of diplomacy, freemasonry, theosophy, feminism and the local magistry. She excelled at becoming intimate with people who could be useful for her career.

===Asia===
In 1919, after WWI, she traveled to Java and Bali on a Swedish cargo ship. In Solo ([[Surakarta]]), Kleen worked with [[Beata van Helsdingen-Schoevers]] to write an anthropological study on the ritual court dances of Solo. Both also participated in the dance lessons.[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beata_van_Helsdingen-Schoevers] Kleen felt that dancing not only involved making the right movements on the sound of music, but that it also involved the transition into an altered state of mind to become in harmony not only with oneself, but with the Universe.

Unfortunately, this project ended in July 1920 in turmoil due to clashing personalities, and van Helsdingen-Schoevers died 17 August 1920 of an unknown disease.<ref>Vivian van de Loo, \"Leven tussen Kunst en Krant, [[Beata van Helsdingen-Schoevers]],[[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beata_van_Helsdingen-Schoevers]] journaliste en declamatrice in Indië. KITLV Leiden 2004\". pp. 142–149.</ref> The project was finished in 1925 with help from \"Volkslectuur\" (the commission of folk literature), [[Mabel Fowler]] and miss Gobée, wife of the Head of the Office for Internal Affairs, titled \"The Serimpi and Bedojo Dances at the Court of Surakarta\", with 16 pages of text. In July 1925 there appeared a new edition with 30 pages of text. The coloured plates were reproductions made by the Topographic Service of Kleen's drawings. For everyone involved, but especially Kleen, the result was very disappointing, because she wanted to participate in this project in order to result in a standard reference work that could be presented worldwide.

When she arrived in Bali in 1920, she started a new project on the mudras, or ritual hand poses, of the Balinese Hindu priests with the assistance of the Rajah of [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]], Gusti Bagus Djilantik, whom she had met in Solo the year before, and of [[Piet de Kat Angelino]]. This was a turning point in her career because de Kat Angelino was able to explain to her the mudras and also encouraged the priests to cooperate. He was district-officer (controleur) of Gianjar and [[Klungklung]] for over a decade and had been collecting material on Balinese priests for years in his home in Gianjar. At his home, she could draw priests and their mudras. Their work together is presented in the book ''Mudras'', with text and illustrations by Kleen, who acknowledged that much of the technical information about the poses and ceremonies came from de Kat Angelino and later on from R.Ng. Poerbatjaraka. Kleen spent the whole of 1921 in Java, working on the material collected in Bali the year before. She exhibited her pictures of the priests at the Art Society in Batavia. Collaboration with de Kat Angelino continued and she met him in Amsterdam on her way home. With his help an exhibition was arranged at the Colonial Institute in Amsterdam. The exhibition was favorably reviewed by de Kat Angelino in the magazine [[Nederlandsch Indië, Oud en Nieuw |''Nederlandsch Indië, Oud en Nieuw'']].
What was the reaction  at that time in the Netherlands on her work in Bali?
[[Anne Hallema]], a Dutch journalist and art-criticus  wrote a critical and extensive article on the Mudra's which appeared Elseviers Geïllustreerd Maandschrift, Jaargang 34, 1924 pp.145-147. He disqualified her work as an artist but praiserd her for her scientific contribution. 
He ends his article with stating that we have to be grateful that this stranger from the land of Selma Lagerlöf toke the initiativ to study the mudra's of the Balinese priests in performing his Hinduïstic rituals. Specially the Indologists and Oriëtalists should be happy with the appearance of this publication.

Another crucial exhibition was ''Två vittberesta damer'' (Two Travelling Ladies) at [[Liljevalchs konsthall|Liljevalch's]] Public Art Gallery in Stockholm 1922, where she showed art and artifacts from [[Java]] and [[Bali]] together with Swedish photographer and author [[Ida Trotzig]] contributing works from [[Japan]]. This exhibition was the starting point for the \"Bali-fever\" in Sweden. Kleen's depictions of mudras were shown at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1923.

Besides ''Mudras'', Kleen published two other books about Bali: ''Ni-Si-Pleng, a story about black children written for white children'' (1924), and, seven years later, ''Tempeldanser och musikinstrument pa Bali'', printed in 300 numbered copies, translated in 1936 as ''The Temple Dances in Bali''.<ref>Elisabeth Lind: the pencil in the service of ethnographical research.p 91-133 in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered by Niclas Franzén and others, Sweden 2018</ref>

Kleen's study on the mudras, the exhibition in Amsterdam at the Colonial Institute and the publication of her books made her internationally known. For her scientific ethnographic work on Bali, Kleen was awarded the Johan August Wahlberg silver medal in April 1938, given to individuals who have \"promoted anthropological and geographical science through outstanding efforts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssag.se/om/stadgar-och-bestammelser/johan-august-wahlbergs-medaljfond/|title=SSAG {{!}} Svenska Sällskapet för Antropologi och Geografi {{!}} Johan August Wahlbergs medaljfond|website=ssag.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>

[[Walter Spies]] was the central figure in the circle of artists residing on the island in Ubud, Klungklung and Karangasem. He was considered to be the greatest expert on Balinese dance and drama. Together with the British dance critic [[Beryl de Zoete]], he wrote the standard 1938 work ''Dance and Drama in Bali''. Spies was jealous of the international success of Kleen{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and wrote a very critical nine-page review of the ''Temple Dances in Bali'' in the journal ''Djawa'' (1939). He complained, \"the text and the depictions are filled with so many mistakes, errors and incorrect statements that one must shake one's head.\" Spies claims that as an ethnographic document the book has no value.<ref>Elisabeth Lind, The pencil in the service of ethnographical research, etc. p. 131-132,</ref> As a result, there were nearly no references to the work of Kleen in any ethnographic periodicals or publications after this critical review. It is only in 1962 that [[C. Hooykaas]] in his article \"Saiva-Siddhanta in Java and Bali\"<ref>Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 118 (1962) no 3(Leiden 309-327</ref> supported the importance of the study on mudras by de Kat Angelino and Kleen.

Kleen contributed work to various European magazines, including ''Sluyters' Monthly'', ''Nederlandsch Indië Oud en Nieuw'', ''Ord och Bild'' and ''Inter-Ocean'', between 1920 and 1925<ref>Haks & Maris, Lexicon of foreign artists who visualized Indonesia. (1600-1950),Singapore 1995</ref> and influenced in this way the perception and expectations of foreign visitors to Bali. Furthermore, she influenced with her colourful, vivid and dynamic art-deco drawing style the development of painting by local artists in Bali, not in a one-way influence but more a kind of mutual influence.<ref>Bruce Granquist. Inventing art: The paintings of Batuan Bali. Satumata Press, 2012</ref> Mostly these local paintings were made for the touristic market and depicted daily life instead of exclusively being concerned with gods, demons and the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics. In this way, she took part in the marketing of \"the last paradise\". This also meant that she became associated with this type of magazine drawing instead of her more important  ethnographic publications.

===Egypt===
In 1926, Kleen visited Egypt to study the meanings of the different hand and foot movements depicted in the art, which resulted in her last publication in 1946 of the book ''Solens Son'' about pharaoh [[Akhenaten|Echnaton]].

===Legacy===
[[File:Tyra-Kleen.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in the 1940s]]
Kleen left her collections to the Swedish House of Nobility on the condition that the archive would not be opened until 50 years after her death.[https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling] In 2001, the paintings, lithographs, drawings, diaries and sketches were brought out and the private part of her collection was brought home to Valinge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling/|title=Tyra Kleens samling : Riddarhuset|website=www.riddarhuset.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> Kleen is represented with art at, for instance, [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-34.zetcom.ch/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=24094&viewType=detailView|title=Göteborgs konstmuseum {{!}} Orientalisk parfym|website=emp-web-34.zetcom.ch|language=sv|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> and [[Nationalmuseum]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-84.zetcom.ch/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=artist&objectId=15325&viewType=detailView|title=Nationalmuseum - Tyra Kleen|website=emp-web-84.zetcom.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> in Stockholm.

From her diaries and letters it is clear that Kleen was a colourful and exciting androgynous<ref name=\":0\" /> personality, besides being an extremely proficient artist.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Her whole life she stayed single, but she had several romances and received many offers of marriage. She loved her freedom and hated to be dominated by men or women. She was very ambitious and particular in traveling and doing business. She was very productive and could work for hours, days and weeks to get results. On the one hand she could be charming and kind, but she could switch quickly from friendship to hostility. She had years-long correspondences with her feminist friends, but could drop people when she considered them no longer useful for her career or ambitions.<ref>Kerstin Gullstrand Hermelin, Tyra Kleen and her background, in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered, Stockholm 2018</ref> Kleen was hardened by her childhood and refusing to give up her freedom for love.<ref>Niklas Franzén, Tyra Kleen as a symbolist,s.72 in Tyra Kleen, etc. Stockholm 2018</ref><ref name=\":0\">Patrik Storn.

Besides ''Mudras'', Kleen published two other books about Bali: ''Ni-Si-Pleng, a story about black children written for white children'' (1924), and, seven years later, ''Tempeldanser och musikinstrument pa Bali'', printed in 300 numbered copies, translated in 1936 as ''The Temple Dances in Bali''.<ref>Elisabeth Lind: the pencil in the service of ethnographical research.p 91-133 in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered by Niclas Franzén and others, Sweden 2018</ref>

Kleen's study on the mudras, the exhibition in Amsterdam at the Colonial Institute and the publication of her books made her internationally known. For her scientific ethnographic work on Bali, Kleen was awarded the Johan August Wahlberg silver medal in April 1938, given to individuals who have \"promoted anthropological and geographical science through outstanding efforts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssag.se/om/stadgar-och-bestammelser/johan-august-wahlbergs-medaljfond/|title=SSAG {{!}} Svenska Sällskapet för Antropologi och Geografi {{!}} Johan August Wahlbergs medaljfond|website=ssag.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>

[[Walter Spies]] was the central figure in the circle of artists residing on the island in Ubud, Klungklung and Karangasem. He was considered to be the greatest expert on Balinese dance and drama. Together with the British dance critic [[Beryl de Zoete]], he wrote the standard 1938 work ''Dance and Drama in Bali''. Spies was jealous of the international success of Kleen{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and wrote a very critical nine-page review of the ''Temple Dances in Bali'' in the journal ''Djawa'' (1939). He complained, \"the text and the depictions are filled with so many mistakes, errors and incorrect statements that one must shake one's head.\" Spies claims that as an ethnographic document the book has no value.<ref>Elisabeth Lind, The pencil in the service of ethnographical research, etc. p. 131-132,</ref> As a result, there were nearly no references to the work of Kleen in any ethnographic periodicals or publications after this critical review. It is only in 1962 that [[C. Hooykaas]] in his article \"Saiva-Siddhanta in Java and Bali\"<ref>Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 118 (1962) no 3(Leiden 309-327</ref> supported the importance of the study on mudras by de Kat Angelino and Kleen.

Kleen contributed work to various European magazines, including ''Sluyters' Monthly'', ''Nederlandsch Indië Oud en Nieuw'', ''Ord och Bild'' and ''Inter-Ocean'', between 1920 and 1925<ref>Haks & Maris, Lexicon of foreign artists who visualized Indonesia. (1600-1950),Singapore 1995</ref> and influenced in this way the perception and expectations of foreign visitors to Bali. Furthermore, she influenced with her colourful, vivid and dynamic art-deco drawing style the development of painting by local artists in Bali, not in a one-way influence but more a kind of mutual influence.<ref>Bruce Granquist. Inventing art: The paintings of Batuan Bali. Satumata Press, 2012</ref> Mostly these local paintings were made for the touristic market and depicted daily life instead of exclusively being concerned with gods, demons and the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics. In this way, she took part in the marketing of \"the last paradise\". This also meant that she became associated with this type of magazine drawing instead of her more important  ethnographic publications.

===Egypt===
In 1926, Kleen visited Egypt to study the meanings of the different hand and foot movements depicted in the art, which resulted in her last publication in 1946 of the book ''Solens Son'' about pharaoh [[Akhenaten|Echnaton]].

===Legacy===
[[File:Tyra-Kleen.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in the 1940s]]
Kleen left her collections to the Swedish House of Nobility on the condition that the archive would not be opened until 50 years after her death.[https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling] In 2001, the paintings, lithographs, drawings, diaries and sketches were brought out and the private part of her collection was brought home to Valinge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling/|title=Tyra Kleens samling : Riddarhuset|website=www.riddarhuset.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> Kleen is represented with art at, for instance, [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-34.zetcom.ch/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=24094&viewType=detailView|title=Göteborgs konstmuseum {{!}} Orientalisk parfym|website=emp-web-34.zetcom.ch|language=sv|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> and [[Nationalmuseum]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-84.zetcom.ch/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=artist&objectId=15325&viewType=detailView|title=Nationalmuseum - Tyra Kleen|website=emp-web-84.zetcom.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> in Stockholm.

From her diaries and letters it is clear that Kleen was a colourful and exciting androgynous<ref name=\":0\" /> personality, besides being an extremely proficient artist.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Her whole life she stayed single, but she had several romances and received many offers of marriage. She loved her freedom and hated to be dominated by men or women. She was very ambitious and particular in traveling and doing business. She was very productive and could work for hours, days and weeks to get results. On the one hand she could be charming and kind, but she could switch quickly from friendship to hostility. She had years-long correspondences with her feminist friends, but could drop people when she considered them no longer useful for her career or ambitions.<ref>Kerstin Gullstrand Hermelin, Tyra Kleen and her background, in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered, Stockholm 2018</ref> Kleen was hardened by her childhood and refusing to give up her freedom for love.<ref>Niklas Franzén, Tyra Kleen as a symbolist,s.72 in Tyra Kleen, etc. Stockholm 2018</ref><ref name=\":0\">Patrik Storn.

The [[Thiel Gallery]] in Stockholm showed the exhibition \"Tyra Kleen: Artist, Vagabond, Adventuress\" in summer 2018. In their catalogue they state: ''\"''Tyra Kleen fought against the obstacles to women artists.

The '''1989 FA Charity Shield''' (also known as the '''[[Wellpark Brewery|Tennent's]] FA Charity Shield''' for sponsorship reasons) was the 67th [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]], an annual English [[association football|football]] match played between the winners of the previous season's [[The Football League|Football League]] and [[FA Cup]]. It was held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 12 August 1989. The match was contested by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], champions of the [[1988–89 Football League]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[1989 FA Cup Final|final]] of the [[1988–89 FA Cup]]. Watched by a crowd of 63,149, Liverpool won the match 1–0.

This was Arsenal's 10th Shield appearance and Liverpool's 14th. The two clubs had met in the [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|last game of the previous season]], in a title decider at [[Anfield]] which Arsenal won 2–0 with a late goal from [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]]. Both clubs also faced each other in the [[Makita International Tournament]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] the previous month; [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] won the match 1–0. Journalists previewing the game argued this year's Shield had lost its spectacle given Liverpool's recent successes in the event as well as the prospect of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] beating Liverpool for a third time.

New signing [[Glenn Hysén]] made his competitive debut for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Ian Rush]] started ahead of fellow striker [[John Aldridge]]. For [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Gus Caesar]] replaced [[Steve Bould]] in the starting team. The only goal of the match came in the first half – a long ball from [[Barry Venison]] floated around the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] defence and found [[Peter Beardsley]] in the penalty area to score. Afterwards [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] spoke of his delight at his team's performance and the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was complimentary of his opponents.

==Background==
The [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] was founded in 1908 as a successor to the [[Sheriff of London Charity Shield]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Abandonment of the Sheriff Shield |page=11 |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=19 April 1908}}</ref> It was a contest between the respective champions of the [[The Football League|Football League]] and [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], which then became an event for select teams of amateur and professional players by 1913.<ref>{{cite news |title=The F.A.

This was Arsenal's first appearance in the Charity Shield in 10 years; prior to the game they had won seven Shields ([[1930 FA Charity Shield|1930]], [[1931 FA Charity Shield|1931]], [[1933 FA Charity Shield|1933]], [[1934 FA Charity Shield|1934]], [[1938 FA Charity Shield|1938]], [[1948 FA Charity Shield|1948]] and [[1953 FA Charity Shield|1953]]), and lost three ([[1935 FA Charity Shield|1935]], [[1936 FA Charity Shield|1936]] and [[1979 FA Charity Shield|1979]]). By contrast, Liverpool had won seven previous Shields outright ([[1966 FA Charity Shield|1966]], [[1974 FA Charity Shield|1974]], [[1976 FA Charity Shield|1976]], [[1979 FA Charity Shield|1979]], [[1980 FA Charity Shield|1980]], [[1982 FA Charity Shield|1982]] and [[1988 FA Charity Shield|1988]]), shared two with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] ([[1965 FA Charity Shield|1965]] and [[1977 FA Charity Shield|1977]]) and one apiece with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] ([[1986 FA Charity Shield|1986]]) and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] ([[1964 FA Charity Shield|1984]]). The club was runners-up in three Shields ([[1971 FA Charity Shield|1971]], [[1983 FA Charity Shield|1983]] and [[1984 FA Charity Shield|1984]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/community-shield/honours |title=English Community Shield: Honours |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=21 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713124226/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/community-shield/honours |archivedate=13 July 2014 }}</ref>

Liverpool striker [[Ian Rush]], who in the previous season sustained a knee injury and was treated for [[Herpes zoster|shingles]] and [[hepatitis]], said before the match: \"I'm in great shape.

Liverpool continued to dominate proceedings in the second half; ''[[The Observer]]'' football correspondent Frank McGhee noted Arsenal's \"obvious need for a more adventurous approach.\"<ref name=\"tos\"/> The club's fans demanded Marwood's introduction to the match, and in the 58th minute the player came on for Caesar.<ref name=\"str\"/> This meant Arsenal's formation was tweaked to 4–4–2, with a [[flat back four]] defence.<ref name=\"str\"/> Arsenal found it hard to contain the Liverpool attack; Lukic saved an effort from Beardsley one-handed, but only could turn the ball out for a corner.<ref name=\"str\"/> A pass by [[Ronnie Whelan]] managed to split the Arsenal defence and find Nicol; Winterburn however put an end to the move with a tackle.<ref name=\"str\"/> [[David Burrows (footballer)|David Burrows]]'s attempt on goal was blocked by O'Leary later on and Lukic did enough to save Rush's shot with his legs.<ref name=\"str\"/>

The '''1989 FA Charity Shield''' (also known as the '''[[Wellpark Brewery|Tennent's]] FA Charity Shield''' for sponsorship reasons) was the 67th [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]], an annual English [[association football|football]] match played between the winners of the previous season's [[The Football League|Football League]] and [[FA Cup]]. It was held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 12 August 1989. The match was contested by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], champions of the [[1988–89 Football League]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[1989 FA Cup Final|final]] of the [[1988–89 FA Cup]]. Watched by a crowd of 63,149, Liverpool won the match 1–0.

This was Arsenal's 10th Shield appearance and Liverpool's 14th. The two clubs had met in the [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|last game of the previous season]], in a title decider at [[Anfield]] which Arsenal won 2–0 with a late goal from [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]]. Both clubs also faced each other in the [[Makita International Tournament]] at Wembley the previous month; Arsenal won the match 1–0. Journalists previewing the game argued this year's Shield had lost its spectacle given Liverpool's recent successes in the event as well as the prospect of Arsenal beating Liverpool for a third time.

New signing [[Glenn Hysén]] made his competitive debut for Liverpool and [[Ian Rush]] started ahead of fellow striker [[John Aldridge]]. For Arsenal, [[Gus Caesar]] replaced [[Steve Bould]] in the starting team. The only goal of the match came in the first half – a long ball from [[Barry Venison]] floated around the Arsenal defence and found [[Peter Beardsley]] in the penalty area to score. Afterwards Liverpool manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] spoke of his delight at his team's performance and the Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was complimentary of his opponents.

==Background==
The [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] was founded in 1908 as a successor to the [[Sheriff of London Charity Shield]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Abandonment of the Sheriff Shield |page=11 |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=19 April 1908}}</ref> It was a contest between the respective champions of the [[The Football League|Football League]] and [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], which then became an event for select teams of amateur and professional players by 1913.<ref>{{cite news |title=The F.A. Charity Shield |page=10 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=7 October 1913}}</ref> In 1921, it was played between the Football League champions and [[FA Cup]] winners for the first time; this became standard practise from 1930.<ref>{{cite news |title=The FA Community Shield history |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/news/team-news/archive/2011/august/community-shield-2011/the-shield-from-the-beginning |first=Peter |last=Ferguson |work=mcfc.co.uk |publisher=Manchester City Football Club |date=4 August 2011 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref> [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] acted as the host of the Shield from 1974.<ref>{{cite news|title=The FA Community Shield history |url=http://www.thefa.com/fa-community-shield/more/history |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=3 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hthw8Bhx?url=http://www.thefa.com/fa-community-shield/more/history |archivedate=6 July 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>

This was Arsenal's first appearance in the Charity Shield in 10 years; prior to the game they had won seven Shields ([[1930 FA Charity Shield|1930]], [[1931 FA Charity Shield|1931]], [[1933 FA Charity Shield|1933]], [[1934 FA Charity Shield|1934]], [[1938 FA Charity Shield|1938]], [[1948 FA Charity Shield|1948]] and [[1953 FA Charity Shield|1953]]), and lost three ([[1935 FA Charity Shield|1935]], [[1936 FA Charity Shield|1936]] and [[1979 FA Charity Shield|1979]]). By contrast, Liverpool had won seven previous Shields outright ([[1966 FA Charity Shield|1966]], [[1974 FA Charity Shield|1974]], [[1976 FA Charity Shield|1976]], [[1979 FA Charity Shield|1979]], [[1980 FA Charity Shield|1980]], [[1982 FA Charity Shield|1982]] and [[1988 FA Charity Shield|1988]]), shared two with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] ([[1965 FA Charity Shield|1965]] and [[1977 FA Charity Shield|1977]]) and one apiece with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] ([[1986 FA Charity Shield|1986]]) and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] ([[1964 FA Charity Shield|1984]]). The club was runners-up in three Shields ([[1971 FA Charity Shield|1971]], [[1983 FA Charity Shield|1983]] and [[1984 FA Charity Shield|1984]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/community-shield/honours |title=English Community Shield: Honours |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=21 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713124226/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/community-shield/honours |archivedate=13 July 2014 }}</ref>

==Pre-match==
This was the second time in a fortnight that Arsenal and Liverpool had played each other; at the end of July, the two teams competed in the [[Makita International Tournament]] at Wembley.<ref name=\"gup\">{{cite news |title=Arsenal confident of hat-trick |first=David |last=Lacey |page=18 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=12 August 1989}}</ref> Arsenal won the game by a single goal to win the tournament and then on their pre-season travels beat Argentinian champions [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]].<ref name=\"gup\"/> The spectacle of the Charity Shield was lost on certain football journalists previewing the match, because of Liverpool's recent successes in the Shield as well as the prospect of Arsenal beating Liverpool for a third time in succession.<ref name=\"ttp\">{{cite news |title=Charity's position overtaken |first=Stuart |last=Jones |page=41 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=12 August 1989}}</ref> David Lacey wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' of 12 August 1989: \"The FA Charity Shield is now more of a pre-season finale than a pipe opener for the main event,\"<ref name=\"gup\"/> and Stuart Jones of ''[[The Times]]'' went further in his assessment of its decline: 
{{blockquote|Whereas it was once an eagerly-awaited showpiece, it resembles in the modern age little more than another public training exercise for sides who are increasingly being invited to practise for the season in more lucrative and prestigious events on foreign fields.<ref name=\"ttp\"/>}}

Liverpool striker [[Ian Rush]], who in the previous season sustained a knee injury and was treated for [[Herpes zoster|shingles]] and [[hepatitis]], said before the match: \"I'm in great shape. Fitter than I have been since I came back from Italy.\"<ref name=\"dmp\">{{cite news |title=Rush: I'm still King Goal |first=Ted |last=Macauley |pages=22–23 |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=12 August 1989}}</ref>

==Match==
===Team selection===
Arsenal was without injured defender [[Steve Bould]], but [[Nigel Winterburn]] returned to full action, as did [[Brian Marwood]] – he recovered from a successful [[Achilles tendon]] operation.<ref name=\"gup\"/> Manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] deployed a [[Formation (association football)#5.E2.80.933.E2.80.932|5–3–2]] formation; [[Gus Caesar]] was brought into the defence to replace Bould.<ref name=\"str\"/>

Liverpool had no injury concerns for the game other than long-term absentee [[Gary Gillespie]];<ref name=\"str\"/> New signing [[Glenn Hysén]] made his competitive debut for the club and striker [[John Aldridge]] was named on the substitutes bench; manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] lined the team up in a [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]] formation.<ref name=\"str\"/> [[Alan Hansen]], who had missed Liverpool's final nine matches of the previous season, was restored as captain.<ref name=\"ttr\">{{cite news |title=Beardsley shows no charity |first=Stuart |last=Jones |page=22 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=14 August 1989}}</ref>

===Summary===
Liverpool created the first chance of the game in the 20th minute. A pass from [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] sent [[Steve Nicol]] clear to shoot, but his effort saw the ball roll wide of the far post.<ref name=\"tos\">{{cite news |title=Liverpool back with a vengeance |first=Frank |last=McGhee |page=20 |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=13 August 1989}}</ref> Liverpool created a further opportunity six minutes after – from a free-kick delivered by Barnes on the left, Rush managed to outjump his marker and head the ball in the direction of the Arsenal goal. It however hit the near post and rebounded in the direction of Arsenal goalkeeper [[John Lukic]].<ref name=\"tos\"/> Minutes after the half-hour mark, Liverpool scored the opening goal – a long ball from [[Barry Venison]] went behind the Arsenal defence and reached [[Peter Beardsley]]. Unimpeded, he controlled the ball and shot it with his right foot to score.<ref name=\"str\"/> Arsenal's [[Kevin Richardson (footballer)|Kevin Richardson]] missed a chance to level the scoreline after good play by [[Lee Dixon]]; from outside the penalty box he scuffed his shot and the ball went over the crossbar.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Davies, Barry (presenter), Motson, John (commentator) |title=Match of the Day |time=22:10:00 pm to 23:00:00 pm |publisher=BBC |medium=Television production |date=12 August 1989}} See also [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B9-rkAhUPk#t=878 YouTube] footage.</ref>

Liverpool continued to dominate proceedings in the second half; ''[[The Observer]]'' football correspondent Frank McGhee noted Arsenal's \"obvious need for a more adventurous approach.\"<ref name=\"tos\"/> The club's fans demanded Marwood's introduction to the match, and in the 58th minute the player came on for Caesar.<ref name=\"str\"/> This meant Arsenal's formation was tweaked to 4–4–2, with a [[flat back four]] defence.<ref name=\"str\"/> Arsenal found it hard to contain the Liverpool attack; Lukic saved an effort from Beardsley one-handed, but only could turn the ball out for a corner.<ref name=\"str\"/> A pass by [[Ronnie Whelan]] managed to split the Arsenal defence and find Nicol; Winterburn however put an end to the move with a tackle.<ref name=\"str\"/> [[David Burrows (footballer)|David Burrows]]'s attempt on goal was blocked by O'Leary later on and Lukic did enough to save Rush's shot with his legs.<ref name=\"str\"/>

The '''Hay Bridge''' is a [[road bridge]] that carries the [[Cobb Highway]] across the [[Murrumbidgee River]] at [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]], in the [[Hay Shire]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The current bridge is the second bridge located in Hay that crosses the Murrumbidgee; the first bridge was in operation from 1873 until 1973; the second and current bridge has operated since 1973.

== Current bridge ==
The current Hay Bridge is a six-[[Span (architecture)|span]], [[reinforced concrete]] and steel [[box girder]] structure supported on steel piles and slender concrete piers. It has an overall length of {{convert|638|ft|m|0|order=flip}} with two {{convert|97|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans and four {{convert|105|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans, and is {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}} between kerbs. A {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=mid|order=flip|spell=on|-wide}} [[footway]] has been provided for pedestrian use.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

Each box girder is made up of five cells each {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} wide and {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} high. The base and walls of each cell are steel plates and the reinforced concrete deck forms the top section. A feature of the design is the cantilever construction of the girders. This allows a greater distance between piers than a simply supported span design.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

Hay is located on the Western Plains where the clay and silt deposit can be up to {{convert|1500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in depth. Due to the complete absence of rock in this deposit, {{convert|10|x|10|in|cm|0|order=flip}} in rolled \"H\" section steel piles have been used for the [[Foundation (construction)|foundations]]. These vary from {{convert|51|to|81|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

[[Coffer dam]]s of steel sheet piling were constructed in the river to enable the construction of the two pile caps and the lower portions of the two piers in the river. The steel girders were manufactured at Sydney in pairs {{convert|15|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, transported by road to Hay and bolted together after having been placed in position on falsework. The longest sections handled were {{convert|65|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, end to end, and each weighed {{convert|24|ST|t|0|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

The bridge was designed by Gordon Bull and Associates, Consulting Engineers and was constructed by contract to and under the supervision of the Department by Central Constructions Pty Ltd of New South Wales. The approaches were designed and constructed by the Department. The total cost of the bridge and approaches was {{AUD}}890,000. The completion of this bridge by the Department, together with the channelisation of the intersection of State Highways Nos 14 and 21 immediately south of the bridge and the reconstruction of Lachlan Street, State Highway No. 21, Cobb Highway by Hay Shire Council, immediately north of the bridge, ensured a smoother flow of traffic through the town of Hay.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

The bridge was opened by the Honourable [[Harry Jago]], the NSW Assistant Minister for Highways, on {{start date|1973|06|08|df=y}}, the same day as he also opened a replacement bridge across the Murrumbidgee River at {{NSWcity|Balranald}}, located {{convert|80|mi|km|0|order=flip}} west.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

The former Hay Bridge was a [[swing bridge]] that carried the Cobb Highway across the Murrumbidgee River at Hay, New South Wales, from 1873 to 1973.

The bridge consisted of two fixed and two swing spans. It was of a [[lattice girder]] design, with timber decking. The drum was a composite of cast and wrought iron that was carried on the centre pier. The opening of the bridge was operated by hand.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/about/environment/protecting-heritage/moveable-span-bridge-study-volume-2-bascule-and-swing-span-bridges-part-2.pdf |title=Volume 2: Bascule and Swing Span Bridges - Movable Span Bridge Study |author=[[GHD Group]] |date=n.d. |website=[[Roads and Maritime Services]] |pages=144, 147, 148, 149 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=7 April 2020 }}</ref> The bridge was opened to allow [[List of Murray–Darling steamboats|riverboats]] to pass the bridge. 

The swing spans were each of {{convert|60|ft|m|1|order=flip}} in length. The swinging spans turned on a pier in the centre of the river. The lower portion of the central pier was cast iron and {{convert|13|ft|m|1|order=flip}} in diameter; it continued {{convert|20|ft|m|1|order=flip}} below the bed of the river. The upper portion of the central pier was wrought iron, {{convert|12|ft|m|1|order=flip}} in diameter, and {{convert|29|ft|m|1|order=flip}} in height, with an ornamental moulding on top; within this was the iron rack on which a pinion gear allowed the swing span to the opened by one person. The pivot shaft was {{convert|8|ft|m|1|order=flip}} long and {{convert|8|in|cm|1|order=flip}} in diameter. The upper part of the central pier was fitted with adjusting screws to regulate weights, and carried the gearing and platform used to turn the bridge.<ref name=\":1\" />

The piers for the side spans each consisted of a pair of  cylinders, each {{convert|6|ft|m|1|order=flip}} in diameter of cast and wrought iron. All the piers were filled with brickwork and concrete and braced together with iron rivets. The piers of the side span had  adjusting screws for equalising the heights of swing and fixed spans. The roadway of side spans was {{convert|17|ft|m|1|order=flip}} wide, and over swing spans was {{convert|15|ft|m|1|order=flip}} to allow for wrought-iron cantilevers to be accommodated.<ref name=\":1\" /> 

The contractors for the ironwork were [[Peter Nicol Russell|P. N. Russell and Co.]], and the sinking and fixing of the piers was by the [[New South Wales Government]] under Mr K. A. Franklin.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13345068|title=THE PREMIER AT HAY.|date=1874-09-08|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date=8 April 2020 |pages=5 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref> P.

The '''Hay Bridge''' is a [[road bridge]] that carries the [[Cobb Highway]] across the [[Murrumbidgee River]] at [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]], in the [[Hay Shire]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The current bridge is the second bridge located in Hay that crosses the Murrumbidgee; the first bridge was in operation from 1873 until 1973; the second and current bridge has operated since 1973.

== Current bridge ==
The current Hay Bridge is a six-[[Span (architecture)|span]], [[reinforced concrete]] and steel [[box girder]] structure supported on steel piles and slender concrete piers. It has an overall length of {{convert|638|ft|m|0|order=flip}} with two {{convert|97|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans and four {{convert|105|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans, and is {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}} between kerbs. A {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=mid|order=flip|spell=on|-wide}} [[footway]] has been provided for pedestrian use.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

Each box girder is made up of five cells each {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} wide and {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} high. The base and walls of each cell are steel plates and the reinforced concrete deck forms the top section. A feature of the design is the cantilever construction of the girders. This allows a greater distance between piers than a simply supported span design.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

Hay is located on the Western Plains where the clay and silt deposit can be up to {{convert|1500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in depth. Due to the complete absence of rock in this deposit, {{convert|10|x|10|in|cm|0|order=flip}} in rolled \"H\" section steel piles have been used for the [[Foundation (construction)|foundations]]. These vary from {{convert|51|to|81|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

[[Coffer dam]]s of steel sheet piling were constructed in the river to enable the construction of the two pile caps and the lower portions of the two piers in the river. The steel girders were manufactured at Sydney in pairs {{convert|15|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, transported by road to Hay and bolted together after having been placed in position on falsework. The longest sections handled were {{convert|65|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, end to end, and each weighed {{convert|24|ST|t|0|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

The bridge was designed by Gordon Bull and Associates, Consulting Engineers and was constructed by contract to and under the supervision of the Department by Central Constructions Pty Ltd of New South Wales. The approaches were designed and constructed by the Department. The total cost of the bridge and approaches was {{AUD}}890,000. The completion of this bridge by the Department, together with the channelisation of the intersection of State Highways Nos 14 and 21 immediately south of the bridge and the reconstruction of Lachlan Street, State Highway No. 21, Cobb Highway by Hay Shire Council, immediately north of the bridge, ensured a smoother flow of traffic through the town of Hay.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

The bridge was opened by the Honourable [[Harry Jago]], the NSW Assistant Minister for Highways, on {{start date|1973|06|08|df=y}}, the same day as he also opened a replacement bridge across the Murrumbidgee River at {{NSWcity|Balranald}}, located {{convert|80|mi|km|0|order=flip}} west.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>

The former Hay Bridge was a [[swing bridge]] that carried the Cobb Highway across the Murrumbidgee River at Hay, New South Wales, from 1873 to 1973.

The bridge consisted of two fixed and two swing spans. It was of a [[lattice girder]] design, with timber decking  The drum was a composite of cast and wrought iron that was carried on the centre pier. The opening of the bridge was operated by hand.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/about/environment/protecting-heritage/moveable-span-bridge-study-volume-2-bascule-and-swing-span-bridges-part-2.pdf |title=Volume 2: Bascule and Swing Span Bridges - Movable Span Bridge Study |author=[[GHD Group]] |date=n.d. |website=[[Roads and Maritime Services]] |pages=144, 147, 148, 149 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=7 April 2020 }}</ref> The bridge was opened to allow [[List of Murray–Darling steamboats|riverboats]] to pass the bridge. 

The swing spans were each of {{convert|60|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length. The swinging spans turned on a pier in the centre of the river. The lower portion of the central pier was cast iron and {{convert|13|ft|m|1|order=flip}} in diameter; it continued {{convert|20|ft|m|1|order=flip}} below the bed of the river. The upper portion of the central pier was wrought iron, {{convert|12|ft|m|1|order=flip}} in diameter, and {{convert|29|ft|m|1|order=flip}} in height, with an ornamental moulding on top; within this was the iron rack on which a pinion gear allowed the swing span to the opened by one person. The pivot shaft was {{convert|8|ft|m|1|order=flip}} long and {{convert|8|in|cm|1|order=flip}} in diameter. The upper part of the central pier was fitted with adjusting screws to regulate weights, and carried the gearing and platform used to turn the bridge.<ref name=\":1\" />

The piers for the side spans each consisted of a pair of  cylinders, each {{convert|6|ft|m|1|order=flip}} in diameter of cast and wrought iron. All the piers were filled with brickwork and concrete and braced together with iron rivets. The piers of the side span had  adjusting screws for equalising the heights of swing and fixed spans. The roadway of side spans was {{convert|17|ft|m|1|order=flip}} wide, and over swing spans was {{convert|15|ft|m|1|order=flip}} to allow for wrought-iron cantilevers to be accommodated.<ref name=\":1\" /> 

The contractors for the ironwork were [[Peter Nicol Russell|P. N. Russell and Co.]], and the sinking and fixing of the piers was by the [[New South Wales Government]] under Mr K. A. Franklin.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13345068|title=THE PREMIER AT HAY.|date=1874-09-08|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date=8 April 2020 |pages=5 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref> P.

'''William Pitt Fessenden''' (October 16, 1806{{spaced ndash}}September 8, 1869) was an [[Politics of the United States|American politician]] from the U.S. state of [[Maine]]. Fessenden was a [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] (later a [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) and member of the [[List of United States political families#The Fessendens|Fessenden political family]]. He served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] before becoming [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]].

A lawyer, he was a leading antislavery Whig in Maine; in Congress, he fought the [[Slave Power]] (the plantation owners who controlled southern states). He built an antislavery coalition in the state legislature that elected him to the U.S. Senate; it became Maine's Republican organization. In the Senate, Fessenden played a central role in the debates on Kansas, denouncing the expansion of slavery. He led [[Radical Republicans]]  in attacking Democrats [[Stephen Douglas]], [[Franklin Pierce]], and [[James Buchanan]]. Fessenden's speeches were read widely, influencing Republicans such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] and building support for  Lincoln's 1860 Republican presidential nomination.  During the war, Senator Fessenden helped shape the Union's taxation and financial policies. He moderated his earlier radicalism, and supported Lincoln against the Radicals, becoming Lincoln's Treasury Secretary.<ref>Landis (2008)</ref> After the war, Fessenden was back in the Senate, as chair of the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], which established terms for resuming congressional representation for the southern states, and which drafted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  Later, Fessenden provided critical support that prevented Senate conviction of President [[Andrew Johnson]], who had been impeached by the House. He was the first Republican Senator to ring out \"...''not guilty''\" followed by six other Republican Senators resulting in the acquittal of President Johnson.

He is the only person to have three streets in Portland named for him: William, Pitt and Fessenden streets in the city's Oakdale neighborhood.

==Youth and early career==
Fessenden was born in [[Boscawen, New Hampshire]], on October 16, 1806.  His father was attorney and legislator [[Samuel Fessenden]].  His mother was Ruth Greene. The parents were unmarried. William was separated from his mother at his birth, and he was raised by his paternal grandmother for seven years.{{clarify|date=February 2014}}

He graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1823 and then studied law. He was a founding member of the [[Temperance movement|Maine Temperance Society]] in 1827.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rolde |first=Neal |title=Maine: A Narrative History |year=1990 |publisher=Harpswell Press |location=Gardiner, ME |isbn=0-88448-069-0 |pages=175}}</ref> That year he was also admitted to the bar. He practiced with his father, who was also a prominent anti-slavery activist. He practiced law first in Bridgton, [[Maine]], a year in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and afterward in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]]. He was a member of the [[Maine House of Representatives]] in 1832 and was its leading debater. He refused nominations to Congress in 1831 and in 1838, and served in the Maine legislature again in 1840, becoming chairman of the house committee to revise the statutes of the state.

He was elected for one term in the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a Whig in 1840. During this term, he moved to repeal the rule that excluded anti-slavery petitions and spoke upon the loan and bankrupt bills, and the army. At the end of his term in Congress, he turned his attention wholly to his law business until he was again in the Maine legislature in 1845–46. He acquired a national reputation as a lawyer and an anti-slavery Whig, and in 1849 prosecuted before the [[United States Supreme Court]] an appeal from an adverse decision of Judge [[Joseph Story]], and gained a reversal by an argument which [[Daniel Webster]] pronounced the best he had heard in twenty years. He was again in the Maine legislature in 1853 and 1854.

==Service in U.S. Senate and Cabinet==
[[File:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|280px|''Running the \"Machine\"''<br />An 1864 cartoon featuring Fessenden, [[Edwin M. Stanton|Edwin Stanton]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] and [[Gideon Welles]] takes a swing at the Lincoln administration.]]Fessenden's strong anti-slavery principles caused his election to the U.S. Senate in 1854, with the support of Whigs and Anti-Slavery Democrats. Upon taking office, he immediately began speaking against the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. His speech on the [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]], in 1856, received the highest praise, and in 1858 his speech on the [[Lecompton Constitution]] of Kansas, and his criticisms of the opinion of the supreme court in the [[Dred Scott case]], were considered the ablest discussion of those topics. He participated in the organization of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], being re-elected to the Senate from that group in 1860, this time without the formality of a nomination.

In 1861, he was a member of the Peace Congress. By the secession of the Southern senators, the Republicans acquired control of the senate and placed Fessenden at the head of the finance committee. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he was the most conspicuous senator in sustaining the national credit. He opposed the [[Legal Tender Act]] as unnecessary and unjust. As chairman of the finance committee, Fessenden prepared and carried through the senate all measures relating to revenue, taxation, and appropriations, and, as declared by [[Charles Sumner]], was \"in the financial field all that our best generals were in arms.\"
[[File:FESSENDEN, William P-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Fessenden as Treasury Secretary]]
[[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed Fessenden [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] upon [[Salmon P. Chase]]'s resignation.  It was the darkest hour of national finances of the United States.{{According to whom|date=March 2018}} Chase had just withdrawn a loan from the market for want of acceptable bids, and the capacity of the country to lend seemed exhausted. The currency had been enormously inflated:  the paper dollar was worth only 34 cents; gold was at $280/ounce. Fessenden at first refused the office, but at last, accepted in obedience to the universal public pressure. When his acceptance became known, gold fell to $225/ounce. He declared that no more currency should be issued, and, making an appeal to the people, he prepared and put upon the market the seven-thirty loan, which proved a triumphant success. This loan was in the form of bonds bearing interest at the rate of 7.30%, which were issued in denominations as low as $50 so that people of moderate means could take them. He also framed and recommended the measures, adopted by congress, which permitted the subsequent consolidation and funding of the government loans into the 4% and 4.5% bonds.
[[File:US-Fractional (3rd Issue)-$0.25-Fr.1294.jpg|thumb|left|Fessenden was one of only three people [[List of people on United States banknotes|depicted]] on United States [[Fractional currency]] during their lifetime.]]
Fessenden began his service as Secretary of the Treasury on July 5, 1864. The financial situation becoming favorable, in accordance with his expressed intention, he resigned the secretaryship, leaving on March 3, 1865, to return to the Senate, to which he had now for the third time been elected.

From 1865 to 1867, he headed the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], which was responsible for overseeing the readmission of states from the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] into the Union. He wrote its report, which vindicated the power of congress over the rebellious states, showed their relations to the government under the constitution and the law of nations, and recommended the constitutional safeguards made necessary by the rebellion. At this point, Fessenden was the acknowledged leader in the senate of the Republicans. He was considered a moderate, rather than Radical, Republican.

[[File:Portrait of William P. Fessenden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederic Porter Vinton]]'s portrait of Fessenden, posthumous. Circa. 1870]]
During President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]] in 1868, Fessenden broke party ranks, along with six other Republican senators, and in a brazen act of political betrayel, voted for acquittal. These seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. He, [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]],<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html \"Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson\".]</ref> and [[Edmund G. Ross]]<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm \"The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868\".]</ref> defied their party and public opinion and voted against conviction. As a result, a 35-19 vote in favor of removing the President from office failed by a single vote of reaching a 2/3 majority.  After the trial, Congressman [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal.

Stewart, ''Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy'' (2009), pp. 240–249, 284–299.</ref>

He served as chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]] during the [[37th United States Congress|37th]] through [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]]es (from 1861 to 1867), which led to his Cabinet appointment. He also served as a chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds|Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds]] during the [[40th United States Congress|40th Congress]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] during the [[41st United States Congress|41st Congress]] and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Library]], also during the 41st Congress. In 1867, he was one of two senators (the other was Senator [[Justin S. Morrill]] of Vermont) who voted against the purchase of [[Alaska]] from Russia.<ref>http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llej&fileName=017/llej017.db&recNum=249</ref> His last speech in the Senate was upon the bill to strengthen the public credit. He advocated the payment of the principal of the public debt in gold and opposed the notion that it might lawfully be paid in depreciated greenbacks.

For several years, he was a regent of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. He received the degree of [[LL.D.]] from Bowdoin in 1858, and from [[Harvard University]] in 1864.

Fessenden died on September 8, 1869, while serving in the U.S. Senate. He was interred at the [[Evergreen Cemetery (Portland, Maine)|Evergreen Cemetery]] in Portland, Maine.  On December 14, 1869, [[George Henry Williams]] addressed the U.S. Senate to deliver a tribute to his friend and fellow Senator.<ref>Williams, George H. (1895). Occasional Addresses. Portland, Oregon: F.W. Baltes and Company. pp. 21-28.</ref>

==Personal life==
Two of his brothers, [[Samuel C. Fessenden|Samuel Clement Fessenden]] and [[T. A. D. Fessenden|Thomas Amory Deblois Fessenden]], were also Congressmen. 

Fessenden married Ellen M. Deering in 1832, and she died in 1857.  They had three sons who served in the [[American Civil War]]: Samuel Fessenden, who was killed at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], the Brigadier-General [[James Deering Fessenden]], and the Major-General [[Francis Fessenden]], the latter of whom wrote a two-volume biography of his father, ''The Life and Services of William Pitt Fessenden,'' which was published in 1907.  A fourth son, [[William Howard Fessenden]], stayed in Maine to take care of the law practice his father had established.  Their fifth child was Mary Elizabeth Deering Fessenden who died in childhood. 

Actress [[Beverly Garland]] is his great-great-granddaughter who dropped her real name Fessenden and went by her married name Garland.

'''William Pitt Fessenden''' (October 16, 1806{{spaced ndash}}September 8, 1869) was an [[Politics of the United States|American politician]] from the U.S. state of [[Maine]]. Fessenden was a [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] (later a [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) and member of the [[List of United States political families#The Fessendens|Fessenden political family]]. He served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] before becoming [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]].

A lawyer, he was a leading antislavery Whig in Maine; in Congress, he fought the [[Slave Power]] (the plantation owners who controlled southern states). He built an antislavery coalition in the state legislature that elected him to the U.S. Senate; it became Maine's Republican organization. In the Senate, Fessenden played a central role in the debates on Kansas, denouncing the expansion of slavery. He led [[Radical Republicans]]  in attacking Democrats [[Stephen Douglas]], [[Franklin Pierce]], and [[James Buchanan]]. Fessenden's speeches were read widely, influencing Republicans such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] and building support for  Lincoln's 1860 Republican presidential nomination.  During the war, Senator Fessenden helped shape the Union's taxation and financial policies. He moderated his earlier radicalism, and supported Lincoln against the Radicals, becoming Lincoln's Treasury Secretary.<ref>Landis (2008)</ref> After the war, Fessenden was back in the Senate, as chair of the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], which established terms for resuming congressional representation for the southern states, and which drafted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  Later, Fessenden provided critical support that prevented Senate conviction of President [[Andrew Johnson]], who had been impeached by the House. He was the first Republican Senator to ring out \"...''not guilty''\" followed by six other Republican Senators resulting in the acquittal of President Johnson.

He is the only person to have three streets in Portland named for him: William, Pitt and Fessenden streets in the city's Oakdale neighborhood.

==Youth and early career==
Fessenden was born in [[Boscawen, New Hampshire]], on October 16, 1806.  His father was attorney and legislator [[Samuel Fessenden]].  His mother was Ruth Greene. The parents were unmarried. William was separated from his mother at his birth, and he was raised by his paternal grandmother for seven years.{{clarify|date=February 2014}}

He graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1823 and then studied law. He was a founding member of the [[Temperance movement|Maine Temperance Society]] in 1827.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rolde |first=Neal |title=Maine: A Narrative History |year=1990 |publisher=Harpswell Press |location=Gardiner, ME |isbn=0-88448-069-0 |pages=175}}</ref> That year he was also admitted to the bar. He practiced with his father, who was also a prominent anti-slavery activist. He practiced law first in Bridgton, [[Maine]], a year in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and afterward in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]]. He was a member of the [[Maine House of Representatives]] in 1832 and was its leading debater. He refused nominations to Congress in 1831 and in 1838, and served in the Maine legislature again in 1840, becoming chairman of the house committee to revise the statutes of the state.

He was elected for one term in the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a Whig in 1840. During this term, he moved to repeal the rule that excluded anti-slavery petitions and spoke upon the loan and bankrupt bills, and the army. At the end of his term in Congress, he turned his attention wholly to his law business until he was again in the Maine legislature in 1845–46. He acquired a national reputation as a lawyer and an anti-slavery Whig, and in 1849 prosecuted before the [[United States Supreme Court]] an appeal from an adverse decision of Judge [[Joseph Story]], and gained a reversal by an argument which [[Daniel Webster]] pronounced the best he had heard in twenty years. He was again in the Maine legislature in 1853 and 1854.

==Service in U.S. Senate and Cabinet==
[[File:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|280px|''Running the \"Machine\"''<br />An 1864 cartoon featuring Fessenden, [[Edwin M. Stanton|Edwin Stanton]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] and [[Gideon Welles]] takes a swing at the Lincoln administration.]]Fessenden's strong anti-slavery principles caused his election to the U.S. Senate in 1854, with the support of Whigs and Anti-Slavery Democrats. Upon taking office, he immediately began speaking against the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. His speech on the [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]], in 1856, received the highest praise, and in 1858 his speech on the [[Lecompton Constitution]] of Kansas, and his criticisms of the opinion of the supreme court in the [[Dred Scott case]], were considered the ablest discussion of those topics. He participated in the organization of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], being re-elected to the Senate from that group in 1860, this time without the formality of a nomination.

In 1861, he was a member of the Peace Congress. By the secession of the Southern senators, the Republicans acquired control of the senate and placed Fessenden at the head of the finance committee. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he was the most conspicuous senator in sustaining the national credit. He opposed the [[Legal Tender Act]] as unnecessary and unjust. As chairman of the finance committee, Fessenden prepared and carried through the senate all measures relating to revenue, taxation, and appropriations, and, as declared by [[Charles Sumner]], was \"in the financial field all that our best generals were in arms.\"
[[File:FESSENDEN, William P-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Fessenden as Treasury Secretary]]
[[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed Fessenden [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] upon [[Salmon P. Chase]]'s resignation.  It was the darkest hour of national finances of the United States.{{According to whom|date=March 2018}} Chase had just withdrawn a loan from the market for want of acceptable bids, and the capacity of the country to lend seemed exhausted. The currency had been enormously inflated:  the paper dollar was worth only 34 cents; gold was at $280/ounce. Fessenden at first refused the office, but at last, accepted in obedience to the universal public pressure. When his acceptance became known, gold fell to $225/ounce. He declared that no more currency should be issued, and, making an appeal to the people, he prepared and put upon the market the seven-thirty loan, which proved a triumphant success. This loan was in the form of bonds bearing interest at the rate of 7.30%, which were issued in denominations as low as $50 so that people of moderate means could take them. He also framed and recommended the measures, adopted by congress, which permitted the subsequent consolidation and funding of the government loans into the 4% and 4.5% bonds.
[[File:US-Fractional (3rd Issue)-$0.25-Fr.1294.jpg|thumb|left|Fessenden was one of only three people [[List of people on United States banknotes|depicted]] on United States [[Fractional currency]] during their lifetime.]]
Fessenden began his service as Secretary of the Treasury on July 5, 1864. The financial situation becoming favorable, in accordance with his expressed intention, he resigned the secretaryship, leaving on March 3, 1865, to return to the Senate, to which he had now for the third time been elected.

From 1865 to 1867, he headed the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], which was responsible for overseeing the readmission of states from the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] into the Union. He wrote its report, which vindicated the power of congress over the rebellious states, showed their relations to the government under the constitution and the law of nations, and recommended the constitutional safeguards made necessary by the rebellion. At this point, Fessenden was the acknowledged leader in the senate of the Republicans. He was considered a moderate, rather than Radical, Republican.

[[File:Portrait of William P. Fessenden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederic Porter Vinton]]'s portrait of Fessenden, posthumous. Circa. 1870]]
During President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]] in 1868, Fessenden broke party ranks, along with six other Republican senators, and in a courageous act of political suicide, voted for acquittal. These seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. He, [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]],<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html \"Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson\".]</ref> and [[Edmund G. Ross]]<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm \"The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868\".]</ref> defied their party and public opinion and voted against conviction. As a result, a 35-19 vote in favor of removing the President from office failed by a single vote of reaching a 2/3 majority.  After the trial, Congressman [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal.  In Butler's hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash cards.<ref>David O. Stewart, ''Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy'' (2009), pp. 240–249, 284–299.</ref>

He served as chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]] during the [[37th United States Congress|37th]] through [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]]es (from 1861 to 1867), which led to his Cabinet appointment. He also served as a chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds|Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds]] during the [[40th United States Congress|40th Congress]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] during the [[41st United States Congress|41st Congress]] and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Library]], also during the 41st Congress. In 1867, he was one of two senators (the other was Senator [[Justin S. Morrill]] of Vermont) who voted against the purchase of [[Alaska]] from Russia.<ref>http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llej&fileName=017/llej017.db&recNum=249</ref> His last speech in the Senate was upon the bill to strengthen the public credit. He advocated the payment of the principal of the public debt in gold and opposed the notion that it might lawfully be paid in depreciated greenbacks.

For several years, he was a regent of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. He received the degree of [[LL.D.]] from Bowdoin in 1858, and from [[Harvard University]] in 1864.

Fessenden died on September 8, 1869, while serving in the U.S. Senate. He was interred at the [[Evergreen Cemetery (Portland, Maine)|Evergreen Cemetery]] in Portland, Maine.  On December 14, 1869, [[George Henry Williams]] addressed the U.S. Senate to deliver a tribute to his friend and fellow Senator.<ref>Williams, George H. (1895). Occasional Addresses.

The '''Peshtigo fire''' was a very large forest fire that took place on October 8, 1871, in northeastern [[Wisconsin]], including much of the southern half of the [[Door Peninsula]], and adjacent parts of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]]. The largest community in the affected area was [[Peshtigo, Wisconsin]]. It burned approximately 1,200,000 acres (490,000&nbsp;ha) and was the deadliest wildfire in American history,<ref name = \"Biondich2010\">{{cite news | last = Biondich | first = S. | title = The Great Peshtigo Fire | newspaper= [[Shepherd Express]] | date = 2010-06-09 | url = http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-11172-the-great-peshtigo-fire.html | access-date = 2011-11-09}}</ref> with the estimated deaths of around 1,500 people,<ref name = \"Biondich2010\" /> and possibly as many as 2,500.<ref name=\"Knickelbine2012\">{{cite book |first= Scott |last= Knickelbine |title=The Great Peshtigo Fire: Stories and Science from America's Deadliest Fire |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AGbGoxHOlBMC&printsec=frontcover |date=29 August 2012 |publisher= [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] Press |ISBN = 978-0870206023 }}</ref>

==Firestorm==
The setting of small fires was a common way to clear forest land for farming and railroad construction. On the day of the Peshtigo fire, a cold front moved in from the west, bringing strong winds that fanned the fires out of control and escalated them to massive proportions.<ref name = \"MPR story\">{{cite web |last=Hemphill |first=Stephanie |title=Peshtigo: a tornado of fire revisited |work=News and Features |publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio]] | date = November 27, 2002 |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200211/27_hemphills_peshtigofire/ |access-date=March 30, 2008}}</ref> A [[firestorm]] ensued.

==Comet theory==
One speculation, first suggested in 1883, was that the occurrence of the Peshtigo and Chicago fires on the same day was not just a coincidence, but that all the major fires that occurred in Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin on that day were caused by the impact from fragments of [[Biela's Comet]]. This theory was revived in a 1985 book,<ref>{{cite book|title=Mrs. O'Leary's Comet: Cosmic Causes of the Great Chicago Fire|last=Waskin|first=Mel|publisher=[[Academy Chicago Publishers]]|year=1985|ISBN=0897331818|location=|pages=}}</ref> studied in a 1997 documentary,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11IujPVv8ys Fire From The Sky].

[[Image:PeshtigoFireMuseumExterior2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peshtigo Fire Museum]]]]
The [[Peshtigo Fire Museum]], just west of [[U.S. Route 41 in Wisconsin|U.S. Highway&nbsp;41]], has a small collection of artifacts from the fire, first-person descriptions of the event, and a [[Peshtigo Fire Cemetery|graveyard]] dedicated to victims of the tragedy.

The fire jumped across the [[Peshtigo River]] and burned both sides of the town.<ref name = \"map\">{{cite web | last = Hipke | first = Deana C. | title = The Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871 | url = http://www.peshtigofire.info/gallery/burntmap.htm | access-date = 2013-01-26 }}</ref> Survivors reported that the [[firestorm]] generated a [[fire whirl]] (described as a tornado) that threw rail cars and houses into the air. Many escaped the flames by immersing themselves in the Peshtigo River, wells, or other nearby bodies of water. Some drowned while others succumbed to [[hypothermia]] in the frigid river. The [[Green Island Light (Wisconsin)|Green Island Light]] was kept lit during the day because of the obscuring smoke, but the three-masted schooner ''George L.

At the same time, another fire burned parts of the [[Door Peninsula]]; because of the coincidence, some incorrectly assumed that the fire had jumped across the waters of Green Bay.<ref name=\"Watson\">Watson, Benjamin A. 1993.

==Comet theory==
One speculation, first suggested in 1883, was that the occurrence of the Peshtigo and Chicago fires on the same day was not just a coincidence, but that all the major fires that occurred in Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin on that day were caused by the impact from fragments of [[Biela's Comet]]. This theory was revived in a 1985 book,<ref>{{cite book|title=Mrs. O'Leary's Comet: Cosmic Causes of the Great Chicago Fire|last=Waskin|first=Mel|publisher=[[Academy Chicago Publishers]]|year=1985|ISBN=0897331818|location=|pages=}}</ref> studied in a 1997 documentary,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11IujPVv8ys Fire From The Sky].

==Legacy==
[[Image:PeshtigoFireMuseumExterior2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peshtigo Fire Museum]]]]
The [[Peshtigo Fire Museum]], just west of [[U.S. Route 41 in Wisconsin|U.S. Highway&nbsp;41]], has a small collection of artifacts from the fire, first-person descriptions of the event, and a [[Peshtigo Fire Cemetery|graveyard]] dedicated to victims of the tragedy. A memorial commemorating the fire was dedicated on October 8, 2012 at the bridge over the Peshtigo River.<ref>[http://www.peshtigotimes.net/?id=20264 \"Large Crowd Attends Fire Monument Event.\" 2012. ''Peshtigo Times'' (11 October).]</ref>

The chapel where Sister Adele Brise and others sheltered from the fire has become the [[National Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help]]. The site is a [[Shrines to the Virgin Mary|Marian shrine]], where visitors can make religious [[pilgrimage]]s.<ref name=\"Cipin\">{{cite web |url= http://shrineofourladyofgoodhelp.com/htmPages/g_hst_p5.html |publisher=Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help |title=Troubles and Miracles |first1=Vojtech |last1=Cipin |year=2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131127043314/http://shrineofourladyofgoodhelp.com/htmPages/g_hst_p5.html| archivedate= 2013-11-27|access-date=March 1, 2013|url-status= dead}}</ref>

The development includes the largest conservation and [[Land use|land-use]] agreement in California history.<ref name=Californian080508>[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/local/x1365314776/Tejon-land-pact-divides-environmentalists Stacey Shepard, \"Tejon land pact divides environmentalists,\" ''Bakersfield Californian,'' May 8, 2008]</ref> It was approved by the county's [[Board of Supervisors]] in October 2009. Opponents launched a legal challenge that was denied in state district court in April 2012.

The pact between the Tejon Ranch Company and a coalition of environmental groups, announced in May 2008,<ref name=LAT080508>[http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-tejon8-2008may08,0,2,25201.story Louis Sahagun, \"Tejon Ranch pact would allow 26,000 homes on the range,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' May 8, 2008]</ref> is designed to permanently protect {{convert|240000|acre|km2}} of the historic ranch, including a vast amount outside the borders of the Tejon Mountain Village subdivision.
{{TOC right}}

==Planned development==

Now approved by Kern County, but a matter of debate for years in the [[Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass]], the development would include homes, commercial buildings, hotels, and golf courses.<ref name=Enterprise090918>[https://archive.is/20130129173312/http://www.mountainenterprise.com/stf.php?sid=5628 Patric Hedlund, \" 'Round One' Gives Tejon 3-2 Vote,\"  ''Mountain Enterprise,'' September 9, 2009, pages 1 and 2]</ref>

Tejon Mountain Village would be a {{convert|5082|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[gated community]] amid 26,417 acres<ref name=Californian091006>[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/growth/x1722027440/Lawsuit-likely-after-supervisors-approve-Tejon-project James Burger, \"Lawsuit likely after supervisors approve Tejon project,\" ''Bakersfield Californian,'' October 6, 2009]</ref>
of Tejon Ranch property. It would include two golf courses, 3,450 homes, a {{convert|160000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}-shopping center near [[Interstate 5]], and a maximum of 750 hotel rooms.<ref name=Californian090918/>
<blockquote>Houses and apartments would be grouped in small enclaves around the lake and on the level tops of surrounding ridges. Larger lot custom homes would rise from the more remote hilltops in the northwest and northeast sections of the development area. Buildings would be designed to fit into the existing land rather than the land being molded to fit the buildings.<ref name=Californian090918>[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/local/x616725528/Massive-Tejon-project-headed-to-first-vote James Burger, \"Massive Tejon project headed to first vote,\" ''Bakersfield Californian,'' September 4, 2009, updated September 8, 2009]</ref></blockquote>

Residential lots would range in size from {{convert|6700|sqft|m2}} to more than {{convert|20|acre|m2}}. There would be two heliports, two 18-hole golf courses, and about {{convert|320000|sqft|m2}} of support space for the \"commercial amenities.\"<ref name=Enterprise090918/>

The property will be developed by a new entity, Tejon Mountain Village [[Limited liability company|LLC]].<ref name=Enterprise091009>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/atf.php?sid=5773&current_edition=2009-10-09 Patric Hedlund, \"No Surprise: Bakersfield Votes 'Yes' for Tejon Village,\" ''Mountain Enterprise,'' October 9, 2009]</ref> Originally a joint enterprise with DMB Associates of Scottsdale, Arizona, the Tejon Ranch Company bought out its partner in July 2014.<ref name=Outlet>{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Ronald D.|title=Tejon Ranch targets commercial development for growth|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-stock-spotlight-tejon-ranch-20140929-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 28, 2014}}</ref>

==Lawsuits ==

A coalition of environmentalists, Native Americans and local residents, including the [[Center for Biological Diversity]], filed a lawsuit in Kern County Superior Court on November 12, 2009, to halt the development. The suit claimed the construction would threaten the [[California condor]] and negatively affect sacred [[Chumash people|Chumash]] sites, degrade air quality, and add traffic to nearby [[Interstate 5]].<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tejon-ranch13-2009nov13,0,1032538.story Ann M. Simmons, \"Suit filed over Tejon Ranch Plan,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' page A4, November 13, 2009]</ref> On November 5, 2010, Kern County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Twisselman ruled in favor of Kern County, Tejon Mountain Village and its development partner, DMB Associates.<ref>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/atf.php?sid=7751&current_edition=2010-11-05 \"Tejon Mountain Village Weathers Legal Challenge from Center for Biological Diversity\" ''Mountain Enterprise'' website, November 6, 2010]</ref> The Center for Biological Diversity appealed the ruling to [[California Courts of Appeal#Fifth District|California's Fifth District Court of Appeal]] in Fresno on February 9, 2011. It was joined by the TriCounty Watchdogs, the [[Wishtoyo Foundation]] (a Chumash-oriented group interested in the environment), and the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment.<ref name=AppealFiledEnt2011.02.18>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/full.php?sid=8214&current_edition=2011-02-18 \"Appeal Filed in Tejon Mtn. Village Suit,\" ''The Mountain Enterprise,'' February 18, 2011, pages 2 and 13.]</ref>

In April 2012, Fifth District Court determined that the project could move forward. The court felt that the flaws it saw in the EIR were too minor to stop the development.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kget.com/news/local/story/Massive-Tejon-development-clears-legal-hurdle/6ocAO8LOBEur58KE0rzfbw.cspx|title=Massive Tejon development clears legal hurdle|date=April 26, 2012|work=KGET TV 17|publisher=17KGET.com|accessdate=April 27, 2012}}</ref>

==Conditions==
In return for the county's granting a 30-year permit to complete the development instead of the standard 10 years, the developers agreed to fund six community endeavors:<ref>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/full.php?sid=5848&current_edition=2009-10-16  \"TMV Trades for 30 Year Accord,\" ''Mountain Enterprise,'' October 16, 2009, page 24]</ref>

* $500,000 for an expanded Frazier Mountain Park [[Community centre|Community Center]], which money would come from a fee of $1,000 on the first 500 residential units sold in the project.
* $25,000 to the local [[Fire safe councils|Fire-Safe Council]] to assist property owners in the Mountain Communities with fire-education efforts and preparation of a wildfire plan.
* $7 yearly from each residence to support [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]], [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organizations]] serving residents and to implement energy-efficiency programs in the Mountain Communities.
* $70 per parcel per year for [[Paramedic|paramedic services]].
* Dedication of a public multi-use trail along the western boundary of [[Castac Lake]].
* Funding of 1.5 years of a deputy sheriff's position (to be effective six months after the first [[Construction permit|building permit]] is issued).

==Concerns==

===Environment===

Principal objections in the county approval process concerned the effects on wildlife, lack of sufficient water, glare from lights, air pollution, and damage to the existing community.

====Wildlife====
Tejon Ranch, which is the largest contiguous parcel of privately owned land in the state, is home to about 80 rare or endangered species, including the [[bald eagle]], the [[Spotted owl|California spotted owl]], and the California condor, according to the [[Center for Biological Diversity]] of Tucson, Arizona.<ref name=NYT080220>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/realestate/commercial/20ranch.html Terry Pristin, \"Warehouses Nibble on Edge of Giant California Ranch,\" ''New York Times,'' February 20, 2008]</ref> Only 150 condors were surviving in the wild in July 2008, and Tejon Ranch is one of the giant bird's prime habitats.<ref name=USAT080729>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/environment/2008-07-29-ecoside_N.htm Dennis Cauchon, \"'An imperfect understanding' of the environment,\" ''USA Today,'' July 29, 2008, updated July 30, 2008]</ref>

The Sierra Club made conserving as much of the Tejon Ranch as possible its top priority for California, Bill Corcoran, a senior regional representative, told the ''New York Times.'' He said, \"There is no other place like this in California. It offers an unparalleled and irreplaceable connection between the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Coast Ranges]] and the [[High Desert (California)|high desert]].\"<ref name=NYT080220/>

A coalition led by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], the Sierra Club, Audubon California, the [[Planning and Conservation League]], and the [[Endangered Habitat League]] worked with the Tejon Ranch Company to develop a program that, if carried out, would conserve 90 percent of the entire Tejon Ranch. In return, the coalition agreed it would not oppose the company's plans to build Tejon Mountain Village and another big development, [[Centennial, California|Centennial]], in northwestern Los Angeles County.<ref name=LAT080508/>

====Water====
D. Adam Lazar, attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, told the county's Board of Supervisors at its October 5, 2009, hearing that there would not be enough water for the project since it was completely dependent on the [[California State Water Project]], which brings water from the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]]. But Ernest Conant, attorney for the Tejon Castac Water District Board, replied that some analyses had considered what might happen if supplies from the state water project were cut back to as low as 50 percent.<ref name=Enterprise091009/>

====Starlight====
Responding to an objection that the development would ruin the dark skies of  \"a prime tourism area for amateur astronomers,\" county planner Lorelei Oviatt proposed and read into the record that the forthcoming [[Dark-sky movement|Dark Sky Society]] model ordinance to control such pollution be adopted for the project.<ref name=Enterprise090918/>

====Air pollution====
Residents who complained about the risk of increased air pollution were told by Oviatt that such concerns \"had been addressed\" by the [[San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District]].<ref name=Enterprise090918/>

====Community life====
Two Planning Commissioners voted against the plan at the commission's September 10, 2009, meeting. One of them cited the \"scale\" of the undertaking, saying that \"I can't help but feel that this isn't a plan that benefits the existing communities of Lebec and Frazier Park,\" and Keats of the Center for Biological Diversity compared the \"corporate greed\" of Wall Street, \"which owns this company\" to the drive to develop Tejon Mountain Village for the \"helicopter playboys\" who would live there.<ref name=Californian090910>[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/local/x169794233/Planners-give-blessing-to-Tejon-project James Burger, \"Planners give blessing to Tejon project,\" ''Bakersfield Californian,'' September 10, 2009]</ref>

Support for the project came from representatives of the Mountain Communities Chamber of Commerce, the Mountain Shakespeare Festival, the Kern County Board of Trade, and the Greater Bakersfield Chamber of Commerce.<ref name=Enterprise090918/>

===Native American claims===

====Legal filing====
A federal court suit was also filed in November 2009 in Fresno by the Kawaiisu (KAH'-yah WAH'-soo) Tribe of Native Americans, arguing that U.S. officials failed to recognize the tribe's claim to areas of the {{convert|270000|acre|km2|adj=on}} Tejon Ranch property where the TMV project is planned and that the Kern County supervisors ignored the existence of historic tribal sites when they approved the plan. That suit sought an injunction suspending development and compensation for use of the land and the tribe's pain and suffering.<ref>[http://law.gaeatimes.com/2009/11/20/indian-tribe-sues-interior-dept-county-to-stop-resort-project-on-california-ranch-17439/ Jacob Adelman, Associated Press, \"Indian tribe sues over Calif ranch development,\" ''The Gaea Times,'' November 20, 2009]</ref>

David Laughing Horse Robinson, who said he was an elder of the tribe of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], claimed in an e-mail that Tejon Ranch did not own the land beneath the proposed project.<ref name=Enterprise090925>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/atf.php?sid=5715 \"Indian Tribe Challenges Tejon Mountain Village Plans,\" ''Mountain Enterprise,'' September 25, 2009]</ref> He said in a video later posted on ''Youtube.com'' that the land was \"stolen.\"<ref name=Californian090925>[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/local/x746311556/Tribe-elder-challenges-Tejon-project James Burger, \"Tribe elder challenges Tejon project,\" ''Bakersfield Californian'' September 30, 2009]</ref>

His claim was countered a few days later by Julie Turner, secretary of the Kern Valley Indian Community, who said in a letter to Kern County Planners that Robinson \"isn't the tribal chairman.\" And Laer Pierce, a spokesman for the Tejon project, said that a Tejon-Sebastian [[Indian reservation|native reservation]] existed only between 1853 and 1864, when the reservation was \"dissolved by Congress.\"

On January 24, 2011, Federal court Judge [[Oliver Wanger]] ruled against Robinson, an instructional technician at [[California State University, Bakersfield]].<ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110125006575/en/Federal-Lawsuit-Contesting-Tejon-Ranch-Ownership-Dismissed \"Federal Lawsuit Contesting Tejon Ranch Ownership Dismissed,\" Business Wire, January 25, 2011]</ref><ref>[http://thebusinessjournal.com/legal/8089-judge-wanger-dismisses-tejon-ranch-challenge \"Judge Wanger Dismisses Tejon Ranch Challenge,\" ''The Business Journal,'' January 25, 2011]</ref>

Native American spokesmen said the project troubled them. Chumash ceremonial leader Mat Waiya said that Tejon Ranch had disturbed Indian cultural sites in the early 2000s but that the ranch had followed protocols since then.<ref name=Californian091006/> The developer has now agreed to provide a {{convert|2500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility in the commercial center for a museum that could serve as a repository for artifacts.<ref name=Enterprise091009/>

====Ruling====

The claim by the Kawaiisu Tribe of Tejon that tried to assert title to the 270,000 acres comprising the Tejon Ranch was rejected by the Ninth [[U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] in June 2015.<ref name=TejonRanchNotOwnedCVBT>[http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=28549 \"Tejon Ranch Not Owned by Indians,\" ''Central Valley Business Times,'' June 22, 2015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723125644/http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=28549 |date=July 23, 2015 }}</ref> 

<blockquote>Among other things, the three-judge panel rejected the tribe’s complaints of alleged forgery and deception in obtaining patents for the four Mexican land grants comprising Tejon Ranch. It says the tribe could not challenge the validity of land patents after more than a century of time had passed. In its decision, the court reached back through the history of the multiple failures of Congress and Presidents to ratify agreements with Indian tribes in the 1850s. The Kawaiisu Tribe alleges that the Tejon/Sebastian Reservation was created pursuant to the Act of 1853, pointing to a letter from President Franklin Pierce to the Secretary of the Interior, Robert McClelland, and a subsequent letter from the Secretary to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California, Edward Beale, from that same year.<ref name=TejonRanchNotOwnedCVBT/></blockquote>

===Sufficiency of notice===
Adam Keats, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, said he believed the county had violated the [[California Environmental Quality Act]], or CEQA, with a \"rushed public hearing process.\"<ref name=Enterprise091009/> And Patric Hedlund, the editor of a local weekly newspaper, the [[Mountain Enterprise]], wrote that the draft [[Environmental Impact Assessment#United States|environmental impact report]] on the village was \"15 notebooks, 13 of them 5.5 inches thick, two others adding four more inches, plus two rolls of large maps. They add up to a tower nearly six feet tall.\" She compared the report to \"a six-foot stranger on the front porch, gawky and inscrutable, standing there for your consideration.\" The county also offered a set of four compact disks and put out a smaller, \"2.5-foot stack\" in the [[Frazier Park, California|Frazier Park]] library.<ref name=Enterprise090605>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/atf.php?sid=5038&current_edition=2009-06-05 \"Tejon Mountain Village Impact Report Review Clock Ticking Down,\" ''Mountain Enterprise,'' June 5, 2009]</ref>

Lorelei Oviatt, division chief of Kern County's Planning Department, spoke at a subsequent community meeting to explain \"how to navigate the data to make effective comments.\"<ref name=Enterprise090626>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/atf.php?sid=5173&current_edition=2009-06-26 Patric Hedlund, \"Capacity Crowd Hungry for Facts,\" ''Mountain Enterprise,'' June 26, 2009]</ref> \"We believe this project has been thoroughly reviewed,\" Oviatt later told the ''[[Bakersfield Californian]].''<ref name=Californian090918/>

[[Category:Tehachapi Mountains]]","'''Tejon Mountain Village''' is a proposed residential, commercial, and recreational development of pristine, rugged property in the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] owned by the [[Tejon Ranch]] Company in [[Lebec, California|Lebec]], southern [[Kern County, California]]. The development includes the largest conservation and [[Land use|land-use]] agreement in California history.<ref name=Californian080508>[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/local/x1365314776/Tejon-land-pact-divides-environmentalists Stacey Shepard, \"Tejon land pact divides environmentalists,\" ''Bakersfield Californian,'' May 8, 2008]</ref> It was approved by the county's [[Board of Supervisors]] in October 2009. Opponents launched a legal challenge which was denied in state district court in April 2012.

The pact between the Tejon Ranch Company and a coalition of environmental groups, announced in May 2008,<ref name=LAT080508>[http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-tejon8-2008may08,0,2,25201.story Louis Sahagun, \"Tejon Ranch pact would allow 26,000 homes on the range,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' May 8, 2008]</ref> is designed to permanently protect {{convert|240000|acre|km2}} of the historic ranch, including a vast amount outside the borders of the Tejon Mountain Village subdivision.

==Planned development==

Now approved by Kern County, but a matter of debate for years in the [[Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass]], the development would include homes, commercial buildings, hotels, and golf courses.<ref name=Enterprise090918>[https://archive.is/20130129173312/http://www.mountainenterprise.com/stf.php?sid=5628 Patric Hedlund, \" 'Round One' Gives Tejon 3-2 Vote,\"  ''Mountain Enterprise,'' September 9, 2009, pages 1 and 2]</ref>

Tejon Mountain Village would be a {{convert|5082|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[gated community]] amid 26,417 acres<ref name=Californian091006>[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/growth/x1722027440/Lawsuit-likely-after-supervisors-approve-Tejon-project James Burger, \"Lawsuit likely after supervisors approve Tejon project,\" ''Bakersfield Californian,'' October 6, 2009]</ref>
of Tejon Ranch property. It would include two golf courses, 3,450 homes, a {{convert|160000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}-shopping center near [[Interstate 5]], and a maximum of 750 hotel rooms.<ref name=Californian090918/>
<blockquote>Houses and apartments would be grouped in small enclaves around the lake and on the level tops of surrounding ridges. Larger lot custom homes would rise from the more remote hilltops in the northwest and northeast sections of the development area. Buildings would be designed to fit into the existing land rather than the land being molded to fit the buildings.<ref name=Californian090918>[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/local/x616725528/Massive-Tejon-project-headed-to-first-vote James Burger, \"Massive Tejon project headed to first vote,\" ''Bakersfield Californian,'' September 4, 2009, updated September 8, 2009]</ref></blockquote>

Residential lots would range in size from {{convert|6700|sqft|m2}} to more than {{convert|20|acre|m2}}. There would be two heliports, two 18-hole golf courses, and about {{convert|320000|sqft|m2}} of support space for the \"commercial amenities.\"<ref name=Enterprise090918/>

The property will be developed by a new entity, Tejon Mountain Village [[Limited liability company|LLC]].<ref name=Enterprise091009>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/atf.php?sid=5773&current_edition=2009-10-09 Patric Hedlund, \"No Surprise: Bakersfield Votes 'Yes' for Tejon Village,\" ''Mountain Enterpise,'' October 9, 2009]</ref> Originally a joint enterprise with DMB Associates of Scottsdale, Arizona, the Tejon Ranch Company bought out its partner in July 2014.<ref name=Outlet>{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Ronald D.|title=Tejon Ranch targets commercial development for growth|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-stock-spotlight-tejon-ranch-20140929-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 28, 2014}}</ref>

==Lawsuits ==

A coalition of environmentalists, Native Americans and local residents, including the [[Center for Biological Diversity]], filed a lawsuit in Kern County Superior Court on November 12, 2009, to halt the development. The suit claimed the construction would threaten the [[California condor]] and negatively affect sacred [[Chumash people|Chumash]] sites, degrade air quality, and add traffic to nearby [[Interstate 5]].<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tejon-ranch13-2009nov13,0,1032538.story Ann M. Simmons, \"Suit filed over Tejon Ranch Plan,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' page A4, November 13, 2009]</ref> On November 5, 2010, Kern County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Twisselman ruled in favor of Kern County, Tejon Mountain Village and its development partner, DMB Associates.<ref>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/atf.php?sid=7751&current_edition=2010-11-05 \"Tejon Mountain Village Weathers Legal Challenge from Center for Biological Diversity\" ''Mountain Enterprise'' website, November 6, 2010]</ref> The Center for Biological Diversity appealed the ruling to [[California Courts of Appeal#Fifth District|California's Fifth District Court of Appeal]] in Fresno on February 9, 2011. It was joined by the TriCounty Watchdogs, the [[Wishtoyo Foundation]] (a Chumash-oriented group interested in the environment), and the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment.<ref name=AppealFiledEnt2011.02.18>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/full.php?sid=8214&current_edition=2011-02-18 \"Appeal Filed in Tejon Mtn.

In April 2012, Fifth District Court determined that the project could move forward. The court felt that the flaws it saw in the EIR were too minor to stop the development.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kget.com/news/local/story/Massive-Tejon-development-clears-legal-hurdle/6ocAO8LOBEur58KE0rzfbw.cspx|title=Massive Tejon development clears legal hurdle|date=April 26, 2012|work=KGET TV 17|publisher=17KGET.com|accessdate=April 27, 2012}}</ref>

==Conditions==
In return for the county's granting a 30-year permit to complete the development instead of the standard 10 years, the developers agreed to fund six community endeavors:<ref>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/full.php?sid=5848&current_edition=2009-10-16  \"TMV Trades for 30 Year Accord,\" ''Mountain Enterprise,'' October 16, 2009, page 24]</ref>

* $500,000 for an expanded Frazier Mountain Park [[Community centre|Community Center]], which money would come from a fee of $1,000 on the first 500 residential units sold in the project.
* $25,000 to the local [[Fire safe councils|Fire-Safe Council]] to assist property owners in the Mountain Communities with fire-education efforts and preparation of a wildfire plan.
* $7 yearly from each residence to support [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]], [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organizations]] serving residents and to implement energy-efficiency programs in the Mountain Communities.
* $70 per parcel per year for [[Paramedic|paramedic services]].
* Dedication of a public multi-use trail along the western boundary of [[Castac Lake]].
* Funding of 1.5 years of a deputy sheriff's position (to be effective six months after the first [[Construction permit|building permit]] is issued).

==Concerns==

===Environment===

Principal objections in the county approval process concerned the effects on wildlife, lack of sufficient water, glare from lights, air pollution, and damage to the existing community.

====Wildlife====
Tejon Ranch, which is the largest contiguous parcel of privately owned land in the state, is home to about 80 rare or endangered species, including the [[bald eagle]], the [[Spotted owl|California spotted owl]], and the California condor, according to the [[Center for Biological Diversity]] of Tucson, Arizona.<ref name=NYT080220>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/realestate/commercial/20ranch.html Terry Pristin, \"Warehouses Nibble on Edge of Giant California Ranch,\" ''New York Times,'' February 20, 2008]</ref> Only 150 condors were surviving in the wild in July 2008, and Tejon Ranch is one of the giant bird's prime habitats.<ref name=USAT080729>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/environment/2008-07-29-ecoside_N.htm Dennis Cauchon, \"'An imperfect understanding' of the environment,\" ''USA Today,'' July 29, 2008, updated July 30, 2008]</ref>

The Sierra Club made conserving as much of the Tejon Ranch as possible its top priority for California, Bill Corcoran, a senior regional representative, told the ''New York Times.'' He said, \"There is no other place like this in California. It offers an unparalleled and irreplaceable connection between the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Coast Ranges]] and the [[High Desert (California)|high desert]].\"<ref name=NYT080220/>

A coalition led by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], the Sierra Club, Audubon California, the [[Planning and Conservation League]], and the [[Endangered Habitat League]] worked with the Tejon Ranch Company to develop a program that, if carried out, would conserve 90 percent of the entire Tejon Ranch. In return, the coalition agreed it would not oppose the company's plans to build Tejon Mountain Village and another big development, [[Centennial, California|Centennial]], in northwestern Los Angeles County.<ref name=LAT080508/>

====Water====
D. Adam Lazar, attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, told the county's Board of Supervisors at its October 5, 2009, hearing that there would not be enough water for the project since it was completely dependent on the [[California State Water Project]], which brings water from the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]]. But Ernest Conant, attorney for the Tejon Castac Water District Board, replied that some analyses had considered what might happen if supplies from the state water project were cut back to as low as 50 percent.<ref name=Enterprise091009/>

====Starlight====
Responding to an objection that the development would ruin the dark skies of  \"a prime tourism area for amateur astronomers,\" county planner Lorelei Oviatt proposed and read into the record that the forthcoming [[Dark-sky movement|Dark Sky Society]] model ordinance to control such pollution be adopted for the project.<ref name=Enterprise090918/>

====Air pollution====
Residents who complained about the risk of increased air pollution were told by Oviatt that such concerns \"had been addressed\" by the [[San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District]].<ref name=Enterprise090918/>

====Community life====
Two Planning Commissioners voted against the plan at the commission's September 10, 2009, meeting. One of them cited the \"scale\" of the undertaking, saying that \"I can't help but feel that this isn't a plan that benefits the existing communities of Lebec and Frazier Park,\" and Keats of the Center for Biological Diversity compared the \"corporate greed\" of Wall Street, \"which owns this company\" to the drive to develop Tejon Mountain Village for the \"helicopter playboys\" who would live there.<ref name=Californian090910>[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/local/x169794233/Planners-give-blessing-to-Tejon-project James Burger, \"Planners give blessing to Tejon project,\" ''Bakersfield Californian,'' September 10, 2009]</ref>

Support for the project came from representatives of the Mountain Communities Chamber of Commerce, the Mountain Shakespeare Festival, the Kern County Board of Trade, and the Greater Bakersfield Chamber of Commerce.<ref name=Enterprise090918/>

===Native American claims===

====Legal filing====
A federal court suit was also filed in November 2009 in Fresno by the Kawaiisu (KAH'-yah WAH'-soo) Tribe of Native Americans, arguing that U.S. officials failed to recognize the tribe's claim to areas of the {{convert|270000|acre|km2|adj=on}} Tejon Ranch property where the TMV project is planned and that the Kern County supervisors ignored the existence of historic tribal sites when they approved the plan. That suit sought an injunction suspending development and compensation for use of the land and the tribe's pain and suffering.<ref>[http://law.gaeatimes.com/2009/11/20/indian-tribe-sues-interior-dept-county-to-stop-resort-project-on-california-ranch-17439/ Jacob Adelman, Associated Press, \"Indian tribe sues over Calif ranch development,\" ''The Gaea Times,'' November 20, 2009]</ref>

David Laughing Horse Robinson, who said he was an elder of the tribe of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], claimed in an e-mail that Tejon Ranch did not own the land beneath the proposed project.<ref name=Enterprise090925>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/atf.php?sid=5715 \"Indian Tribe Challenges Tejon Mountain Village Plans,\" ''Mountain Enterprise,'' September 25, 2009]</ref> He said in a video later posted on ''Youtube.com'' that the land was \"stolen.\"<ref name=Californian090925>[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/local/x746311556/Tribe-elder-challenges-Tejon-project James Burger, \"Tribe elder challenges Tejon project,\" ''Bakersfield Californian'' September 30, 2009]</ref>

His claim was countered a few days later by Julie Turner, secretary of the Kern Valley Indian Community, who said in a letter to Kern County Planners that Robinson \"isn't the tribal chairman.\" And Laer Pierce, a spokesman for the Tejon project, said that a Tejon-Sebastian [[Indian reservation|native reservation]] existed only between 1853 and 1864, when the reservation was \"dissolved by Congress.\"

On January 24, 2011, Federal court Judge [[Oliver Wanger]] ruled against Robinson, an instructional technician at [[California State University, Bakersfield]].<ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110125006575/en/Federal-Lawsuit-Contesting-Tejon-Ranch-Ownership-Dismissed \"Federal Lawsuit Contesting Tejon Ranch Ownership Dismissed,\" Business Wire, January 25, 2011]</ref><ref>[http://thebusinessjournal.com/legal/8089-judge-wanger-dismisses-tejon-ranch-challenge \"Judge Wanger Dismisses Tejon Ranch Challenge,\" ''The Business Journal,'' January 25, 2011]</ref>

Native American spokesmen said the project troubled them. Chumash ceremonial leader Mat Waiya said that Tejon Ranch had disturbed Indian cultural sites in the early 2000s but that the ranch had followed protocols since then.<ref name=Californian091006/> The developer has now agreed to provide a {{convert|2500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility in the commercial center for a museum that could serve as a repository for artifacts.<ref name=Enterprise091009/>

====Ruling====

The claim by the Kawaiisu Tribe of Tejon that tried to assert title to the 270,000 acres comprising the Tejon Ranch was rejected by the Ninth [[U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] in June 2015.<ref name=TejonRanchNotOwnedCVBT>[http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=28549 \"Tejon Ranch Not Owned by Indians,\" ''Central Valley Business Times,'' June 22, 2015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723125644/http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=28549 |date=July 23, 2015 }}</ref> 

<blockquote>Among other things, the three-judge panel rejected the tribe’s complaints of alleged forgery and deception in obtaining patents for the four Mexican land grants comprising Tejon Ranch. It says the tribe could not challenge the validity of land patents after more than a century of time had passed. In its decision, the court reached back through the history of the multiple failures of Congress and Presidents to ratify agreements with Indian tribes in the 1850s. The Kawaiisu Tribe alleges that the Tejon/Sebastian Reservation was created pursuant to the Act of 1853, pointing to a letter from President Franklin Pierce to the Secretary of the Interior, Robert McClelland, and a subsequent letter from the Secretary to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California, Edward Beale, from that same year.<ref name=TejonRanchNotOwnedCVBT/></blockquote>

===Sufficiency of notice===
Adam Keats, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, said he believed the county had violated the [[California Environmental Quality Act]], or CEQA, with a \"rushed public hearing process.\"<ref name=Enterprise091009/> And Patric Hedlund, the editor of a local weekly newspaper, the [[Mountain Enterprise]], wrote that the draft [[Environmental Impact Assessment#United States|environmental impact report]] on the village was \"15 notebooks, 13 of them 5.5 inches thick, two others adding four more inches, plus two rolls of large maps. They add up to a tower nearly six feet tall.\" She compared the report to \"a six-foot stranger on the front porch, gawky and inscrutable, standing there for your consideration.\" The county also offered a set of four compact disks and put out a smaller, \"2.5-foot stack\" in the [[Frazier Park, California|Frazier Park]] library.<ref name=Enterprise090605>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/atf.php?sid=5038&current_edition=2009-06-05 \"Tejon Mountain Village Impact Report Review Clock Ticking Down,\" ''Mountain Enterprise,'' June 5, 2009]</ref>

Lorelei Oviatt, division chief of Kern County's Planning Department, spoke at a subsequent community meeting to explain \"how to navigate the data to make effective comments.\"<ref name=Enterprise090626>[http://www.mountainenterprise.com/atf.php?sid=5173&current_edition=2009-06-26 Patric Hedlund, \"Capacity Crowd Hungry for Facts,\" ''Mountain Enterprise,'' June 26, 2009]</ref> \"We believe this project has been thoroughly reviewed,\" Oviatt later told the ''[[Bakersfield Californian]].''<ref name=Californian090918/>

\"'''Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld'''\" (A Lambkin goes and bears the guilt) is a Lutheran [[Passion hymn]] in German by [[Paul Gerhardt]]. The hymn text was first published in [[Johann Crüger]]'s ''[[Praxis Pietatis Melica]]'', starting from the lost 1647 edition. [[Wolfgang Dachstein]]'s 16th-century \"[[An Wasserflüssen Babylon]]\" melody is commonly indicated as its [[hymn tune]], although other settings exist.

From the late 17th century Gerhardt's hymn text is used in larger vocal works such as [[Passion (music)|Passion setting]]s. With Dachstein's hymn tune it is included in the Protestant hymnal ''[[Evangelisches Gesangbuch]]''.

== History ==
Paul Gerhardt's \"Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld\" was first published in 1647, in a lost edition of Johann Crüger's ''Praxis Pietatis Melica''.<ref name=\"Korth\" /> The earliest extant print of the hymn, in the ''Praxis Pietatis Melica'' of 1648, indicates Wolfgang Dachstein's 16th-century \"An Wasserflüssen Babylon\" melody as its singing tune:<ref name=\"Julian\">{{cite book |last1=Julian |first1=John |date=1901 |chapter=Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld |title=[[:commons:Category:Dictionary of Hymnology|A Dictionary of Hymnology]] |volume=[[:File:A Dictionary of Hymnology Vol. 1.pdf|I]] |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |pages=[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/A_Dictionary_of_Hymnology_Vol._1.pdf/page343-972px-A_Dictionary_of_Hymnology_Vol._1.pdf.jpg 325]–[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/A_Dictionary_of_Hymnology_Vol._1.pdf/page344-981px-A_Dictionary_of_Hymnology_Vol._1.pdf.jpg 326] |ref=harv}}</ref>

The hymn was originally used as a [[Eucharist in Lutheranism|communion]] song.<ref name=\"Axmacher\" /> Later it was described as \"the masterpiece of all Passion hymns\".<ref name=\"Julian\" />

\"'''Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld'''\" (A Lambkin goes and bears the guilt) is a [[Lutheran hymn]] for [[Passiontide]] by [[Paul Gerhardt]]. The hymn text was first published in [[Johann Crüger]]'s ''[[Praxis Pietatis Melica]]'', starting from the lost 1647 edition. [[Wolfgang Dachstein]]'s 16th-century \"[[An Wasserflüssen Babylon]]\" melody is commonly indicated as its [[hymn tune]], although other settings exist.

From the late 17th century Gerhardt's hymn text is used in larger vocal works such as [[Passion (music)|Passion setting]]s. With Dachstein's hymn tune it is included in the Protestant hymnal ''[[Evangelisches Gesangbuch]]''.

== History ==
Paul Gerhardt's \"Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld\" was first published in 1647, in a lost edition of Johann Crüger's ''Praxis Pietatis Melica''.<ref name=\"Korth\" /> The earliest extant print of the hymn, in the ''Praxis Pietatis Melica'' of 1648, indicates Wolfgang Dachstein's 16th-century \"An Wasserflüssen Babylon\" melody as its singing tune:<ref name=\"Julian\">{{cite book |last1=Julian |first1=John |date=1901 |chapter=Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld |title=[[:commons:Category:Dictionary of Hymnology|A Dictionary of Hymnology]] |volume=[[:File:A Dictionary of Hymnology Vol. 1.pdf|I]] |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |pages=[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/A_Dictionary_of_Hymnology_Vol._1.pdf/page343-972px-A_Dictionary_of_Hymnology_Vol._1.pdf.jpg 325]–[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/A_Dictionary_of_Hymnology_Vol._1.pdf/page344-981px-A_Dictionary_of_Hymnology_Vol._1.pdf.jpg 326] |ref=harv}}</ref>

The hymn was originally used as a [[Eucharist in Lutheranism|communion]] song.<ref name=\"Axmacher\" /> Later it was described as \"the masterpiece of all Passion hymns\".<ref name=\"Julian\" />

\"Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld\" has been characterised as a paraphrase of the [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]].<ref name=\"Korth\" /> The hymn text is based on [[Isaiah&nbsp;53]]:4–7 and [[John&nbsp;1]]:29.<ref name=\"Julian\" /><ref name=\"Gerhardt\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=qGxFAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA19 V.

English translations of the hymn include \"A Lamb goes uncomplaining forth\".<ref name=\"Julian\" />

The '''National Film and Sound Archive of Australia''' ('''NFSA''') is [[Australia]]'s audiovisual archive, responsible for developing, preserving, maintaining, promoting and providing access to a national collection of [[film]], [[television]], sound, [[radio]], video games, new media, and related documents and artefacts. The collection ranges from works created in the late nineteenth century when the recorded sound and film industries were in their infancy, to those made in the present day.

The NFSA collection first started as the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (within the then [[National Library of Australia|Commonwealth National Library]]) in 1935, becoming an independent cultural organisation in 1984. On 3 October, Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] officially opened the NFSA's headquarters in Canberra.

==History of the organisation==

The work of the Archive can be officially dated to the establishment of the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (part of the then [[National Library of Australia|Commonwealth National Library]]) by a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] decision on 11 December 1935.

After being part of the National Library of Australia, and its predecessors, for nearly 50 years, the National Film and Sound Archive was created as a separate [[Commonwealth]] collecting institution through an announcement in Parliament on 5 April 1984 that took immediate effect.<ref name=\"NAA CA 4123\">{{citation|title=CA 4123: National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+4123|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> At that time, an Advisory Committee was established to guide the institution.

On 21 June 1999, the name was changed to ScreenSound Australia, the National Collection of Screen and Sound, and changed again in early 2000 to ScreenSound Australia, National Screen and Sound Archive. It reverted to its original name, National Film and Sound Archive, in December 2004.

Meanwhile,  consequent on amendments to the [[Australian Film Commission]] Act which took effect on 1 July 2003, it ceased to be a semi-autonomous entity within the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and became an integrated branch, later a division, of the Australian Film Commission, a funding and promotional body.

In 2007, the Liberal Government announced the creation of a new agency to be called [[Screen Australia]] which would incorporate the main functions of the Film Finance Corporation, the Australian Film Commission (including the Archive), and [[Film Australia]]. Following elections in November 2007, however, the new Labor Government implemented an election promise to allow the NFSA to become a [[statutory authority]], similar to other major cultural institutions including the [[National Library of Australia]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[National Museum of Australia]]. The NFSA Act became law on 20 March 2008 and came into effect on 1 July 2008, with celebrations held that day.<ref>Massola, James (2008) \"Innovative film sets the scene for the Archive's new role\", ''[[The Canberra Times]]'', 2008-07-02, p. 7</ref>

== Collections ==

The NFSA collection includes more than 3 million items, encompassing sound, radio, television, film, video games and new media. In addition to discs, films, videos, audio tapes, phonograph cylinders and wire recordings, the Collection includes supporting documents and artefacts, such as personal papers and organisational records, photographs, posters, lobby cards, publicity, scripts, costumes, props, memorabilia and sound, video and film equipment.

Notable holdings include:
* The Cinesound [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] Australian Newsreel Collection, 1929–1975: comprehensive collection of 4,000 [[newsreel]] films and documentaries representing news stories covering all major events in Australian history, sport and entertainment from 1929 to 1975. Inscribed on the Australian Memory of the World Register in 2003.
* ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', 1906: directed by [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]], is the first full-length narrative [[feature film]] produced anywhere in the world, and was inscribed onto the International [http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22621&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html Memory of the World ] Register in 2007.
* the earliest surviving Australian sound recording, [https://www.nfsa.gov.au/collection/curated/hen-convention-thomas-rome \"The Hen Convention\"], a novelty song by vocalist John James Villiers, with piano accompaniment, recorded by Thomas Rome in 1896.
* the earliest surviving film shot in Australia, [https://www.nfsa.gov.au/collection/curated/patineur-grotesque ''Patineur Grotesque''], footage of a man performing on rollerskates for a crowd in Prince Alfred Park, Sydney in 1896. It was shot by Marius Sestier.
* original costumes from Australian films such as ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'', ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'', ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', and ''[[My Brilliant Career]]''.

A 2010 study compared the curatorial practices of accessioning and cataloging for NFSA collections and for [[YouTube]] with regard to access to older Australian television programs. It found the NFSA to be stronger in current affairs and older programs, and YouTube stronger in game shows, lifestyle programs, and \"human interest\" material (births, marriages, and deaths). YouTube cataloging was found to have fewer broken links than the NFSA collection, and YouTube [[metadata]] could be searched more intuitively. The NFSA was found to generally provide more useful reference information about production and broadcast dates.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=Alan|title=YouTube versus the National Film and Sound Archive: Which Is the More Useful Resource for Historians of Australian Television?|journal=[[Television & New Media]]|year=2011|volume=12|issue=2|page=154}}</ref>

The NFSA announced plans to collect Australian-developed video games as part of its collection starting in 2019 with new titles to be added on an annual basis.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/national-film-and-sound-archive-of-australia-to-collect-preserve-aussie-video-games | title = National Film and Sound Archive of Australia to Collect, Preserve Aussie Video Games | first=  Luke | last = Reilly | date =September 26, 2019 | accessdate = September 26, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>

== History of the building ==
<!-- This is a SUMMARY. Please don't add new information or details here, but instead at the main article [[Australian Institute of Anatomy]]! -->
{{main|Australian Institute of Anatomy}}
[[File:National Film and Sound Archive viewed near McCoy Circuit.jpg|right|thumb|The National Film and Sound Archive fronts onto McCoy Circuit.]]
The building to which the Archive moved in 1984 was the home of the Australian Institute of Anatomy from 1931-84. Originally it held the anatomy collection of [[William Colin Mackenzie|Sir Colin MacKenzie]]. This collection included the heart of the celebrated Australian racehorse [[Phar Lap]].

The building is often classified as [[art deco]], though its overall architectural style is technically \"Late 20th Century Stripped Classical\", the style of ancient Greece and Rome but simplified and modernised.  It features a symmetrical façade, a horizontal skyline, classical columns and a central entrance. The decorative foyer features images of native flora, fauna and Aboriginal art and motifs. Face masks of well-known scientists from the late 19th century and early 20th century are featured on the foyer’s walls as a reminder of its previous incarnation as the Institute of Anatomy.

The building also features a landscaped courtyard, theatre and research centre. In 1999, the building was extended to accommodate the Archive's growth. The new wing’s design is in keeping with the Art Deco style of the main structure with details and finishes to match the original.

The '''National Film and Sound Archive of Australia''' ('''NFSA''') is [[Australia]]'s audiovisual archive, responsible for developing, preserving, maintaining, promoting and providing access to a national collection of [[film]], [[television]], sound, [[radio]], video games, new media, and related documents and artefacts. The collection ranges from works created in the late nineteenth century when the recorded sound and film industries were in their infancy, to those made in the present day.

The NFSA collection first started as the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (within the then [[National Library of Australia|Commonwealth National Library]]) in 1935, becoming an independent cultural organisation in 1984. On 3 October, Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] officially opened the NFSA's headquarters in Canberra.

==History of the organisation==

The work of the Archive can be officially dated to the establishment of the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (part of the then [[National Library of Australia|Commonwealth National Library]]) by a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] decision on 11 December 1935.

After being part of the National Library of Australia, and its predecessors, for nearly 50 years, the National Film and Sound Archive was created as a separate [[Commonwealth]] collecting institution through an announcement in Parliament on 5 April 1984 that took immediate effect.<ref name=\"NAA CA 4123\">{{citation|title=CA 4123: National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+4123|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> At that time, an Advisory Committee was established to guide the institution.

On 21 June 1999, the name was changed to ScreenSound Australia, the National Collection of Screen and Sound, and changed again in early 2000 to ScreenSound Australia, National Screen and Sound Archive. It reverted to its original name, National Film and Sound Archive, in December 2004.

Meanwhile,  consequent on amendments to the [[Australian Film Commission]] Act which took effect on 1 July 2003, it ceased to be a semi-autonomous entity within the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and became an integrated branch, later a division, of the Australian Film Commission, a funding and promotional body.

In 2007, the Liberal Government announced the creation of a new agency to be called [[Screen Australia]] which would incorporate the main functions of the Film Finance Corporation, the Australian Film Commission (including the Archive), and [[Film Australia]]. Following elections in November 2007, however, the new Labor Government implemented an election promise to allow the NFSA to become a statutory authority, similar to other major cultural institutions including the [[National Library of Australia]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[National Museum of Australia]]. The NFSA Act became law on 20 March 2008 and came into effect on 1 July 2008, with celebrations held that day.<ref>Massola, James (2008) \"Innovative film sets the scene for the Archive's new role\", ''[[The Canberra Times]]'', 2008-07-02, p. 7</ref>

== Collections ==

The NFSA collection includes more than 3 million items, encompassing sound, radio, television, film, video games and new media. In addition to discs, films, videos, audio tapes, phonograph cylinders and wire recordings, the Collection includes supporting documents and artefacts, such as personal papers and organisational records, photographs, posters, lobby cards, publicity, scripts, costumes, props, memorabilia and sound, video and film equipment.

Notable holdings include:
* The Cinesound [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] Australian Newsreel Collection, 1929–1975: comprehensive collection of 4,000 [[newsreel]] films and documentaries representing news stories covering all major events in Australian history, sport and entertainment from 1929 to 1975. Inscribed on the Australian Memory of the World Register in 2003.
* ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', 1906: directed by [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]], is the first full-length narrative [[feature film]] produced anywhere in the world, and was inscribed onto the International [http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22621&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html Memory of the World ] Register in 2007.
* the earliest surviving Australian sound recording, [https://www.nfsa.gov.au/collection/curated/hen-convention-thomas-rome \"The Hen Convention\"], a novelty song by vocalist John James Villiers, with piano accompaniment, recorded by Thomas Rome in 1896.
* the earliest surviving film shot in Australia, [https://www.nfsa.gov.au/collection/curated/patineur-grotesque ''Patineur Grotesque''], footage of a man performing on rollerskates for a crowd in Prince Alfred Park, Sydney in 1896. It was shot by Marius Sestier.
* original costumes from Australian films such as ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'', ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'', ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', and ''[[My Brilliant Career]]''.

A 2010 study compared the curatorial practices of accessioning and cataloging for NFSA collections and for [[YouTube]] with regard to access to older Australian television programs. It found the NFSA to be stronger in current affairs and older programs, and YouTube stronger in game shows, lifestyle programs, and \"human interest\" material (births, marriages, and deaths). YouTube cataloging was found to have fewer broken links than the NFSA collection, and YouTube [[metadata]] could be searched more intuitively. The NFSA was found to generally provide more useful reference information about production and broadcast dates.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=Alan|title=YouTube versus the National Film and Sound Archive: Which Is the More Useful Resource for Historians of Australian Television?|journal=[[Television & New Media]]|year=2011|volume=12|issue=2|page=154}}</ref>

The NFSA announced plans to collect Australian-developed video games as part of its collection starting in 2019 with new titles to be added on an annual basis.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/national-film-and-sound-archive-of-australia-to-collect-preserve-aussie-video-games | title = National Film and Sound Archive of Australia to Collect, Preserve Aussie Video Games | first=  Luke | last = Reilly | date =September 26, 2019 | accessdate = September 26, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>

== History of the building ==
<!-- This is a SUMMARY. Please don't add new information or details here, but instead at the main article [[Australian Institute of Anatomy]]! -->
{{main|Australian Institute of Anatomy}}
[[File:National Film and Sound Archive viewed near McCoy Circuit.jpg|right|thumb|The National Film and Sound Archive fronts onto McCoy Circuit.]]
The building to which the Archive moved in 1984 was the home of the Australian Institute of Anatomy from 1931-84. Originally it held the anatomy collection of [[William Colin Mackenzie|Sir Colin MacKenzie]]. This collection included the heart of the celebrated Australian racehorse [[Phar Lap]].

The building is often classified as [[art deco]], though its overall architectural style is technically \"Late 20th Century Stripped Classical\", the style of ancient Greece and Rome but simplified and modernised.  It features a symmetrical façade, a horizontal skyline, classical columns and a central entrance. The decorative foyer features images of native flora, fauna and Aboriginal art and motifs. Face masks of well-known scientists from the late 19th century and early 20th century are featured on the foyer’s walls as a reminder of its previous incarnation as the Institute of Anatomy.

The building also features a landscaped courtyard, theatre and research centre. In 1999, the building was extended to accommodate the Archive's growth. The new wing’s design is in keeping with the Art Deco style of the main structure with details and finishes to match the original.

'''Hatton William Sumners''' (May 30, 1875 &ndash; April 19, 1962) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman from the [[Dallas, Texas]] area, serving from 1913 to 1947. He rose to become Chairman of the powerful [[House Judiciary Committee]].

==Early life and career==
Hatton Sumners, the second of three children of William A. and Anna Elizabeth Walker Sumners, was born near [[Fayetteville, Tennessee]] on May 30, 1875. He grew up on a farm in Lincoln County and attended local schools.<ref name=Sumners>[https://baylorarchives.cuadra.com/cgi-bin/starfetch.exe?QgID14lsjbYp8zWJvsu0Wt8HlfdX6ps3oLYSzUh9HPLokzGHPuBb3ixgF6QcwJkjAaMaKFHQXxMOGIWJlR48sGx@nuLe@m1XnRv@p1uDMN4/0007e3.xml Hatton Sumners Papers] #91, Baylor Collections of Political Materials, W. R. Poage Legislative Library, Baylor University.</ref>

In 1893, he moved to [[Garland, Texas]], near [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], at a time when the city was beginning to industrialize and was a booming business center. In 1895, as a 20-year-old newcomer to Dallas County, Sumners persuaded the Dallas City Attorney, Alfred P. Wozencraft, to let him \"[[read law]]\" in his office, a common alternative to law school.<ref>[http://www.oldred.org/history/social_history_1.html Old Red Museum, Dallas County Historical Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629012503/http://www.oldred.org/history/social_history_1.html |date=June 29, 2007 }}</ref> Sumners was admitted to the bar in 1897 and commenced practice in Dallas.

Sumners was elected as prosecuting attorney of [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] in 1900, serving two non-consecutive terms.  As [[prosecutor]], he brought charges against gamblers in an attempt to clean up Dallas.  As a result of his investigations and his campaign against drinking and vice, Sumners was not re-elected in 1902.<ref name=TexasHandbook>

</ref> He continued his campaign against gambling and voting irregularities in Dallas, ultimately influencing state legislation enacted to reform the system. After that, Sumners was elected Dallas County prosecutor again.  Instead of continuing in that position for additional terms, he accepted the presidency of the district and county attorneys' association of Texas in 1906 and 1907, where he campaigned against betting interests.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>

==Service in Congress==
Sumners ran for and was elected in 1912 to an [[Texas's At-large congressional district|at-large seat]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the Sixty-third Congress, taking office on March 4, 1913.  He was the first of the 132 freshmen congressmen in that Congress to get a bill through the House; the bill made Dallas a port of entry for US Customs.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>  In 1914, he ran for the seat from [[Texas's 5th congressional district]], which included [[Dallas]], Ellis, [[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall]], Hill, and Bosque counties, and he was elected.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>

Sumners was a lifetime defender of states' rights. He was quoted as saying, \"There are but two sorts of government – a government by the people and a government the voice of which comes from the top downward. With us more and more, the voice of the government is spoken in Washington downward to the people. What we need in America is a people conscious of their responsibility, conscious of their power, conscious they are the government and then get on the job.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sumners|first=Hatton|date=February 19, 1942|title=We the People|url=|journal=National Association of Retail Druggists Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

In the 1920s, Sumners spoke out against the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]], introduced by a Republican congressman from [[St. Louis|Saint Louis, Missouri]]. Sumners said that the bill's sponsors did not have adequate statistics to prove their case (that lynching should be a federal crime), that the bill would increase racial mob violence. Sumners also questioned the constitutionality of the bill and posited the bill ultimately impinged on [[states' rights]].<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/05/98966810.pdf \"Filibuster Delays Anti-Lynching Bill,\" ''New York Times,'' January 5, 1922]</ref> He believed part of the solution to end lynching would start with local sentiment.

Speaking on the House floor while some African Americans watched from the balcony, Sumners attacked the bill using racial stereotypes: \"Only a short time ago... their ancestors roamed the jungles of Africa in absolute savagery…[Y]ou do not know where the beast is among them.

Sumners served on the powerful [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives]] and was appointed regularly to investigate allegations of corruption among [[federal judge]]s. He served on the impeachment committees for three federal judges: [[George W. English]], [[Harold Louderback]], and [[Halsted L.

In 1924, Sumners became acquainted with U.S. Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft]] and worked with him to pass a bill amending the judicial code, also known as the \"Judges Bill.\" Sumners appeared before the Supreme Court several times on behalf of Congress, including for the Pocket Veto Case of 1928, the McCracken Contempt Case of 1934, and the Municipal Bankruptcy Act Case of 1936.<ref name=\"Sumners\" /> Sumners became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1932.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" /> In 1934, he drafted a constitution for the [[Philippines]], developing a reputation as an authority on constitutional law.<ref name=\"Sumners\" /> Sumners was responsible for bringing the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Federal Reserve Bank]] to Dallas.<ref name=\":0\" /> As a loyal Democrat, he supported much of President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislation.

He drew the line at Roosevelt's plan to expand the US Supreme Court, after the Court began to rule that key parts of the New Deal were unconstitutional. Roosevelt announced his so-called [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]] in 1936. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sumners discreetly worked in opposition.

He and two other Texans, Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Senator [[Tom Connally|Thomas T.

Sumners, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, decided that the reorganization bill would not come up in his committee, because he wanted to avoid it being sent to and passing in the full House. He traveled around the country making speeches about constitutional government. The bill never left his committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jzc01|title=COURT-PACKING PLAN OF 1937|last=PATENAUDE|first=LIONEL V.|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>

He faced two serious opponents in the 1938 election, but was re-elected and was not seriously challenged again.

In 1945, Sumners responded strongly to the lynching of Jesse James Payne, a prisoner in custody of Sheriff Lonnie T. Davis in [[Madison, Florida|Madison, FL]]. Sheriff Davis was investigated for any wrongdoing associated with the lynching of Payne.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jack.

The act governs the way administrative agencies of the federal government may propose and establish regulations and grants the judiciary oversight over all agency actions.<ref>USC §706</ref>

In 1946, Sumners announced he would not seek re-election; he served seventeen consecutive terms.

He was a member of the [[Henry Pomeroy Miller|Miller group]] in Washington.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Caro |last=Caro |first=Robert A. |series=[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson]] |title=The Path to Power |year=1982 |publisher=[[Alfred A.

== War Powers Act of 1941 ==
Sumners introduced the [[War Powers Act of 1941]]. This act gave President Roosevelt increased powers to execute [[World War II]] in a more efficient manner. This legislation was passed by both houses and signed into law in three days.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Public Law 354 |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/77/publaw-354.pdf|website=legisworks.org|access-date=2019-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017131142/http://legisworks.org/congress/77/publaw-354.pdf |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |via=Wayback Machine}}</ref>

== Response to lynchings in Mississippi ==
While Sumners started his time in Congress as a man viewed by some as unconcerned by racial violence, he was outspoken against states and figures he viewed as ineffective in stopping lynching. Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to lynchings in Mississippi in 1931, “What we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.”<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>

In the wake of the lynchings of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels in 1937, Sumners was asked to speak about anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined, writing, “It has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  The meeting would be construed as being opposed to anti-lynching legislation; whereas, to be effective it should be a meeting opposed to lynching. This suggestion is very important…everything should indicate that you are trying to stop mob violence and that this is the whole purpose of the meeting.”<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. L. W. Alford, Chairman of the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, May 4, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>

In reference to the 1937 lynchings, an outraged Sumners sent the Governor of Mississippi a telegram that stated “If the press reports are even approximately correct, and they seem to be, these lynchings, both with regard to lynchers and the officers involved, were as dastardly a crime as cowardice could devise and brutality execute. It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment.”<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now-infamous lynchings including the sheriffs, writing, “The turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.”<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A. A. Carmichael, May 25, 1937, DHS, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>

==Final years==
After leaving Congress, Sumners was the Director of Research for the [[Southwestern Legal Foundation]]. Sumners formed the Hatton W. Sumners Foundation in 1949, which still awards loans and scholarships to worthy students.  The foundation is also a sponsor of the [[Internet]] project 'Vote Smart.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=93666|title=Project Vote Smart|publisher=votesmart.org|accessdate=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Organizations like the [[YMCA]], the Red Cross, and his local church also benefitted from Sumner's generosity.<ref name=Sumners/>

Sumners received an honorary doctor of laws from [[Southern Methodist University]] and the [[American Bar Association Medal]].  He died on April 19, 1962. After services in the Highland Park Methodist Church in Dallas, he was interred in the [[Knights of Pythias]] Cemetery in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]], Texas.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>

==Books authored==
Sumners wrote ''The Private Citizen and His Democracy'' in 1959.

'''Hatton William Sumners''' (May 30, 1875 &ndash; April 19, 1962) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman from the [[Dallas, Texas]] area, serving from 1913 to 1947. He rose to become Chairman of the powerful [[House Judiciary Committee]].

==Early life and career==
Hatton Sumners, the second of three children of William A. and Anna Elizabeth Walker Sumners, was born near [[Fayetteville, Tennessee]] on May 30, 1875. He grew up on a farm in Lincoln County and attended local schools.<ref name=Sumners>[https://baylorarchives.cuadra.com/cgi-bin/starfetch.exe?QgID14lsjbYp8zWJvsu0Wt8HlfdX6ps3oLYSzUh9HPLokzGHPuBb3ixgF6QcwJkjAaMaKFHQXxMOGIWJlR48sGx@nuLe@m1XnRv@p1uDMN4/0007e3.xml Hatton Sumners Papers] #91, Baylor Collections of Political Materials, W. R. Poage Legislative Library, Baylor University.</ref>

In 1893, he moved to [[Garland, Texas]], near [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], at a time when the city was beginning to industrialize and was a booming business center. In 1895, as a 20-year-old newcomer to Dallas County, Sumners persuaded the Dallas City Attorney, Alfred P. Wozencraft, to let him \"[[read law]]\" in his office, a common alternative to law school.<ref>[http://www.oldred.org/history/social_history_1.html Old Red Museum, Dallas County Historical Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629012503/http://www.oldred.org/history/social_history_1.html |date=June 29, 2007 }}</ref> Sumners was admitted to the bar in 1897 and commenced practice in Dallas.

Sumners was elected as prosecuting attorney of [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] in 1900, serving two non-consecutive terms.  As [[prosecutor]], he brought charges against gamblers in an attempt to clean up Dallas.  As a result of his investigations and his campaign against drinking and vice, Sumners was not re-elected in 1902.<ref name=TexasHandbook>

</ref> He continued his campaign against gambling and voting irregularities in Dallas, ultimately influencing state legislation enacted to reform the system. After that, Sumners was elected Dallas County prosecutor again.  Instead of continuing in that position for additional terms, he accepted the presidency of the district and county attorneys' association of Texas in 1906 and 1907, where he campaigned against betting interests.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>

==Service in Congress==
Sumners ran for and was elected in 1912 to an [[Texas's At-large congressional district|at-large seat]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the Sixty-third Congress, taking office on March 4, 1913.  He was the first of the 132 freshmen congressmen in that Congress to get a bill through the House; the bill made Dallas a port of entry for US Customs.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>  In 1914, he ran for the seat from [[Texas's 5th congressional district]], which included [[Dallas]], Ellis, [[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall]], Hill, and Bosque counties, and he was elected.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>

Sumners was a lifetime defender of states' rights. He was quoted as saying, \"There are but two sorts of government – a government by the people and a government the voice of which comes from the top downward. With us more and more, the voice of the government is spoken in Washington downward to the people. What we need in America is a people conscious of their responsibility, conscious of their power, conscious they are the government and then get on the job.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sumners|first=Hatton|date=February 19, 1942|title=We the People|url=|journal=National Association of Retail Druggists Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment.”<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now-infamous lynchings including the sheriffs, writing, “The turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.”<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A. A. Carmichael, May 25, 1937, DHS, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>

==Final years==
After leaving Congress, Sumners was the Director of Research for the [[Southwestern Legal Foundation]]. Sumners formed the Hatton W.

Sumners received an honorary doctor of laws from [[Southern Methodist University]] and the [[American Bar Association Medal]].  He died on April 19, 1962.

'''Hatton William Sumners''' (May 30, 1875 &ndash; April 19, 1962) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman from the [[Dallas, Texas]] area, serving from 1913 to 1947. He rose to become Chairman of the powerful [[House Judiciary Committee]].

==Early life and career==
Hatton Sumners, the second of three children of William A. and Anna Elizabeth Walker Sumners, was born near [[Fayetteville, Tennessee]] on May 30, 1875. He grew up on a farm in Lincoln County and attended local schools.<ref name=Sumners>[https://baylorarchives.cuadra.com/cgi-bin/starfetch.exe?QgID14lsjbYp8zWJvsu0Wt8HlfdX6ps3oLYSzUh9HPLokzGHPuBb3ixgF6QcwJkjAaMaKFHQXxMOGIWJlR48sGx@nuLe@m1XnRv@p1uDMN4/0007e3.xml Hatton Sumners Papers] #91, Baylor Collections of Political Materials, W. R. Poage Legislative Library, Baylor University.</ref>

In 1893, he moved to [[Garland, Texas]], near [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], at a time when the city was beginning to industrialize and was a booming business center. In 1895, as a 20-year-old newcomer to Dallas County, Sumners persuaded the Dallas City Attorney, Alfred P. Wozencraft, to let him \"[[read law]]\" in his office, a common alternative to law school.<ref>[http://www.oldred.org/history/social_history_1.html Old Red Museum, Dallas County Historical Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629012503/http://www.oldred.org/history/social_history_1.html |date=June 29, 2007 }}</ref> Sumners was admitted to the bar in 1897 and commenced practice in Dallas.

Sumners was elected as prosecuting attorney of [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] in 1900, serving two non-consecutive terms.  As [[prosecutor]], he brought charges against gamblers in an attempt to clean up Dallas.  As a result of his investigations and his campaign against drinking and vice, Sumners was not re-elected in 1902.<ref name=TexasHandbook>

</ref> He continued his campaign against gambling and voting irregularities in Dallas, ultimately influencing state legislation enacted to reform the system. After that, Sumners was elected Dallas County prosecutor again.  Instead of continuing in that position for additional terms, he accepted the presidency of the district and county attorneys' association of Texas in 1906 and 1907, where he campaigned against betting interests.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>

==Service in Congress==
Sumners ran for and was elected in 1912 to an [[Texas's At-large congressional district|at-large seat]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the Sixty-third Congress, taking office on March 4, 1913.  He was the first of the 132 freshmen congressmen in that Congress to get a bill through the House; the bill made Dallas a port of entry for US Customs.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>  In 1914, he ran for the seat from [[Texas's 5th congressional district]], which included [[Dallas]], Ellis, [[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall]], Hill, and Bosque counties, and he was elected.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>

Sumners was a lifetime defender of states' rights. He was quoted as saying, \"There are but two sorts of government – a government by the people and a government the voice of which comes from the top downward. With us more and more, the voice of the government is spoken in Washington downward to the people. What we need in America is a people conscious of their responsibility, conscious of their power, conscious they are the government and then get on the job.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sumners|first=Hatton|date=February 19, 1942|title=We the People|url=|journal=National Association of Retail Druggists Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

In the 1920s, Sumners spoke out against the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]], introduced by a Republican congressman from [[St. Louis|Saint Louis, Missouri]]. Sumners said that the bill's sponsors did not have adequate statistics to prove their case (that lynching should be a federal crime), that the bill would increase racial mob violence. Sumners also questioned the constitutionality of the bill and posited the bill ultimately impinged on [[states' rights]].<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/05/98966810.pdf \"Filibuster Delays Anti-Lynching Bill,\" ''New York Times,'' January 5, 1922]</ref> He believed part of the solution to end lynching would start with local sentiment. In his zeal to protect states’ rights he stated the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill “would mark the greatest advance toward the obliteration of the states as independent governmental agencies which has yet been registered by any expression of legislative or public attitude.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Charlie|date=January 7, 1922|title=Dyer's Arguments in Favor of Antilynching bill; Answer Summers [sic] of Texas, Chief Opponent|url=|journal=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> He also marked the bill as a direct threat to local and state responsibility stating, “This bill strikes at the very heart of state sovereignty and the sense of local responsibility.  When you destroy these, what sort of protection have the people who live in a community,<ref>January 4, 1922 Congressional Record , page 803</ref>” and “it permits the Federal Government to lay coercive hands on states, and establishes a precedent of sweeping encroachment on states’ rights.\"<ref>January 4, 1922 United States Congressional Record, page 793</ref> 

Speaking on the House floor while some African Americans watched from the balcony, Sumners attacked the bill using racial stereotypes: \"Only a short time ago... their ancestors roamed the jungles of Africa in absolute savagery…[Y]ou do not know where the beast is among them. Somewhere in that black mass of people is the man who would outrage your wife or your child, and every man who lives in the country knows it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kevincmurphy.com/uatw-legacies-shame.html|title=Uphill All the Way: The Fortunes of Progressivism, 1919-1929 (Copyright KcM 2013)|website=www.kevincmurphy.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WBqedYHYMXAC&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22their+ancestors+roamed+the+jungles+of+Africa+in+absolute+savagery%22#v=onepage&q=%22their+ancestors+roamed+the+jungles+of+Africa+in+absolute+savagery%22&f=false|title=At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America|first=Philip|last=Dray|date=18 December 2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|via=Google Books|isbn=9780307430663}}</ref> 

Sumners served on the powerful [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives]] and was appointed regularly to investigate allegations of corruption among [[federal judge]]s. He served on the impeachment committees for three federal judges: [[George W. English]], [[Harold Louderback]], and [[Halsted L. Ritter]].<ref>Congressional Biography</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsu04|title=SUMNERS, HATTON WILLIAM|last=MONROE|first=MARY CATHERINE|date=2010-06-15|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>

In 1924, Sumners became acquainted with U.S. Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft]] and worked with him to pass a bill amending the judicial code, also known as the \"Judges Bill.\" Sumners appeared before the Supreme Court several times on behalf of Congress, including for the Pocket Veto Case of 1928, the McCracken Contempt Case of 1934, and the Municipal Bankruptcy Act Case of 1936.<ref name=\"Sumners\" /> Sumners became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1932.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" /> In 1934, he drafted a constitution for the [[Philippines]], developing a reputation as an authority on constitutional law.<ref name=\"Sumners\" /> Sumners was responsible for bringing the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Federal Reserve Bank]] to Dallas.<ref name=\":0\" /> As a loyal Democrat, he supported much of President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislation.

He drew the line at Roosevelt's plan to expand the US Supreme Court, after the Court began to rule that key parts of the New Deal were unconstitutional. Roosevelt announced his so-called [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]] in 1936. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sumners discreetly worked in opposition. When the plan's bill was in trouble, Sumners reportedly said, \"Boys, here's where I cash in my chips,\" referring to his waning support for the President.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" />  Ultimately, Chairman Sumners came out formally against the Court-packing plan. He and two other Texans, Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Senator [[Tom Connally|Thomas T. Connally]], led the fight against the court plan because they saw the president’s request as a symbolic desire for unlimited power. Sumners, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, decided that the reorganization bill would not come up in his committee, because he wanted to avoid it being sent to and passing in the full House. He traveled around the country making speeches about constitutional government. The bill never left his committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jzc01|title=COURT-PACKING PLAN OF 1937|last=PATENAUDE|first=LIONEL V.|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>

He faced two serious opponents in the 1938 election, but was re-elected and was not seriously challenged again.

In 1945, Sumners responded strongly to the lynching of Jesse James Payne, a prisoner in custody of Sheriff Lonnie T. Davis in [[Madison, Florida|Madison, FL]]. Sheriff Davis was investigated for any wrongdoing associated with the lynching of Payne.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jack. E.|date=January 1990|title=\"Whitewash\" in Florida: The Lynching of Jesse James Payne and Its Aftermath|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|volume=68|issue=3|pages=277–298|jstor=30146708}}</ref> Upon hearing the news, Sumners warned Florida Governor [[Millard Caldwell]], “If these facts are true, or approximately true, this sheriff is not only guilty of a violation of official duty, of a cowardly act, but he is guilty of a direct assault upon the sovereignty of the state.”<ref>Personal letter to then Florida Governor Millard Caldwell, October 17, 1945, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-116.</ref>

Sumners chaired the House Judiciary Committee when the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] passed on June 11, 1946. The act governs the way administrative agencies of the federal government may propose and establish regulations and grants the judiciary oversight over all agency actions.<ref>USC §706</ref>

In 1946, Sumners announced he would not seek re-election; he served seventeen consecutive terms.

He was a member of the [[Henry Pomeroy Miller|Miller group]] in Washington.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Caro |last=Caro |first=Robert A. |series=[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson]] |title=The Path to Power |year=1982 |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-0394499734 |page=271}}</ref>

== War Powers Act of 1941 ==
Sumners introduced the [[War Powers Act of 1941]]. This act gave President Roosevelt increased powers to execute [[World War II]] in a more efficient manner. This legislation was passed by both houses and signed into law in three days.<ref>{{Cite web |title:Public Law 354 |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/77/publaw-354.pdf|website=legisworks.org|access-date=2019-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017131142/http://legisworks.org/congress/77/publaw-354.pdf |via=Wayback Machine}}</ref>

== Response to lynchings in Mississippi ==
While Sumners started his time in Congress as a man viewed by some as unconcerned by racial violence, he was outspoken against states and figures he viewed as ineffective in stopping lynching. Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to lynchings in Mississippi in 1931, “What we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.”<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>

In the wake of the lynchings of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels in 1937, Sumners was asked to speak about anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined, writing, “It has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  The meeting would be construed as being opposed to anti-lynching legislation; whereas, to be effective it should be a meeting opposed to lynching. This suggestion is very important…everything should indicate that you are trying to stop mob violence and that this is the whole purpose of the meeting.”<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. L. W. Alford, Chairman of the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, May 4, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>

In reference to the 1937 lynchings, an outraged Sumners sent the Governor of Mississippi a telegram that stated “If the press reports are even approximately correct, and they seem to be, these lynchings, both with regard to lynchers and the officers involved, were as dastardly a crime as cowardice could devise and brutality execute. It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment.”<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now-infamous lynchings including the sheriffs, writing, “The turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.”<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A. A. Carmichael, May 25, 1937, DHS, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>

==Final years==
After leaving Congress, Sumners was the Director of Research for the [[Southwestern Legal Foundation]]. Sumners formed the Hatton W. Sumners Foundation in 1949, which still awards loans and scholarships to worthy students.  The foundation is also a sponsor of the [[Internet]] project 'Vote Smart.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=93666|title=Project Vote Smart|publisher=votesmart.org|accessdate=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Organizations like the [[YMCA]], the Red Cross, and his local church also benefitted from Sumner's generosity.<ref name=Sumners/>

Sumners received an honorary doctor of laws from [[Southern Methodist University]] and the [[American Bar Association Medal]].  He died on April 19, 1962. After services in the Highland Park Methodist Church in Dallas, he was interred in the [[Knights of Pythias]] Cemetery in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]], Texas.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>

In his zeal to protect states’ rights he stated the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill “would mark the greatest advance toward the obliteration of the states as independent governmental agencies which has yet been registered by any expression of legislative or public attitude.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Charlie|date=January 7, 1922|title=Dyer's Arguments in Favor of Antilynching bill; Answer Summers [sic] of Texas, Chief Opponent|url=|journal=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> He also marked the bill as a direct threat to local and state responsibility stating, “This bill strikes at the very heart of state sovereignty and the sense of local responsibility.  When you destroy these, what sort of protection have the people who live in a community,<ref>January 4, 1922 Congressional Record , page 803</ref>” and “it permits the Federal Government to lay coercive hands on states, and establishes a precedent of sweeping encroachment on states’ rights.\"<ref>January 4, 1922 United States Congressional Record, page 793</ref> 

Speaking on the House floor while some African Americans watched from the balcony, Sumners attacked the bill using racial stereotypes: \"Only a short time ago... their ancestors roamed the jungles of Africa in absolute savagery…[Y]ou do not know where the beast is among them. Somewhere in that black mass of people is the man who would outrage your wife or your child, and every man who lives in the country knows it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kevincmurphy.com/uatw-legacies-shame.html|title=Uphill All the Way: The Fortunes of Progressivism, 1919-1929 (Copyright KcM 2013)|website=www.kevincmurphy.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WBqedYHYMXAC&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22their+ancestors+roamed+the+jungles+of+Africa+in+absolute+savagery%22#v=onepage&q=%22their+ancestors+roamed+the+jungles+of+Africa+in+absolute+savagery%22&f=false|title=At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America|first=Philip|last=Dray|date=18 December 2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|via=Google Books|isbn=9780307430663}}</ref> 

Sumners served on the powerful [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives]] and was appointed regularly to investigate allegations of corruption among [[federal judge]]s. He served on the impeachment committees for three federal judges: [[George W. English]], [[Harold Louderback]], and [[Halsted L. Ritter]].<ref>Congressional Biography</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsu04|title=SUMNERS, HATTON WILLIAM|last=MONROE|first=MARY CATHERINE|date=2010-06-15|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>

In 1924, Sumners became acquainted with U.S. Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft]] and worked with him to pass a bill amending the judicial code, also known as the \"Judges Bill.\" Sumners appeared before the Supreme Court several times on behalf of Congress, including for the Pocket Veto Case of 1928, the McCracken Contempt Case of 1934, and the Municipal Bankruptcy Act Case of 1936.<ref name=\"Sumners\" /> Sumners became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1932.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" /> In 1934, he drafted a constitution for the [[Philippines]], developing a reputation as an authority on constitutional law.<ref name=\"Sumners\" /> Sumners was responsible for bringing the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Federal Reserve Bank]] to Dallas.<ref name=\":0\" /> As a loyal Democrat, he supported much of President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislation.

He drew the line at Roosevelt's plan to expand the US Supreme Court, after the Court began to rule that key parts of the New Deal were unconstitutional. Roosevelt announced his so-called [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]] in 1936. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sumners discreetly worked in opposition. When the plan's bill was in trouble, Sumners reportedly said, \"Boys, here's where I cash in my chips,\" referring to his waning support for the President.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" />  Ultimately, Chairman Sumners came out formally against the Court-packing plan. He and two other Texans, Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Senator [[Tom Connally|Thomas T. Connally]], led the fight against the court plan because they saw the president’s request as a symbolic desire for unlimited power. Sumners, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, decided that the reorganization bill would not come up in his committee, because he wanted to avoid it being sent to and passing in the full House. He traveled around the country making speeches about constitutional government. The bill never left his committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jzc01|title=COURT-PACKING PLAN OF 1937|last=PATENAUDE|first=LIONEL V.|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>

He faced two serious opponents in the 1938 election, but was re-elected and was not seriously challenged again.

In 1945, Sumners responded strongly to the lynching of Jesse James Payne, a prisoner in custody of Sheriff Lonnie T. Davis in [[Madison, Florida|Madison, FL]]. Sheriff Davis was investigated for any wrongdoing associated with the lynching of Payne.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jack. E.|date=January 1990|title=\"Whitewash\" in Florida: The Lynching of Jesse James Payne and Its Aftermath|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|volume=68|issue=3|pages=277–298|jstor=30146708}}</ref> Upon hearing the news, Sumners warned Florida Governor [[Millard Caldwell]], “If these facts are true, or approximately true, this sheriff is not only guilty of a violation of official duty, of a cowardly act, but he is guilty of a direct assault upon the sovereignty of the state.”<ref>Personal letter to then Florida Governor Millard Caldwell, October 17, 1945, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-116.</ref>

Sumners chaired the House Judiciary Committee when the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] passed on June 11, 1946. The act governs the way administrative agencies of the federal government may propose and establish regulations and grants the judiciary oversight over all agency actions.<ref>USC §706</ref>

In 1946, Sumners announced he would not seek re-election; he served seventeen consecutive terms.

He was a member of the [[Henry Pomeroy Miller|Miller group]] in Washington.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Caro |last=Caro |first=Robert A. |series=[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson]] |title=The Path to Power |year=1982 |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-0394499734 |page=271}}</ref>

== War Powers Act of 1941 ==
Sumners introduced the [[War Powers Act of 1941]]. This act gave President Roosevelt increased powers to execute [[World War II]] in a more efficient manner. This legislation was passed by both houses and signed into law in three days.<ref>{{Cite web |title:Public Law 354 ||url=http://legisworks.org/congress/77/publaw-354.pdf|website=legisworks.org|access-date=2019-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017131142/http://legisworks.org/congress/77/publaw-354.pdf |via=Wayback Machine}}</ref>

== Response to lynchings in Mississippi ==
While Sumners started his time in Congress as a man viewed by some as unconcerned by racial violence, he was outspoken against states and figures he viewed as ineffective in stopping lynching. Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to lynchings in Mississippi in 1931, “What we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.”<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>

In the wake of the lynchings of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels in 1937, Sumners was asked to speak about anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined, writing, “It has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  The meeting would be construed as being opposed to anti-lynching legislation; whereas, to be effective it should be a meeting opposed to lynching. This suggestion is very important…everything should indicate that you are trying to stop mob violence and that this is the whole purpose of the meeting.”<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. L. W. Alford, Chairman of the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, May 4, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>

In reference to the 1937 lynchings, an outraged Sumners sent the Governor of Mississippi a telegram that stated “If the press reports are even approximately correct, and they seem to be, these lynchings, both with regard to lynchers and the officers involved, were as dastardly a crime as cowardice could devise and brutality execute. It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment.”<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now-infamous lynchings including the sheriffs, writing, “The turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.”<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A. A. Carmichael, May 25, 1937, DHS, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>

==Final years==
After leaving Congress, Sumners was the Director of Research for the [[Southwestern Legal Foundation]]. Sumners formed the Hatton W. Sumners Foundation in 1949, which still awards loans and scholarships to worthy students.  The foundation is also a sponsor of the [[Internet]] project 'Vote Smart.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=93666|title=Project Vote Smart|publisher=votesmart.org|accessdate=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Organizations like the [[YMCA]], the Red Cross, and his local church also benefitted from Sumner's generosity.<ref name=Sumners/>

Sumners received an honorary doctor of laws from [[Southern Methodist University]] and the [[American Bar Association Medal]].  He died on April 19, 1962. After services in the Highland Park Methodist Church in Dallas, he was interred in the [[Knights of Pythias]] Cemetery in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]], Texas.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>

==Books authored==
Sumners wrote ''The Private Citizen and His Democracy'' in 1959.

'''''Quiz''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[James Graham (playwright)|James Graham]]. Originally commissioned by theatre producer, William Village,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.williamvillage.com/|title=William Village {{!}} Independent theatre producer and general manager|last=Village|first=William|website=William Village|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref> it made its world premiere at the [[Minerva Theatre, Chichester]], in November 2017, before transferring to the [[Noel Coward Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in March 2018. The play centres on the true story of [[Charles Ingram]] and [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|the coughing scandal]] that surrounded his 2001 win of £1,000,000 on ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

'''Marco Simone''' ({{IPA-it|ˈmarko siˈmoːne}}; born 7 January 1969) is an Italian former professional [[association football|football]]er, who played as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] or [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]]. He most prominently played for [[A.C. Milan]], with whom he won four [[Serie A]] championships and two [[UEFA Champions League]] titles, as well as French club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], and Monégasque outfit [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]]. At international level, Simone played four games for the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]].

As a manager, Simone, has also served as the head coach of [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in [[Ligue 2]], and [[FC Lausanne-Sport|Lausanne-Sport]].

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Simone was born in [[Castellanza]]. He debuted in [[Serie A]] for [[Como Calcio 1907|Como]] on 11 January 1987. After a few appearances in the top-flight Serie A, he was put [[loan (football)|on loan]] at [[A.S.D. F.C. Alzano|Virescit Boccaleone]] in the secondary [[Serie C1]] league. He scored 15 goals for Virescit in the 1987–88 season, and finished as top scorer of the Serie C1 league.<ref name=magliarossonera.it>{{cite web|title=Marco Simone|url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Simone.html|publisher=Maglia Rossonera|accessdate=13 May 2015|language=Italian}}</ref>

He returned to [[Como Calcio 1907|Como]] for the [[1988–89 Serie A|1988–89 Serie A season]], in which he scored 6 goals. Como finished dead last in the tournament, and was [[relegated]] to [[Serie B]].

===Milan===
In the summer of 1989, Simone was brought into the squad of third-place finishers [[A.C. Milan]] by manager [[Arrigo Sacchi]]. His stay at Milan would be long and successful, as he won the 1990 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] under manager Sacchi, as well as four Serie A titles in five years from 1992 to 1996 and the 1994 [[UEFA Champions League]] under the management of [[Fabio Capello]].<ref name=magliarossonera.it/><ref name=\"A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Marco Simone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.acmilan.com/en/marco-simone|title=A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Marco Simone|website=acmilan.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>

His best season for Milan came during the [[1994–95 Serie A|1994–95 Serie A season]], where he scored 17 goals in 30 games, as well as 4 in the Champions League, for a total of 21 goals in all competitions, as Milan reached the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final]], only to be defeated by [[Ajax F.C.|Ajax]]. He also managed 11 goals in all competitions during the [[1995–96 A.C. Milan season|1995–96 season]], 8 of which came in [[1995–96 Serie A|Serie A]], finishing as the club's second highest goalscorer behind [[George Weah]] as Milan won the Serie A title. Despite competing for the attacking spots at Milan with the three [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award winners [[Marco van Basten]] (1992), [[Roberto Baggio]] (1993) and [[George Weah]] (1995) (as well as the presence of [[Ruud Gullit]], [[Dejan Savićević]], [[Daniele Massaro]], [[Paolo Di Canio]], [[Jean-Pierre Papin]], [[Christophe Dugarry]], and [[Brian Laudrup]]), he scored a total of 74 goals in 245 games in all competitions for Milan.<ref name=magliarossonera.it/><ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.acmilandk.net/club/index.php?module=pagesetter&func=viewpub&tid=3&pid=4 Marco Simone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928125702/http://www.acmilandk.net/club/index.php?module=pagesetter&func=viewpub&tid=3&pid=4 |date=28 September 2007 }} at ''ACMilan.dk''</ref>

===International debut===
During his time with Milan, Simone also made his senior debut for the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] on 19 December 1992, under then national team manager Arrigo Sacchi, in a 2–1 away win in a [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1994 World Cup qualifier]] against [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. He would go on to play four games in total for the national team between 1992 and 1996, but did not score any goals for Italy.<ref name=magliarossonera.it/><ref name=\"figc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=27&squadra=2|title=Nazionale in cifre: Simone, Marco|publisher=FIGC|language=Italian|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref>

===Later career in France, Monaco and return to Italy===
In 1997, Simone moved abroad to play for French club [[Paris Saint-Germain FC|Paris Saint-Germain]], with whom he won both domestic cups in his first season. He scored in both the [[1998 Coupe de la Ligue Final|Coupe de la Ligue]] final and the [[1998 Coupe de France Final|Coupe de France]] final against [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and [[RC Lens|Lens]] respectively.<ref>{{cite news

He scored 21 goals and made 15 assists in 34 games during the [[1999–2000 French Division 1|1999–2000 season]], and helped Monaco win the [[Ligue 1]] championship in 2000. He returned to Milan for parts of the [[2001–02 Serie A|2001–02 Serie A season]], scoring his last goal with the Rossoneri in Coppa Italia against Lazio in 2002. He returned to Monaco, but rarely played during the [[2002–03 Ligue 1]] season.<ref name=magliarossonera.it/>

Following an unsuccessful [[2003–04 Ligue 1|season]] playing for [[OGC Nice]], he retired from football in 2004, at the age of 35. He made a short come-back as he played a single game for [[Serie C2]] club [[A.C. Legnano|Legnano]] in 2005.<ref name=magliarossonera.it/>

==Style of play==
Simone was a diminutive [[Forward (association football)|forward]], gifted with pace, good movement, an eye for goal, and excellent technique. He was capable of playing in several attacking positions, and was best used as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], due to his small stature and slender physical build, although he was also capable of playing in a [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|central role]] as a main [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], or even as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].<ref name=magliarossonera.it/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.milannews.it/terza-pagina-milanday/l-uomo-in-piu-36089 |title=L'uomo in più |publisher=MilanNews.it |language=Italian |date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/68275/simone-appointed-tours |title=Simone appointed at Tours |publisher=Football Italia |date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=21 March 2020 }}</ref>

He most prominently played for [[A.C. Milan]], with whom he won four [[Serie A]] championships and two [[UEFA Champions League]] titles, as well as French club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], and Monégasque outfit [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]].

As a manager, Simone, has also served as the head coach of [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in [[Ligue 2]], and [[FC Lausanne-Sport|Lausanne-Sport]].

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Simone was born in [[Castellanza]]. He debuted in [[Serie A]] for [[Como Calcio 1907|Como]] on 11 January 1987. After a few appearances in the top-flight Serie A, he was put [[loan (football)|on loan]] at [[A.S.D. F.C. Alzano|Virescit Boccaleone]] in the secondary [[Serie C1]] league. He scored 15 goals for Virescit in the 1987–88 season, and finished as top scorer of the Serie C1 league.<ref name=magliarossonera.it>{{cite web|title=Marco Simone|url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Simone.html|publisher=Maglia Rossonera|accessdate=13 May 2015|language=Italian}}</ref>

He returned to [[Como Calcio 1907|Como]] for the [[1988–89 Serie A|1988–89 Serie A season]], in which he scored 6 goals. Como finished dead last in the tournament, and was [[relegated]] to [[Serie B]].

===Milan===
In the summer of 1989, Simone was brought into the squad of third-place finishers [[A.C. Milan]] by manager [[Arrigo Sacchi]]. His stay at Milan would be long and successful, as he won the 1990 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] under manager Sacchi, as well as four Serie A titles in five years from 1992 to 1996 and the 1994 [[UEFA Champions League]] under the management of [[Fabio Capello]].<ref name=magliarossonera.it/><ref name=\"A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Marco Simone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.acmilan.com/en/marco-simone|title=A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Marco Simone|website=acmilan.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>

His best season for Milan came during the [[1994–95 Serie A|1994–95 Serie A season]], where he scored 17 goals in 30 games, as well as 4 in the Champions League, for a total of 21 goals in all competitions, as Milan reached the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final]], only to be defeated by [[Ajax F.C.|Ajax]]. He also managed 11 goals in all competitions during the [[1995–96 A.C. Milan season|1995–96 season]], 8 of which came in [[1995–96 Serie A|Serie A]], finishing as the club's second highest goalscorer behind [[George Weah]] as Milan won the Serie A title. Despite competing for the attacking spots at Milan with the three [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award winners [[Marco van Basten]] (1992), [[Roberto Baggio]] (1993) and [[George Weah]] (1995) (as well as the presence of [[Ruud Gullit]], [[Dejan Savićević]], [[Daniele Massaro]], [[Paolo Di Canio]], [[Jean-Pierre Papin]], [[Christophe Dugarry]], and [[Brian Laudrup]]), he scored a total of 74 goals in 245 games in all competitions for Milan.<ref name=magliarossonera.it/><ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.acmilandk.net/club/index.php?module=pagesetter&func=viewpub&tid=3&pid=4 Marco Simone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928125702/http://www.acmilandk.net/club/index.php?module=pagesetter&func=viewpub&tid=3&pid=4 |date=28 September 2007 }} at ''ACMilan.dk''</ref>

===International debut===
During his time with Milan, Simone also made his senior debut for the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] on 19 December 1992, under then national team manager Arrigo Sacchi, in a 2–1 away win in a [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1994 World Cup qualifier]] against [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. He would go on to play four games in total for the national team between 1992 and 1996, but did not score any goals for Italy.<ref name=magliarossonera.it/><ref name=\"figc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=27&squadra=2|title=Nazionale in cifre: Simone, Marco|publisher=FIGC|language=Italian|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref>

===Later career in France, Monaco and return to Italy===
In 1997, Simone moved abroad to play for French club [[Paris Saint-Germain FC|Paris Saint-Germain]], with whom he won both domestic cups in his first season. He scored in both the [[1998 Coupe de la Ligue Final|Coupe de la Ligue]] final and the [[1998 Coupe de France Final|Coupe de France]] final against [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and [[RC Lens|Lens]] respectively.<ref>{{cite news

|accessdate=3 January 2020}}</ref> He transferred to [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] in 1999. He scored 21 goals and made 15 assists in 34 games during the [[1999–2000 French Division 1|1999–2000 season]], and helped Monaco win the [[Ligue 1]] championship in 2000. He returned to Milan for parts of the [[2001–02 Serie A|2001–02 Serie A season]], scoring his last goal with the Rossoneri in Coppa Italia against Lazio in 2002. He returned to Monaco, but rarely played during the [[2002–03 Ligue 1]] season.<ref name=magliarossonera.it/>

Following an unsuccessful [[2003–04 Ligue 1|season]] playing for [[OGC Nice]], he retired from football in 2004, at the age of 35. He made a short come-back as he played a single game for [[Serie C2]] club [[A.C. Legnano|Legnano]] in 2005.<ref name=magliarossonera.it/>

==Style of play==
Simone was a diminutive [[Forward (association football)|forward]], gifted with pace, good movement, an eye for goal, and excellent technique. He was capable of playing in several attacking positions, and was best used as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], due to his small stature and slender physical build, although he was also capable of playing in a [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|central role]] as a main [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], or even as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].<ref name=magliarossonera.it/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.milannews.it/terza-pagina-milanday/l-uomo-in-piu-36089 |title=L'uomo in più |publisher=MilanNews.it |language=Italian |date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/68275/simone-appointed-tours |title=Simone appointed at Tours |publisher=Football Italia |date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=21 March 2020 }}</ref>

The '''Constitution of Argentina''' is the basic governing document of [[Argentina]], and the primary source of existing [[Law of Argentina|law in Argentina]]. [[Argentine Constitution of 1853|Its first version]] was written in 1853 by a Constitutional Assembly gathered in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and the doctrinal basis was taken in part from the [[United States Constitution]]. It was then reformed in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957 (which mainly repealed the 1949 reform), and the current version is the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|reformed text of 1994]].

==History==
[[Image:JuanBaustistaAlberdi.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], the legal scholar who drafted the 1853 Constitution.]] 
The first attempt to divide political power in [[Argentina]] was during the government created after the [[May Revolution]] (Spanish: Revolución de Mayo): the [[Primera Junta]] could not create new taxes without the ''Cabildo'''s authorization.

Many revolutionary leaders, led by [[Mariano Moreno]], wanted to declare independence immediately and to make a constitution in order to build an independent state. In October 1811, the [[Junta Grande]], which succeeded the Primera Junta, enacted the Regulation for the Division of Power, but it was not accepted by the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|executive power]]. Nevertheless, the [[freedom of press]] and the Decree on Individual Security were accepted by November.
In 1813, the [[Asamblea del Año XIII|General Constitutional Assembly]] was intended to declare a constitution but it could only declare the freedom for slaves' sons.

In [[Argentine Constitution of 1819|1819]] and [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|1826]] were declared two constitutions that eventually failed because of the disagreement between [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Federalists]] and [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]].
Many other ''constitutional'' pacts existed between 1820 and 1853 (when the current Argentine Constitution was enacted). The most important of them are: the [[Treaty of Pilar]] (1820), the [[Quadrilateral Treaty|Treaty of the ''Cuadrilátero'']] (1822), the [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] (1831), the Palermo Protocol (1852), and the [[San Nicolás Agreement|Treaty of San Nicolás]] (1852).

The [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] urged all the provinces to call a General Federal Congress, however this would have limited [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]'s power who was the most powerful province governor, so the Congress was never called.
When Rosas was defeated, in 1852, the [[San Nicolás Agreement|Treaty of San Nicolás]] finally called the Constitutional Congress that, in Santa Fe, on May 1, 1853, sworn to make effective the federal Constitution. Consequently, the [[Buenos Aires Province|Province of Buenos Aires]] left the [[Argentine Confederation]] until 1859.

===Reforms to the 1853 Constitution===
The first constitutional amendment to the original 1853 text was performed in 1860 after Buenos Aires rejoined the Argentine Confederation. It consisted of several changes to many of the original articles. One of the major changes was the renaming of the state: according to the reform, the country would be officially named ''República Argentina'' (\"Argentine Republic\") and, for legal purposes, ''Nación Argentina'' (\"Argentine Nation\"), replacing the older Argentine Confederation denomination in all articles of the constitution. Another important inclusion was the constitutional recognizing of Buenos Aires' exclusive rights guaranteed by the Treaty of San Nicolás.

The following reform was done in 1866 and established that exportation and importation taxes would be destined to the National Treasury indefinitely, no longer until 1866 as the 1860 reform did.

In 1898, another minor constitutional amendment was approved. It allowed a more flexible ratio for proportional apportionment in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and set the number of ministries to eight.

During [[Juan Domingo Perón]]'s government the [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]] was successfully passed, a major revision of the constitution. Its goal was to modernize and adapt the text to the twentieth century's concepts of democracy, as for example, including a list of ''social rights'' including better working conditions for the working class, right to good education, etc. This also was included into the principles stated on the Preamble. Also, it permitted the indefinite reelection of the president.

During the military regime known as the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'' that had deposed Perón's government in 1955, in 1957 and before the elections that had to be held in 1958, a Constitutional Convention was elected to reform the constitution. This reform does not include 1949's, implicitly annulling it so the text was based on the 1898 one. The only changes done were to include a summary of Perón's social articles known as ''article 14 bis'' (existing currently) and to establish the necessity to have a Labour and Social Security Code.

In 1972, a \"Constitutional Amendment\" done by the military government led by general [[Alejandro A. Lanusse]] reformed the 1957 text. This had to last until 1977 but its application could be extended until 1981 if no Constitutional Convention in 1976 decided either to accept it or reject it definitively. This amendment was not fully applied by the democratic government of Perón in his third term nor by his wife [[Isabel Perón]] acting as President after his death. Some changes were related to the size of Senate and one-term reelection of president and vice-president. Also reduced presidential, senatorial and deputies' terms all to four years.

The last (and current) version of the Argentine Constitution was done by [[Carlos Saúl Menem]] in 1994. It included many of the modifications from the 1972 \"amendment\" as the growth of the Senate size (three per Province), one-term presidential reelection and reduction of its term to four years. It also made [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires City]] an [[Autonomous city|autonomous entity]] with its own authorities. Other changes were done to ensure a softer presidentialist regime, the inclusion of a new chapter into the Bill of Rights related to politics, health and environment, and also the adoption of a much faster legislative procedure for creating laws. In addition with the 1994 constitutional reform, the requirement of belonging to the Roman Catholic faith in order to be President or Vice President of the Republic, was also abolished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Argentina 1853 (reinst. 1983, rev. 1994)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Argentina_1994?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>

==Divisions==
The Argentine Constitution has four major division types; Parts, Titles, Divisions and Chapters, though these need not be present all the time. For example, the First Part is divided into Chapters but not into Titles nor Sections. The scheme of the Constitution is the following:
*Preamble
*First Part (43 sections)
**First Chapter ''Declarations, rights and guarantees'' (35 sections)
**Second Chapter ''New rights and guarantees'' (8 sections)
*Second Part ''Authorities of the Nation'' (86 sections)
**First Title ''Federal Government'' (77 sections)
***First Division ''Of the Legislative Power'' (43 sections, 42 + 1 separated)
****First Chapter ''Of the Chamber of Deputies'''(9 sections)
****Second Chapter ''Of the Senate'' (9 sections)
****Third Chapter ''Common dispositions to both Chambers'' (12 sections)
****Fourth Chapter ''Powers of the Congress'' (2 sections, of which one is sub-divided 32 times)
****Fifth Chapter ''Of the formation of Laws'' (8 sections)
****Sixth Chapter ''Of the [[Auditoría General de la Nacion]]'' (1 section)
****Seventh Chapter ''Of the Ombudsman'' (1 section)
***Second Division ''Of the Executive Power'' (21 sections)
****First Chapter ''Of its nature and duration'' (7 sections)
****Second Chapter ''Of the way and time of the election of the President and 
****Third Chapter ''Powers of the Executive Branch'' (1 section sub-divided 20 times)
****Fourth Chapter ''Of the ministers'' (8 sections, of which one is sub-divided 13 times)
***Third Division ''Of the Judicial Power'' (12 sections)
****First Chapter ''Of its nature and duration'' (8 sections)
****Second Chapter ''Powers of the Judicial Branch'' (4 sections)
***Fourth Section ''Of the Office of the Public Prosecution'' (1 section)
**Second Title ''Provincial Governments'' (9 sections)
*Transitorial Provisions

==Preamble==
[[Image:Constitución Nacional Argentina 1853 - página 1.jpeg|thumb|240px|left|''\"Nos los Representantes del Pueblo de la Nación Argentina &hellip;\"'']]
The Preamble of the Argentine Constitution states or implies, in short terms, a number of starting points for the conception of the nation, such as a representative government. It acknowledges previous agreements to create a constitution (in order to legitimize the gathering of the Assembly). Finally, it lays the foundations for the policy of support of [[immigration in Argentina|immigration]], by asking \"for the protection of [[God]], source of all reason and justice\" for all people who desire to inhabit Argentina.

==Declarations, rights and guarantees ==
The Constitution establishes a Bill of Rights and Guarantees for all individuals, Argentine or foreign; the inviolability of the right of life, liberty, equality, security and property. The second chapter, added in 1994, deals with public ethics, political rights, environmental protection and consumer rights.

Civil rights are recognized to all inhabitants with no distinction of nationality. This is a consequence of the traditional interest of Argentina in the affluence of foreigners and foreign investment. Labor rights are also acknowledged (this is part of the legacy of [[Peronism]], resulting in the 1949 and 1957 reforms). These include limited labor day, just salary, right of organization, social security benefits, etc.

The constitution declares that no one can be deprived of property, except in case of judicial sentence based on previously enacted legislation, or through expropriation for reasons of public utility, dully qualified by law and previously indemnified. The person, its judicial defense, its domicile and correspondence are inviolable.

What the law does not forbid is permitted. Individuals have complete freedom to do or refuse to do anything in private, except if that interferes with public order or morality, or causes damage to third parties.

The 1994 reform introduces several new legal figures: ''amparo judicial'' (an [[injunction]]), ''habeas corpus'' and ''habeas data''. Injunctions are destined to protect citizens from actual or imminent damage; ''[[habeas corpus (Argentine law)|habeas corpus]]'' (known for a long time to Argentine jurisprudence, and related to the [[habeas corpus]] of [[Common Law]]) is to protect the citizen's physical freedom; and ''[[habeas data (Argentine law)|habeas data]]'' is a person's right to access information about himself or herself, and request its confidentiality, a change or a suppression.

The Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.

===Declarations===
Declarations state the basis that hold the nation's politics and define it as an independent entity, for example, Article 1 states that the government is representative, republican and federal and Article 35 lists the Country's official names.

===Guarantees===
They are institutional methods to protect the exercise of fundamental rights. They are so important that it is possible to say that a right can be held as long as it has a guarantee to protect it.
Most of Guarantees are in the sections 18 and 43, between these are: habeas corpus, the abolition of death penalty and torture.

===Rights===
The Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.

* '''Civil''' rights are related to the people as individuals. Some examples are: right to live, have honor, have a name, make associations and to express opinions.
* '''Patrimonial''' rights protect men in relation to their goods. Some examples are: to own, to sell, to hire, and to build legal industries.
* '''Politic''' rights allow people to take part in the government, by themselves or by electing representatives: this category includes the right to choose and be chosen for the government and to make or join a political party.
* '''Social''' rights are related to people as part of society: these are (among many others) the rights to work, to have fair wages, to know, to learn, to teach.

In [[Argentina]], Freedom is one of the most important rights. Section 19 says that private actions of men that don't harm the public order or another man can not be judged by authorities. Moreover, it holds the \"principle of legality\": ''No inhabitant of the Nation will be forced to do what the law doesn't order nor forbidden to do what the law doesn't forbid''.
Equality is as important as freedom. Section 16 states that in the country there are no noble titles and \"all its inhabitants are equal before the law\"

==Form of government==
According to the Constitution, Argentina is a representative [[federalism|federal]] [[republic]], divided in [[provinces of Argentina|provinces]], [[municipality|municipalities]], and the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]]. Each province has the right and duty to dictate its own constitution, respecting the same principles as the national constitution.

==Divisions of government powers==
[[Image:Edificio del Congreso en Buenos Aires 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]
The Constitution mandates a strict separation of government powers, into three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) and the Public Ministry.

===Executive===
The Executive Branch is formed by the [[President of Argentina|President]], who is both head of state, as well as chief executive and head of government. (Art. 87). The Vice-President replaces the President in case of illness, absence from the capital, death, resignation, or removal.

The Vice-President doesn't belong to the executive branch. Curiously, it belongs to the legislative branch since he is also the President of the Senate. (Art. 57)

The President promulgates the laws sanctioned by Congress, and has veto power over them. The President directs international relations and is the Commander in Chief of the Army. In some cases, the President can issue [[Necessity and Urgency Decree|emergency decrees]].

In the 1994 amendments to the 1853 Constitution, the post of the Chief of the Cabinet Ministers was created who would serve as chief operating officer and would run the day-to-day operations of the government and will be at the same time, be politically responsible to the both Houses of the National Congress, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and they can remove him or her via censure. The creation of the post was intended to reduce the presidentialist character of the country's presidential form of government.

===Legislative===
The Legislative Branch is composed of the Vice-President, a bicameral Congress, the General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman. Congress is divided in two Houses: ''Cámara de Diputados'' ([[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], the Lower House) and ''Cámara de Senadores'' ([[Argentine Senate|Senate]], the Upper House).

The Vice-President belongs in the Legislative Branch since he (or she) is also the President of the Senate Chamber.

The General Auditing Office of the Nation is a technical advisory body of Congress with functional autonomy.

The Ombudsman is an independent body which works without receiving instructions from any authority. The mission of the Ombudsman is the defense and protection of human rights, civil rights and guarantees, and the control of the Administration.

===Judicial===
The Judicial Branch is formed by the Supreme Court, and lower courts throughout the country. The Supreme Justices and all judges hold their offices as long as they are not deposed for misbehavior.

===Public Ministry===
The Public Ministry is an independent body with functional autonomy and financial autarchy, with the function of promoting justice for the defense of legality, of the general interests of society, in coordination with the other authorities of the Republic.

It is composed of an Attorney General of the Nation and an Ombudsman General of the Nation, and such other members as the law may establish.

This reform does not include 1949's, implicitly annulling it so the text was based on the 1898 one. The only changes done were to include a summary of Perón's social articles known as ''article 14 bis'' (existing currently) and to establish the necessity to have a Labour and Social Security Code.

In 1972, a \"Constitutional Amendment\" done by the military government led by general [[Alejandro A. Lanusse]] reformed the 1957 text. This had to last until 1977 but its application could be extended until 1981 if no Constitutional Convention in 1976 decided either to accept it or reject it definitively. This amendment was not fully applied by the democratic government of Perón in his third term nor by his wife [[Isabel Perón]] acting as President after his death. Some changes were related to the size of Senate and one-term reelection of president and vice-president. Also reduced presidential, senatorial and deputies' terms all to four years.

The last (and current) version of the Argentine Constitution was done by [[Carlos Saúl Menem]] in 1994. It included many of the modifications from the 1972 \"amendment\" as the growth of the Senate size (three per Province), one-term presidential reelection and reduction of its term to four years. It also made [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires City]] an [[Autonomous city|autonomous entity]] with its own authorities. Other changes were done to ensure a softer presidentialist regime, the inclusion of a new chapter into the Bill of Rights related to politics, health and environment, and also the adoption of a much faster legislative procedure for creating laws. In addition with the 1994 constitutional reform, the requirement of belonging to the Roman Catholic faith in order to be President or Vice President of the Republic, was also abolished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Argentina 1853 (reinst. 1983, rev. 1994)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Argentina_1994?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>

==Preamble==
[[Image:Constitución Nacional Argentina 1853 - página 1.jpeg|thumb|240px|left|''\"Nos los Representantes del Pueblo de la Nación Argentina &hellip;\"'']]
The Preamble of the Argentine Constitution states or implies, in short terms, a number of starting points for the conception of the nation, such as a representative government. It acknowledges previous agreements to create a constitution (in order to legitimize the gathering of the Assembly). Finally, it lays the foundations for the policy of support of [[immigration in Argentina|immigration]], by asking \"for the protection of [[God]], source of all reason and justice\" for all people who desire to inhabit Argentina.

==Declarations, rights and guarantees ==
The Constitution establishes a Bill of Rights and Guarantees for all individuals, Argentine or foreign; the inviolability of the right of life, liberty, equality, security and property. The second chapter, added in 1994, deals with public ethics, political rights, environmental protection and consumer rights.

Civil rights are recognized to all inhabitants with no distinction of nationality. This is a consequence of the traditional interest of Argentina in the affluence of foreigners and foreign investment. Labor rights are also acknowledged (this is part of the legacy of [[Peronism]], resulting in the 1949 and 1957 reforms). These include limited labor day, just salary, right of organization, social security benefits, etc.

The constitution declares that no one can be deprived of property, except in case of judicial sentence based on previously enacted legislation, or through expropriation for reasons of public utility, dully qualified by law and previously indemnified. The person, its judicial defense, its domicile and correspondence are inviolable.

What the law does not forbid is permitted. Individuals have complete freedom to do or refuse to do anything in private, except if that interferes with public order or morality, or causes damage to third parties.

The 1994 reform introduces several new legal figures: ''amparo judicial'' (an [[injunction]]), ''habeas corpus'' and ''habeas data''. Injunctions are destined to protect citizens from actual or imminent damage; ''[[habeas corpus (Argentine law)|habeas corpus]]'' (known for a long time to Argentine jurisprudence, and related to the [[habeas corpus]] of [[Common Law]]) is to protect the citizen's physical freedom; and ''[[habeas data (Argentine law)|habeas data]]'' is a person's right to access information about himself or herself, and request its confidentiality, a change or a suppression.

The Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.

===Declarations===
Declarations state the basis that hold the nation's politics and define it as an independent entity, for example, Article 1 states that the government is representative, republican and federal and Article 35 lists the Country's official names.

===Guarantees===
They are institutional methods to protect the exercise of fundamental rights. They are so important that it is possible to say that a right can be held as long as it has a guarantee to protect it.
Most of Guarantees are in the sections 18 and 43, between these are: habeas corpus, the abolition of death penalty and torture.

===Rights===
The Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.

* '''Civil''' rights are related to the people as individuals. Some examples are: right to live, have honor, have a name, make associations and to express opinions.
* '''Patrimonial''' rights protect men in relation to their goods. Some examples are: to own, to sell and to hire and build legal industries.
* '''Politic''' rights allow people to take part in the government, by themselves or by electing representatives: this category includes the right to choose and be chosen for the government and to make or join a political party.
* '''Social''' rights are related to people as part of society: these are (among many others) the rights to work, to have fair wages, to know, to learn, to teach.

In [[Argentina]], Freedom is one of the most important rights. Section 19 says that private actions of men that don't harm the public order or another man can not be judged by authorities. Moreover, it holds the \"principle of legality\": ''No inhabitant of the Nation will be forced to do what the law doesn't order nor forbidden to do what the law doesn't forbid''.
Equality is as important as freedom. Section 16 states that in the country there are no noble titles and \"all its inhabitants are equal before the law\"

==Form of government==
According to the Constitution, Argentina is a representative [[federalism|federal]] [[republic]], divided in [[provinces of Argentina|provinces]], [[municipality|municipalities]], and the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]]. Each province has the right and duty to dictate its own constitution, respecting the same principles as the national constitution.

==Divisions of government powers==
[[Image:Edificio del Congreso en Buenos Aires 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]
The Constitution mandates a strict separation of government powers, into three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) and the Public Ministry.

===Executive===
The Executive Branch is formed by the [[President of Argentina|President]], who is both head of state, as well as chief executive and head of government. (Art. 87). The Vice-President replaces the President in case of illness, absence from the capital, death, resignation, or removal.

The Vice-President doesn't belong to the executive branch. Curiously, it belongs to the legislative branch since he is also the President of the Senate. (Art. 57)

The President promulgates the laws sanctioned by Congress, and has veto power over them. The President directs international relations and is the Commander in Chief of the Army. In some cases, the President can issue [[Necessity and Urgency Decree|emergency decrees]].

In the 1994 amendments to the 1853 Constitution, the post of the Chief of the Cabinet Ministers was created who would serve as chief operating officer and would run the day-to-day operations of the government and will be at the same time, be politically responsible to the both Houses of the National Congress, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and they can remove him or her via censure. The creation of the post was intended to reduce the presidentialist character of the country's presidential form of government.

===Legislative===
The Legislative Branch is composed of the Vice-President, a bicameral Congress, the General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman. Congress is divided in two Houses: ''Cámara de Diputados'' ([[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], the Lower House) and ''Cámara de Senadores'' ([[Argentine Senate|Senate]], the Upper House).

The Vice-President belongs in the Legislative Branch since he (or she) is also the President of the Senate Chamber.

The General Auditing Office of the Nation is a technical advisory body of Congress with functional autonomy.

The Ombudsman is an independent body which works without receiving instructions from any authority. The mission of the Ombudsman is the defense and protection of human rights, civil rights and guarantees, and the control of the Administration.

===Judicial===
The Judicial Branch is formed by the Supreme Court, and lower courts throughout the country. The Supreme Justices and all judges hold their offices as long as they are not deposed for misbehavior.

===Public Ministry===
The Public Ministry is an independent body with functional autonomy and financial autarchy, with the function of promoting justice for the defense of legality, of the general interests of society, in coordination with the other authorities of the Republic.

It is composed of an Attorney General of the Nation and an Ombudsman General of the Nation, and such other members as the law may establish.

Several of [[Saturn]]'s [[moons of Saturn|natural satellites]] have figured prominently in works of [[science fiction]].

== Saturnian system ==
Some works of fiction refer to several of Saturn's moons, or to no specific moon.
*''[[Animorphs]]'' novel series. The creature called the [[Veleek]] was originally found by the [[Yeerks]] on one of Saturn's moons.
*''[[Exosquad]]'' animated TV series. Saturn's moons initially were home of the Pirate Clans before the discovery of the planet Chaos.
*The ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' game universe (1987-) places the headquarters and other facilities of the [[Ordo Malleus]] branch of Inquisition in Saturn's moons, including the main base of their most famous subordinates — the [[Grey Knights]] chapter of [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]].
*''[[Starhunter 2300]]'' Canadian sci-fi TV series. Many episodes of this series take place in part of the Saturn system, designated as \"Saturn Federation.\" The spaceship carrying the main characters is the Trans-Utopian, which travels frequently between Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. Various moons of Saturn are mentioned, including Titan and Iapetus. There is also a large space station orbiting Saturn at which the Trans-Utopian docks, called \"Ring-Shepherd.\"
*In the novel ''[[The True Meaning of Smekday]]'', the Boov, after leaving Earth, colonize one of Saturn's moons. It is \"a bit of a fixer-upper\", though.
*The Daedalus Series, by Michael J. Martinez, including novels ''The Daedalus Incident'' (2013),<ref>{{cite book

*Many levels of the video game ''[[Overload (video game)|Overload]]'' take place in facilities located on the moons of Saturn.

== Janus ==
[[Image:Janus 2006 closeup by Cassini.jpg|right|80px|Janus]]
[[Janus (moon)|Janus]] is a small inner moon of Saturn notable for having an orbit nearly identical to the orbit of the moon [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]]; the two swap orbital positions every four years.

*Janus features prominently in [[Alastair Reynolds]]' science fiction novel ''[[Pushing Ice]]'' (2005). In the novel, Janus is revealed to be a shell containing an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] spacecraft which unexpectedly departs the [[solar system]] in the direction of a giant structure orbiting the star [[Spica]]. The novel tells the story of the crew of a human mining ship who establish a colony on the moon as it leaves the [[solar system]].

== Mimas ==
[[Image:Mimas shape.jpg|right|80px]]
[[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] is a small, [[icy moon]] orbiting close to Saturn, notable for being scarred by [[Herschel (Mimantean crater)|Herschel crater]], whose diameter is very wide compared to the total circumference of the moon.

*In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s 1958 novel ''[[Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn]]'' the hero, knowing that Mimas is almost entirely made of ice, guides his ship on a collision course towards it, melts its surface with his weapons, and thus hides the ship in order to escape from his enemies, the people from the Sirius System.
*In \"Zero Summer,\" a short story by [[Caitlín R. Kiernan]], Mimas is the destination of a starship manned by two androids.
* Mimas is a recurring location in the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' TV sitcom and its spinoff novels. In the episode \"[[Dimension Jump (Red Dwarf episode)|Dimension Jump]]\", Mimas hosts a Space Corps test base for test pilot [[Red Dwarf characters#Ace Rimmer|Arnold J. 'Ace' Rimmer]], while the first novel, ''[[Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'', begins with [[Dave Lister]] stranded in a seedy city on Mimas. Both the book and the series refer to the local delicacy \"Mimean Bladderfish\".
*\"[[The First Duty]]\" (1992), episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Mimas is the site of an evacuation station to which four [[Starfleet]] cadets, including [[Wesley Crusher]], transport after their vessels collide.
*In [[Grant Callin]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', Mimas is one of the locations of an alien artifact. It is also the site of human colonization and mining called \"M-Base\".
*In the table-top science fiction game ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'', Mimas serves as a high-security prison for the most dangerous prisoners of the Ordo Malleus branch of the Inquisition.
*In [[Paul J. McAuley]]'s ''[[The Quiet War (novel)|The Quiet War]]'' (2008), Mimas is home to a notable \"Outer\" family which has profound influence over Jovian/Saturnian satellite politics.
*In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s short story ''Les Mortes d'Arthur'' (1985), Herschel crater (named Arthur in the story) is the site of the terrestrial part of the sixty-sixth Olympic Winter Games (2194) and the setting of a murder mystery.
*In Alexander Janzer's science fiction novel ''Higher Reality'' (2015), Mimas is where the protagonist encounters a strange extraterrestrial craft while investigating the disappearance of the crew of a small outpost.

== Enceladus ==
[[Image:Enceladusstripes cassini.jpg|right|80px|Enceladus]]
[[Enceladus]] is a small, icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, with an extremely bright surface and the geyser-like plumes of ice and water vapor that erupt from its southern polar region. It is the source of material for Saturn's E Ring.

*In the 1930s [[Buck Rogers]] [[old time radio]] show, Enceladus makes an appearance. In the story entitled \"[[Killer Kane]] and Ardala on Saturn's moon,\" the titular villains try to take over the peaceful government of the Saturnian moon. The moon is depicted as having an atmosphere and supporting a happy population of [[humanoid]] life. Buck races to the moon to set things right.
*In ''[[Exosquad]]'', Enceladus was the location of a heavily fortified Pirate Clans' outpost and the site of the second battle between them and the [[Exofleet]] just prior to the beginning of the Terran-Neosapien war.
*In Grant D. Callin's science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', Enceladus is one of the locations of an alien artifact.
*At the conclusion of the [[Time Machine (book series)|Time Machine]] book ''The Rings of Saturn'' (set in 2085), the spacecraft blows up Enceladus as it returns to [[Earth]] after meeting an alien life-form.
*In [[Charles R. Pellegrino|Charles Pellegrino's]] ''Dust'', the narrative switches periodically to a robotic probe landing on Enceladus in search of life.
*In [[Paul J. McAuley]]'s ''[[The Quiet War (novel)|The Quiet War]]'' (2008), Enceladus serves as one of the battlefields as Earth invades Saturn's inhabited satellites in the 23rd Century.
*The History Channel show ''[[Life After People: The Series]]'', depicts the ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' spacecraft crashing into it and causing the bacteria on the craft to begin to inhabit it, eventually evolving into [[extraterrestrial life]].
*In the ''[[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal]]'' web comic ([http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1733 #1733]), Enceladus is depicted as having fish like creatures below its icy surface. These creatures are used in what appears to be the McDonald's [[Filet-O-Fish|Fish Fillet]].
*In the [[GURPS]] sourcebook ''GURPS Space: Terradyne'', the Terradyne corporation detonates a nuclear explosion on Enceladus to alter its orbit to eventually impact [[Mars]], as part of its Martian [[terraforming]] project.
*In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[Cold Warriors]]\", Enceladus is referred to as \"Saturn's main dump moon\", and is the location of a specimen of the cold virus from the 20th century.
*The ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'' stops at Enceladus in the fourth episode of ''[[Space Battleship Yamato 2199]]'' to acquire a rare metal for essential repairs, and to find possible survivors transmitting a distress signal. Isolated ''Yamato'' crew members are pursued by enemy forces, but are saved by an ice geyser. The moon is later used as a base for the Earth Defense Fleet by 2202.
*In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s novel ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', characters occasionally refer to the \"Enceladian biota\" &ndash; microscopic alien organisms that some humans ingest, believing them to have medicinal value.
*Michael J. Martinez's novel ''The Enceladus Crisis'' is set in part on Enceladus.
*In the video game [[Destiny 2: Forsaken]] Cayde-6 leaves a coded message in the mission \"Ace in the Hole\" that goes as follows: \"If The Sun Over Nessus Escapes Nebula Cycle; Evac Labor After Dawn, Under Solstice\". If you take the first letter from each word, it spells the sentence IT'S ON ENCELADUS.
*In Evan Rentz's novel ''Neighbor Earth: The Landing in Illinois'' (2019), Enceladus is the origin of the Saturn beasts, an intelligent extraterrestrial species whose discovery was claimed by the United States during the height of the [[Space Race]].

== Tethys ==
[[Image:Odysseus crater.jpg|right|80px|Tethys]]
[[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]] is a medium-sized icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, very similar to Dione.

* An unnamed Tethys is the setting for the 1980 science fiction thriller ''[[Saturn 3]]''.
* In the American animated television series ''[[Exosquad]]'', Tethys was the primary base of the Pirate Clans prior to the discovery of Chaos.
* In the 1993 computer game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', an image of Tethys was used for a fictional planet called Tei-Tenga, which was cut from the game. The image can be still seen within the games textures.
* Level 17 of the computer game ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'' takes place in the Tethys H<sub>2</sub>O Mine.
*In Warhammer 40,000, Tethys is the location of the Librarium Daemonicum, a repositary of the knowledge of the Ordo Malleus branch of the Inquisition.
Due to the large crater on the surface of Tethys, some people call it \"The Death Moon\" due to it being similar to the Star Wars battle station, the Death Star, a moon-sized spacestation with a superlaser powerful enough to blow up planets.

== Dione ==
[[Image:Dione color south.jpg|right|80px|Dione]]
[[Dione (moon)|Dione]] is a medium-sized icy moon orbiting close to Saturn
*In [[Grant Callin|Grant D. Callin's]] science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', [[Dione (moon)|Dione]] is one of the locations of an alien artifact.
*In the early [[Noon Universe]] novel ''[[Space Apprentice]]'' by [[Strugatsky brothers]] as the heroes stop there on their way (one of them is a planetologist and has some interest in the moon's observatory) they found that its administrator made it a living hell for everybody. This revelation serves as one of the major plot points in the novel.
*In [[Paul J. McAuley]]'s ''[[The Quiet War (novel)|The Quiet War]]'' (2008), Dione's Paris is the leading settlement amongst Saturn's inhabited \"Outer\" satellite colonies, and suffers heavily due to its vocal resistance.
*In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', Dione has been broken into chunks and crashed onto the surface of [[Venus]] as part of a [[terraforming]] process.

== Rhea ==
[[Image:Rhea true color.jpg|right|80px]]
[[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] is the second-largest moon of Saturn.

* \"Valley of Pretenders\" by Dennis Clive (pseudonym of [[John Russell Fearn]]), published in ''Science Fiction'', March 1939.
* \"Outpost of the Eons\" by Dirk Wylie (pseudonym of Joseph Harold Dockweiler), published in ''Astonishing Stories'', April 1943.
* In the film ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', humanity builds a defense outpost on Rhea.
* In the [[Red Rising]] book series, 60 years prior to the events of the books Rhea rebelled against the society and as a lesson to other inhabited moons and planets was 'glassed' (the surface bombarded until so hot it formed a layer of glass-like rock).

== Titan ==
[[Image:Titan in natural color Cassini.jpg|80px|right|Titan]]
{{main|Titan in fiction}}
[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is the largest [[natural satellite|moon]] of [[Saturn]]. Its substantial [[atmosphere]] makes it the most [[Earth]]-like moon in the [[Solar System]] and hence a popular [[science fiction]] setting.
<!--Please put additional references to Titan in the *Titan in fiction* main article, not in this space-->

== Hyperion ==
[[Image:Hyperion true.jpg|right|80px]]
[[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] is the largest irregularly-shaped moon of Saturn, orbiting between Titan and Iapetus.

* Level 16 of the computer game ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'' takes place in a [[methane]] mine on Hyperion.
* In [[Dan Simmons]]'s ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'', the eponymous planet was first colonised by settlers from a colony on the moon Hyperion.
* In [[Alastair Reynolds]]' science fiction novel ''[[On the Steel Breeze]]'' (2012), Hyperion is home to a colony of \"artists and malcontents\".
* In the anime ''[[Infinite Ryvius]]'' (1999), Hyperion is the site of a self-governed colony independent of the rest of the Alliance.

== Iapetus ==

[[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] is a large moon orbiting further from Saturn than any of its other large satellites.  Half of its surface is very bright while the other half is extremely dark.  Investigations since 2004 have also noted its irregular shape, immense impact basins, and a high mountainous ridge on the equator.

* In [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story \"The Comedian's Children\" (1958), a manned expedition to Iapetus in 2034 creates a public craze for black/white designs and \"bi-colored gimcrackery\", but is later linked to ''iapetitis'', a disease in children where one side of the body turns white and paralyzed, the other black.
* In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), astronaut Dave Bowman finds an enigmatic alien monolith waiting for him on the surface of Iapetus (referred to as \"Japetus\" throughout). Iapetus's two tone coloration is caused by a vast white ellipse on the moon's surface, with the monolith appearing as a black dot in its exact center. When the ''Voyager'' space probes arrived at Iapetus thirteen years later, they discovered that there was indeed a black region within the moon's brighter hemisphere. Clarke reports that [[Carl Sagan]], who was on the ''Voyager'' imaging team, sent him a photo, with the note \"Thinking of you ...\".<ref>Arthur C. Clarke, Introduction to ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' (1984)</ref>  Because of [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)#Differences from the film|difficulties]] achieving a convincing model of Saturn's rings, the film version of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' relocated the monolith to an orbit around Jupiter. The three sequel novels written by Clarke follow the film rather than the novel in this matter.
* Iapetus is the setting for ''[[The Saturn Game]]'' (1981) by [[Poul Anderson]].
* Iapetus is the second site of the mysterious phenomenon called \"goorm\" in Sergei Pavlov's hard SF novel ''[[Moon Rainbow]]'' (1984), first being the Uranus' moon [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]].
* In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s futuristic novel ''[[The Memory of Whiteness]]'' (1985), Iapetus is populated by the descendants of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] colonists who retain a [[Communist]] political system.
* In [[Grant Callin]]'s 1986 science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', Iapetus is one of the locations of an alien artifact. There is also human colonization and mining at an installation called \"I-Base\".
* In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s [[Gaea trilogy]], Iapetus is used as a \"nest\" for a fledgling Titan.  One of the objectives of the ''Ringmaster'' mission to Saturn is to investigate the moon's dark region recently contracting to a narrow band; Gaea reveals this is the result of her offspring entering a new stage of development.  When it is fully mature, Iapetus will be shattered and the new Titan born out of its rubble.
* In [[David Weber]]'s novel ''[[The Armageddon Inheritance]]'' (1993), genocidal aliens (the Achuultani) attempt to use Iapetus as a kinetic energy weapon to destroy all life on Earth.
* In the ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' universe, Iapetus acts as a dockyard for the Ordo Malleus fleet, as well as that of the Grey Knights chapter of Space Marines.
* Iapetus appears in [[Ian McDonald (author)|Ian McDonald]]'s ''Chaga''.
* In [[Jack McDevitt]]'s ''[[The Engines of God]]'' (1996), there is a strange ice-made icon on Iapetus. It leads to a depressing discovery that every intelligent civilization of the Galaxy could be obliterated by an unknown Dark Force from the void between the Galaxy's arms.
* Iapetus is the setting of the book ''Aliens: Steel Egg'' by John Shirley (2007).
* In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s novel ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', a giant city known as the High Street is built along the spine of Iapetus's [[equatorial ridge]].
* In the online comic by Joshua Quagmire, ''Bunz & Katz'' (November 2012 - current) Iapetus is revealed to be an ancient, near-derelict alien battle station which is \"awakened\" by the ''Cassini'' probe fly-by. The series' protagonists are the only surviving scouts from this station.

==Phoebe==

[[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]] is a retrograde orbiting moon in the outer Saturn system. It is the largest of the Saturnian [[irregular moon]]s.

*In [[James S.A. Corey]]'s ''Expanse'' series, Phoebe is actually an alien biological warhead that was accidentally captured by Saturn on its way to reprogram protozoan life on Earth. The extraction and use as a weapon of the protomolecular payload of Phoebe drives the primary conflicts of the series. After the protomolecule is used against [[433 Eros]], Phoebe is destroyed via thermonuclear bombardment by the Martian space navy to keep anyone else from obtaining samples, and to prevent it from getting loose in the system.

Several of [[Saturn]]'s [[moons of Saturn|natural satellites]] have figured prominently in works of [[science fiction]].

== Saturnian system ==
Some works of fiction refer to several of Saturn's moons, or to no specific moon.
*''[[Animorphs]]'' novel series. The creature called the [[Veleek]] was originally found by the [[Yeerks]] on one of Saturn's moons.
*''[[Exosquad]]'' animated TV series. Saturn's moons initially were home of the Pirate Clans before the discovery of the planet Chaos.
*The ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' game universe (1987-) places the headquarters and other facilities of the [[Ordo Malleus]] branch of Inquisition in Saturn's moons, including the main base of their most famous subordinates — the [[Grey Knights]] chapter of [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]].
*''[[Starhunter 2300]]'' Canadian sci-fi TV series. Many episodes of this series take place in part of the Saturn system, designated as \"Saturn Federation.\" The spaceship carrying the main characters is the Trans-Utopian, which travels frequently between Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. Various moons of Saturn are mentioned, including Titan and Iapetus. There is also a large space station orbiting Saturn at which the Trans-Utopian docks, called \"Ring-Shepherd.\"
*In the novel ''[[The True Meaning of Smekday]]'', the Boov, after leaving Earth, colonize one of Saturn's moons. It is \"a bit of a fixer-upper\", though.

*Many levels of the video game ''[[Overload (video game)|Overload]]'' take place in facilities located on the moons of Saturn.

== Janus ==
[[Image:Janus 2006 closeup by Cassini.jpg|right|80px|Janus]]
[[Janus (moon)|Janus]] is a small inner moon of Saturn notable for having an orbit nearly identical to the orbit of the moon [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]]; the two swap orbital positions every four years.

*Janus features prominently in [[Alastair Reynolds]]' science fiction novel ''[[Pushing Ice]]'' (2005). In the novel, Janus is revealed to be a shell containing an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] spacecraft which unexpectedly departs the [[solar system]] in the direction of a giant structure orbiting the star [[Spica]]. The novel tells the story of the crew of a human mining ship who establish a colony on the moon as it leaves the [[solar system]].

== Mimas ==
[[Image:Mimas shape.jpg|right|80px]]
[[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] is a small, [[icy moon]] orbiting close to Saturn, notable for being scarred by [[Herschel (Mimantean crater)|Herschel crater]], whose diameter is very wide compared to the total circumference of the moon.

*In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s 1958 novel ''[[Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn]]'' the hero, knowing that Mimas is almost entirely made of ice, guides his ship on a collision course towards it, melts its surface with his weapons, and thus hides the ship in order to escape from his enemies, the people from the Sirius System.
*In \"Zero Summer,\" a short story by [[Caitlín R. Kiernan]], Mimas is the destination of a starship manned by two androids.
* Mimas is a recurring location in the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' TV sitcom and its spinoff novels. In the episode \"[[Dimension Jump (Red Dwarf episode)|Dimension Jump]]\", Mimas hosts a Space Corps test base for test pilot [[Red Dwarf characters#Ace Rimmer|Arnold J. 'Ace' Rimmer]], while the first novel, ''[[Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'', begins with [[Dave Lister]] stranded in a seedy city on Mimas. Both the book and the series refer to the local delicacy \"Mimean Bladderfish\".
*\"[[The First Duty]]\" (1992), episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Mimas is the site of an evacuation station to which four [[Starfleet]] cadets, including [[Wesley Crusher]], transport after their vessels collide.

[[Enceladus]] is a small, icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, with an extremely bright surface and the geyser-like plumes of ice and water vapor that erupt from its southern polar region. It is the source of material for Saturn's E Ring.

*In the 1930s [[Buck Rogers]] [[old time radio]] show, Enceladus makes an appearance. In the story entitled \"[[Killer Kane]] and Ardala on Saturn's moon,\" the titular villains try to take over the peaceful government of the Saturnian moon. The moon is depicted as having an atmosphere and supporting a happy population of [[humanoid]] life. Buck races to the moon to set things right.

*In [[Charles R. Pellegrino|Charles Pellegrino's]] ''Dust'', the narrative switches periodically to a robotic probe landing on Enceladus in search of life.
*In [[Paul J. McAuley]]'s ''[[The Quiet War (novel)|The Quiet War]]'' (2008), Enceladus serves as one of the battlefields as Earth invades Saturn's inhabited satellites in the 23rd Century.
*The History Channel show ''[[Life After People: The Series]]'', depicts the ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' spacecraft crashing into it and causing the bacteria on the craft to begin to inhabit it, eventually evolving into [[extraterrestrial life]].
*In the ''[[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal]]'' web comic ([http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1733 #1733]), Enceladus is depicted as having fish like creatures below its icy surface. These creatures are used in what appears to be the McDonald's [[Filet-O-Fish|Fish Fillet]].

*In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[Cold Warriors]]\", Enceladus is referred to as \"Saturn's main dump moon\", and is the location of a specimen of the cold virus from the 20th century.
*The ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'' stops at Enceladus in the fourth episode of ''[[Space Battleship Yamato 2199]]'' to acquire a rare metal for essential repairs, and to find possible survivors transmitting a distress signal. Isolated ''Yamato'' crew members are pursued by enemy forces, but are saved by an ice geyser. The moon is later used as a base for the Earth Defense Fleet by 2202.
*In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s novel ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', characters occasionally refer to the \"Enceladian biota\" &ndash; microscopic alien organisms that some humans ingest, believing them to have medicinal value.
*Michael J. Martinez's novel ''The Enceladus Crisis'' is set in part on Enceladus.
*In the video game [[Destiny 2: Forsaken]] Cayde-6 leaves a coded message in the mission \"Ace in the Hole\" that goes as follows: \"If The Sun Over Nessus Escapes Nebula Cycle; Evac Labor After Dawn, Under Solstice\" [SPOILER ALERT] If you take the first letter from each word, it spells the sentence, IT'S ON ENCELADUS.
*In Evan Rentz's novel ''Neighbor Earth: The Landing in Illinois'' (2019), Enceladus is the origin of the Saturn beasts, an intelligent extraterrestrial species whose discovery was claimed by the United States during the height of the [[Space Race]].

== Tethys ==
[[Image:Odysseus crater.jpg|right|80px|Tethys]]
[[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]] is a medium-sized icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, very similar to Dione.

* An unnamed Tethys is the setting for the 1980 science fiction thriller ''[[Saturn 3]]''.
* In the American animated television series ''[[Exosquad]]'', Tethys was the primary base of the Pirate Clans prior to the discovery of Chaos.
* In the 1993 computer game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', an image of Tethys was used for a fictional planet called Tei-Tenga, which was cut from the game. The image can be still seen within the games textures.
* Level 17 of the computer game ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'' takes place in the Tethys H<sub>2</sub>O Mine.
*In Warhammer 40,000, Tethys is the location of the Librarium Daemonicum, a repositary of the knowledge of the Ordo Malleus branch of the Inquisition.
Due to the large crater on the surface of Tethys, some people call it \"The Death Moon\" due to it being similar to the Star Wars battle station, the Death Star, a moon-sized spacestation with a superlaser powerful enough to blow up planets.

== Dione ==
[[Image:Dione color south.jpg|right|80px|Dione]]
[[Dione (moon)|Dione]] is a medium-sized icy moon orbiting close to Saturn
*In [[Grant Callin|Grant D. Callin's]] science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', [[Dione (moon)|Dione]] is one of the locations of an alien artifact.
*In the early [[Noon Universe]] novel ''[[Space Apprentice]]'' by [[Strugatsky brothers]] as the heroes stop there on their way (one of them is a planetologist and has some interest in the moon's observatory) they found that its administrator made it a living hell for everybody. This revelation serves as one of the major plot points in the novel.
*In [[Paul J. McAuley]]'s ''[[The Quiet War (novel)|The Quiet War]]'' (2008), Dione's Paris is the leading settlement amongst Saturn's inhabited \"Outer\" satellite colonies, and suffers heavily due to its vocal resistance.
*In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', Dione has been broken into chunks and crashed onto the surface of [[Venus]] as part of a [[terraforming]] process.

== Rhea ==
[[Image:Rhea true color.jpg|right|80px]]
[[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] is the second-largest moon of Saturn.

* \"Valley of Pretenders\" by Dennis Clive (pseudonym of [[John Russell Fearn]]), published in ''Science Fiction'', March 1939.
* \"Outpost of the Eons\" by Dirk Wylie (pseudonym of Joseph Harold Dockweiler), published in ''Astonishing Stories'', April 1943.
* In the film ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', humanity builds a defense outpost on Rhea.
* In the [[Red Rising]] book series, 60 years prior to the events of the books Rhea rebelled against the society and as a lesson to other inhabited moons and planets was 'glassed' (the surface bombarded until so hot it formed a layer of glass-like rock).

== Titan ==
[[Image:Titan in natural color Cassini.jpg|80px|right|Titan]]
{{main|Titan in fiction}}
[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is the largest [[natural satellite|moon]] of [[Saturn]]. Its substantial [[atmosphere]] makes it the most [[Earth]]-like moon in the [[Solar System]] and hence a popular [[science fiction]] setting.
<!--Please put additional references to Titan in the *Titan in fiction* main article, not in this space-->

== Hyperion ==
[[Image:Hyperion true.jpg|right|80px]]
[[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] is the largest irregularly-shaped moon of Saturn, orbiting between Titan and Iapetus.

* Level 16 of the computer game ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'' takes place in a [[methane]] mine on Hyperion.
* In [[Dan Simmons]]'s ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'', the eponymous planet was first colonised by settlers from a colony on the moon Hyperion.
* In [[Alastair Reynolds]]' science fiction novel ''[[On the Steel Breeze]]'' (2012), Hyperion is home to a colony of \"artists and malcontents\".
* In the anime ''[[Infinite Ryvius]]'' (1999), Hyperion is the site of a self-governed colony independent of the rest of the Alliance.

== Iapetus ==

[[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] is a large moon orbiting further from Saturn than any of its other large satellites.  Half of its surface is very bright while the other half is extremely dark.  Investigations since 2004 have also noted its irregular shape, immense impact basins, and a high mountainous ridge on the equator.

* In [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story \"The Comedian's Children\" (1958), a manned expedition to Iapetus in 2034 creates a public craze for black/white designs and \"bi-colored gimcrackery\", but is later linked to ''iapetitis'', a disease in children where one side of the body turns white and paralyzed, the other black.
* In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), astronaut Dave Bowman finds an enigmatic alien monolith waiting for him on the surface of Iapetus (referred to as \"Japetus\" throughout). Iapetus's two tone coloration is caused by a vast white ellipse on the moon's surface, with the monolith appearing as a black dot in its exact center. When the ''Voyager'' space probes arrived at Iapetus thirteen years later, they discovered that there was indeed a black region within the moon's brighter hemisphere. Clarke reports that [[Carl Sagan]], who was on the ''Voyager'' imaging team, sent him a photo, with the note \"Thinking of you ...\".<ref>Arthur C. Clarke, Introduction to ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' (1984)</ref>  Because of [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)#Differences from the film|difficulties]] achieving a convincing model of Saturn's rings, the film version of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' relocated the monolith to an orbit around Jupiter. The three sequel novels written by Clarke follow the film rather than the novel in this matter.
* Iapetus is the setting for ''[[The Saturn Game]]'' (1981) by [[Poul Anderson]].
* Iapetus is the second site of the mysterious phenomenon called \"goorm\" in Sergei Pavlov's hard SF novel ''[[Moon Rainbow]]'' (1984), first being the Uranus' moon [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]].
* In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s futuristic novel ''[[The Memory of Whiteness]]'' (1985), Iapetus is populated by the descendants of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] colonists who retain a [[Communist]] political system.
* In [[Grant Callin]]'s 1986 science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', Iapetus is one of the locations of an alien artifact. There is also human colonization and mining at an installation called \"I-Base\".
* In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s [[Gaea trilogy]], Iapetus is used as a \"nest\" for a fledgling Titan.  One of the objectives of the ''Ringmaster'' mission to Saturn is to investigate the moon's dark region recently contracting to a narrow band; Gaea reveals this is the result of her offspring entering a new stage of development.  When it is fully mature, Iapetus will be shattered and the new Titan born out of its rubble.
* In [[David Weber]]'s novel ''[[The Armageddon Inheritance]]'' (1993), genocidal aliens (the Achuultani) attempt to use Iapetus as a kinetic energy weapon to destroy all life on Earth.
* In the ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' universe, Iapetus acts as a dockyard for the Ordo Malleus fleet, as well as that of the Grey Knights chapter of Space Marines.
* Iapetus appears in [[Ian McDonald (author)|Ian McDonald]]'s ''Chaga''.
* In [[Jack McDevitt]]'s ''[[The Engines of God]]'' (1996), there is a strange ice-made icon on Iapetus. It leads to a depressing discovery that every intelligent civilization of the Galaxy could be obliterated by an unknown Dark Force from the void between the Galaxy's arms.
* Iapetus is the setting of the book ''Aliens: Steel Egg'' by John Shirley (2007).
* In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s novel ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', a giant city known as the High Street is built along the spine of Iapetus's [[equatorial ridge]].
* In the online comic by Joshua Quagmire, ''Bunz & Katz'' (November 2012 - current) Iapetus is revealed to be an ancient, near-derelict alien battle station which is \"awakened\" by the ''Cassini'' probe fly-by. The series' protagonists are the only surviving scouts from this station.

==Phoebe==

[[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]] is a retrograde orbiting moon in the outer Saturn system. It is the largest of the Saturnian [[irregular moon]]s.

*In [[James S.A. Corey]]'s ''Expanse'' series, Phoebe is actually an alien biological warhead that was accidentally captured by Saturn on its way to reprogram protozoan life on Earth. The extraction and use as a weapon of the protomolecular payload of Phoebe drives the primary conflicts of the series.

'''James Walker Fannin Jr.''' (1804 or 1805 &ndash; March 27, 1836) was a 19th-century American military figure in the Texas Army and leader during the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1835&ndash;36. After being outnumbered and surrendering to Mexican forces at the [[Battle of Coleto Creek]], Colonel Fannin and [[Goliad massacre|nearly all his 344 men were executed]] soon afterward at [[Goliad, Texas]], under [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]'s orders for all rebels to be executed.

He was memorialized in several place names, including a military training camp and a major city street of Houston.

==Early life and family==
Different sources say his year of birth as either 1804 or 1805.<ref name=HoTFannin>{{cite web|last1=Hartmann|first1=Clinton P.|title=James Walker Fannin|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffa02|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>

He was born in Georgia to Isham Fannin, a veteran of the [[War of 1812]]. His mother's last name was Walker. Although she was not married to his father, the Walker family raised him. His ancestors, who spelled the family name Fanning, lived in America during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], a family with divided loyalties during the conflict. Isham's father James W. Fannin dropped the \"g\" from the family name and settled in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>Brown (2000) pp.3-5</ref>

Fannin enrolled in the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] on July 1, 1819.<ref>Brown (2000) p. 5</ref> He resigned November 20, 1821, from the school. Although he seems to have been academically deficient, and was often tardy or absent from classes, he had received a letter from a cousin urging his immediate return to Georgia to attend to ailing grandparents.<ref>Brown (2000) p. 6</ref>

He married Minerva Fort. Their daughter, Missouri Pinckney, was born on July 17, 1829.<ref>Brown (2000) p. 10</ref> A second daughter, Minerva, nicknamed Eliza, was born mentally ill in 1832.<ref name=\"B1213\">Brown (2000) pp. 12-16</ref> While living in [[Columbus, Georgia]], he enlisted in the [[Militia (United States)|militia]] and worked as a merchant.<ref>Brown (2000) p.8</ref> In [[Muscogee County, Georgia|Muscogee County]], he was a member of the Temperance Society and served for a short time as a judge.<ref>Brown (2000) pp.8-9</ref> By 1832, Fannin was involved in the (illegal) business of transporting slaves.

==Texas Revolution==
{{main article|Texas Revolution}}
In 1834, Fannin settled his family at [[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]], in colonial [[Coahuila y Tejas|Tejas]] (now Texas), where he owned a [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] and was a managing partner in a slave-trading syndicate.<ref>Brown (2000) pp. 21,23-26</ref> By 1835, Fannin was involved in the growing [[English American|Anglo-American]] resistance to the [[Mexican Texas|Mexican government in Texas]]. He wrote letters seeking financial assistance and volunteers to help Texas. By September, Fannin was an active volunteer in the Texas Army.<ref>Brown (2000) p. 2</ref>

He took part in the [[Battle of Gonzales]] on October 2 and urged [[Stephen F. Austin]] to send aid to Gonzales. Fannin later worked with [[James Bowie]], First Battalion, First Division, under Austin's orders to secure supplies and determine the conditions in and around Gonzales and [[San Antonio de Bexar]].

{{quote|Fellow citizens ... We urge as many as can possibly leave their homes to repair to Gonzales immediately, \"armed and equipped for war even to the knife.\" ...If Texas will now act promptly, she will soon be redeemed from that worse than Egyptian bondage which now cramps her resources and retards her prosperity.|J.W. Fannin. Jr. (et al), October 2, 1835<ref>Brown (2000) p. 40</ref>}}

Under the command of Bowie,<ref>Brown (2000) p. 42</ref> Fannin fought in the [[Battle of Concepción]] on October 28, 1835.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barr|first1=Alwyn|title=Battle of Concepción|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qec02|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>

In November 1835, Austin ordered Fannin and [[William B. Travis]] and about 150 men to cut off any Mexican supply party. On November 13, Houston offered Fannin the post of [[inspector general]] to the regular army.<ref name=HoTFannin/> Fannin wrote back requesting a field appointment of [[brigadier general]] and a \"post of danger\". On November 22, 1835, Fannin was honorably discharged from the volunteer army by Austin and began campaigning for a larger regular army for Texas. He also went home to spend time with his family.<ref name=HoTFannin/>

[[Sam Houston]], supported by Governor [[Henry Smith (Texas Governor)|Henry Smith]], commissioned Fannin as a [[colonel]] in the regular army on December 7, 1835. By January 7, 1836, the provisional government had appointed Fannin \"military agent\", to answer only to the council and not Houston. He began recruiting forces and supplies for the forthcoming and confusing [[Matamoros Expedition|Matamoros campaign]] against the Mexican city of [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]]. Fannin had difficulty leading the volunteers in his charge. He tried to institute regular Army discipline, but his [[irregular military|irregular]] volunteers would not accept it. Many of his men thought he was aloof, and several historians believe that he was an ineffective commander because of it. The majority of the men serving under Fannin had been in Texas only a short time; he was frustrated by this, writing to Lt. Governor [[James W. Robinson (Texas and California)|James W. Robinson]] \"... among the rise of 400 men at, and near this post, I doubt if 25 citizens of Texas can be mustered in the ranks...\".<ref name=bradle135>Bradle (2007), pg. 135</ref>

In early February, Fannin sailed from Velasco and landed at Copano with four companies of the Georgia Battalion, moving to join a small band of [[Texian]]s at [[Refugio, Texas|Refugio]]. Mexican reinforcements under General [[Jose Urrea]] arrived at [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], complicating the Texian plans to attack that city. Fannin withdrew 25 miles north to [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]].

==Failed expedition to support the Alamo and aftermath==
{{Main article|Goliad Campaign}}
Appeals from Travis at the Alamo  (via [[James Bonham]]) prompted Fannin to launch a relief march of more than 300 men and four pieces of artillery on February 25, 1836. After some delay, Fannin and his men moved out on the 28th for the journey to San Antonio, a distance of more than 90 miles. The relief mission was a failure. The troops barely had crossed the [[San Antonio River]] when wagons broke down, prompting the men to camp within sight of [[Goliad]].<ref>Moore (2004) p.28</ref> They had little or no food, some men were barefooted, and the oxen teams wandered off during the night. On March 6, 1836, the [[Battle of the Alamo]] was fought, with all the Alamo's defenders (about 187 men) being killed by Mexican forces.

The Mexican forces under General José de Urrea were now rapidly approaching the Texan stronghold in Goliad. They defeated Texian forces at the [[Battle of San Patricio]] on February 27, where 20 were killed and prisoners were taken. [[Frank W. Johnson]] and four other Texians were captured, but later managed to escape and rejoin James Fannin's command at Goliad.<ref>Todish,.Todish,Spring (1998) p.128</ref>

The [[Battle of Agua Dulce]] was fought on March 2. Dr. [[James Grant (Texas)|James Grant]], Robert C. Morris and 12 others were killed, with prisoners taken.

On March 14, 1836, Ward and King were attacked by Urrea and more than 200 Mexican soldiers as they were about to leave. This detachment was part of Urrea's larger force of nearly 1,200 men. The same day, General Houston ordered Fannin to retreat to [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]]. Fannin sent word to the men at Refugio to rendezvous with his command at Victoria.

Transporting nine cannons and more than 500 spare muskets, Fannin's forces were also heavily laden with supplies and baggage. The column had traveled about 6 miles when Fannin ordered a halt to rest his animals. At about 3 pm, Mexican cavalry appeared. The Texians immediately formed a [[Infantry square|hollow square]] with their wagons and cannon placed in each corner for defense as Gen. Urrea's forces attacked. After a fierce battle, the Mexicans lost about 100 to 200 killed and wounded; Texian losses were seven to nine killed and 60 wounded. Facing overwhelming odds, though, Fannin and his troops surrendered the next day, at the [[Battle of Coleto]].<ref name=hardin173>Hardin (1994), p. 173</ref>

==The Goliad massacre==
{{Main article|Goliad massacre}}
The Mexicans took the Texans back to Goliad, where they were held as prisoners at Fort Defiance. The Texans thought they would likely be set free in a few weeks. General Urrea left Goliad, leaving command to Colonel Jose Nicolas de la Portilla. Urrea wrote to Santa Anna to ask for clemency for the Texans.  Urrea wrote in his diary that he \"... wished to elude these orders as far as possible without compromising my personal responsibility.\" On March 26, 1836, 19:00, Santa Anna ordered Portilla to execute the prisoners.<ref name=hardin173/>

The next day, [[Palm Sunday]], March 27, 1836, Colonel Portilla had 400 Texans marched out of Fort Defiance into three columns on the Bexar Road, San Patricio Road, and Victoria Road. They were shot point blank, between two rows of Mexican soldiers, and any survivors were clubbed or knifed to death.<ref name=hardin173/>

The 40 wounded men who could not walk were executed inside the fort compound. Fannin was the last to be executed, after seeing his men killed. He was taken by Mexican soldiers to the courtyard in front of the chapel, blindfolded, and seated in a chair (due to his leg wound from the battle). He made three requests: he asked for his personal possessions to be sent to his family, to be shot in his heart and not his face, and to be given a Christian burial. The soldiers took his belongings, shot him in the face, and burned Fannin's body along with the other Texans who died that day.<ref name=hardin174>Hardin (1994), p. 174</ref><ref>[http://www.presidiolabahia.org/frequently_asked_questions.htm \"Frequently Asked Questions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309031543/http://www.presidiolabahia.org/frequently_asked_questions.htm |date=March 9, 2013 }}, Presidio La Bahia</ref>

Twenty-eight Texans escaped by feigning death and other means. Three known survivors escaped to Houston's army, where they fought in the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. In numerous accounts of the Goliad Massacre, a Mexican woman, [[Francita Alavez]], rescued about 20 Texan soldiers; she became known as \"The Angel of Goliad\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/goliadangel.htm|title=Sons of Dewitt Colony Texas, The Angel of Goliad|publisher=Texas A&M University|accessdate=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205105032/http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/goliadangel.htm|archivedate=December 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Other people were known to have rescued prisoners.

'''James Walker Fannin Jr.''' (1804 or 1805 &ndash; March 27, 1836) was a 19th-century American military figure in the Texas Army and leader during the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1835&ndash;36. After being outnumbered and surrendering to Mexican forces at the [[Battle of Coleto Creek]], Colonel Fannin and [[Goliad massacre|nearly all his 344 men were executed]] soon afterward at [[Goliad, Texas]], under [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]'s orders for all rebels to be executed.

He was memorialized in several place names, including a military training camp and a major city street of Houston.

==Early life and family==
Different sources say his year of birth as either 1804 or 1805.<ref name=HoTFannin>{{cite web|last1=Hartmann|first1=Clinton P.|title=James Walker Fannin|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffa02|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>

He was born in Georgia to Isham Fannin, a veteran of the [[War of 1812]]. His mother's last name was Walker. Although she was not married to his father, the Walker family raised him. His ancestors, who spelled the family name Fanning, lived in America during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], a family with divided loyalties during the conflict. Isham's father James W. Fannin dropped the \"g\" from the family name and settled in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>Brown (2000) pp.3-5</ref>

Fannin enrolled in the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] on July 1, 1819.<ref>Brown (2000) p. 5</ref> He resigned November 20, 1821, from the school. Although he seems to have been academically deficient, and was often tardy or absent from classes, he had received a letter from a cousin urging his immediate return to Georgia to attend to ailing grandparents.<ref>Brown (2000) p. 6</ref>

He married Minerva Fort. Their daughter, Missouri Pinckney, was born on July 17, 1829.<ref>Brown (2000) p. 10</ref> A second daughter, Minerva, nicknamed Eliza, was born mentally ill in 1832.<ref name=\"B1213\">Brown (2000) pp. 12-16</ref> While living in [[Columbus, Georgia]], he enlisted in the [[Militia (United States)|militia]] and worked as a merchant.<ref>Brown (2000) p.8</ref> In [[Muscogee County, Georgia|Muscogee County]], he was a member of the Temperance Society and served for a short time as a judge.<ref>Brown (2000) pp.8-9</ref> By 1832, Fannin was involved in the (illegal) business of transporting slaves.

==Texas Revolution==
{{main article|Texas Revolution}}
In 1834, Fannin settled his family at [[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]], in colonial [[Coahuila y Tejas|Tejas]] (now Texas), where he owned a [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] and was a managing partner in a slave-trading syndicate.<ref>Brown (2000) pp. 21,23-26</ref> By 1835, Fannin was involved in the growing [[English American|Anglo-American]] resistance to the [[Mexican Texas|Mexican government in Texas]]. He wrote letters seeking financial assistance and volunteers to help Texas. By September, Fannin was an active volunteer in the Texas Army.<ref>Brown (2000) p. 2</ref>

He took part in the [[Battle of Gonzales]] on October 2 and urged [[Stephen F. Austin]] to send aid to Gonzales. Fannin later worked with [[James Bowie]], First Battalion, First Division, under Austin's orders to secure supplies and determine the conditions in and around Gonzales and [[San Antonio de Bexar]].

{{quote|Fellow citizens ... We urge as many as can possibly leave their homes to repair to Gonzales immediately, \"armed and equipped for war even to the knife.\" ...If Texas will now act promptly, she will soon be redeemed from that worse than Egyptian bondage which now cramps her resources and retards her prosperity.|J.W. Fannin. Jr. (et al), October 2, 1835<ref>Brown (2000) p. 40</ref>}}

Under the command of Bowie,<ref>Brown (2000) p. 42</ref> Fannin fought in the [[Battle of Concepción]] on October 28, 1835.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barr|first1=Alwyn|title=Battle of Concepción|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qec02|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>

In November 1835, Austin ordered Fannin and [[William B. Travis]] and about 150 men to cut off any Mexican supply party. On November 13, Houston offered Fannin the post of [[inspector general]] to the regular army.<ref name=HoTFannin/> Fannin wrote back requesting a field appointment of [[brigadier general]] and a \"post of danger\". On November 22, 1835, Fannin was honorably discharged from the volunteer army by Austin and began campaigning for a larger regular army for Texas. He also went home to spend time with his family.<ref name=HoTFannin/>

[[Sam Houston]], supported by Governor [[Henry Smith (Texas Governor)|Henry Smith]], commissioned Fannin as a [[colonel]] in the regular army on December 7, 1835. By January 7, 1836, the provisional government had appointed Fannin \"military agent\", to answer only to the council and not Houston. He began recruiting forces and supplies for the forthcoming and confusing [[Matamoros Expedition|Matamoros campaign]] against the Mexican city of [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]]. Fannin had difficulty leading the volunteers in his charge. He tried to institute regular Army discipline, but his [[irregular military|irregular]] volunteers would not accept it. Many of his men thought he was aloof, and several historians believe that he was an ineffective commander because of it. The majority of the men serving under Fannin had been in Texas only a short time; he was frustrated by this, writing to Lt. Governor [[James W. Robinson (Texas and California)|James W. Robinson]] \"... among the rise of 400 men at, and near this post, I doubt if 25 citizens of Texas can be mustered in the ranks...\".<ref name=bradle135>Bradle (2007), pg. 135</ref>

In early February, Fannin sailed from Velasco and landed at Copano with four companies of the Georgia Battalion, moving to join a small band of [[Texian]]s at [[Refugio, Texas|Refugio]]. Mexican reinforcements under General [[Jose Urrea]] arrived at [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], complicating the Texian plans to attack that city. Fannin withdrew 25 miles north to [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]].

==Failed expedition to support the Alamo and aftermath==
{{Main article|Goliad Campaign}}
Appeals from Travis at the Alamo  (via [[James Bonham]]) prompted Fannin to launch a relief march of more than 300 men and four pieces of artillery on February 25, 1836. After some delay, Fannin and his men moved out on the 28th for the journey to San Antonio, a distance of more than 90 miles. The relief mission was a failure. The troops barely had crossed the [[San Antonio River]] when wagons broke down, prompting the men to camp within sight of [[Goliad]].<ref>Moore (2004) p.28</ref> They had little or no food, some men were barefooted, and the oxen teams wandered off during the night. On March 6, 1836, the [[Battle of the Alamo]] was fought, with all the Alamo's defenders (about 187 men) being killed by Mexican forces.

The Mexican forces under General José de Urrea were now rapidly approaching the Texan stronghold in Goliad. They defeated Texian forces at the [[Battle of San Patricio]] on February 27, where 20 were killed and prisoners were taken. [[Frank W. Johnson]] and four other Texians were captured, but later managed to escape and rejoin James Fannin's command at Goliad.<ref>Todish,.Todish,Spring (1998) p.128</ref>

The [[Battle of Agua Dulce]] was fought on March 2. Dr. [[James Grant (Texas)|James Grant]], Robert C. Morris and 12 others were killed, with prisoners taken. [[Plácido Benavides]] and six others escaped to notify Fannin of the situation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bishop|first1=Curtis|title=Battle of Agua Dulce Creek|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfa01|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref>

'''Drudkh''' is a Ukrainian [[black metal]] band. It currently consists of {{ill|Roman Saenko|uk|Роман Саєнко}} (former member of [[Hate Forest]] and [[Dark Ages (band)|Dark Ages]]), Thurios (former member of [[Astrofaes]]), Krechet, and Vlad. All four also belonged to [[Blood of Kingu]] until it was disbanded. Their lyrics embrace [[Slavic mythology]]. Many of the band's lyrics are derived from the works of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets ([[Oleksandr Oles]], [[Oleh Olzhych]], [[Maik Yohansen]] etc.) and especially [[Taras Shevchenko]].

Drudkh have been particularly secretive throughout the course of their career, even for a black metal band, giving no interviews and not releasing the lyrics to several of their albums. The band is not explicitly political in its lyrics and has denied links to fascism or any other political ideology. However, Hate Forest, Saekno's previous band, was more explicitly involved in the NSBM scene, and Drudkh's music has repeatedly referenced the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]], a [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalist]] formation from World War II that committed [[ethnic cleansing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.splicetoday.com/music/fascist-folk|title=Fascist Folk|last=Berlatsky|first=Noah|date=September 10, 2009|website=[[Splice Today]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> From their conception until 2009, Drudkh did not have any official website, but in May 2009, [[Season of Mist]] launched an official [[Myspace]], operated by the label rather than the band.

==History==
Drudkh have released ten albums, two EPs, three splits, and one anthology collecting material from the band's early splits and EPs. Their early releases were released on CD through the [[England|English]] [[extreme metal]] record label [[Supernal Music]], with the exception of the EP (which was a vinyl release), and, again with the exception of the EP, on vinyl through two [[Finland|Finnish]] black metal labels, [[Northern Heritage]] and Faustian Distribution. More recent release have been through Season of Mist, which has also issued remastered versions of the band's earlier albums as [[digipak]]s.

The band's first album, ''[[Forgotten Legends]]'', was released on August 18, 2003. The album establishes the band's trademark epic sound; its three tracks and one [[conclusion (music)|outro]] span nearly forty minutes, with the longest track, \"False Dawn\", nearing the sixteen-minute mark. ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' included ''Forgotten Legends'' in its Top 40 Black Metal albums list.<ref>{{cite web

''[[Autumn Aurora]]'' followed on November 28, 2004 (see [[2004 in music]]). While continuing its predecessor's general mood and atmosphere, it distinguishes itself by incorporating [[synthesizer]]s and other such [[keyboard instrument]]s. ''Autumn Aurora'' has frequently been cited as Drudkh's finest album, although some fans give the nod to the later ''[[Blood in Our Wells]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This record had a strong critical success: for example, it was chosen the best album of the year by [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] web-zine.<ref>{{cite web

After ''Autumn Aurora'', Amorth (drums, keyboards) joined the band and replaced Yuriy.

''[[The Swan Road]]'' (''Лебединий шлях''), released on March 14, 2005 (see [[2005 in music]]), marked a departure in a number of ways. It was well reviewed and is the first Drudkh album to have Ukrainian lyrics, all of which are adapted or taken directly from the work ''[[Haydamaky (poem)|The Haidamakas]]'' ([[1841 in literature|1841]]) by [[Taras Shevchenko]], narrating about the [[Koliyivshchyna|Ukrainian anti-Polish uprising]] of 1768.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Its CD booklet included prints of Shevchenko's notebooks, which many non-Ukrainian-speaking fans mistook for song lyrics. The addition of Shevchenko's poetry can also be said to have given Drudkh's music a more pronounced [[Ukrainian nationalism|nationalistic leaning]] (a move continued on the next album). The music's atmosphere is also significantly more urgent, with the drums pushed to the forefront of the mix and a vastly increased use of [[blast beat]]s.

On March 23, 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]), Drudkh released ''Blood in Our Wells'' (''Кров у наших криницях''), once again through Supernal Music. On this album, poetry from four nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets (including [[Oleksandr Oles]] and [[Lina Kostenko]]) serves as lyrical material, and the album itself was dedicated to [[Stepan Bandera]], leader of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. Musically, the album adds [[progressive rock]] influences and an increased use of traditional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[guitar solo|soloing]] into the mix, while retaining the band's tradition of blending black metal and Ukrainian folk music. In part because several tracks sample the Ukrainian poetic film ''[[Mamay (film)|Mamay]]'' (2003), the album is considered more cinematic than its predecessors. Many fans have cited this album as the band's best work to date. It was Drudkh's first record to appear in the ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' Top 40 year list, placing at number 35.<ref name=rocklistmusic.co.uk>{{cite web

After the release of ''Blood in Our Wells'', Amorth was exiled from the band and new members Krechet (bass) and Vlad (drums) joined.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On October 19, 2006, Drudkh released ''[[Songs of Grief and Solitude]]'' (''Пісні скорботи і самітності''). This release is composed of folk music, with much of the music containing melodic elements from previous Drudkh compositions (for example, \"The Cranes Will Never Return Here\" is based on a riff from \"Solitude\" on ''Blood in Our Wells'', and \"Archaic Dance\" is based on a riff from \"Glare of 1768\" on ''The Swan Road''). It is entirely instrumental, with barely any drumming, and prominently features wind instruments. The album received mixed reviews, with some fans criticising the band for reusing old material, and others praising the band's radical reconstruction of its own sound.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On April 16, 2007 (see [[2007 in music]]), Supernal Music released Drudkh's ''[[Anti-Urban]]'', a 45-RPM 10&nbsp;inch coloured vinyl limited to 999 copies containing exclusive tracks available only to Supernal Music customers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Season of Mist]] later re-released it as a [[mini CD]] in 2009 as part of the deluxe box-set edition of ''[[Microcosmos (Drudkh album)|Microcosmos]]'', and it was also included on the band's collection ''Eastern Frontier in Flames''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The band's next release, a full-length black metal album titled ''[[Estrangement (album)|Estrangement]]'' (''Вiдчуженiсть''), was released on August 25, 2007 as a deluxe edition.<ref name=supernalmusic>{{cite web

| accessdate = October 11, 2012
}}</ref> The album, which had the working title ''River of Tears'', had been rumored to have a \"[[Burzum]]ic\" feel before its release, and in some ways this was borne out by the album's release; its songs were in many ways significantly more minimalistic than those on ''Blood in Our Wells''. Its lyrics were based completely on the 1931-1932 works of Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych. Reception to the album has been largely positive, with many fans hailing it as a return to the band's roots or praising the band's musicianship demonstrated in the album's many solos. Notably, the album also featured the band's first prominent use of blast beats since ''The Swan Road''. A spoken introduction in the first track is taken from the 1995 Ukrainian feature film ''{{ill|Assassination. An Autumn Murder in Munich|uk|Атентат — Осіннє вбивство в Мюнхені}}'' about Bandera's life and assassination.

In Autumn 2008, the band signed with the [[France|French]] label Season of Mist.<ref>{{cite web

Drudkh's eighth full-length album, ''[[Handful of Stars]]'' (''Пригорща зірок''), was released on September 21, 2010, via [[Season of Mist]]. Critics and fans noticed the changes in style and sound: it was much clearer than previous efforts and bore influence from [[post-rock]]. The record received mixed reviews as a result, though it appeared in ''Haunting the Chapel''{{'s}} Top 50 Albums of 2010 at 8 position.<ref name=top2010/> Again, for lyrics was used the poetry of Ukrainian authors, such as [[Oleksa Stefanovych]] and [[Svyatoslav Gordynskyj]].<ref>{{cite web

It was released as a CD only with deluxe edition of ''Handful of Stars'' and also as [[10\" LP]] including download card to get the digital version of the record.

The music's atmosphere is also significantly more urgent, with the drums pushed to the forefront of the mix and a vastly increased use of [[blast beat]]s.

On March 23, 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]), Drudkh released ''Blood in Our Wells'' (''Кров у наших криницях''), once again through Supernal Music. On this album, poetry from four nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets (including [[Oleksandr Oles]] and [[Lina Kostenko]]) serves as lyrical material, and the album itself was dedicated to [[Stepan Bandera]], leader of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. Musically, the album adds [[progressive rock]] influences and an increased use of traditional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[guitar solo|soloing]] into the mix, while retaining the band's tradition of blending black metal and Ukrainian folk music. In part because several tracks sample the Ukrainian poetic film ''[[Mamay (film)|Mamay]]'' (2003), the album is considered more cinematic than its predecessors. Many fans have cited this album as the band's best work to date. It was Drudkh's first record to appear in the ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' Top 40 year list, placing at number 35.<ref name=rocklistmusic.co.uk>{{cite web

After the release of ''Blood in Our Wells'', Amorth was exiled from the band and new members Krechet (bass) and Vlad (drums) joined.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On October 19, 2006, Drudkh released ''[[Songs of Grief and Solitude]]'' (''Пісні скорботи і самітності''). This release is composed of folk music, with much of the music containing melodic elements from previous Drudkh compositions (for example, \"The Cranes Will Never Return Here\" is based on a riff from \"Solitude\" on ''Blood in Our Wells'', and \"Archaic Dance\" is based on a riff from \"Glare of 1768\" on ''The Swan Road''). It is entirely instrumental, with barely any drumming, and prominently features wind instruments. The album received mixed reviews, with some fans criticising the band for reusing old material, and others praising the band's radical reconstruction of its own sound.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On April 16, 2007 (see [[2007 in music]]), Supernal Music released Drudkh's ''[[Anti-Urban]]'', a 45-RPM 10&nbsp;inch coloured vinyl limited to 999 copies containing exclusive tracks available only to Supernal Music customers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Season of Mist]] later re-released it as a [[mini CD]] in 2009 as part of the deluxe box-set edition of ''[[Microcosmos (Drudkh album)|Microcosmos]]'', and it was also included on the band's collection ''Eastern Frontier in Flames''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The band's next release, a full-length black metal album titled ''[[Estrangement (album)|Estrangement]]'' (''Вiдчуженiсть''), was released on August 25, 2007 as a deluxe edition.<ref name=supernalmusic>{{cite web

}}</ref> The album, which had the working title ''River of Tears'', had been rumored to have a \"[[Burzum]]ic\" feel before its release, and in some ways this was borne out by the album's release; its songs were in many ways significantly more minimalistic than those on ''Blood in Our Wells''. Its lyrics were based completely on the 1931-1932 works of Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych. Reception to the album has been largely positive, with many fans hailing it as a return to the band's roots or praising the band's musicianship demonstrated in the album's many solos. Notably, the album also featured the band's first prominent use of blast beats since ''The Swan Road''. A spoken introduction in the first track is taken from the 1995 Ukrainian feature film ''{{ill|Assassination. An Autumn Murder in Munich|uk|Атентат — Осіннє вбивство в Мюнхені}}'' about Bandera's life and assassination.

In Autumn 2008, the band signed with the [[France|French]] label Season of Mist.<ref>{{cite web

Drudkh's eighth full-length album, ''[[Handful of Stars]]'' (''Пригорща зірок''), was released on September 21, 2010, via [[Season of Mist]]. Critics and fans noticed the changes in style and sound: it was much clearer than previous efforts and bore influence from [[post-rock]]. The record received mixed reviews as a result, though it appeared in ''Haunting the Chapel''{{'s}} Top 50 Albums of 2010 at 8 position.<ref name=top2010/> Again, for lyrics was used the poetry of Ukrainian authors, such as [[Oleksa Stefanovych]] and [[Svyatoslav Gordynskyj]].<ref>{{cite web

== Career ==
[[File:Princess Nokia.jpg|thumb|Princess Nokia performing in 2014]]

=== Early career and ''Metallic Butterfly'' (2010-2016) ===
Frasqueri recorded their first song, \"Destiny\", in 2010, and released it under the name \"Wavy Spice\" on their [[SoundCloud]] page and their YouTube channel in mid-2012. It was largely autobiographical and gained modest popularity. Subsequently, they released their second track, \"Bitch I'm Posh\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /><ref>[http://noisey.vice.com/ja/blog/wavy-spice-bitch-im-posh Wavy Spice\" \"Bitch I'm Posh\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220182519/http://noisey.vice.com/ja/blog/wavy-spice-bitch-im-posh |date=2014-02-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"paper\" /> The track went viral, and as of March 2020, received 170,000 plays on SoundCloud.<ref>\"[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/16/wavy-spice Wavy Spice (New band of the day No 1,679)]\" [[The Guardian]].

Frasqueri continued to release singles, such as ''Dragons'', a ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' inspired piece, ''Honeysuckle'', and ''Vicki Gotti'' until changing their moniker to Princess Nokia. They released their mixtape, ''1992'', on Soundcloud and began touring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/princessnokiaofficial/sets/1992-deluxe|title=1992 Deluxe|website=SoundCloud|language=en|access-date=2018-01-06}}</ref>

In February 2017, Frasqueri confronted a member of the audience at a charity concert at [[Cambridge University]] whom they accused of \"mouthing dirty obscenities like 'show me your tits'.\" The alleged harasser denied yelling such obscenities and told ''[[The Cambridge Student]]'': \"I was standing in the audience and was told by a fellow audience member that the name of the performer was 'Abigail'. Given that I was enjoying the performance, I shouted out 'Let's go Abigail!'. After I shouted this, they came down from the stage.

Frasqueri recorded their first song, \"Destiny\", in 2010, and released it under the name \"Wavy Spice\" on their [[SoundCloud]] page and their YouTube channel in mid-2012. It was largely autobiographical and gained modest popularity. Subsequently, they released their second track, \"Bitch I'm Posh\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /><ref>[http://noisey.vice.com/ja/blog/wavy-spice-bitch-im-posh Wavy Spice\" \"Bitch I'm Posh\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220182519/http://noisey.vice.com/ja/blog/wavy-spice-bitch-im-posh |date=2014-02-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"paper\" /> The track went viral, and as of March 2020, received 170,000 plays on SoundCloud.<ref>\"[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/16/wavy-spice Wavy Spice (New band of the day No 1,679)]\" [[The Guardian]].

Frasqueri continued to release singles, such as ''Dragons'', a ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' inspired piece, ''Honeysuckle'', and ''Vicki Gotti'' until changing their moniker to Princess Nokia.

==Music career==
In 1967, O'Sullivan was signed to a five-year contract with April Music, [[Columbia Records|CBS Records']] house publishing company, after coming to the attention of the professional manager Stephen Shane,<ref>'In 1967 ... [h]e took a part-time Christmas job at the [[C&A]] department store on [[Oxford Street]]. While there, a colleague brought his tapes to the attention of the [[CBS]] record company executives. They liked what they heard, and he was signed up.' ''Ireland's Own'', 12 June 2015, No. 5501, pg 9</ref> who also suggested changing his name from Ray to Gilbert as a play on the name of the operetta composers [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. His songs at the time were [[avant-garde]], and even drew the interest of [[Vivian Stanshall]] and the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]], who were interested in recording a couple of them. He was paid an advance of £12 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|12|1967|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), with which he bought a piano. He was signed to CBS Records by the [[A&R]] manager Mike Smith ([[the Tremeloes]] and [[Love Affair (band)|the Love Affair]]).

After two unsuccessful singles with CBS, \"Disappear\" and \"What Can I Do?\", and one with the Irish record label [[Major Minor Records|Major Minor]], \"Mr. Moody's Garden\", all released under the name \"Gilbert\", O'Sullivan sent some demo [[compact cassette|tapes]] to [[Gordon Mills]], the manager of [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], whereupon O'Sullivan was signed to Mills' label, [[MAM Records]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref>[http://www.classicbands.com/osullivan.html \"Gilbert O'Sullivan\"], ClassicBands.com, accessed 9 January 2013</ref> O'Sullivan's self-created eye-catching visual image comprised a [[Bowl cut|pudding basin haircut]], cloth cap and short trousers.

===Early success===
[[File:GilbertOSullivan1972.jpg|thumb|200px|right|O'Sullivan in 1972.]]
At the end of 1970, O'Sullivan achieved his first UK [[Top 40|Top 10]] hit with \"[[Nothing Rhymed]]\",<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> which also reached [[chart-topper|No. 1]] in the [[Netherlands]],<ref name=\"Top40/\">{{cite web|url=http://www.top40.nl/top40/1971/week-08|title=Top40 Chart|website=Top40.nl|accessdate=27 October 2017}}</ref> where it earned O'Sullivan his first [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/>  Subsequent hits followed including \"Underneath The Blanket Go\" (which also reached [[chart-topper|No. 1]] in the Netherlands), \"[[We Will (song)|We Will]]\" and \"No Matter How I Try\", the latter being named \"Best Ballad or Romantic Song\" at the 17th Ivor Novello Awards in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|title=1972|url=http://theivors.com/archive/1970-1979/the-ivors-1972/|website=The Ivors|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> O'Sullivan released his debut album, ''[[Himself (Gilbert O'Sullivan album)|Himself]]'', in 1971.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>

In 1972 O'Sullivan reached international [[celebrity|stardom]] with \"[[Alone Again (Naturally)]]\", which reached No. 3 in UK; No. 1 in the US, spending six non-consecutive weeks at [[Chart-topper|No. 1]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] and selling nearly two million copies; No. 2 in New Zealand (11 weeks on the charts in total); No. 1 in Canada for 2 weeks (13 weeks in the Top 40);<ref name=\"Webfitz\">[http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1972]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> and No. 1 in Japan (21 weeks on the chart). The guitar solo was played by [[Big Jim Sullivan]].

In total US sales for 1972, O'Sullivan's hit was topped only by [[Roberta Flack]]'s \"[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]\". Both songs were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] categories in 1973, but Flack won both.

O'Sullivan followed \"Alone\" with \"[[Clair (song)|Clair]]\" (1972, from the album ''[[Back to Front (Gilbert O'Sullivan album)|Back to Front]]''). The single reached No. 2 in the United States on the Hot 100 and No. 1 in the UK and Canada (14 weeks in the Canadian Top 40).<ref name=\"Webfitz\"/> O'Sullivan's [[gramophone record|disc]] sales exceeded ten million in 1972 and made him the top star of the year.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> O'Sullivan's success led to him taking part in the [[BBC]]'s anniversary programme ''Fifty Years of Music'' in November 1972.

\"[[Out of the Question (Gilbert O'Sullivan song)|Out of the Question]]\" (also from ''Back to Front'') reached No. 17 in the US and No. 14 in Canada.<ref name=\"Webfitz\"/>  \"[[Get Down (Gilbert O'Sullivan song)|Get Down]]\" (1973), from the album ''I'm A Writer Not A Fighter'', reached No. 1 in the UK and in Germany,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartsurfer.de/artist/gilbert-o-sullivan/get-down-song_vrgg.html|title=Get Down von Gilbert O'Sullivan|first=|last=Chartsurfer.de|website=Chartsurfer.de|accessdate=27 October 2017}}</ref> No. 7 in both the US and Canada, and No. 3 in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/><ref name=\"Webfitz\"/> Following \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" and \"Clair\", \"Get Down\" was his third million-seller, with the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] gold disc award presented on 18 September 1973.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> His November 1974 single \"Christmas Song\" reached No. 12 in the UK and No. 5 in Ireland.

\"Ooh Baby\" and \"Happiness Is Me and You\" charted, but O'Sullivan's sales were decreasing.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In June 1975 he had his last Top 20 hit, \"I Don't Love You But I Think I Like You\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/><ref name=\"AMG\"/>

Things turned more sour when he discovered his recording contract with MAM Records greatly favoured the label's owner, Gordon Mills.  A lawsuit followed, with prolonged argument over how much money his songs had earned and how much of that money he had actually received.<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\">{{cite book

Although he had won, the court battle put his [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] career on hold.

===Later career===
In 1980, after a five-year hiatus, he returned to his old record label, CBS.

The first single, \"What's in a Kiss?\", reached No. 19 in the UK in 1980 and No. 21 in Japan.<ref name=\"Gilbert\"/> It was his first UK Top 20 hit in five years. Following this release, and due in part to the then-ongoing MAM court case, O'Sullivan released no new material between 1983 and 1986.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Apart from the single \"So What ?\" in 1990 and a [[compilation album]] in 1991 ''Nothing But The Best'', O'Sullivan was absent from the charts until another compilation album, ''The Berry Vest of Gilbert O'Sullivan'', returned him to the UK Top 20 in 2004.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>

O'Sullivan is also noted for his role in bringing about the practice of clearing samples in [[hip hop music]] as a result of the 1991 court case, [[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records, Inc.]],<ref>''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records, Inc.]]'', [[Case citation|780 F. Supp. 182]] ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1991)</ref> in which he sued [[rapping|rapper]] [[Biz Markie]] over the rights to use a [[sampling (music)|sample]] of his song \"Alone Again (Naturally)\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He won 100% of the royalties and made sampling an expensive undertaking.<ref name=\"Grauiad-1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/25/gilbert-o-sullivan-reappraisal|title=Gilbert O'Sullivan: time for a reappraisal?|last=Stanley|first=Bob|date=25 August 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=11 March 2017}}</ref>

On 26 August 2010, O'Sullivan announced that he had joined Hypertension, a record company whose artists have included [[Leo Sayer]], [[Chris DeBurgh]], [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Gerry Rafferty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hypertension-music.de/?page_id=3 |title=Hypertension \" Artists |publisher=Hypertension-music.de |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref>

On 19 July 2011, O'Sullivan played live on the [[BBC Radio 2]] [[Ken Bruce]] Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012hkht |title=BBC Radio 2 – Ken Bruce, 19/07/2011 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref> On 26 August that year, the documentary ''Out on His Own'' was broadcast by BBC 4 (before by Irish RTÉ). In March 2012, the compilation album ''Gilbert O'Sullivan: The Very Best Of – A Singer & His Songs''  entered the UK Albums Chart at No.12. 2015 saw Gilbert re-emerge on Irish and BBC radio and television. He toured Ireland beginning of June, and on 8 June 2015 his Peggy Lee-inspired new album ''Latin ala G!'' was released.

On 24 August 2018, O'Sullivan released his 19th studio album ''Gilbert O’Sullivan''. The album entered the UK album charts at No. 20, his first UK charting studio album for over 40 years.

==Personal life==
O'Sullivan purposely avoided dating at the peak of his career; he feared that doing so would inhibit his songwriting abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gilbertosullivan.net/in_print/rolling_stone_02.htm |title=Gilbert O'Sullivan &#124; In Print |website=Gilbertosullivan.net |date=1973-08-02 |accessdate=2016-10-08}}</ref> In January 1980, O'Sullivan married his [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] girlfriend Aase. Later that year the first of their two daughters, Helen-Marie, was born. Tara was born two years later.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

He currently lives in Jersey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/fame-fortune/gilbert-osullivan-success-was-the-postman-walking-up-the-garden/|title=Gilbert O'Sullivan: 'Success was the postman walking up the garden whistling my song'|first=Caroline|last=Rees|date=14 August 2016|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>
Clair one O’Sullivan’s biggest hits is said to a affectionate song about his then managers daughter who can be heard giggling at the end of the track. Although O’Sullivan, had said that his fear of wet paper towels was his principal motivation in writing the classic. The Claire in the title refers to the brand of paper “Claire Fontaine”.

In 1972 O'Sullivan reached international [[celebrity|stardom]] with \"[[Alone Again (Naturally)]]\", which reached No. 3 in UK; No. 1 in the US, spending six non-consecutive weeks at [[Chart-topper|No. 1]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] and selling nearly two million copies; No. 2 in New Zealand (11 weeks on the charts in total); No. 1 in Canada for 2 weeks (13 weeks in the Top 40);<ref name=\"Webfitz\">[http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1972]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> and No. 1 in Japan (21 weeks on the chart). The guitar solo was played by [[Big Jim Sullivan]].

In total US sales for 1972, O'Sullivan's hit was topped only by [[Roberta Flack]]'s \"[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]\". Both songs were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] categories in 1973, but Flack won both.

O'Sullivan followed \"Alone\" with \"[[Clair (song)|Clair]]\" (1972, from the album ''[[Back to Front (Gilbert O'Sullivan album)|Back to Front]]''). The single reached No. 2 in the United States on the Hot 100 and No. 1 in the UK and Canada (14 weeks in the Canadian Top 40).<ref name=\"Webfitz\"/> O'Sullivan's [[gramophone record|disc]] sales exceeded ten million in 1972 and made him the top star of the year.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> O'Sullivan's success led to him taking part in the [[BBC]]'s anniversary programme ''Fifty Years of Music'' in November 1972.

\"[[Out of the Question (Gilbert O'Sullivan song)|Out of the Question]]\" (also from ''Back to Front'') reached No. 17 in the US and No. 14 in Canada.<ref name=\"Webfitz\"/>  \"[[Get Down (Gilbert O'Sullivan song)|Get Down]]\" (1973), from the album ''I'm A Writer Not A Fighter'', reached No. 1 in the UK and in Germany,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartsurfer.de/artist/gilbert-o-sullivan/get-down-song_vrgg.html|title=Get Down von Gilbert O'Sullivan|first=|last=Chartsurfer.de|website=Chartsurfer.de|accessdate=27 October 2017}}</ref> No. 7 in both the US and Canada, and No. 3 in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/><ref name=\"Webfitz\"/> Following \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" and \"Clair\", \"Get Down\" was his third million-seller, with the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] gold disc award presented on 18 September 1973.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> His November 1974 single \"Christmas Song\" reached No. 12 in the UK and No. 5 in Ireland.

===MAM records===
O'Sullivan enjoyed nearly five years of success with MAM, a run that included seven UK Top 10 singles and four UK Top 10 albums; three US Top 10 singles and one top 10 album; five Dutch Top 10 singles and three Top 10 albums; five New Zealand Top 10 singles; three Canadian Top 10 singles; and seven Japan Top 10 singles.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gilbertosullivan.com |title=The Official Gilbert O'Sullivan Website – A Friend of Mine |publisher=Gilbertosullivan.com |accessdate=22 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050811074659/http://www.gilbertosullivan.com/ |archivedate=11 August 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

\"Ooh Baby\" and \"Happiness Is Me and You\" charted, but O'Sullivan's sales were decreasing.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In June 1975 he had his last Top 20 hit, \"I Don't Love You But I Think I Like You\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/><ref name=\"AMG\"/>

Things turned more sour when he discovered his recording contract with MAM Records greatly favoured the label's owner, Gordon Mills.  A lawsuit followed, with prolonged argument over how much money his songs had earned and how much of that money he had actually received.<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\">{{cite book

Although he had won, the court battle put his [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] career on hold.

===Later career===
In 1980, after a five-year hiatus, he returned to his old record label, CBS.

The first single, \"What's in a Kiss?\", reached No. 19 in the UK in 1980 and No. 21 in Japan.<ref name=\"Gilbert\"/> It was his first UK Top 20 hit in five years. Following this release, and due in part to the then-ongoing MAM court case, O'Sullivan released no new material between 1983 and 1986.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Apart from the single \"So What ?\" in 1990 and a [[compilation album]] in 1991 ''Nothing But The Best'', O'Sullivan was absent from the charts until another compilation album, ''The Berry Vest of Gilbert O'Sullivan'', returned him to the UK Top 20 in 2004.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>

O'Sullivan is also noted for his role in bringing about the practice of clearing samples in [[hip hop music]] as a result of the 1991 court case, [[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records, Inc.]],<ref>''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records, Inc.]]'', [[Case citation|780 F. Supp. 182]] ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1991)</ref> in which he sued [[rapping|rapper]] [[Biz Markie]] over the rights to use a [[sampling (music)|sample]] of his song \"Alone Again (Naturally)\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He won 100% of the royalties and made sampling an expensive undertaking.<ref name=\"Grauiad-1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/25/gilbert-o-sullivan-reappraisal|title=Gilbert O'Sullivan: time for a reappraisal?|last=Stanley|first=Bob|date=25 August 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=11 March 2017}}</ref>

O'Sullivan has continued to record and perform into the 21st century. He enjoys [[Big in Japan (phrase)|particular acclaim in Japan]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> His album ''A Scruff at Heart'' was released in 2007, featuring \"Just So You Know\". On 14 July 2008, O'Sullivan released \"Never Say Di\". He appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2008|2008 Glastonbury Festival]], and played London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 26 October 2009. On 26 August 2010, O'Sullivan announced that he had joined Hypertension, a record company whose artists have included [[Leo Sayer]], [[Chris DeBurgh]], [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Gerry Rafferty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hypertension-music.de/?page_id=3 |title=Hypertension \" Artists |publisher=Hypertension-music.de |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref>

His album ''Gilbertville'' was released on 31 January 2011; it featured \"All They Wanted To Say\", which dealt with the 2001 [[September 11 attacks|attacks on the World Trade Center]], and his single \"Where Would We Be (Without Tea)?\". On 19 July 2011, O'Sullivan played live on the [[BBC Radio 2]] [[Ken Bruce]] Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012hkht |title=BBC Radio 2 – Ken Bruce, 19/07/2011 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref> On 26 August that year, the documentary ''Out on His Own'' was broadcast by BBC 4 (before by Irish RTÉ). In March 2012, the compilation album ''Gilbert O'Sullivan: The Very Best Of – A Singer & His Songs''  entered the UK Albums Chart at No.12. 2015 saw Gilbert re-emerge on Irish and BBC radio and television. He toured Ireland beginning of June, and on 8 June 2015 his Peggy Lee-inspired new album ''Latin ala G!'' was released.

On 24 August 2018, O'Sullivan released his 19th studio album ''Gilbert O’Sullivan''. The album entered the UK album charts at No. 20, his first UK charting studio album for over 40 years.

==Personal life==
O'Sullivan purposely avoided dating at the peak of his career; he feared that doing so would inhibit his songwriting abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gilbertosullivan.net/in_print/rolling_stone_02.htm |title=Gilbert O'Sullivan &#124; In Print |website=Gilbertosullivan.net |date=1973-08-02 |accessdate=2016-10-08}}</ref> In January 1980, O'Sullivan married his [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] girlfriend Aase.

'''''Notiomastodon''''' is an extinct [[proboscidea]]n genus of [[gomphothere]]s (a distant relative to modern [[elephants]]) endemic to [[South America]] from the [[Pleistocene]] to the [[Holocene]].<ref name=\"ShoshaniTassy2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Shoshani|first1=Jeheskel|last2=Tassy|first2=Pascal|title=Advances in proboscidean taxonomy & classification, anatomy & physiology, and ecology & behavior|journal=Quaternary International|volume=126–128|year=2005|pages=5–20|issn=1040-6182|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2004.04.011|bibcode=2005QuInt.126....5S}}</ref> It was among the last known gomphotheres and one of two South American gomphotheres alongside ''[[Cuvieronius]]'' and was the predominant gomphothere on the continent ranging widely over most of South America excluding the [[Andes|High Andes]]. The species has a long and convoluted taxonomic history due to its morphological variability and confusion with related gomphothere taxa, which was only resolved during the 2010's.

== Taxonomy ==
[[File:Gomphothere_Teeth_South_America_Cuvier_1806.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.56|Two gomphothere teeth from Cuvier (1806) with A referring to “''mastodonte des cordillères''” and B referring to “''mastodonte humboldien''”]]
Proboscideans in South America were first described by [[Georges Cuvier]] in 1806,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cuvier|first=Georges|title=Sur différentes dents du genre des mastodontes, mais d'espèces moindres que celle de l'Ohio, trouvées en plusieurs lieux des deux continents|journal=Annales du Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle|volume=7|pages=401–420|year=1806}}</ref> but he failed to give them specific names beyond \"Mastodon\".  [[Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim|Fischer]] in 1814 assigned the “''mastodonte des cordillères''” specimen the first specific name \"''Mastotherium hyodon''\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Gotthelf|author-link=Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim|title=Zoognosia tabulis synopticis illustrata in Usum Praelectionem Academiae Imperialis Medico-Chirurgicae Mosquensis Edita: Vol 3.

Dufour et E. d'Ocagne}}</ref> Due to the [[Principle of Priority]], this meant that ''\"Mastodon andium\"'' was invalid, as \"''Mastotherium hyodon''\" was named first from the same specimen. Today, neither tooth is considered diagnostic to any specific taxon.<ref name=\"Mothé et al 2016 (In Press)\" /> 


''Notiomastodon'',{{refn|group=\"nb\"|From the {{lang-grc|νότιος}} ({{transl|grc|nótios}}, \"southern\")<ref>{{LSJ|no/tios|νότιος|ref}}</ref>}} \"southern mastodon\" was named by Cabrera (1929). It was assigned to the Gomphotheriidae by Carroll (1988).

For centuries, the taxonomy of gomphotheres, including ''Notiomastodon'' had been subject to debate, with many generic and specific names for similar South American gomphotheres.

== Evolution ==
''Notiomastodon'' belongs to the family [[Gomphotheriidae]], a group of animals distantly related to modern elephants and [[mammoth]]s. ''Notiomastodon'' seems to have had a 4-million-year-long [[ghost lineage]], diverging from the clade that contains ''[[Rhynchotherium]]'' and ''[[Cuvieronius]]'' around the Late [[Miocene]]. This would imply that ''Notiomastodon'' had been evolving in southern [[Central America]], where the fossils are poorly sampled, prior to its migration into South America during the [[Pliocene]] or Pleistocene.<ref name=\"Mothé et al 2016 (In Press)\" /> Gomphotheres arrived in South America after the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] as part of the [[Great American Interchange|Great American Biotic Interchange]], alongside many other taxa from North America. The oldest known record of gomphotheres in South America is a fragmentary vertebra from the Earliest Pleistocene (~2.5 Ma) [[Uquia Formation]] of Argentina<ref>Cione, A.L., Gasparini, G.M., Soibelzon, E., Soibelzon, L.H., Tonni, E.P., 2015. The Great American Biotic Interchange in Southern South America: Land Mammal Biostratigraphy, Climatic Evolution and Faunal Integration. Springer Briefs in Earth System Sciences. Springer, New York-London</ref> The oldest known remains definitively attributable to ''Notiomastodon'' are known from the late Early Pleistocene (1.2-0.8 ma) from the Rio de la Plata, also in Argentina, consisting of a pair of tusks and other associated remains.<ref name=\"Mothé et al 2016 (In Press)\" /> A 2019 study using [[collagen]] sequencing found ''Notiomastodon'' closer to ''[[Mastodon|Mammut]]'' than to extant elephants, though how this effects gomphothere phylogeny is unclear.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buckley|first=Michael|last2=Recabarren|first2=Omar P.|last3=Lawless|first3=Craig|last4=García|first4=Nuria|last5=Pino|first5=Mario|date=November 2019|title=A molecular phylogeny of the extinct South American gomphothere through collagen sequence analysis|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|language=en|volume=224|pages=105882|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.105882|bibcode=2019QSRv..22405882B|doi-access=free}}</ref>

'''''Notiomastodon''''' is an extinct [[proboscidea]]n genus of [[gomphothere]]s (a distant relative to modern [[elephants]]) endemic to [[South America]] from the [[Pleistocene]] to the [[Holocene]].<ref name=\"ShoshaniTassy2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Shoshani|first1=Jeheskel|last2=Tassy|first2=Pascal|title=Advances in proboscidean taxonomy & classification, anatomy & physiology, and ecology & behavior|journal=Quaternary International|volume=126–128|year=2005|pages=5–20|issn=1040-6182|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2004.04.011|bibcode=2005QuInt.126....5S}}</ref> It was among the last known gomphotheres and one of two South American gomphotheres alongside ''[[Cuvieronius]]'' and was the predominant gomphothere on the continent ranging widely over most of South America excluding the [[Andes|High Andes]]. The species has a long and convoluted taxonomic history due to its morphological variability and confusion with related gomphothere taxa, which was only resolved during the 2010's.

Dufour et E. d'Ocagne}}</ref> Due to the [[Principle of Priority]], this meant that ''\"Mastodon andium\"'' was invalid, as \"''Mastotherium hyodon''\" was named first from the same specimen.

For centuries, the taxonomy of gomphotheres, including ''Notiomastodon'' had been subject to debate, with many generic and specific names for similar South American gomphotheres.

== Evolution ==
''Notiomastodon'' belongs to the family [[Gomphotheriidae]], a group of animals distantly related to modern elephants and [[mammoth]]s. ''Notiomastodon'' seems to have had a 4-million-year-long [[ghost lineage]], diverging from the clade that contains ''[[Rhynchotherium]]'' and ''[[Cuvieronius]]'' around the Late [[Miocene]]. This would imply that ''Notiomastodon'' had been evolving in southern [[Central America]], where the fossils are poorly sampled, prior to its migration into South America during the [[Pliocene]] or Pleistocene.<ref name=\"Mothé et al 2016 (In Press)\" /> Gomphotheres arrived in South America after the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] as part of the [[Great American Interchange|Great American Biotic Interchange]], alongside many other taxa from North America. The oldest known record of gomphotheres in South America is a fragmentary vertebra from the Earliest Pleistocene (~2.5 Ma) [[Uquia Formation]] of Argentina<ref>Cione, A.L., Gasparini, G.M., Soibelzon, E., Soibelzon, L.H., Tonni, E.P., 2015. The Great American Biotic Interchange in Southern South America: Land Mammal Biostratigraphy, Climatic Evolution and Faunal Integration. Springer Briefs in Earth System Sciences. Springer, New York-London</ref> The oldest known remains definitively attributable to ''Notiomastodon'' are known from the late Early Pleistocene (1.2-0.8 ma) from the Rio de la Plata, also in Argentina, consisting of a pair of tusks and other associated remains.<ref name=\"Mothé et al 2016 (In Press)\" /> A 2019 study using [[collagen]] sequencing found ''Notiomastodon'' closer to ''[[Mastodon|Mammut]]'' than to extant elephants, though how this effects gomphothere phylogeny is unclear.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buckley|first=Michael|last2=Recabarren|first2=Omar P.|last3=Lawless|first3=Craig|last4=García|first4=Nuria|last5=Pino|first5=Mario|date=November 2019|title=A molecular phylogeny of the extinct South American gomphothere through collagen sequence analysis|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|language=en|volume=224|pages=105882|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.105882|bibcode=2019QSRv..22405882B|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Dravet syndrome has been characterized by prolonged [[Febrile seizure|febrile]] and non-febrile [[seizure]]s within the first year of a child’s life.

Dravet syndrome appears during the first year of life, often beginning around six months of age with frequent febrile seizures (fever-related seizures). Children with Dravet syndrome typically experience a lagged development of language and motor skills, hyperactivity and sleep difficulties, chronic infection, growth and balance issues, and difficulty relating to others. The effects of this disorder do not diminish over time, and children diagnosed with Dravet syndrome require fully committed caretakers with tremendous patience and the ability to closely monitor them.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\">Miller, I.O. and Sotero de Menezes.

Febrile seizures are divided into two categories known as simple and complex. A febrile seizure would be categorized as complex if it has occurred within 24 hours of another seizure or if it lasts longer than 15 minutes. A febrile seizure lasting less than 15 minutes would be considered simple. Sometimes modest hyperthermic stressors like physical exertion or a hot bath can provoke seizures in affected individuals.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/> However, any seizure uninterrupted after 5 minutes, without a resumption of [[postictal]] (more normal; recovery-type; after-seizure) consciousness can lead to potentially fatal [[status epilepticus]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Causes==
In most cases the mutations in Dravet syndrome are not hereditary and the mutated gene is found for the first time in a single family member.<ref name=\"Reference3\" /> In 70–90% of patients, Dravet syndrome is caused by [[nonsense mutations]] in the [[SCN1A]] gene resulting in a premature stop codon and thus a non-functional protein.<ref name=\"Reference3\" />  This gene normally codes for neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V)1.1.<ref name=Reference4>{{cite journal|last1=Cheah|first1=C|last2=Catterall|first2=W.A.|title=Characterizing the role of sodium channels in mouse models of Dravet Syndrome|date=2012}}</ref> In mouse models, these loss-of-function mutations have been observed to result in a decrease in sodium currents and impaired excitability of GABAergic [[interneuron]]s of the [[hippocampus]].<ref name=\"Reference4\" /> The researchers found that loss of NA(V)1.1 channels was sufficient to cause the epilepsy and premature death seen in Dravet syndrome.<ref name=\"Reference4\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Couzin-Frankel |first1=Jennifer |title=Sudden death in epilepsy: Researchers finger possible cause |journal=Science |date=8 April 2015 |doi=10.1126/science.aab2456 }}</ref>

The timing of the first signs and symptoms in Dravet syndrome occur about the same time as normal childhood vaccinations, leading some to believe the vaccine was the cause. However, this is likely a non-specific response to fever, as vaccination often induces fever,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin YJ, Wen CN, Lin YY, Hsieh WC, Chang CC, Chen YH, Hsu CH, Shih YJ, Chen CH, Fang CT |title=Oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants for pediatric influenza vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Nat Commun |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=315 |date=January 2020 |pmid=31949137 |pmc=6965081 |doi=10.1038/s41467-019-14230-x |url=}}</ref> and fever is known to be associated with seizures in persons with Dravet syndrome.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dravetfoundation.org/what-is-dravet-syndrome/|title=What is Dravet Syndrome?|last=admin|publisher=}}</ref>  Some of the patients who put forth vaccine injury claims from encephalopathy were later found, upon testing, to actually have Dravet syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ben-Menachem |first1=Elinor |title=Vaccination and the Onset of Dravet Syndrome |journal=Epilepsy Currents |date=4 January 2019 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=120–122 |doi=10.5698/1535-7511-11.4.120 |pmid=21852883 |pmc=3152151 }}</ref>

===Genetics===
The genotypic explanation of the disorder has been located on the specific voltage-gated sodium channel genes known as [[SCN1A]] and [[SCN2A]]. These genes are located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 24.3 and code for the alpha subunit of the transmembrane sodium channel protein. A mutation in either of these two genes will cause an individual to develop dysfunctional sodium channels, which are crucial in the pathway for sending chemical signals in the brain, causing the phenotypic display of myoclonic epilepsy from the individual. A properly functioning channel would respond to a voltage difference across the membrane and form a pore through which only sodium ions can pass. The influx of sodium induces the generation of action potential by temporarily changing the charge of the cell. When the gene is mutated, the eventually translated protein improperly folds its pore segment within the cell membrane because it has different amino acid chemistry, which renders the channel inactive. It is also possible for a mutation to reduce the number of channels produced by an individual, which leads to the development of Dravet syndrome.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1535-7597.2005.05105.x |pmid=16059449 |pmc=1176321 |title=A Plethora of SCN1A Mutations: What Can They Tell Us? |journal=Epilepsy Currents |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=17–20 |year=2005 |last1=Wallace |first1=Robyn }}</ref>

Currently, the SCN1A gene is the most clinically relevant; the largest number of epilepsy related mutations characterized thus far occur in this gene.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugawara T, Tsurubuchi Y, Agarwala KL, Ito M, Fukuma G, Mazaki-Miyazaki E, Nagafuji H, Noda M, Imoto K, Wada K, Mitsudome A, Kaneko S, Montal M, Nagata K, Hirose S, Yamakawa K | year = 2001 | title = A missense mutation of the Na+ channel alpha II subunit gene Na(v)1.2 in a patient with febrile and afebrile seizures causes channel dysfunction | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = 11| pages = 6384–9 | doi=10.1073/pnas.111065098 | pmid=11371648 | pmc=33477}}</ref> Typically, a [[missense mutation]] in either the S5 or S6 segment of the sodium channel pore results in a loss of channel function and the development of Dravet syndrome. A heterozygous inheritance of an SCN1A mutation is all that is necessary to develop a defective sodium channel; patients with Dravet syndrome will still have one normal copy of the gene.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>

==Diagnosis==
According to the Dravet Syndrome Foundation, the diagnostic criteria for DS requires the patient to present with several of the following symptoms:<ref name=Reference5>{{cite web|title=Diagnostic Criteria|url=http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/consider-dravet/diagnostic-criteria|website=Dravet Syndrome Foundation|accessdate=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150317204051/http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/consider-dravet/diagnostic-criteria|archive-date=17 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

* Onset of seizures in the first year of life in an otherwise healthy infant
* Initial seizures are typically prolonged and are generalized or unilateral
* Presence of other seizure types (i.e. myoclonic seizures)
* Seizures associated with fever due to illness or vaccinations
* Seizures induced by prolonged exposure to warm temperatures
* Seizures in response to strong lighting or certain visual patterns
* Initially normal EEGs and later EEGs with slowing and severe generalized polyspikes
* Normal initial development followed by slow development during the first few years of life
* Some degree of hypotonia
* Unstable gait and balance issues
* Ankle pronation and flat feet and/or development of a crouched gait with age

==Treatment==
Seizures in Dravet syndrome can be difficult to manage but may be reduced by anticonvulsant medications such as [[clobazam]], [[stiripentol]], [[topiramate]] and [[valproate]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dravet Syndrome Foundation: Treatment|url=http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/medical-information/treatment|accessdate=1 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228054002/http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/medical-information/treatment|archive-date=28 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because the course of the disorder varies from individual to individual,  treatment protocols may vary. A diet high in fats and low in carbohydrates may also be beneficial, known as a [[ketogenic diet]]. Although diet adjustment can help, it does not eliminate the symptoms. Until a better form of treatment or cure is discovered, those with this disease will have myoclonic epilepsy for the rest of their lives.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/>

Certain anticonvulsant medications that are classed as sodium channel blockers are now known to make seizures worse in most Dravet patients. These medications include carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and phenytoin.<ref>{{cite web|title=NICE: Epilepsies: diagnosis and management|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg137/chapter/1-Guidance#pharmacological-treatment|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SCN1A Patients Advised to Avoid Sodium Channel Blockers|url=http://www.ice-epilepsy.org/scn1a-patients-advised-to-avoid-sodium-channel-blockers.html|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref>

Treatments include cognitive rehabilitation through psychomotor and speech therapy.<ref name=\"Reference2\" /> In addition, valproate is often administered to prevent recurrence of febrile seizures and a [[benzodiazepine]] is used for long lasting seizures, but these treatments are usually insufficient.<ref name=Reference6>{{cite journal|last1=Chiron|first1=C|last2=Dulac|first2=O|title=The pharmacologic treatment of Dravet syndrome|journal=Epilepsia|date=1 April 2011|volume=52|pages=72–75|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03007.x|pmid=21463285}}<!--|accessdate=17 March 2015--></ref> 

Stiripentol was the only medication for which a double-blind [[placebo]]-controlled [[randomized controlled trial]] was performed and this medication showed efficacy in trials.<ref name=\"Reference6\" /> It acts as a GABAergic agent and as a [[GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator|positive allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]].<ref name=\"Reference6\" /> Stiripentol, can improve [[focal refractory epilepsy]], as well as Dravet's syndrome, supplemented with clobazam and valproate was approved in Europe in 2007 as a therapy for Dravet syndrome and has been found to reduce overall seizure rate by 70%.<ref name=\"Reference6\" /> In cases with more drug-resistant seizures, topiramate and the ketogenic diet are used as alternative treatments.<ref name=\"Reference6\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brigo |first1=Francesco |last2=Storti |first2=Monica |last3=Igwe |first3=Stanley C |title=Stiripentol for focal refractory epilepsy |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=10 |pages=CD009887 |date=21 October 2015 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009887.pub3 |pmid=26488459 }}</ref>

Sometimes modest hyperthermic stressors like physical exertion or a hot bath can provoke seizures in affected individuals.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/> However, any seizure uninterrupted after 5 minutes, without a resumption of [[postictal]] (more normal; recovery-type; after-seizure) consciousness can lead to potentially fatal [[status epilepticus]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Causes==
In most cases the mutations in Dravet syndrome are not hereditary and the mutated gene is found for the first time in a single family member.<ref name=\"Reference3\" /> In 70–90% of patients, Dravet syndrome is caused by [[nonsense mutations]] in the [[SCN1A]] gene resulting in a premature stop codon and thus a non-functional protein.<ref name=\"Reference3\" />  This gene normally codes for neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V)1.1.<ref name=Reference4>{{cite journal|last1=Cheah|first1=C|last2=Catterall|first2=W.A.|title=Characterizing the role of sodium channels in mouse models of Dravet Syndrome|date=2012}}</ref> In mouse models, these loss-of-function mutations have been observed to result in a decrease in sodium currents and impaired excitability of GABAergic [[interneuron]]s of the [[hippocampus]].<ref name=\"Reference4\" /> The researchers found that loss of NA(V)1.1 channels was sufficient to cause the epilepsy and premature death seen in Dravet syndrome.<ref name=\"Reference4\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Couzin-Frankel |first1=Jennifer |title=Sudden death in epilepsy: Researchers finger possible cause |journal=Science |date=8 April 2015 |doi=10.1126/science.aab2456 }}</ref>

The timing of the first signs and symptoms in Dravet syndrome occur about the same time as normal childhood vaccinations, leading some to believe the vaccine was the cause. However, this is likely a non-specific response to fever, as vaccination often induces fever,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin YJ, Wen CN, Lin YY, Hsieh WC, Chang CC, Chen YH, Hsu CH, Shih YJ, Chen CH, Fang CT |title=Oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants for pediatric influenza vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Nat Commun |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=315 |date=January 2020 |pmid=31949137 |pmc=6965081 |doi=10.1038/s41467-019-14230-x |url=}}</ref> and fever is known to be associated with seizures in persons with Dravet syndrome.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dravetfoundation.org/what-is-dravet-syndrome/|title=What is Dravet Syndrome?|last=admin|publisher=}}</ref>  Some of the patients who put forth vaccine injury claims from encephalopathy were later found, upon testing, to actually have Dravet syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ben-Menachem |first1=Elinor |title=Vaccination and the Onset of Dravet Syndrome |journal=Epilepsy Currents |date=4 January 2019 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=120–122 |doi=10.5698/1535-7511-11.4.120 |pmid=21852883 |pmc=3152151 }}</ref>

===Genetics===
The genotypic explanation of the disorder has been located on the specific voltage-gated sodium channel genes known as [[SCN1A]] and [[SCN2A]]. These genes are located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 24.3 and code for the alpha subunit of the transmembrane sodium channel protein. A mutation in either of these two genes will cause an individual to develop dysfunctional sodium channels, which are crucial in the pathway for sending chemical signals in the brain, causing the phenotypic display of myoclonic epilepsy from the individual. A properly functioning channel would respond to a voltage difference across the membrane and form a pore through which only sodium ions can pass. The influx of sodium induces the generation of action potential by temporarily changing the charge of the cell. When the gene is mutated, the eventually translated protein improperly folds its pore segment within the cell membrane because it has different amino acid chemistry, which renders the channel inactive. It is also possible for a mutation to reduce the number of channels produced by an individual, which leads to the development of Dravet syndrome.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1535-7597.2005.05105.x |pmid=16059449 |pmc=1176321 |title=A Plethora of SCN1A Mutations: What Can They Tell Us? |journal=Epilepsy Currents |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=17–20 |year=2005 |last1=Wallace |first1=Robyn }}</ref>

Currently, the SCN1A gene is the most clinically relevant; the largest number of epilepsy related mutations characterized thus far occur in this gene.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugawara T, Tsurubuchi Y, Agarwala KL, Ito M, Fukuma G, Mazaki-Miyazaki E, Nagafuji H, Noda M, Imoto K, Wada K, Mitsudome A, Kaneko S, Montal M, Nagata K, Hirose S, Yamakawa K | year = 2001 | title = A missense mutation of the Na+ channel alpha II subunit gene Na(v)1.2 in a patient with febrile and afebrile seizures causes channel dysfunction | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = 11| pages = 6384–9 | doi=10.1073/pnas.111065098 | pmid=11371648 | pmc=33477}}</ref> Typically, a [[missense mutation]] in either the S5 or S6 segment of the sodium channel pore results in a loss of channel function and the development of Dravet syndrome. A heterozygous inheritance of an SCN1A mutation is all that is necessary to develop a defective sodium channel; patients with Dravet syndrome will still have one normal copy of the gene.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>

==Diagnosis==
According to the Dravet Syndrome Foundation, the diagnostic criteria for DS requires the patient to present with several of the following symptoms:<ref name=Reference5>{{cite web|title=Diagnostic Criteria|url=http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/consider-dravet/diagnostic-criteria|website=Dravet Syndrome Foundation|accessdate=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150317204051/http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/consider-dravet/diagnostic-criteria|archive-date=17 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

* Onset of seizures in the first year of life in an otherwise healthy infant
* Initial seizures are typically prolonged and are generalized or unilateral
* Presence of other seizure types (i.e. myoclonic seizures)
* Seizures associated with fever due to illness or vaccinations
* Seizures induced by prolonged exposure to warm temperatures
* Seizures in response to strong lighting or certain visual patterns
* Initially normal EEGs and later EEGs with slowing and severe generalized polyspikes
* Normal initial development followed by slow development during the first few years of life
* Some degree of hypotonia
* Unstable gait and balance issues
* Ankle pronation and flat feet and/or development of a crouched gait with age

==Treatment==
Seizures in Dravet syndrome can be difficult to manage but may be reduced by anticonvulsant medications such as [[clobazam]], [[stiripentol]], [[topiramate]] and [[valproate]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dravet Syndrome Foundation: Treatment|url=http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/medical-information/treatment|accessdate=1 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228054002/http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/medical-information/treatment|archive-date=28 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because the course of the disorder varies from individual to individual,  treatment protocols may vary. A diet high in fats and low in carbohydrates may also be beneficial, known as a [[ketogenic diet]]. Although diet adjustment can help, it does not eliminate the symptoms. Until a better form of treatment or cure is discovered, those with this disease will have myoclonic epilepsy for the rest of their lives.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/>

Certain anticonvulsant medications that are classed as sodium channel blockers are now known to make seizures worse in most Dravet patients. These medications include carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and phenytoin.<ref>{{cite web|title=NICE: Epilepsies: diagnosis and management|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg137/chapter/1-Guidance#pharmacological-treatment|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SCN1A Patients Advised to Avoid Sodium Channel Blockers|url=http://www.ice-epilepsy.org/scn1a-patients-advised-to-avoid-sodium-channel-blockers.html|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref>

Treatments include cognitive rehabilitation through psychomotor and speech therapy.<ref name=\"Reference2\" /> In addition, valproate is often administered to prevent recurrence of febrile seizures and a [[benzodiazepine]] is used for long lasting seizures, but these treatments are usually insufficient.<ref name=Reference6>{{cite journal|last1=Chiron|first1=C|last2=Dulac|first2=O|title=The pharmacologic treatment of Dravet syndrome|journal=Epilepsia|date=1 April 2011|volume=52|pages=72–75|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03007.x|pmid=21463285}}<!--|accessdate=17 March 2015--></ref>

==Plot==
World-famous Italian [[tenor]] opera singer, Giorgio Fini, is in [[Boston]] for a concert when he gets a phone call asking him to perform at [[Metropolitan Opera|The Met]]. The call brings up bad memories from his disastrous appearance there seven years earlier. It scares him to the point where he cannot sing at rehearsal. Everyone panics thinking he is losing his voice.

His business manager, Henry Pollack, has a throat specialist Pamela Taylor, look at Giorgio. He at first refuses her, believing her not to be a doctor, but \"a nurse\" because she is a woman. After being scared into seeing her by his manager, she immediately detects that the problem is psychological, not physical. Pamela makes up a serious-sounding name for the condition and gives Giorgio a shot to cure it, which she reveals to Henry is harmless vitamin B12. After reacting to the prick of the needle, Giorgio instantly gets his voice back and proceeds to sing the following day at the [[Hatch Shell]] in Boston.

Giorgio is immediately physically attracted to Pamela, and even though he is married with two children, she agrees to go out on a dinner date. The date does not go well, but Giorgio is persistent, visiting the hospital where Pamela works. His quick thinking helps calm a scared child getting ready for surgery to remove his tonsils, promising ice cream which he delivers after the surgery.  Impressed by his handling of the children, she agrees to another date. She eventually becomes his traveling companion. After spending a romantic week in [[San Francisco]] and the wine country visiting friends of Giorgio, the two eventually fall in love, even though at the start of their relationship he told her this was just \"a fling\" and made her promise not to fall in love with him.  He gains the confidence through his love for her to agree to perform at the Met in the [[Giacomo Puccini]] opera ''[[Turandot]]''. However, because Giorgio refuses to leave his wife, Pamela throws him a kiss and leaves the Met while Giorgio is singing \"[[Nessun Dorma]]\" to her.

==Production==
In June 1980 MGM announced they had signed a deal with Pavarotti to star in the movie. \"I have done a lot of television and think I have the experience to do a movie,\" said the singer. \"I will put myself in the hands of those making this but hopefully my sense of humor will come through.<ref name=\"los\">LIGHTS, CAMERA... PAVAROTTI: MGM signs tenor for motion picture debut in romantic comedy 'Yes, Giorgio'
Lee, Grant. Los Angeles Times 5 June 1980: h1.</ref>

Pavarotti said he did the film \"Because they asked me\" and \"it has been almost 30 years since the days when Mario Lanza made a movie, and I thought it was time for the world of opera to come out in a movie. I think it will be good for the opera and probably good for me.\"<ref>At the Movies; PAVAROTTI PREPARES FOR A DEBUT
Klemesrud, Judy. New York Times,14 Aug 1981: C.6.</ref>

The singer said [[Mario Lanza]] was an \"inspiration for me. He did a lot for the world of opera, and I believe he had one of the greatest, most exciting voices I have ever heard. Of course I never saw him on a stage; perhaps he would have been unable to sing opera. But I do know that his voice was definitely exciting.\"<ref name=\"debut\">PAVAROTTI IS RELISHING HIS MOVIE DEBUT Boston Globe 22 Aug 1981: 1.</ref>

Producer Peter Fetterman said originally he had wanted to remake ''[[The Great Caruso]]'' \"But that wasn't very realistic. No one in Hollywood was going to invest a lot of money in a period piece. I just knew that someone had to make a movie with Pavarotti. He's got so much charisma. A talent like his appears only once in every generation. The story is a musical romance like those wonderful MGM films with Mario Lanza.\"<ref name=\"boston\"/>

\"The film's budget will be substantial\" said executive producer Herbert Breslin. \"We're not going to skimp on it. We'll spend whatever it takes to make a movie right for Mr Pavarotti.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>

It was decided for Pavarotti to perform a free concert in Boston that would be used for the movie. He performed it on June 26. The unit arrived in Boston on June 22 and shot there for ten days. A crowd of over 110,000 saw the free concert.<ref>SAFETY FEARS MAR PAVAROTTI CONCERT PLANS: [FIFTH Edition]

Parotti performed 10 songs and sang three encores during the concert that ended shortly before 6 p.m. and included a 15-minute intermission. \"His performance was faultless,\" said Fetterman. \"It's going to be the highlight of the movie.\"<ref>SUNSHINE, CAMERAS AND PAVAROTTI: Boston Globe 28 June 1981: 1</ref>

While filming on the MGM backlot Shaffner said Pavarotti \"needs direction, because he is not a professional actor. He needs to be told when to pull back. But he responds very well.\"

Pavarotti said \"I am enjoying the movie... Are there any surprises? No surprises. Except being awakened at 5 a.m. For a man who usually gets out of bed at 10 or 12, that is a surprise... Will I do another film? I'll tell you after I see this one.\" <ref name=\"debut\"/>

==Plot==
World-famous Italian [[tenor]] opera singer, Giorgio Fini, is in [[Boston]] for a concert when he gets a phone call asking him to perform at [[Metropolitan Opera|The Met]]. The call brings up bad memories from his disastrous appearance there seven years earlier. It scares him to the point where he cannot sing at rehearsal. Everyone panics thinking he is losing his voice.

His business manager, Henry Pollack, has a throat specialist Pamela Taylor, look at Giorgio. He at first refuses her, believing her not to be a doctor, but \"a nurse\" because she is a woman. After being scared into seeing her by his manager, she immediately detects that the problem is psychological, not physical. Pamela makes up a serious-sounding name for the condition and gives Giorgio a shot to cure it, which she reveals to Henry is harmless vitamin B12. After reacting to the prick of the needle, Giorgio instantly gets his voice back and proceeds to sing the following day at the [[Hatch Shell]] in Boston.

Giorgio is immediately physically attracted to Pamela, and even though he is married with two children, she agrees to go out on a dinner date. The date does not go well, but Giorgio is persistent, visiting the hospital where Pamela works. His quick thinking helps calm a scared child getting ready for surgery to remove his tonsils, promising ice cream which he delivers after the surgery.  Impressed by his handling of the children, she agrees to another date. She eventually becomes his traveling companion. After spending a romantic week in [[San Francisco]] and the wine country visiting friends of Giorgio, the two eventually fall in love, even though at the start of their relationship he told her this was just \"a fling\" and made her promise not to fall in love with him.  He gains the confidence through his love for her to agree to perform at the Met in the [[Giacomo Puccini]] opera ''[[Turandot]]''. However, because Giorgio refuses to leave his wife, Pamela throws him a kiss and leaves the Met while Giorgio is singing \"[[Nessun Dorma]]\" to her.

==Production==
In June 1980 MGM announced they had signed a deal with Pavarotti to star in the movie. \"I have done a lot of television and think I have the experience to do a movie,\" said the singer. \"I will put myself in the hands of those making this but hopefully my sense of humor will come through.<ref name=\"los\">LIGHTS, CAMERA...

Lee, Grant. Los Angeles Times 5 June 1980: h1. </ref>

Pavarotti said he did the film \"Because they asked me\" and \"it has been almost 30 years since the days when Mario Lanza made a movie, and I thought it was time for the world of opera to come out in a movie. I think it will be good for the opera and probably good for me.\"<ref>At the Movies; PAVAROTTI PREPARES FOR A DEBUT

The singer said [[Mario Lanza]] was an \"inspiration for me. He did a lot for the world of opera, and I believe he had one of the greatest, most exciting voices I have ever heard. Of course I never saw him on a stage; perhaps he would have been unable to sing opera. But I do know that his voice was definitely exciting.\"<ref name=\"debut\">PAVAROTTI IS RELISHING HIS MOVIE DEBUT Boston Globe 22 Aug 1981: 1. </ref>

Producer Peter Fetterman said originally he had wanted to remake ''[[The Great Caruso]]'' \"But that wasn't very realistic. No one in Hollywood was going to invest a lot of money in a period piece. I just knew that someone had to make a movie with Pavarotti. He's got so much charisma. A talent like his appears only once in every generation. The story is a musical romance like those wonderful MGM films with Mario Lanza.\"<ref name=\"boston\"/>

\"The film's budget will be substantial\" said executive producer Herbert Breslin. \"We're not going to skimp on it. We'll spend whatever it takes to make a movie right for Mr Pavarotti.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>

It was decided for Pavarotti to perform a free concert in Boston that would be used for the movie. He performed it on June 26. The unit arrived in Boston on June 22 and shot there for ten days. A crowd of over 110,000 saw the free concert.<ref>SAFETY FEARS MAR PAVAROTTI CONCERT PLANS: [FIFTH Edition]

Parotti performed 10 songs and sang three encores during the concert that ended shortly before 6 p.m. and included a 15-minute intermission. \"His performance was faultless,\" said Fetterman. \"It's going to be the highlight of the movie.\"<ref>SUNSHINE, CAMERAS AND PAVAROTTI: Boston Globe 28 June 1981: 1</ref>

While filming on the MGM backlot Shaffner said Pavarotti \"needs direction, because he is not a professional actor. He needs to be told when to pull back. But he responds very well.\"

Pavarotti said \"I am enjoying the movie... Are there any surprises? No surprises. Except being awakened at 5 a.m. For a man who usually gets out of bed at 10 or 12, that is a surprise... Will I do another film? I'll tell you after I see this one.\" <ref name=\"debut\"/>

'''Laura San Giacomo''' (born November 14, 1962)<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-no96-58680 Worldcat]. Some news items report November 14, 1961.</ref> is an American actress. She is known for playing Cynthia in the film ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989), Kit De Luca in the film ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990), Nadine Cross in ''[[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|The Stand]]'' (1994), and Maya Gallo on the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' (1997–2003). A [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] and two-time [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nominee, she also played the regular role of Rhetta Rodriguez on the [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] drama ''[[Saving Grace (TV series)|Saving Grace]]'' (2007–2010), and the recurring role of Dr. [[Grace Confalone]] on the [[CBS]] drama ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' (2016–19).

San Giacomo discovered acting while attending [[Morris Knolls High School]]. In 1984, she received a fine arts degree, specializing in acting, from [[Carnegie Mellon School of Drama]] in [[Pittsburgh]].

==Career==
After graduating, she moved to New York. San Giacomo then went on to appear in several theater productions, including the [[Garry Marshall]]-[[Lowell Ganz]] production of ''Wrong Turn at Lungfish'' in Los Angeles, the Princeton/McCarter Theatre production of ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'', and off-Broadway in ''Beirut''. She also starred in ''[[Italian American Reconciliation]]'', regional productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', as well as ''[[Crimes of the Heart]]''. In a review of the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] 1986 presentation of ''As You Like It'', San Giacomo received a special mention: \"although doll-like Laura San Giacomo had only a minor role as a wilful shepherdess, she sank her fangs into it and received the only show-interrupting applause of the evening.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-03-13/entertainment/26084264_1_lighting-true-love-maureen-garrett | title=As You Like It: Try It | first=Stuart D.|last=Bykofsky | work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] | publisher=[[Philadelphia News Network]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date=March 13, 1986 }}</ref>

===Early career===
San Giacomo's first television appearances were four episodes on three television series during 1987.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb name|0000624}}</ref>  Two notable appearances were in ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'' in 1988 for the episode \"Protected Witness\" (Season 2 / Episode 13) as Theresa Farantino, and in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' in 1989 for the episode, \"Leap of Faith\" (Season 5, Episode 19) as Tania Lewis. The ''Miami Vice'' episode also featured a guest appearance by her future husband, actor [[Cameron Dye]], one year before their marriage. Prior to that, she was featured on the daytime soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'' as Louisa Sanchez, the Latina common-law wife of Mitch Beck (Brian Fitzpatrick) whose presence threatened to thwart his relationship with Hillary Martin ([[Carmen Thomas]]).

However, San Giacomo first drew international attention in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989), which also marked her film debut as a credited actor (in the 1988 movie ''[[Miles from Home]]'', her role as \"Sandy\" was not credited).<ref name=\"imdb\" /> Her work in the film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and she received a [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] ''New Generation Award''. The film was honored with the [[Cannes Film Festival]]'s prestigious Grand Prize, the [[Palme d'Or]].

In 1990, San Giacomo played a supporting role as [[Julia Roberts]]'s character's wisecracking friend Kit De Luca in ''[[Pretty Woman]]''. The [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film ended up generating $178 million at the [[box office]].<ref>{{Mojo title|id=prettywoman|title=Pretty Woman}}</ref>

San Giacomo has appeared in such films as ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' (1990), ''Vital Signs'' (1990), ''[[Under Suspicion (1991 film)|Under Suspicion]]'' (1991), ''[[Once Around]]'' (1991), ''[[Where the Day Takes You]]'' (1992), ''Nina Takes a Lover'' (1994), and ''[[Suicide Kings]]'' (1997). She also appeared as [[List of The Stand characters#Nadine Cross|Nadine Cross]] in the [[Stephen King]] [[TV miniseries]] ''[[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|The Stand]]'' opposite [[Rob Lowe]], which landed them on the cover of the May 7–13, 1994, issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''. She continued doing films, and as 1999 ended, she did the film ''[[Eat Your Heart Out (film)|Eat Your Heart Out]]''. In 2001, San Giacomo landed the starring role in the [[Jenifer Estess]] [[bio-pic]] ''Jenifer'', which aired on [[CBS]] in October of that year.

San Giacomo did voice work for the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' (as the character of [[Fox (animated character)|Fox]]). However, she went uncredited for the role because her agent believed it would damage her reputation to have worked on an animated series.

===''Just Shoot Me!''===
{{Main|Just Shoot Me!}}
Needing to work, but not wanting to be away from her newborn son for months at a time, San Giacomo shifted to television in the role of hot-tempered, sassy journalist [[Maya Gallo]] in the [[situation comedy]] ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' (1997–2003).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |title=Laura San Giacomo interview by Chet Cooper |publisher=abilitymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916045406/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |archivedate=2011-09-16 }}</ref> Her character was partially based on an unproduced idea that executive producer [[Steven Levitan]] once had in mind for actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] when he was a writer for ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. San Giacomo was originally cast in the starring role, since the series was meant to center on her character; however, the show soon adopted an ensemble style. Despite the shift in focus, San Giacomo remained an integral part of the show and with top billing. She and the four other main cast members appeared in all 148 episodes of the series, which lasted until 2003.

San Giacomo's work during Season 2 (1997–1998) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination in 1998 for [[List of Golden Globe Awards: Television, Best Actress, Comedy/Musical|Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical]]; the award went to ''[[Ally McBeal|Ally McBeal's]]'' [[Calista Flockhart]].

===Post-''Just Shoot Me!'' and appearances===
After NBC cancelled ''Just Shoot Me!'' in 2003, San Giacomo appeared sporadically on television and in films. She made guest appearances on several television series, including the short-lived [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[The Handler (TV series)|The Handler]]'' in 2003 and [[HBO]]'s ''[[Unscripted]]'' in 2005. She was the narrator for the [[true crime]] series ''Snapped: Killer Couples'' on [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. San Giacomo also appeared in the 2005 films ''[[Checking Out (2005 film)|Checking Out]]'' and ''[[Havoc (2005 film)|Havoc]]'', as well as the 2006 film ''Conquistadora''. San Giacomo was to have made her return to television on [[The WB Television Network|The WB's]] new drama ''[[Related]]'' in 2005, but the character was recast due to creative differences. [[Kiele Sanchez]] took her place as \"Anne Sorelli\" on the show. San Giacomo also made few public appearances; she made her first public appearance in nearly a year on 19 October 2005 at the ''15th Annual Environmental Media Awards''.  She made two more public appearances at the ''Crystal and Lucy Awards'' on 6 June 2006 and at the ''3rd Annual [[Alfred E. Mann|Alfred Mann]] Foundation Innovation and Inspiration Gala'' on 9 September 2006.

In 2006, San Giacomo returned to network television with three guest appearances on the third season of ''[[Veronica Mars]]''. She reunited with her former [[love interest]] from ''Just Shoot Me!'', [[Enrico Colantoni]], playing Harmony Chase. Both Colantoni and San Giacomo enjoyed their reunion so much that they lobbied for their characters to appear together in further episodes.<ref>[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars,0,2855432.story Former 'Just Shoot Me' Stars Enjoy Life on 'Mars' – Laura San Giacomo and Enrico Colantoni reunite on CW drama – Zap2it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926125445/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars%2C0%2C2855432.story |date=2012-09-26 }}</ref>

In September 2006, San Giacomo secured her first starring role on a television program after ''Just Shoot Me!'', when she reunited with a former peer and co-starred opposite fellow Carnegie-Mellon alum [[Holly Hunter]] in [[Turner Network Television|TNT's]] [[drama]] series ''[[Saving Grace (TV Series)|Saving Grace]]''. San Giacomo played Grace's best friend Rhetta Rodriguez.

In June 2010, San Giacomo guest starred in the episode titled \"Death Becomes Her\" on the [[USA Network|USA network's]] ''[[In Plain Sight]]''. She played a woman from an organized crime family with a terminal illness. In December 2011, San Giacomo appeared on the episode titled \"Beards\" on ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', as Caroline, Melanie's estranged sister.

== Personal life ==
San Giacomo has been married twice, first to actor [[Cameron Dye]] (1990–1998), with whom she had a son, Mason Dye (b. November 19, 1995), who has [[cerebral palsy]], and second to actor [[Matt Adler]] (m. 2000).
San Giacomo is a cousin of [[Torry Castellano]], former drummer of the rock group [[The Donnas]].

She lives in the [[San Fernando Valley]], [[California]]. Her hobbies include horseback riding, gymnastics, ice skating, ballet, tennis, golf and playing piano.

San Giacomo is a strong supporter of charitable causes, most prominently those related to [[disabilities]]. She has appeared at the [[Environmental Media Awards]], the \"Voices For Change\" gala benefit and concert which benefits Children with Disabilities, and the \"Friends Finding a Cure\" gala benefiting Project [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. She is also a founder of the CHIME Charter Elementary School, an [[elementary school]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], California. Chime is an inclusion school for all children of all abilities. The school opened its doors in 2001. As a charter school, CHIME provides free [[public education]] to students and admits them through a lottery system. The school serves approximately 200 children in [[kindergarten]] through fifth grade who live in communities around California's [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/news/newsletters/innovator/2005/0509.html Archived: The Education Innovator-9 May 2005]</ref> Today CHIME services grade kindergarten through eighth grade and has almost 700 students.

The ''Miami Vice'' episode also featured a guest appearance by her future husband, actor [[Cameron Dye]], one year before their marriage. Prior to that, she was featured on the daytime soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'' as Louisa Sanchez, the Latina common-law wife of Mitch Beck (Brian Fitzpatrick) whose presence threatened to thwart his relationship with Hillary Martin ([[Carmen Thomas]]).

However, San Giacomo first drew international attention in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989), which also marked her film debut as a credited actor (in the 1988 movie ''[[Miles from Home]]'', her role as \"Sandy\" was not credited).<ref name=\"imdb\" /> Her work in the film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and she received a [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] ''New Generation Award''. The film was honored with the [[Cannes Film Festival]]'s prestigious Grand Prize, the [[Palme d'Or]].

In 1990, San Giacomo played a supporting role as [[Julia Roberts]]'s character's wisecracking friend Kit De Luca in ''[[Pretty Woman]]''. The [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film ended up generating $178 million at the [[box office]].<ref>{{Mojo title|id=prettywoman|title=Pretty Woman}}</ref>

San Giacomo has appeared in such films as ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' (1990), ''Vital Signs'' (1990), ''[[Under Suspicion (1991 film)|Under Suspicion]]'' (1991), ''[[Once Around]]'' (1991), ''[[Where the Day Takes You]]'' (1992), ''Nina Takes a Lover'' (1994), and ''[[Suicide Kings]]'' (1997). She also appeared as [[List of The Stand characters#Nadine Cross|Nadine Cross]] in the [[Stephen King]] [[TV miniseries]] ''[[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|The Stand]]'' opposite [[Rob Lowe]], which landed them on the cover of the May 7–13, 1994, issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''. She continued doing films, and as 1999 ended, she did the film ''[[Eat Your Heart Out (film)|Eat Your Heart Out]]''. In 2001, San Giacomo landed the starring role in the [[Jenifer Estess]] [[bio-pic]] ''Jenifer'', which aired on [[CBS]] in October of that year.

San Giacomo did voice work for the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' (as the character of [[Fox (animated character)|Fox]]). However, she went uncredited for the role because her agent believed it would damage her reputation to have worked on an animated series.

===''Just Shoot Me!''===
{{Main|Just Shoot Me!}}
Needing to work, but not wanting to be away from her newborn son for months at a time, San Giacomo shifted to television in the role of hot-tempered, sassy journalist [[Maya Gallo]] in the [[situation comedy]] ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' (1997–2003).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |title=Laura San Giacomo interview by Chet Cooper |publisher=abilitymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916045406/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |archivedate=2011-09-16 }}</ref> Her character was partially based on an unproduced idea that executive producer [[Steven Levitan]] once had in mind for actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] when he was a writer for ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. San Giacomo was originally cast in the starring role, since the series was meant to center on her character; however, the show soon adopted an ensemble style. Despite the shift in focus, San Giacomo remained an integral part of the show and with top billing. She and the four other main cast members appeared in all 148 episodes of the series, which lasted until 2003.

San Giacomo's work during Season 2 (1997–1998) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination in 1998 for [[List of Golden Globe Awards: Television, Best Actress, Comedy/Musical|Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical]]; the award went to ''[[Ally McBeal|Ally McBeal's]]'' [[Calista Flockhart]].

===Post-''Just Shoot Me!'' and appearances===
After NBC cancelled ''Just Shoot Me!'' in 2003, San Giacomo appeared sporadically on television and in films. She made guest appearances on several television series, including the short-lived [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[The Handler (TV series)|The Handler]]'' in 2003 and [[HBO]]'s ''[[Unscripted]]'' in 2005. She was the narrator for the [[true crime]] series ''Snapped: Killer Couples'' on [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. San Giacomo also appeared in the 2005 films ''[[Checking Out (2005 film)|Checking Out]]'' and ''[[Havoc (2005 film)|Havoc]]'', as well as the 2006 film ''Conquistadora''. San Giacomo was to have made her return to television on [[The WB Television Network|The WB's]] new drama ''[[Related]]'' in 2005, but the character was recast due to creative differences. [[Kiele Sanchez]] took her place as \"Anne Sorelli\" on the show. San Giacomo also made few public appearances; she made her first public appearance in nearly a year on 19 October 2005 at the ''15th Annual Environmental Media Awards''.  She made two more public appearances at the ''Crystal and Lucy Awards'' on 6 June 2006 and at the ''3rd Annual [[Alfred E. Mann|Alfred Mann]] Foundation Innovation and Inspiration Gala'' on 9 September 2006.

In 2006, San Giacomo returned to network television with three guest appearances on the third season of ''[[Veronica Mars]]''. She reunited with her former [[love interest]] from ''Just Shoot Me!'', [[Enrico Colantoni]], playing Harmony Chase. Both Colantoni and San Giacomo enjoyed their reunion so much that they lobbied for their characters to appear together in further episodes.<ref>[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars,0,2855432.story Former 'Just Shoot Me' Stars Enjoy Life on 'Mars' – Laura San Giacomo and Enrico Colantoni reunite on CW drama – Zap2it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926125445/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars%2C0%2C2855432.story |date=2012-09-26 }}</ref>

In September 2006, San Giacomo secured her first starring role on a television program after ''Just Shoot Me!'', when she reunited with a former peer and co-starred opposite fellow Carnegie-Mellon alum [[Holly Hunter]] in [[Turner Network Television|TNT's]] [[drama]] series ''[[Saving Grace (TV Series)|Saving Grace]]''. San Giacomo played Grace's best friend Rhetta Rodriguez.

In June 2010, San Giacomo guest starred in the episode titled \"Death Becomes Her\" on the [[USA Network|USA network's]] ''[[In Plain Sight]]''. She played a woman from an organized crime family with a terminal illness. In December 2011, San Giacomo appeared on the episode titled \"Beards\" on ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', as Caroline, Melanie's estranged sister.

== Personal life ==
San Giacomo has been married twice, first to actor [[Cameron Dye]] (1990–1998), with whom she had a son, Mason Dye (b. November 19, 1995), who has [[cerebral palsy]], and second to actor [[Matt Adler]] (m. 2000).
San Giacomo is a cousin of [[Torry Castellano]], former drummer of the rock group [[The Donnas]].

She lives in the [[San Fernando Valley]], [[California]]. Her hobbies include horseback riding, gymnastics, ice skating, ballet, tennis, golf and playing piano.

San Giacomo is a strong supporter of charitable causes, most prominently those related to [[disabilities]]. She has appeared at the [[Environmental Media Awards]], the \"Voices For Change\" gala benefit and concert which benefits Children with Disabilities, and the \"Friends Finding a Cure\" gala benefiting Project [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. She is also a founder of the CHIME Charter Elementary School, an [[elementary school]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], California. Chime is an inclusion school for all children of all abilities. The school opened its doors in 2001. As a charter school, CHIME provides free [[public education]] to students and admits them through a lottery system. The school serves approximately 200 children in [[kindergarten]] through fifth grade who live in communities around California's [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/news/newsletters/innovator/2005/0509.html Archived: The Education Innovator-9 May 2005]</ref> Today CHIME services grade kindergarten through eighth grade and has almost 700 students.

'''''The Man Who Could Cheat Death''''' is a 1959 British [[horror film|horror]] film, directed by [[Terence Fisher]] and starring [[Anton Diffring]], [[Hazel Court]] and [[Christopher Lee]]. [[Jimmy Sangster]] adapted the screenplay from the play ''[[The Man in Half Moon Street (play)|The Man in Half Moon Street]]'' by [[Barré Lyndon]], which had been [[The Man in Half Moon Street|previously filmed in 1945]]. ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was produced by [[Michael Carreras]] and [[Anthony Nelson Keys]] for [[Hammer Film Productions]]. It was released in the US on 19 August 1959 and in the UK on 30 November 1959.

== Plot ==

Paris, 1890. Dr Georges Bonnet (Diffring), MD and sculptor, harbours an unusual secret. Although he appears to be in his mid-30s, he is actually 104-years-old, and has kept his youth and vitality through [[Parathyroid gland|parathyroid]] gland transplants every 10 years. But things are going wrong. Prof Ludwig Weiss ([[Arnold Marlé]]) of Vienna, co-discoverer of the anti-ageing process, is three weeks late in arriving at Georges' home to perform the latest transplant. As such, Georges must drink a steaming green liquid to stay young. When Georges' latest model, Margo Philippe ([[Delphi Lawrence]]), comes across Georges swilling the fluid, he strikes her down. 

Georges has invited a number of people to a reception at which he will unveil his bust of Margo, including Janine Dubois (Court), his former lover, and Dr Pierre Girard (Lee), Janine's current companion. When the 89-year-old Ludwig later arrives, it is quite apparent he will be unable to operate on Georges because a stroke has incapacitated his right hand. Ludwig tells Georges they must find another surgeon.

Georges and Ludwig invite Janine and Pierre to dinner. In private, Ludwig convinces Pierre to perform the transplant. However, Janine is still in love with Georges, and when he mysteriously says he must soon leave Paris so he can 'lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond', Janine asks to accompany him. As the dinner party ends, [[National Police (France)|Surété]] Inspector LeGris ([[Francis de Wolff|Francis De Wolff]]) arrives. He is investigating Margo's disappearance. Georges denies knowing her whereabouts and, when LeGris asks to see the bust of Margo, he tells him that he accidentally destroyed it. LeGris leaves and Georges admits to his startled guests that he lied but says the police would probably damage the bust if he turned it over to them.

After Janine and Pierre have left, Ludwig tells Georges that Pierre will operate. But Ludwig has grown suspicious of Georges and says it is strange that Georges' models have gone missing right after Georges' transplants. Ludwig also tells him that after examining the newest parathyroid gland, he can tell Georges has harvested it from a living person, instead of it being 'revitalised' from a corpse. When Ludwig tells him that his actions are unjustified, Georges says sadly that he's done what he's done because he has been left 'utterly alone - again and again' and is tired of having to start a new life every decade. Georges horrifies Ludwig by saying he wants to end his loneliness by having Janine with him forever. The men argue violently, and Georges strangles Ludwig to death.

Pierre arrives the following morning to perform the operation, but Georges tells him that Ludwig was unexpectedly called back to Vienna. Pierre refuses to carry on and suggests that Georges find another surgeon. But Georges can find no one who is willing or able,

LeGris tells Pierre of the disappearances of three young women at 10 year intervals - in London, San Francisco and Bern, Switzerland - and that each modelled for a sculptor who was an MD and who went missing at the same time. With Margo also missing, LeGris believes Georges is responsible for all the disappearances.

Georges takes Janine to a storeroom which holds his sculptures. He proudly shows her the first figurine he made as a boy. The figurine is dated 1798.  Janine laughingly says the date must be incorrect because if it weren't, Georges would be 104. Georges abruptly leaves, locking Janine in the storeroom.

Georges tells Pierre that he and Ludwig discovered the secret of 'perpetual life' decades earlier. But he can't reveal the secret to the world because if everyone could live forever, paradoxically, everyone would die as there would be no supply of parathyroid glands to keep them alive. Pierre again refuses to perform the transplant, calling it 'an offence against nature [and] and offence against God'. But he relents when Georges threatens Janine's life.

Janine finds a now-mad Margo imprisoned in the storeroom. Meanwhile, Pierre fakes the operation - making the incision at Georges' waist but not transplanting the gland. Georges rushes to the storeroom, and as Pierre and LeGris follow, Georges tells Janine that the same operation will allow her to live forever, always young and beautiful and in love. She refuses.

Suddenly, Georges begins ageing rapidly and realises that Pierre didn't actually perform the operation. As he exclaims he's dying, Margo, laughing dementedly, throws an oil lamp on him, setting him and the storeroom afire. Pierre and LeGris rescue Janine. Georges and Margo die in the flames.

== Production ==
The lead role of Bonnet was originally offered to [[Peter Cushing]], who turned it down six days before shooting started. Cushing's reason was that he was completely exhausted 'following the shooting of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' (1959), which had just wrapped up'. The loss of Cushing caused Hammer to threaten legal action against him.

The European release of the film featured a scene in which Court appeared topless.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=104}} She was paid 'an extra £2000 ($5,600 in 1959 dollars)' for the scene, in which she is posing for a sculpture made by Diffring's character.

The X-cert meant that the film could only be exhibited to people age 16 or older. The film was cut in order to get the certificate, which allowed it to be shown in the UK, but the details of what or how much was cut are unknown.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/man-who-could-cheat-death-1959|title=The Man Who Could Cheat Death (1959)|last=|first=|date=|website=British Board of Film Classification|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

== Reception ==

''The'' ''Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films'' calls the film an \"odd mish-mash of mad scientist sci-fi flick and gothic flannel\" that \"suffers from an excess of dialogue and a lack of action.\"{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=41}} 

This assessment is reflected in other contemporary reviews. Film scholar Chris Fellner quotes several: the 20 June 1959 issue of ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' says that the movie's 'chief drawback' is 'that it is given more to talk than to movement'; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<nowiki/>'s issue of 24 June 1959 calls it 'well acted and intelligently conceived. But invention and embellishment in this field appear to have been exhausted'; and the ''[[Motion Picture Exhibitor]]'' issue of 1 July 1959 describes ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' as suffering from 'relying mainly on talk'.<ref name=\":1\" />

The film is referred to by journalist Howard Maxford as a 'commercial and artistic disaster' and a 'bog standard surgical thriller' that is 'by no means a Hammer classic'. He calls Terence Fisher's direction 'curiously unambitious', characterised by 'many scenes filmed in lengthy, static takes, almost as if from the stalls of a theatre'. Maxford also dislikes the 'Bright, bland lighting' and 'garish Technicolor film stock' which together 'make for some visually tedious and unattractive images'.<ref name=\":0\" />

On the other hand, film scholar Phil Hardy writes that visually the film 'looks like one of Hammer's more lavish productions', although it is a 'minor item' in Fisher's work. He describes the movie as having a 'perfunctory script', which makes it a 'rather awkward variation on the [[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]] motif'.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Hardy, ed.|first=Phil|title=The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies|publisher=Harper & Row, Publishers|year=1986|isbn=0060550503|location=NY|pages=115}}</ref>

In the 'Hazel Court' chapter of ''Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors'', author Calvin Thomas Beck praises the performances of the three main actors. He writes that Diffring shows 'unique and excellent villainy' and is a 'magnificent heavy who has been shamefully neglected by filmmakers'. Court, he writes, is a 'fine, striking actress at all times' who 'screams and cringes properly' during the movie. He calls ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' one of her 'finest British thrillers'. Beck also notes that Lee 'unexpectedly reversed his monster-villain image' in the film.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Calvin Thomas|title=Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co. Inc.|year=1978|isbn=0025081705|location=NY|pages=280-281}}</ref>

Author 'Bobb' Carter agrees with Beck's view of Court's performance. Carter calls it 'on the whole (...) a solid, impassioned performance that makes it a shame that this was her last role for Hammer', even though her character, Janine, has the 'distressing trait of not being able to smell something fishy even if there was a whale in the room'.<ref name=\":3\" />

Other critics disagree about the quality of the acting in the film. Maxford calls Diffring's performance 'cold-eyed' and suggests that 'audiences were more used to seeing [him] playing ruthless Nazis',<ref name=\":0\" /> while Hardy says that 'Lee simply walks through his part'.<ref name=\":4\" />

== Novelisation ==
The screenplay of ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was rewritten as an inexpensive paperback novel in 1959. It was published in the US by [[Avon Books]] and sold for 35¢, with the authors named as 'Barre' Lyndon and Jimmy Sangster. In the UK, where the book sold for 2/6, [[Ace Books]] listed the author as John Sansom, the pen name of Sangster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/Man-Who-Could-Cheat-Death-Lyndon-Barre/10079019346/bd#&grid=1&pid=1|title=The Man Who Could Cheat Death|last=|first=|date=|website=Abe Books|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

'''''The Man Who Could Cheat Death''''' is a 1959 British [[horror film|horror]] film, directed by [[Terence Fisher]] and starring [[Anton Diffring]], [[Hazel Court]] and [[Christopher Lee]]. [[Jimmy Sangster]] adapted the screenplay from the play ''[[The Man in Half Moon Street (play)|The Man in Half Moon Street]]'' by [[Barré Lyndon]], which had been [[The Man in Half Moon Street|previously filmed in 1945]]. ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was produced by [[Michael Carreras]] and [[Anthony Nelson Keys]] for [[Hammer Film Productions]]. It was released in the US on 19 August 1959 and in the UK on 30 November 1959.

== Plot ==

Paris, 1890. Dr Georges Bonnet (Diffring), MD and sculptor, harbours an unusual secret. Although he appears to be in his mid-30s, he is actually 104-years-old, and has kept his youth and vitality through [[Parathyroid gland|parathyroid]] gland transplants every 10 years. But things are going wrong. Prof Ludwig Weiss ([[Arnold Marlé]]) of Vienna, co-discoverer of the anti-ageing process, is three weeks late in arriving at Georges' home to perform the latest transplant. As such, Georges must drink a steaming green liquid to stay young. When Georges' latest model, Margo Philippe ([[Delphi Lawrence]]), comes across Georges swilling the fluid, he strikes her down. 

Georges has invited a number of people to a reception at which he will unveil his bust of Margo, including Janine Dubois (Court), his former lover, and Dr Pierre Girard (Lee), Janine's current companion. When the 89-year-old Ludwig later arrives, it is quite apparent he will be unable to operate on Georges because a stroke has incapacitated his right hand. Ludwig tells Georges they must find another surgeon.

Georges and Ludwig invite Janine and Pierre to dinner. In private, Ludwig convinces Pierre to perform the transplant. However, Janine is still in love with Georges, and when he mysteriously says he must soon leave Paris so he can 'lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond', Janine asks to accompany him. As the dinner party ends, [[National Police (France)|Surété]] Inspector LeGris ([[Francis de Wolff|Francis De Wolff]]) arrives. He is investigating Margo's disappearance. Georges denies knowing her whereabouts and, when LeGris asks to see the bust of Margo, he tells him that he accidentally destroyed it. LeGris leaves and Georges admits to his startled guests that he lied but says the police would probably damage the bust if he turned it over to them.

After Janine and Pierre have left, Ludwig tells Georges that Pierre will operate. But Ludwig has grown suspicious of Georges and says it is strange that Georges' models have gone missing right after Georges' transplants. Ludwig also tells him that after examining the newest parathyroid gland, he can tell Georges has harvested it from a living person, instead of it being 'revitalised' from a corpse. When Ludwig tells him that his actions are unjustified, Georges says sadly that he's done what he's done because he has been left 'utterly alone - again and again' and is tired of having to start a new life every decade. Georges horrifies Ludwig by saying he wants to end his loneliness by having Janine with him forever. The men argue violently, and Georges strangles Ludwig to death.

Pierre arrives the following morning to perform the operation, but Georges tells him that Ludwig was unexpectedly called back to Vienna. Pierre refuses to carry on and suggests that Georges find another surgeon. But Georges can find no one who is willing or able,

LeGris tells Pierre of the disappearances of three young women at 10 year intervals - in London, San Francisco and Bern, Switzerland - and that each modelled for a sculptor who was an MD and who went missing at the same time. With Margo also missing, LeGris believes Georges is responsible for all the disappearances.

Georges takes Janine to a storeroom which holds his sculptures. He proudly shows her the first figurine he made as a boy. The figurine is dated 1798.  Janine laughingly says the date must be incorrect because if it weren't, Georges would be 104. Georges abruptly leaves, locking Janine in the storeroom.

Georges tells Pierre that he and Ludwig discovered the secret of 'perpetual life' decades earlier. But he can't reveal the secret to the world because if everyone could live forever, paradoxically, everyone would die as there would be no supply of parathyroid glands to keep them alive. Pierre again refuses to perform the transplant, calling it 'an offence against nature [and] and offence against God'. But he relents when Georges threatens Janine's life.

Janine finds a now-mad Margo imprisoned in the storeroom. Meanwhile, Pierre fakes the operation - making the incision at Georges' waist but not transplanting the gland. Georges rushes to the storeroom, and as Pierre and LeGris follow, Georges tells Janine that the same operation will allow her to live forever, always young and beautiful and in love. She refuses.

Suddenly, Georges begins ageing rapidly and realises that Pierre didn't actually perform the operation. As he exclaims he's dying, Margo, laughing dementedly, throws an oil lamp on him, setting him and the storeroom afire. Pierre and LeGris rescue Janine. Georges and Margo die in the flames.

== Production ==
The lead role of Bonnet was originally offered to [[Peter Cushing]], who turned it down six days before shooting started. Cushing's reason was that he was completely exhausted 'following the shooting of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' (1959), which had just wrapped up'. The loss of Cushing caused Hammer to threaten legal action against him.
