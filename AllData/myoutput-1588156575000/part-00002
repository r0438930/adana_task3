It is carried out to allow medical procedures that would otherwise be intolerably painful for the patient; or where the nature of the procedure itself precludes the patient being awake.\n\nA variety of [[General anesthetic|drugs]] may be administered, with the overall aim of ensuring [[unconsciousness]], [[amnesia]], [[Analgesic|analgesia]], loss of reflexes of the [[autonomic nervous system]], and in some cases [[paralysis]] of [[skeletal muscle]]s. The optimal combination of drugs for any given patient and procedure is typically selected by an [[anesthesiologist|anaesthetist]], or another provider such as an operating department practitioner, anaesthetist practitioner, [[physician assistant]] or [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]] (depending on local practice), in consultation with the patient and the surgeon, dentist, or other practitioner performing the operative procedure.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of general anesthesia}}\n{{Further|History of tracheal intubation}}\nAttempts at producing a state of general anaesthesia can be traced throughout recorded history in the writings of the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indians]], and [[History of China#Ancient era|Chinese]].  During the [[Middle Ages]], scientists and other scholars made significant advances in the [[Eastern world]], while their European counterparts also made important advances.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw significant advances in [[anatomy]] and [[surgery|surgical technique]]. However, despite all this progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated [[pain]], many patients chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although there has been a great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anaesthesia, several scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anaesthetic techniques.\n\nTwo enormous leaps occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery. An appreciation of the [[germ theory of disease]] led rapidly to the development and application of [[antiseptic]] techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to [[asepsis]], reduced the overall [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in [[pharmacology]] and [[physiology]] which led to the development of general anaesthesia and the control of pain. On 14 November 1804, [[Hanaoka Seish\u016b]], a Japanese doctor, became the first person to successfully perform surgery using general anaesthesia.\n\nIn the 20th century, the safety and efficacy of general anaesthesia was improved by the routine use of [[tracheal intubation]] and other advanced [[airway management]] techniques. Significant advances in [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and new [[anesthetic|anaesthetic agents]] with improved [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[Pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]] characteristics also contributed to this trend. Finally, standardized training programs for anaesthesiologists and [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]]s emerged during this period.\n\n== Purpose ==\nGeneral anaesthesia has many purposes, including:\n#Analgesia (loss of response to pain)\n#Amnesia (loss of memory)\n#Immobility (loss of motor reflexes)\n#Hypnosis (unconsciousness)\n#Paralysis (skeletal muscle relaxation and normal muscle relaxation)\n\nGeneral anaesthesia should not be used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis<ref name=\"pmid28876979\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Boehm I, Nairz K, Morelli J, Silva Hasembank Keller P, Heverhagen JT |title=General anaesthesia for patients with a history of a contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis: a useful prophylaxis? |journal=Br J Radiol |volume=90 |issue=1079 |pages=20160647 |year=2017 |pmid=28876979 | doi=10.1259/bjr.20160647 |pmc=5963380}}</ref>  \n\n== Biochemical mechanism of action ==\nThe [[biochemistry|biochemical]] [[Theories of general anaesthetic action|mechanism of action of general anaesthetics]] is not well understood {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.

Despite newer anaesthetic agents and delivery techniques, which have led to more rapid onset of\u2014and recovery from\u2014anaesthesia (in some cases bypassing some of the stages entirely), the principles remain.\n\n;Stage 1: Stage 1, also known as ''induction'', is the period between the administration of induction agents and loss of consciousness. During this stage, the patient progresses from analgesia without amnesia to analgesia with amnesia. Patients can carry on a conversation at this time.\n;Stage 2: Stage 2, also known as the ''excitement stage'', is the period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity. During this stage, the patient's [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[heart rate]] may become irregular. In addition, there may be uncontrolled movements, vomiting, [[Apnea|suspension of breathing]], and [[Pupillary response|pupillary dilation]]. Because the combination of spastic movements, vomiting, and irregular respiration may compromise the patient's airway, rapidly acting drugs are used to minimize time in this stage and reach Stage 3 as fast as possible.\n{{anchor|Surgical anaesthesia}}\n;Stage 3: In Stage 3, also known as ''surgical anaesthesia'', the skeletal muscles relax, vomiting stops, respiratory depression occurs, and eye movements slow and then stop. The patient is unconscious and ready for surgery. This stage is divided into four planes:\n:# The eyes roll, then become fixed;\n:# Corneal and laryngeal reflexes are lost;\n:# The pupils dilate and light reflex is lost;\n:# Intercostal paralysis and shallow abdominal respiration occur.\n;Stage 4: Stage 4, also known as ''overdose'', occurs when too much anaesthetic medication is given relative to the amount of surgical stimulation and the patient has severe [[brainstem]] or [[Medulla oblongata|medullary]] depression, resulting in a cessation of respiration and potential cardiovascular collapse. This stage is lethal without cardiovascular and respiratory support.\n\n== Induction ==\nGeneral anaesthesia is usually induced in a [[medical facility]], most commonly in an [[Operating theater|operating theatre]] or in a dedicated anaesthetic room adjacent to the theatre. However, it may also be conducted in other locations, such as an [[endoscopy]] suite, [[radiology]] or [[cardiology]] department, [[emergency department]], or ambulance, or at the site of a [[disaster]] where extrication of the patient may be impossible or impractical.\n\nAnaesthetic agents may be administered by various routes, including [[inhalation]], [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] ([[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]], [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]], or [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]]), [[mouth|oral]], and [[rectum|rectal]]. Once they enter the [[circulatory system]], the agents are transported to their biochemical [[Active site|sites of action]] in the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] nervous systems.\n\nMost general anaesthetics are induced either intravenously or by inhalation. Intravenous injection works faster than inhalation, taking about 10\u201320 seconds to induce total unconsciousness. This minimizes the excitatory phase (Stage 2) and thus reduces complications related to the induction of anaesthesia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Commonly used intravenous induction agents include [[propofol]], [[sodium thiopental]], [[etomidate]], [[methohexital]], and [[ketamine]]. [[Inhalational anaesthetic|Inhalational anaesthesia]] may be chosen when intravenous access is difficult to obtain (e.g., children), when difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or when the patient prefers it. [[Sevoflurane]] is the most commonly used agent for inhalational induction, because it is less irritating to the [[tracheobronchial tree]] than other agents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nAs an example sequence of induction drugs:\n# Pre-oxygenation to fill lungs with oxygen to permit a longer period of apnea during intubation without affecting blood oxygen levels\n# [[Fentanyl]] for systemic analgesia for intubation\n# [[Propofol]] for sedation for intubation\n# Switching from oxygen to a mixture of oxygen and [[inhalational anesthetic]]\n\n[[Laryngoscopy]] and intubation are both very stimulating and induction blunts the response to these maneuvers while simultaneously inducing a near-coma state to prevent awareness.\n\n=== Physiologic monitoring ===\nSeveral [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] technologies allow for a controlled induction of, maintenance of, and emergence from general anaesthesia.\n# '''Continuous [[electrocardiography]]''' (ECG or EKG): [[Electrode]]s are placed on the patient's skin to monitor heart rate and rhythm. This may also help the anaesthesiologist to identify early signs of heart [[ischemia|ischaemia]]. Typically lead II and V5 are monitored for arrhythmias and ischemia, respectively.\n# '''Continuous [[pulse oximetry]]''' (SpO2): A device is placed, usually on a finger, to allow for early detection of a fall in a patient's [[hemoglobin|haemoglobin]] saturation with oxygen ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxaemia]]).\n# '''Blood pressure monitoring''': There are two methods of measuring the patient's blood pressure. The first, and most common, is non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. This involves placing a [[Sphygmomanometer|blood pressure cuff]] around the patient's arm, forearm, or leg. A machine takes blood pressure readings at regular, preset intervals throughout the surgery. The second method is invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring. This method is reserved for patients with significant heart or lung disease, the critically ill, and those undergoing major procedures such as cardiac or transplant surgery, or when large blood loss is expected. It involves placing a special type of plastic [[cannula]] in an artery, usually in the wrist ([[radial artery]]) or groin ([[femoral artery]]).\n# '''Agent concentration measurement''': [[anaesthetic machine]]s typically have monitors to measure the percentage of inhalational anaesthetic agents used as well as exhalation concentrations. These monitors include measuring [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[inhalational anaesthetic]]s (e.g., [[nitrous oxide]], [[isoflurane]]).\n# '''Oxygen measurement''': Almost all circuits have an alarm in case oxygen delivery to the patient is compromised. The alarm goes off if the fraction of inspired oxygen drops below a set threshold.\n# A '''circuit disconnect alarm''' or '''low pressure alarm''' indicates failure of the circuit to achieve a given pressure during [[mechanical ventilation]].\n# '''[[Capnography]]''' measures the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] exhaled by the patient in percent or mmHg, allowing the anaesthesiologist to assess the adequacy of [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. MmHg is usually used to allow the provider to see more subtle changes.  \n# '''Temperature measurement''' to discern [[hypothermia]] or fever, and to allow early detection of [[malignant hyperthermia]].\n# '''[[Electroencephalography]]''', '''[[entropy monitoring]]''', or other systems may be used to verify the depth of anaesthesia. This reduces the likelihood of [[anaesthesia awareness]] and of overdose.\n\n=== Airway management ===\n{{main|Airway management}}\nAnaesthetized patients lose protective airway reflexes (such as coughing), [[Airway management|airway patency]], and sometimes a regular breathing pattern due to the effects of anaesthetics, [[opioid]]s, or [[muscle relaxant]]s.\nTo maintain an open airway and regulate breathing, some form of [[tracheal tube|breathing tube]] is inserted after the patient is unconscious.\nTo enable [[mechanical ventilation]], an [[Tracheal intubation|endotracheal tube]] is often used, although there are alternative devices that can assist respiration, such as face masks or [[laryngeal mask airway]]s.\nGenerally, full mechanical ventilation is only used if a very deep state of general anaesthesia is to be induced for a major procedure, and/or with a profoundly ill or injured patient.\nThat said, induction of general anaesthesia usually results in [[apnea]] and requires ventilation until the drugs wear off and spontaneous breathing starts.\nIn other words, ventilation may be required for both induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia or just during the induction.\nHowever, mechanical ventilation can provide ventilatory support during spontaneous breathing to ensure adequate gas exchange.\n\nGeneral anaesthesia can also be induced with the patient spontaneously breathing and therefore maintaining their own oxygenation which can be beneficial in certain scenarios (e.g. difficult airway or tubeless surgery). Spontaneous ventilation has been traditionally maintained with inhalational agents (i.e. halothane or sevoflurane) which is called a gas or inhalational induction. Spontaneous ventilation can also be maintained using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol). Intravenous anaesthesia to maintain spontaneous respiration has certain advantages over inhalational agents (i.e. suppressed laryngeal reflexes) however it requires careful titration.

The first drug used for this purpose was [[curare]], introduced in the 1940s, which has now been superseded by drugs with fewer side effects and, generally, shorter duration of action. Muscle relaxation allows surgery within major [[body cavity|body cavities]], such as the [[abdomen]] and [[thorax]], without the need for very deep anaesthesia, and also facilitates [[endotracheal intubation]].\n\n[[Acetylcholine]], the natural [[neurotransmitter]] at the [[neuromuscular junction]], causes muscles to contract when it is released from nerve endings. Muscle relaxants work by preventing acetylcholine from attaching to its receptor. Paralysis of the muscles of respiration\u2014the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] and [[intercostal muscle]]s of the chest\u2014requires that some form of artificial respiration be implemented. Because the muscles of the [[larynx]] are also paralysed, the airway usually needs to be protected by means of an [[endotracheal tube]].\n\nParalysis is most easily monitored by means of a peripheral nerve stimulator. This device intermittently sends short electrical pulses through the skin over a peripheral nerve while the contraction of a muscle supplied by that nerve is observed. The effects of muscle relaxants are commonly reversed at the end of surgery by [[Cholinesterase inhibitor|anticholinesterase]] drugs, which are administered in combination with muscarinic [[anticholinergic]] drugs to minimize side effects. Novel neuromuscular blockade reversal agents such as [[sugammadex]] may also be used. Examples of skeletal muscle relaxants in use today are [[pancuronium]], [[rocuronium]], [[vecuronium]], [[cisatracurium]], [[atracurium]], [[mivacurium]], and [[succinylcholine]].\n\n== Maintenance ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe duration of action of intravenous induction agents is generally 5 to 10 minutes, after which spontaneous recovery of consciousness will occur. In order to prolong unconsciousness for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. This is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, sometimes [[nitrous oxide]], and a [[volatile anaesthetic]] agent, or by administering medication (usually [[propofol]]) through an [[Peripheral venous catheter|intravenous catheter]]. Inhaled agents are frequently supplemented by intravenous anaesthetics, such as [[opioid]]s (usually [[fentanyl]] or a fentanyl derivative) and [[sedative]]s (usually propofol or midazolam). With propofol-based anaesthetics, however, supplementation by inhalation agents is not required.\n\nAt the end of surgery, administration of anaesthetic agents is discontinued. Recovery of consciousness occurs when the concentration of anaesthetic in the brain drops below a certain level (usually within 1 to 30 minutes, depending on the duration of surgery).\n\n{{anchor|tci}}\nIn the 1990s, a novel method of maintaining anaesthesia was developed in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. Called [[target controlled infusion]] (TCI), it involves using a computer-controlled syringe driver (pump) to infuse propofol throughout the duration of surgery, removing the need for a volatile anaesthetic and allowing pharmacologic principles to more precisely guide the amount of the drug used by setting the desired drug concentration. Advantages include faster recovery from anaesthesia, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and absence of a trigger for [[malignant hyperthermia]]. At present, TCI is not permitted in the United States, but a syringe pump delivering a specific rate of medication is commonly used instead.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOther medications are occasionally used to treat side effects or prevent complications. They include [[antihypertensives]] to treat high blood pressure; [[ephedrine]] or [[phenylephrine]] to treat low blood pressure; [[salbutamol]] to treat [[asthma]], [[laryngospasm]], or [[bronchospasm]]; and [[epinephrine]] or [[diphenhydramine]] to treat allergic reactions. [[Glucocorticoids]] or [[antibiotics]] are sometimes given to prevent inflammation and infection, respectively.\n\n== Emergence ==\nEmergence is the return to baseline physiologic function of all organ systems after the cessation of general anaesthetics. This stage may be accompanied by temporary neurologic phenomena, such as [[agitated emergence]] (acute mental confusion), [[aphasia]] (impaired production or comprehension of speech), or focal impairment in sensory or motor function. [[Postanesthetic shivering|Shivering]] is also fairly common and can be clinically significant because it causes an increase in [[oxygen]] consumption, [[carbon dioxide]] production, [[cardiac output]], [[heart rate]], and [[blood pressure|systemic blood pressure]]. The proposed mechanism is based on the observation that the spinal cord recovers at a faster rate than the brain. This results in uninhibited spinal reflexes manifested as [[clonic]] activity (shivering). This theory is supported by the fact that [[doxapram]], a [[Central nervous system|CNS]] stimulant, is somewhat effective in abolishing postoperative shivering.<ref>Basics of Anesthesia, 5th Edition Authors: Robert K.

It is carried out to allow medical procedures that would otherwise be intolerably painful for the patient; or where the nature of the procedure itself precludes the patient being awake.\n\nA variety of [[General anesthetic|drugs]] may be administered, with the overall aim of ensuring [[unconsciousness]], [[amnesia]], [[Analgesic|analgesia]], loss of reflexes of the [[autonomic nervous system]], and in some cases [[paralysis]] of [[skeletal muscle]]s. The optimal combination of drugs for any given patient and procedure is typically selected by an [[anesthesiologist|anaesthetist]], or another provider such as an operating department practitioner, anaesthetist practitioner, [[physician assistant]] or [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]] (depending on local practice), in consultation with the patient and the surgeon, dentist, or other practitioner performing the operative procedure.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of general anesthesia}}\n{{Further|History of tracheal intubation}}\nAttempts at producing a state of general anaesthesia can be traced throughout recorded history in the writings of the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indians]], and [[History of China#Ancient era|Chinese]].  During the [[Middle Ages]], scientists and other scholars made significant advances in the [[Eastern world]], while their European counterparts also made important advances.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw significant advances in [[anatomy]] and [[surgery|surgical technique]]. However, despite all this progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated [[pain]], many patients chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although there has been a great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anaesthesia, several scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anaesthetic techniques.\n\nTwo enormous leaps occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery. An appreciation of the [[germ theory of disease]] led rapidly to the development and application of [[antiseptic]] techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to [[asepsis]], reduced the overall [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in [[pharmacology]] and [[physiology]] which led to the development of general anaesthesia and the control of pain. On 14 November 1804, [[Hanaoka Seish\u016b]], a Japanese doctor, became the first person to successfully perform surgery using general anaesthesia.\n\nIn the 20th century, the safety and efficacy of general anaesthesia was improved by the routine use of [[tracheal intubation]] and other advanced [[airway management]] techniques. Significant advances in [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and new [[anesthetic|anaesthetic agents]] with improved [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[Pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]] characteristics also contributed to this trend. Finally, standardized training programs for anaesthesiologists and [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]]s emerged during this period.\n\n== Purpose ==\nGeneral anaesthesia has many purposes, including:\n#Analgesia (loss of response to pain)\n#Amnesia (loss of memory)\n#Immobility (loss of motor reflexes)\n#Hypnosis (unconsciousness)\n#Paralysis (skeletal muscle relaxation and normal muscle relaxation)\n\nGeneral anaesthesia should not be used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis<ref name=\"pmid28876979\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Boehm I, Nairz K, Morelli J, Silva Hasembank Keller P, Heverhagen JT |title=General anaesthesia for patients with a history of a contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis: a useful prophylaxis? |journal=Br J Radiol |volume=90 |issue=1079 |pages=20160647 |year=2017 |pmid=28876979 | doi=10.1259/bjr.20160647}}</ref>  \n\n== Biochemical mechanism of action ==\nThe [[biochemistry|biochemical]] [[Theories of general anaesthetic action|mechanism of action of general anaesthetics]] is not well understood {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.

Despite newer anaesthetic agents and delivery techniques, which have led to more rapid onset of\u2014and recovery from\u2014anaesthesia (in some cases bypassing some of the stages entirely), the principles remain.\n\n;Stage 1: Stage 1, also known as ''induction'', is the period between the administration of induction agents and loss of consciousness. During this stage, the patient progresses from analgesia without amnesia to analgesia with amnesia. Patients can carry on a conversation at this time.\n;Stage 2: Stage 2, also known as the ''excitement stage'', is the period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity. During this stage, the patient's [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[heart rate]] may become irregular. In addition, there may be uncontrolled movements, vomiting, [[Apnea|suspension of breathing]], and [[Pupillary response|pupillary dilation]]. Because the combination of spastic movements, vomiting, and irregular respiration may compromise the patient's airway, rapidly acting drugs are used to minimize time in this stage and reach Stage 3 as fast as possible.\n{{anchor|Surgical anaesthesia}}\n;Stage 3: In Stage 3, also known as ''surgical anaesthesia'', the skeletal muscles relax, vomiting stops, respiratory depression occurs, and eye movements slow and then stop. The patient is unconscious and ready for surgery. This stage is divided into four planes:\n:# The eyes roll, then become fixed;\n:# Corneal and laryngeal reflexes are lost;\n:# The pupils dilate and light reflex is lost;\n:# Intercostal paralysis and shallow abdominal respiration occur.\n;Stage 4: Stage 4, also known as ''overdose'', occurs when too much anaesthetic medication is given relative to the amount of surgical stimulation and the patient has severe [[brainstem]] or [[Medulla oblongata|medullary]] depression, resulting in a cessation of respiration and potential cardiovascular collapse. This stage is lethal without cardiovascular and respiratory support.\n\n== Induction ==\nGeneral anaesthesia is usually induced in a [[medical facility]], most commonly in an [[Operating theater|operating theatre]] or in a dedicated anaesthetic room adjacent to the theatre. However, it may also be conducted in other locations, such as an [[endoscopy]] suite, [[radiology]] or [[cardiology]] department, [[emergency department]], or ambulance, or at the site of a [[disaster]] where extrication of the patient may be impossible or impractical.\n\nAnaesthetic agents may be administered by various routes, including [[inhalation]], [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] ([[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]], [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]], or [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]]), [[mouth|oral]], and [[rectum|rectal]]. Once they enter the [[circulatory system]], the agents are transported to their biochemical [[Active site|sites of action]] in the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] nervous systems.\n\nMost general anaesthetics are induced either intravenously or by inhalation. Intravenous injection works faster than inhalation, taking about 10\u201320 seconds to induce total unconsciousness. This minimizes the excitatory phase (Stage 2) and thus reduces complications related to the induction of anaesthesia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Commonly used intravenous induction agents include [[propofol]], [[sodium thiopental]], [[etomidate]], [[methohexital]], and [[ketamine]]. [[Inhalational anaesthetic|Inhalational anaesthesia]] may be chosen when intravenous access is difficult to obtain (e.g., children), when difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or when the patient prefers it. [[Sevoflurane]] is the most commonly used agent for inhalational induction, because it is less irritating to the [[tracheobronchial tree]] than other agents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nAs an example sequence of induction drugs:\n# Pre-oxygenation to fill lungs with oxygen to permit a longer period of apnea during intubation without affecting blood oxygen levels\n# [[Fentanyl]] for systemic analgesia for intubation\n# [[Propofol]] for sedation for intubation\n# Switching from oxygen to a mixture of oxygen and [[inhalational anesthetic]]\n\n[[Laryngoscopy]] and intubation are both very stimulating and induction blunts the response to these maneuvers while simultaneously inducing a near-coma state to prevent awareness.\n\n=== Physiologic monitoring ===\nSeveral [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] technologies allow for a controlled induction of, maintenance of, and emergence from general anaesthesia.\n# '''Continuous [[electrocardiography]]''' (ECG or EKG): [[Electrode]]s are placed on the patient's skin to monitor heart rate and rhythm. This may also help the anaesthesiologist to identify early signs of heart [[ischemia|ischaemia]]. Typically lead II and V5 are monitored for arrhythmias and ischemia, respectively.\n# '''Continuous [[pulse oximetry]]''' (SpO2): A device is placed, usually on a finger, to allow for early detection of a fall in a patient's [[hemoglobin|haemoglobin]] saturation with oxygen ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxaemia]]).\n# '''Blood pressure monitoring''': There are two methods of measuring the patient's blood pressure. The first, and most common, is non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. This involves placing a [[Sphygmomanometer|blood pressure cuff]] around the patient's arm, forearm, or leg. A machine takes blood pressure readings at regular, preset intervals throughout the surgery. The second method is invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring. This method is reserved for patients with significant heart or lung disease, the critically ill, and those undergoing major procedures such as cardiac or transplant surgery, or when large blood loss is expected. It involves placing a special type of plastic [[cannula]] in an artery, usually in the wrist ([[radial artery]]) or groin ([[femoral artery]]).\n# '''Agent concentration measurement''': [[anaesthetic machine]]s typically have monitors to measure the percentage of inhalational anaesthetic agents used as well as exhalation concentrations. These monitors include measuring [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[inhalational anaesthetic]]s (e.g., [[nitrous oxide]], [[isoflurane]]).\n# '''Oxygen measurement''': Almost all circuits have an alarm in case oxygen delivery to the patient is compromised. The alarm goes off if the fraction of inspired oxygen drops below a set threshold.\n# A '''circuit disconnect alarm''' or '''low pressure alarm''' indicates failure of the circuit to achieve a given pressure during [[mechanical ventilation]].\n# '''[[Capnography]]''' measures the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] exhaled by the patient in percent or mmHg, allowing the anaesthesiologist to assess the adequacy of [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. MmHg is usually used to allow the provider to see more subtle changes.  \n# '''Temperature measurement''' to discern [[hypothermia]] or fever, and to allow early detection of [[malignant hyperthermia]].\n# '''[[Electroencephalography]]''', '''[[entropy monitoring]]''', or other systems may be used to verify the depth of anaesthesia. This reduces the likelihood of [[anaesthesia awareness]] and of overdose.\n\n=== Airway management ===\n{{main|Airway management}}\nAnaesthetized patients lose protective airway reflexes (such as coughing), [[Airway management|airway patency]], and sometimes a regular breathing pattern due to the effects of anaesthetics, [[opioid]]s, or [[muscle relaxant]]s.\nTo maintain an open airway and regulate breathing, some form of [[tracheal tube|breathing tube]] is inserted after the patient is unconscious.\nTo enable [[mechanical ventilation]], an [[Tracheal intubation|endotracheal tube]] is often used, although there are alternative devices that can assist respiration, such as face masks or [[laryngeal mask airway]]s.\nGenerally, full mechanical ventilation is only used if a very deep state of general anaesthesia is to be induced for a major procedure, and/or with a profoundly ill or injured patient.\nThat said, induction of general anaesthesia usually results in [[apnea]] and requires ventilation until the drugs wear off and spontaneous breathing starts.\nIn other words, ventilation may be required for both induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia or just during the induction.\nHowever, mechanical ventilation can provide ventilatory support during spontaneous breathing to ensure adequate gas exchange.\n\nGeneral anaesthesia can also be induced with the patient spontaneously breathing and therefore maintaining their own oxygenation which can be beneficial in certain scenarios (e.g. difficult airway or tubeless surgery). Spontaneous ventilation has been traditionally maintained with inhalational agents (i.e. halothane or sevoflurane) which is called a gas or inhalational induction. Spontaneous ventilation can also be maintained using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol). Intravenous anaesthesia to maintain spontaneous respiration has certain advantages over inhalational agents (i.e. suppressed laryngeal reflexes) however it requires careful titration. SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is a technique that has been used in difficult and obstructed airways.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Booth AW, Vidhani K, Lee PK, Thomsett CM | title = SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and Hi-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) maintains oxygenation and airway patency during management of the obstructed airway: an observational study | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 118 | issue = 3 | pages = 444\u2013451 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28203745 | pmc = 5409133 | doi = 10.1093/bja/aew468 | url = https://academic.oup.com/bja/article/118/3/444/2999638/SponTaneous-Respiration-using-IntraVEnous }}</ref>\n\n=== Eye management ===\n{{Main|Eye injuries during general anaesthesia}}\nGeneral anaesthesia reduces the [[Tetanic contraction|tonic contraction]] of the [[orbicularis oculi muscle]], causing [[lagophthalmos]], or incomplete eye closure, in 59% of patients.<ref name=\"contractor\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Contractor S, Hardman JG |title=Injury during anaesthesia |journal=Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=67\u201370 |year=2006 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkl004}}</ref> In addition, tear production and tear-film stability are reduced, resulting in corneal epithelial drying and reduced [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] protection.

The first drug used for this purpose was [[curare]], introduced in the 1940s, which has now been superseded by drugs with fewer side effects and, generally, shorter duration of action. Muscle relaxation allows surgery within major [[body cavity|body cavities]], such as the [[abdomen]] and [[thorax]], without the need for very deep anaesthesia, and also facilitates [[endotracheal intubation]].\n\n[[Acetylcholine]], the natural [[neurotransmitter]] at the [[neuromuscular junction]], causes muscles to contract when it is released from nerve endings. Muscle relaxants work by preventing acetylcholine from attaching to its receptor. Paralysis of the muscles of respiration\u2014the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] and [[intercostal muscle]]s of the chest\u2014requires that some form of artificial respiration be implemented. Because the muscles of the [[larynx]] are also paralysed, the airway usually needs to be protected by means of an [[endotracheal tube]].\n\nParalysis is most easily monitored by means of a peripheral nerve stimulator. This device intermittently sends short electrical pulses through the skin over a peripheral nerve while the contraction of a muscle supplied by that nerve is observed. The effects of muscle relaxants are commonly reversed at the end of surgery by [[Cholinesterase inhibitor|anticholinesterase]] drugs, which are administered in combination with muscarinic [[anticholinergic]] drugs to minimize side effects. Novel neuromuscular blockade reversal agents such as [[sugammadex]] may also be used. Examples of skeletal muscle relaxants in use today are [[pancuronium]], [[rocuronium]], [[vecuronium]], [[cisatracurium]], [[atracurium]], [[mivacurium]], and [[succinylcholine]].\n\n== Maintenance ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe duration of action of intravenous induction agents is generally 5 to 10 minutes, after which spontaneous recovery of consciousness will occur. In order to prolong unconsciousness for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. This is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, sometimes [[nitrous oxide]], and a [[volatile anaesthetic]] agent, or by administering medication (usually [[propofol]]) through an [[Peripheral venous catheter|intravenous catheter]]. Inhaled agents are frequently supplemented by intravenous anaesthetics, such as [[opioid]]s (usually [[fentanyl]] or a fentanyl derivative) and [[sedative]]s (usually propofol or midazolam). With propofol-based anaesthetics, however, supplementation by inhalation agents is not required.\n\nAt the end of surgery, administration of anaesthetic agents is discontinued. Recovery of consciousness occurs when the concentration of anaesthetic in the brain drops below a certain level (usually within 1 to 30 minutes, depending on the duration of surgery).\n\n{{anchor|tci}}\nIn the 1990s, a novel method of maintaining anaesthesia was developed in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. Called [[target controlled infusion]] (TCI), it involves using a computer-controlled syringe driver (pump) to infuse propofol throughout the duration of surgery, removing the need for a volatile anaesthetic and allowing pharmacologic principles to more precisely guide the amount of the drug used by setting the desired drug concentration. Advantages include faster recovery from anaesthesia, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and absence of a trigger for [[malignant hyperthermia]]. At present, TCI is not permitted in the United States, but a syringe pump delivering a specific rate of medication is commonly used instead.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOther medications are occasionally used to treat side effects or prevent complications. They include [[antihypertensives]] to treat high blood pressure; [[ephedrine]] or [[phenylephrine]] to treat low blood pressure; [[salbutamol]] to treat [[asthma]], [[laryngospasm]], or [[bronchospasm]]; and [[epinephrine]] or [[diphenhydramine]] to treat allergic reactions. [[Glucocorticoids]] or [[antibiotics]] are sometimes given to prevent inflammation and infection, respectively.\n\n== Emergence ==\nEmergence is the return to baseline physiologic function of all organ systems after the cessation of general anaesthetics. This stage may be accompanied by temporary neurologic phenomena, such as [[agitated emergence]] (acute mental confusion), [[aphasia]] (impaired production or comprehension of speech), or focal impairment in sensory or motor function. [[Postanesthetic shivering|Shivering]] is also fairly common and can be clinically significant because it causes an increase in [[oxygen]] consumption, [[carbon dioxide]] production, [[cardiac output]], [[heart rate]], and [[blood pressure|systemic blood pressure]]. The proposed mechanism is based on the observation that the spinal cord recovers at a faster rate than the brain. This results in uninhibited spinal reflexes manifested as [[clonic]] activity (shivering). This theory is supported by the fact that [[doxapram]], a [[Central nervous system|CNS]] stimulant, is somewhat effective in abolishing postoperative shivering.<ref>Basics of Anesthesia, 5th Edition Authors: Robert K.
