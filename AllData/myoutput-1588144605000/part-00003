Her performance as Lola-Lola in ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930) brought her international acclaim and a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]]. Dietrich starred in Hollywood films such as ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' (1930), ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932), and ''[[Desire (1936 film)|Desire]]'' (1936). She successfully traded on her glamorous persona and \"exotic\" looks, and became one of the highest-paid actresses of the era. Throughout World War II, she was a high-profile entertainer in the United States. Although she still made occasional films after the war such as ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957), Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a marquee live-show performer.\n\nDietrich was known for her humanitarian efforts during the war, housing German and French exiles, providing financial support and even advocating their U.S. citizenship. For her work on improving morale on the front lines during the war, she received several honors from the United States, France, Belgium, and Israel. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] named Dietrich [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|the ninth greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema]].<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite news |title=AFI's 50 Greatest American Screen Legends |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |work=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Map Rote Insel-Berlin.svg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Location of Marlene Dietrich's birthplace in [[Rote Insel]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Marlene Dietrich Birth House Panorama 2012-07-28 small.tiff\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Dietrich's birthplace in Leberstra\u00dfe 65, Berlin-[[Sch\u00f6neberg]]\n}}\n\nDietrich was born on {{Birth date|1901|12|27|df=yes}} at Leberstra\u00dfe 65 in the neighborhood of [[Rote Insel]] in [[Sch\u00f6neberg]], now a district of Berlin.<ref name=Born>Born as Maria Magdalena, not Marie Magdalene, according to Dietrich's biography by her daughter, Maria Riva {{harv|Riva|1993}}; however Dietrich's biography by Charlotte Chandler cites \"Marie Magdalene\" as her birth name {{harv|Chandler|2011|p=12}}.</ref> Her mother, Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine (''n\u00e9e'' Felsing), was from an affluent Berlin family who owned a jewelry and clock-making firm. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, was a police lieutenant. Dietrich had one sibling, Elisabeth, who was one year older. Dietrich's father died in 1907.{{sfn|Bach|2011|p=19}} His best friend, Eduard von Losch, an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] first lieutenant in the [[Grenadiers]], courted Wilhelmina and married her in 1914, but he died soon afterwards, in July 1916, from injuries sustained during the First World War.<ref name=Born /> Von Losch never officially adopted the Dietrich sisters, so Dietrich's surname was never von Losch, as has sometimes been claimed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ourqueerhistory.com/marlene-dietrich-german-american-actress-and-singer/|title=Marlene Dietrich (German-American actress and singer)|work=Our Queer History|date=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nDietrich's family nicknamed her \"Lena\" and \"Lene\" ({{IPA-de|le\u02d0n\u025b|IPA}}). Aged about 11, she combined her first two names to form the name \"Marlene\". Dietrich attended the Auguste-Viktoria Girls' School from 1907 to 1917{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=20}} and graduated from the Victoria-Luise-Schule (today Goethe-Gymnasium) in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, in 1918.{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=26}} She studied the [[violin]]{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=32}} and became interested in theater and poetry as a teenager. A wrist injury{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=39}} curtailed her dreams of becoming a concert violinist, but by 1922 she had her first job, playing violin in a [[pit orchestra]] for silent films at a Berlin cinema. She was fired after only four weeks.{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=42}}\n\nThe earliest professional stage appearances by Dietrich were as a [[chorus line|chorus girl]] on tour with Guido Thielscher's Girl-Kabarett [[vaudeville]]-style entertainments, and in Rudolf Nelson revues in Berlin.{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=44}} In 1922, Dietrich auditioned unsuccessfully for theatrical director and impresario [[Max Reinhardt]]'s drama academy;{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=49}} however, she soon found herself working in his theatres as a chorus girl and playing small roles in dramas. She did not attract any special attention at first.\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nDietrich's film debut was a small part in the film ''[[The Little Napoleon]]'' (1923).{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=491}} She met her future husband, Rudolf Sieber, on the set of ''[[Tragedy of Love]]'' in 1923. Dietrich and Sieber were married in a civil ceremony in Berlin on 17 May 1923.{{sfn|Bach|2011|p=62}} Her only child, daughter [[Maria Riva|Maria Elisabeth Sieber]], was born on 13 December 1924.{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=65}}\n\nDietrich continued to work on stage and in film both in Berlin and Vienna throughout the 1920s. On stage, she had roles of varying importance in [[Frank Wedekind]]'s ''[[Pandora's Box (play)|Pandora's Box]]'',{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=480}} [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'',{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=480}} and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'',{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=482}} as well as [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Back to Methuselah]]''{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=483}} and ''[[Misalliance]]''.{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=488}} It was in musicals and revues such as ''Broadway'', ''Es Liegt in der Luft'', and ''Zwei Krawatten'', however, that she attracted the most attention. By the late 1920s, Dietrich was also playing sizable parts on screen, including roles in ''[[Caf\u00e9 Elektric]]'' (1927), ''[[I Kiss Your Hand, Madame]]'' (1928), and ''[[The Ship of Lost Souls]]'' (1929).<ref>{{cite web|title=Ship of Lost Men (Das Schiff der verlorenen Menschen)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ship-Lost-Schiff-verlorenen-Menschen/dp/B008L1GDK6|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=17 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Film career until World War II ==\n=== Association with von Sternberg ===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = The-Blue-Angel-Dietrich.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Dietrich in her breakthrough role in ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express (1932) by Don English.png\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Josef von Sternberg]] used [[Portrait photography#Butterfly lighting|butterfly lighting]] to enhance Dietrich's features in ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932)\n}}\n\nIn 1929, Dietrich landed her breakthrough role of Lola Lola, a cabaret singer who caused the downfall of a hitherto respectable schoolmaster (played by [[Emil Jannings]]), in the [[UFA GmbH|UFA]] production of ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930), shot at [[Babelsberg Studio|Babelsberg film studios]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studiobabelsberg.com/en/filming-in-germany-film-production-services-soft-money-incentives-germany/100th-anniversary-of-studio-babelsberg/|title=100th anniversary of Studio Babelsberg|publisher=www.StudioBabelsberg.com|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filmportal.de/en/movie/der-blaue-engel_ea43d4a69a155006e03053d50b37753d|title=filmportal: The Blue Angel|publisher=www.filmportal.de|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref> [[Josef von Sternberg]] directed the film and thereafter took credit for having \"discovered\" Dietrich. The film introduced Dietrich's signature song \"[[Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)|Falling in Love Again]]\", which she recorded for [[Electrola]] and later made further recordings in the 1930s for [[Polydor]] and [[Decca Records]].\n\nIn 1930, on the strength of ''The Blue Angel's'' international success, and with encouragement and promotion from Josef von Sternberg, who was established in Hollywood, Dietrich moved to the United States under contract to [[Paramount Pictures]], the U.S. film distributor of ''[[The Blue Angel]]''. The studio sought to market Dietrich as a German answer to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s [[Swedes|Swedish]] star, [[Greta Garbo]]. Sternberg welcomed her with gifts, including a green [[Rolls-Royce Phantom II]]. The car later appeared in their first U.S. film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ex-Marlene Dietrich, Multiple Best in Show Winning 1930 Rolls-Royce Phantom|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22530/lot/170/|publisher=Bonhams|access-date=18 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223074337/https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22530/lot/170/|archive-date=23 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDietrich starred in six films directed by von Sternberg at Paramount between 1930 and 1935. Von Sternberg worked effectively with Dietrich to create the image of a glamorous and mysterious [[femme fatale]]. He encouraged her to lose weight and coached her intensively as an actress. She willingly followed his sometimes imperious direction in a way that a number of other performers resisted.<ref>See e.g., {{harvp|Thomson|1975|p=587}}: \"He was not an easy man to be directed by. Many actors\u2014notably [Emil] Jannings and William Powell\u2014reacted violently to him. Dietrich adored him, and trusted him. ... \"</ref>\n\nIn ''Morocco'' (1930), Dietrich was again cast as a cabaret singer. The film is best remembered for the sequence in which she performs a song dressed in a man's white tie and kisses another woman, both provocative for the era. The film earned Dietrich her only [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]] nomination.\n\n''Morocco'' was followed by ''[[Dishonored (film)|Dishonored]]'' (1931), a major success with Dietrich cast as a [[Mata Hari]]-like spy. ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932), which was dubbed by the critics \"''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' on wheels\", was von Sternberg and Dietrich's biggest box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1932. Dietrich and von Sternberg again collaborated on the romance ''[[Blonde Venus]]'' (1932). Dietrich worked without von Sternberg for the first time in three years in the romantic drama ''[[The Song of Songs (1933 film)|Song of Songs]]'' (1933), playing a naive German peasant, under the direction of [[Rouben Mamoulian]]. Dietrich and Sternberg's last two films, ''[[The Scarlet Empress]]'' (1934), and ''[[The Devil Is a Woman (1935 film)|The Devil Is a Woman]]'' (1935)\u2014the most stylized of their collaborations\u2014were their lowest-grossing films. Dietrich later remarked that she was at her most beautiful in ''The Devil Is a Woman''.\n\nVon Sternberg is known for his exceptional skill in lighting and photographing Dietrich to optimum effect. He had a signature use of light and shadow, including the impact of light passed through a veil or slatted window blinds (as for example in ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]''). This combined with the scrupulous attention to [[set design]] and costumes makes the films they made together among cinema's most visually stylish.<ref>See, for example, {{harvp|Thomson|1975}}. The entry for Dietrich: \"With him [von Sternberg] Dietrich made seven masterpieces [i.e., ''Blue Angel'' in Germany and the six in Hollywood], films that are still breathtakingly modern, which have no superior for their sense of artificiality suffused with emotion and which visually combine decadence and austerity, tenderness and cruelty, gaiety and despair.\"</ref> Critics still vigorously debate how much of the credit belonged to von Sternberg and how much to Dietrich, but most would agree that neither consistently reached such heights again after Paramount fired von Sternberg and the two ceased working together.<ref>See, for example, the entries for Dietrich and Sternberg in {{harvp|Thomson|1975}}.</ref> The collaboration of one actress and director creating seven films is still unmatched in motion pictures, with the possible exception of [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[George Cukor]], who made ten films together over a much longer period but which were not created for Hepburn the way the last six von Sternberg/Dietrich collaborations were.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/28/archives/after-making-nine-films-together-hepburn-can-practically-direct.html|title=After Making Nine Films Together, Hepburn Can Practically Direct Cukor; Hepburn Helps Cukor Direct The Corn Is Green'|first=Benedict|last=Nightingale|date=1 February 1979|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>{{sfn|Spoto|1992}}\n\n=== The later 1930s ===\nDietrich's first film after the end of her partnership with von Sternberg was [[Frank Borzage]]'s ''[[Desire (1936 film)|Desire]]'' (1936), a commercial success that gave Dietrich an opportunity to try her hand at [[romantic comedy]]. Her next project, ''[[I Loved a Soldier]]'' (1936), ended in shambles when the film was scrapped several weeks into production due to script problems, scheduling confusion and the studio's decision to fire the producer Ernst Lubitsch .{{sfn|Bach|1992|pp=210-211}}\n\nExtravagant offers lured Dietrich away from Paramount to make her first color film ''[[The Garden of Allah (1936 film)|The Garden of Allah]]'' (1936) for independent producer [[David O. Selznick]], for which she received $200,000, and to Britain for Alexander Korda's production, ''[[Knight Without Armour]]'' (1937), at a salary of $450,000, which made her one of the best paid film stars of the time. While both films performed decently at the box office, her vehicles were costly to produce and her public popularity had declined. By this time, Dietrich placed 126th in box office rankings, and American film exhibitors proclaimed her \"[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]\" in May 1938, a distinction she shared with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Mae West]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]] and [[Fred Astaire]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicmoviefavorites.com/how-joan-crawford-survived-box-office-poison-twice/|title=How Joan Crawford Survived Box Office Poison twice!|date=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile in London, Dietrich later said in interviews, she was approached by [[Nazi Party]] officials and offered lucrative contracts, should she agree to return to Germany as a foremost film star in the [[Third Reich]]. She refused their offers and applied for U.S. citizenship in 1937.<ref name=\"Helm\">{{cite news|last=Helm|first=Toby|title=Film star felt ashamed of Belsen link|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1344765/Film-star-felt-ashamed-of-Belsen-link.html|accessdate=18 May 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 June 2000}}</ref> She returned to Paramount to make ''[[Angel (1937 film)|Angel]]'' (1937), another romantic comedy directed by [[Ernst Lubitsch]]; the film was poorly received, leading Paramount to buy out the remainder of Dietrich's contract.\n\n[[File:Destry-Rides-Again-1939.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Stewart]] and Marlene Dietrich in ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' (1939)]]\n\nDietrich, with encouragement from Josef von Sternberg, accepted producer [[Joe Pasternak]]'s offer to play against type in her first film in two years: that of the cowboy saloon girl, Frenchie, in the western-comedy ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' (1939), with [[James Stewart]]. This was a significantly less well paid role than she had been accustomed. The bawdy role revived her career and \"[[See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have]]\", a song she introduced in the film, became a hit when she recorded it for Decca. She played similar types in ''[[Seven Sinners (1940 film)|Seven Sinners]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'' (1942) both with [[John Wayne]].\n\n== World War II ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 160\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = MarleneDietrichUniform.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Dietrich's uniform, worn during her tours supporting Allied personnel in World War II\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Medaloffreedom-cropped.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =Dietrich received the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]] from Gen.

In 1937, her entire salary for ''[[Knight Without Armour|Knight Without Armor]]'' ($450,000) was put into [[escrow]] to help the refugees. In 1939, she became an American citizen and renounced her German citizenship.<ref name=\"nytimesobit\" />\nIn December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II, and Dietrich became one of the first public figures to help sell [[war bond]]s.

Dietrich would inform the audience that she could read minds and ask them to concentrate on whatever came into their minds. Then she would walk over to a soldier and earnestly tell him, \"Oh, think of something else. I can't possibly talk about ''that''!\" American church papers reportedly published stories complaining about this part of Dietrich's act.<ref name=sudendorf />\n\nIn 1944, the Morale Operations Branch of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) initiated the Musak project, musical propaganda broadcasts designed to demoralize enemy soldiers.<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/marlene-dietrich.html|title=A Look Back ...

Her performance as Lola-Lola in ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930) brought her international acclaim and a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]]. Dietrich starred in Hollywood films such as ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' (1930), ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932), and ''[[Desire (1936 film)|Desire]]'' (1936). She successfully traded on her glamorous persona and \"exotic\" looks, and became one of the highest-paid actresses of the era. Throughout World War II, she was a high-profile entertainer in the United States. Although she still made occasional films after the war such as ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957), Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a marquee live-show performer.\n\nDietrich was known for her humanitarian efforts during the war, housing German and French exiles, providing financial support and even advocating their U.S. citizenship. For her work on improving morale on the front lines during the war, she received several honors from the United States, France, Belgium, and Israel. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] named Dietrich [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|the ninth greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema]].<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite news |title=AFI's 50 Greatest American Screen Legends |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |work=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Map Rote Insel-Berlin.svg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Location of Marlene Dietrich's birthplace in [[Rote Insel]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Marlene Dietrich Birth House Panorama 2012-07-28 small.tiff\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Dietrich's birthplace in Leberstra\u00dfe 65, Berlin-[[Sch\u00f6neberg]]\n}}\n\nDietrich was born on {{Birth date|1901|12|27|df=yes}} at Leberstra\u00dfe 65 in the neighborhood of [[Rote Insel]] in [[Sch\u00f6neberg]], now a district of Berlin.<ref name=Born>Born as Maria Magdalena, not Marie Magdalene, according to Dietrich's biography by her daughter, Maria Riva {{harv|Riva|1993}}; however Dietrich's biography by Charlotte Chandler cites \"Marie Magdalene\" as her birth name {{harv|Chandler|2011|p=12}}.</ref> Her mother, Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine (''n\u00e9e'' Felsing), was from an affluent Berlin family who owned a jewelry and clock-making firm. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, was a police lieutenant. Dietrich had one sibling, Elisabeth, who was one year older. Dietrich's father died in 1907.{{sfn|Bach|2011|p=19}} His best friend, Eduard von Losch, an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] first lieutenant in the [[Grenadiers]], courted Wilhelmina and married her in 1914, but he died soon afterwards, in July 1916, from injuries sustained during the First World War.<ref name=Born /> Von Losch never officially adopted the Dietrich sisters, so Dietrich's surname was never von Losch, as has sometimes been claimed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ourqueerhistory.com/marlene-dietrich-german-american-actress-and-singer/|title=Marlene Dietrich (German-American actress and singer)|work=Our Queer History|date=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nDietrich's family nicknamed her \"Lena\" and \"Lene\" ({{IPA-de|le\u02d0n\u025b|IPA}}). Aged about 11, she combined her first two names to form the name \"Marlene\". Dietrich attended the Auguste-Viktoria Girls' School from 1907 to 1917{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=20}} and graduated from the Victoria-Luise-Schule (today Goethe-Gymnasium) in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, in 1918.{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=26}} She studied the [[violin]]{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=32}} and became interested in theater and poetry as a teenager. A wrist injury{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=39}} curtailed her dreams of becoming a concert violinist, but by 1922 she had her first job, playing violin in a [[pit orchestra]] for silent films at a Berlin cinema. She was fired after only four weeks.{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=42}}\n\nThe earliest professional stage appearances by Dietrich were as a [[chorus line|chorus girl]] on tour with Guido Thielscher's Girl-Kabarett [[vaudeville]]-style entertainments, and in Rudolf Nelson revues in Berlin.{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=44}} In 1922, Dietrich auditioned unsuccessfully for theatrical director and impresario [[Max Reinhardt]]'s drama academy;{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=49}} however, she soon found herself working in his theatres as a chorus girl and playing small roles in dramas. She did not attract any special attention at first.\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nDietrich's film debut was a small part in the film ''[[The Little Napoleon]]'' (1923).{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=491}} She met her future husband, Rudolf Sieber, on the set of ''[[Tragedy of Love]]'' in 1923. Dietrich and Sieber were married in a civil ceremony in Berlin on 17 May 1923.{{sfn|Bach|2011|p=62}} Her only child, daughter [[Maria Riva|Maria Elisabeth Sieber]], was born on 13 December 1924.{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=65}}\n\nDietrich continued to work on stage and in film both in Berlin and Vienna throughout the 1920s. On stage, she had roles of varying importance in [[Frank Wedekind]]'s ''[[Pandora's Box (play)|Pandora's Box]]'',{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=480}} [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'',{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=480}} and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'',{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=482}} as well as [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Back to Methuselah]]''{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=483}} and ''[[Misalliance]]''.{{sfn|Bach|1992|p=488}} It was in musicals and revues such as ''Broadway'', ''Es Liegt in der Luft'', and ''Zwei Krawatten'', however, that she attracted the most attention. By the late 1920s, Dietrich was also playing sizable parts on screen, including roles in ''[[Caf\u00e9 Elektric]]'' (1927), ''[[I Kiss Your Hand, Madame]]'' (1928), and ''[[The Ship of Lost Souls]]'' (1929).<ref>{{cite web|title=Ship of Lost Men (Das Schiff der verlorenen Menschen)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ship-Lost-Schiff-verlorenen-Menschen/dp/B008L1GDK6|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=17 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Film career until World War II ==\n=== Association with von Sternberg ===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = The-Blue-Angel-Dietrich.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Dietrich in her breakthrough role in ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express (1932) by Don English.png\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Josef von Sternberg]] used [[Portrait photography#Butterfly lighting|butterfly lighting]] to enhance Dietrich's features in ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932)\n}}\n\nIn 1929, Dietrich landed her breakthrough role of Lola Lola, a cabaret singer who caused the downfall of a hitherto respectable schoolmaster (played by [[Emil Jannings]]), in the [[UFA GmbH|UFA]] production of ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930), shot at [[Babelsberg Studio|Babelsberg film studios]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studiobabelsberg.com/en/filming-in-germany-film-production-services-soft-money-incentives-germany/100th-anniversary-of-studio-babelsberg/|title=100th anniversary of Studio Babelsberg|publisher=www.StudioBabelsberg.com|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filmportal.de/en/movie/der-blaue-engel_ea43d4a69a155006e03053d50b37753d|title=filmportal: The Blue Angel|publisher=www.filmportal.de|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref> [[Josef von Sternberg]] directed the film and thereafter took credit for having \"discovered\" Dietrich. The film introduced Dietrich's signature song \"[[Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)|Falling in Love Again]]\", which she recorded for [[Electrola]] and later made further recordings in the 1930s for [[Polydor]] and [[Decca Records]].\n\nIn 1930, on the strength of ''The Blue Angel's'' international success, and with encouragement and promotion from Josef von Sternberg, who was established in Hollywood, Dietrich moved to the United States under contract to [[Paramount Pictures]], the U.S. film distributor of ''[[The Blue Angel]]''. The studio sought to market Dietrich as a German answer to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s [[Swedes|Swedish]] star, [[Greta Garbo]]. Sternberg welcomed her with gifts, including a green [[Rolls-Royce Phantom II]]. The car later appeared in their first U.S. film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ex-Marlene Dietrich, Multiple Best in Show Winning 1930 Rolls-Royce Phantom|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22530/lot/170/|publisher=Bonhams|access-date=18 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223074337/https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22530/lot/170/|archive-date=23 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDietrich starred in six films directed by von Sternberg at Paramount between 1930 and 1935. Von Sternberg worked effectively with Dietrich to create the image of a glamorous and mysterious [[femme fatale]]. He encouraged her to lose weight and coached her intensively as an actress. She willingly followed his sometimes imperious direction in a way that a number of other performers resisted.<ref>See e.g., {{harvp|Thomson|1975|p=587}}: \"He was not an easy man to be directed by. Many actors\u2014notably [Emil] Jannings and William Powell\u2014reacted violently to him. Dietrich adored him, and trusted him. ... \"</ref>\n\nIn ''Morocco'' (1930), Dietrich was again cast as a cabaret singer. The film is best remembered for the sequence in which she performs a song dressed in a man's white tie and kisses another woman, both provocative for the era. The film earned Dietrich her only [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]] nomination.\n\n''Morocco'' was followed by ''[[Dishonored (film)|Dishonored]]'' (1931), a major success with Dietrich cast as a [[Mata Hari]]-like spy. ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932), which was dubbed by the critics \"''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' on wheels\", was von Sternberg and Dietrich's biggest box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1932. Dietrich and von Sternberg again collaborated on the romance ''[[Blonde Venus]]'' (1932). Dietrich worked without von Sternberg for the first time in three years in the romantic drama ''[[The Song of Songs (1933 film)|Song of Songs]]'' (1933), playing a naive German peasant, under the direction of [[Rouben Mamoulian]]. Dietrich and Sternberg's last two films, ''[[The Scarlet Empress]]'' (1934), and ''[[The Devil Is a Woman (1935 film)|The Devil Is a Woman]]'' (1935)\u2014the most stylized of their collaborations\u2014were their lowest-grossing films. Dietrich later remarked that she was at her most beautiful in ''The Devil Is a Woman''.\n\nVon Sternberg is known for his exceptional skill in lighting and photographing Dietrich to optimum effect. He had a signature use of light and shadow, including the impact of light passed through a veil or slatted window blinds (as for example in ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]''). This combined with the scrupulous attention to [[set design]] and costumes makes the films they made together among cinema's most visually stylish.<ref>See, for example, {{harvp|Thomson|1975}}. The entry for Dietrich: \"With him [von Sternberg] Dietrich made seven masterpieces [i.e., ''Blue Angel'' in Germany and the six in Hollywood], films that are still breathtakingly modern, which have no superior for their sense of artificiality suffused with emotion and which visually combine decadence and austerity, tenderness and cruelty, gaiety and despair.\"</ref> Critics still vigorously debate how much of the credit belonged to von Sternberg and how much to Dietrich, but most would agree that neither consistently reached such heights again after Paramount fired von Sternberg and the two ceased working together.<ref>See, for example, the entries for Dietrich and Sternberg in {{harvp|Thomson|1975}}.</ref> The collaboration of one actress and director creating seven films is still unmatched in motion pictures, with the possible exception of [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[George Cukor]], who made ten films together over a much longer period but which were not created for Hepburn the way the last six von Sternberg/Dietrich collaborations were.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/28/archives/after-making-nine-films-together-hepburn-can-practically-direct.html|title=After Making Nine Films Together, Hepburn Can Practically Direct Cukor; Hepburn Helps Cukor Direct The Corn Is Green'|first=Benedict|last=Nightingale|date=1 February 1979|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>{{sfn|Spoto|1992}}\n\n=== The later 1930s ===\nDietrich's first film after the end of her partnership with von Sternberg was [[Frank Borzage]]'s ''[[Desire (1936 film)|Desire]]'' (1936), a commercial success that gave Dietrich an opportunity to try her hand at [[romantic comedy]]. Her next project, ''[[I Loved a Soldier]]'' (1936), ended in shambles when the film was scrapped several weeks into production due to script problems, scheduling confusion and the studio's decision to fire the producer Ernst Lubitsch .{{sfn|Bach|1992|pp=210-211}}\n\nExtravagant offers lured Dietrich away from Paramount to make her first color film ''[[The Garden of Allah (1936 film)|The Garden of Allah]]'' (1936) for independent producer [[David O. Selznick]], for which she received $200,000, and to Britain for Alexander Korda's production, ''[[Knight Without Armour]]'' (1937), at a salary of $450,000, which made her one of the best paid film stars of the time. While both films performed decently at the box office, her vehicles were costly to produce and her public popularity had declined. By this time, Dietrich placed 126th in box office rankings, and American film exhibitors proclaimed her \"[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]\" in May 1938, a distinction she shared with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Mae West]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]] and [[Fred Astaire]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicmoviefavorites.com/how-joan-crawford-survived-box-office-poison-twice/|title=How Joan Crawford Survived Box Office Poison twice!|date=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile in London, Dietrich later said in interviews, she was approached by [[Nazi Party]] officials and offered lucrative contracts, should she agree to return to Germany as a foremost film star in the [[Third Reich]]. She refused their offers and applied for U.S. citizenship in 1937.<ref name=\"Helm\">{{cite news|last=Helm|first=Toby|title=Film star felt ashamed of Belsen link|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1344765/Film-star-felt-ashamed-of-Belsen-link.html|accessdate=18 May 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 June 2000}}</ref> She returned to Paramount to make ''[[Angel (1937 film)|Angel]]'' (1937), another romantic comedy directed by [[Ernst Lubitsch]]; the film was poorly received, leading Paramount to buy out the remainder of Dietrich's contract.\n\n[[File:Destry-Rides-Again-1939.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Stewart]] and Marlene Dietrich in ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' (1939)]]\n\nDietrich, with encouragement from Josef von Sternberg, accepted producer [[Joe Pasternak]]'s offer to play against type in her first film in two years: that of the cowboy saloon girl, Frenchie, in the western-comedy ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' (1939), with [[James Stewart]]. This was a significantly less well paid role than she had been accustomed. The bawdy role revived her career and \"[[See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have]]\", a song she introduced in the film, became a hit when she recorded it for Decca. She played similar types in ''[[Seven Sinners (1940 film)|Seven Sinners]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'' (1942) both with [[John Wayne]].\n\n== World War II ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 160\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = MarleneDietrichUniform.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Dietrich's uniform, worn during her tours supporting Allied personnel in World War II\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Medaloffreedom-cropped.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =Dietrich received the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]] from Gen.

In the late 1930s, Dietrich created a fund with [[Billy Wilder]] and several other exiles to help Jews and dissidents escape from Germany. In 1937, her entire salary for ''[[Knight Without Armour|Knight Without Armor]]'' ($450,000) was put into [[escrow]] to help the refugees. In 1939, she became an American citizen and renounced her German citizenship.<ref name=\"nytimesobit\" />\nIn December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II, and Dietrich became one of the first public figures to help sell [[war bond]]s.

Dietrich would inform the audience that she could read minds and ask them to concentrate on whatever came into their minds. Then she would walk over to a soldier and earnestly tell him, \"Oh, think of something else.
