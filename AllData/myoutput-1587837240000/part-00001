It is compulsory for [[motor vehicles]] used on public roads to display [[vehicle registration plate]]s, with the exception of vehicles of the reigning monarch used on official business.<ref name=\"royalcars\">{{cite web |url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Transport/Cars.aspx |title = The Royal Household \u2013 Transport \u2013 Cars |author = The Royal Household |accessdate = 28 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023110/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Transport/Cars.aspx|archivedate=14 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Motor Car Act 1903]], which came into force on 1 January 1904, required all motor vehicles to be entered on an official [[vehicle register]], and to carry alphanumeric plates. The Act was passed in order that vehicles could be easily traced in the event of an accident, contravention of the law or any other incident. Vehicle registration alphanumeric plates in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law. Front plates are white, whereas rear plates are yellow.\n\nWithin the UK itself, there are two systems: one for [[Great Britain]], which dates from 2001, and another for [[Northern Ireland]], which is similar to the original 1904 system. Both systems are administered by the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] (DVLA) in [[Swansea]]. Until July 2014, Northern Ireland's system was administered by the [[Driver and Vehicle Agency]] (DVA) in [[Coleraine]], which had the same status as the DVLA. Other schemes relating to the UK are also listed below. The international vehicle registration code for the United Kingdom is '''GB''' (Great Britain and Northern Ireland).\n\n== Standard requirements ==\n[[File:United Kingdom license plate KAF 762L 1963.jpg|thumb|200px|Black number plates with white or silver characters are permitted on vehicles constructed over 40 years ago, if registered under the Historic Vehicle taxation class.

It follows that the older style plates are now available for any vehicle constructed 40 or more years ago, provided that an application has been made to the DVLA to have the vehicle included in the historic vehicle class; it is so registered and is nil-rated for Vehicle Excise Duty.<ref>[https://insidedvla.blog.gov.uk/2015/11/17/whats-the-story-with-black-and-silver-number-plates/ What's the story with black and silver number plates?], [[DVLA]], 17 November 2015</ref>\n\n=== Motorcycles ===\n[[File:Coventry Triumph Motorcycle.jpg|right|thumb|Vintage Triumph motorcycle with front plate]]\nUntil 1975, motorcycles had to display a front plate, colloquially known as the \"pedestrian slicer\".<ref name=\"Brooke\">{{cite book |author = Lindsay Brooke |title = Triumph : A Century of Passion and Power |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=I8sIulyI7xoC&pg=PA41 |publisher = MotorBooks International |isbn = 978-1-61059-227-7 |pages = 41\u2013 }}</ref>, which was usually but not always a double-sided plate on top of the front mudguard, curved to follow the contour of the wheel and visible from the sides.

The letters '''I''', '''Q''' and '''Z''' are not used as local office identifiers, though  '''O''' is still needed for ''Oxford''; '''Z''' can be used only as a random letter.\n** The first of these two letters is a [[mnemonic]] standing for the name of the broad area where the registration office is located.

The code is either the last two digits of the year itself if issued between March and August (e.g. \"10\" for registrations issued between 1 March and 31 August 2010), or else has 50 added to that value if issued between September and February the following year (e.g. \"60\" for registrations issued between 1 September 2010 and 28 February 2011);\n* A '''three-letter sequence''' which uniquely distinguishes each of the vehicles displaying the same initial four-character area and age sequence. The letters '''I''' and '''Q''' are excluded from the three-letter sequence, as are combinations that may appear offensive (including those in foreign languages). Due to batch allocation of new registration marks to dealers, it is common for cars with \"neighbouring\" letter sequences to be of the same manufacturer.\n\nThis scheme has three particular advantages:\n* A buyer of a second-hand vehicle can in theory determine the year of first registration of the vehicle without having to look it up. However, a vehicle is permitted to display a number plate where the age identifier is older (but ''not'' newer) than the vehicle. The wide awareness of how the \"age identifier\" works has led to it being used in advertising by used-car showrooms instead of simply stating a year.\n* In the case of a police investigation of an accident or vehicle-related crime, witnesses usually remember the initial area code letters \u2013 it is then quite simple to narrow down suspect vehicles to a much smaller number by checking the authority's database without having to know the full number.<ref>{{citation |url = http://www.speedyreg.co.uk/platehistory |title = History of Number Plates |publisher = Speedy Registrations Co.

The width of the previous font was condensed from 57&nbsp;mm to 50&nbsp;mm to allow space for the extra letter and the optional blue EU strip. The letter '''O''' and the digit '''0''' are intentionally identical, as are the letter '''I''' and digit '''1'''. But the typeface accentuates the differences between characters such as '''8''' and '''B''', or '''D''' and '''0''', with [[slab serif]]s to improve the legibility of a plate from a distance. This is especially useful for the [[automatic number plate recognition]] software of [[speed cameras]] and [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]. This accentuation also discourages the tampering that is sometimes practised with the use of black [[insulating tape]] or paint to change letter forms (such as '''P''' to '''R''', or '''9''' to '''8'''), or with the inclusion of carefully positioned black \"fixing screw\" dots that alter the appearance of letters on some [[vanity plate]]s.\n\nThe design has similarities with the [[FE-Schrift]] number-plate font which was introduced in Germany in 1994 and which has been mandatory there since 2000. However, the UK design remains more conventional in its character shapes.\n\n==== Special plates ====\nRegistrations having a combination of characters that are particularly appealing (resembling a name, for example) are auctioned each year. The first of these auctions was in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insidedvla.blog.gov.uk/2014/11/12/25-years-selling-personalised-registrations/|title=25 years selling personalised registrations|first=Damian|last=Lawson|publisher=DVLA|date=12 November 2014|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.numberplates.com/museum/auctions/14_12_89.asp|title=Number Plate Auction - December 1989|publisher=Numberplates.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nFor the 07 registration period a higher than usual number of Scottish 07 codes were retained as Select registrations for sale and an additional allocation of Tx letter pairs were released for use by the local offices in Scotland with the same allocation as the Sx letter pairs (for example Edinburgh with SK to SN allocated had TK to TN added){{ref label|scotland|a|a}}.<ref name=\"Newall\">{{cite book |last = Newall |first = L.H. |title = A History of Motor Vehicle Registration in the United Kingdom |edition = 3rd |year = 2008 |publisher = Newby Books |location = Scarborough |page = 302 |isbn = 978-1-872686-32-5 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 the [[Edinburgh]] DVLA office exceptionally issued <code>TN07</code> prefixed registrations for some vehicles, instead of the expected '<code>SN07</code>'.

Subject to certain conditions, number plates can be transferred between vehicles by the vehicle owner; some of these transfers involve tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds changing hands, because of the desirability of a specific letter/number combination.\n\n=== History ===\n\n==== Before 1932 ====\n[[File:United Kingdom license plate AH 72 Norfolk 1904-1932 Flickr - woody1778a.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Number plate displaying a vehicle registration mark created between 1903 and 1932]]\nThe first series of number plates was issued in [[Motor Car Act 1903|1903]] and ran until 1932, consisting of a one- or two-letter code followed by a sequence number from 1 to 9999.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nationalnumbers.co.uk/number-plate-history.htm |title = A Brief History Lesson on Licensing and Registrations |publisher = Nationalnumbers.co.uk |date = 30 November 1983 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> The code indicated the local authority in whose area the vehicle was registered.

London and [[Middlesex]] quickly took most codes with L and M as the first letter respectively, while [[Surrey]], initially allocated <code>P</code>, took many codes beginning with that letter.\n\nThe first mark to be issued in London was the simple, bold, <code>A 1</code> and this was registered to [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Earl Russell]].

This scheme placed a serial letter before the code, and had the sequence number run only to 999, thus restricting the number of characters in a registration to six. The first area to issue such marks was [[Staffordshire]] in July 1932 with <code>ARF&nbsp;1</code> etc.,<ref name=\"regnumbers\">{{cite web |url = http://www.fleetdata.co.uk/ukregistrations.html |title = British vehicle registration numbers |publisher = Fleetdata.co.uk |accessdate = 29 December 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100219132653/http://fleetdata.co.uk/ukregistrations.html |archivedate = 19 February 2010 }}</ref> and all other areas in England and Wales, plus most areas in Scotland, followed suit once they had issued all their two-letter registrations.\n\nI, Q, and Z were not used as serial letters, as the use of I and Z continued to be restricted to Ireland and Q was reserved for temporary imports, while the single-letter codes were left out of this scheme as a serial letter would have created a duplicate of an existing two-letter code. (The [[Vehicle registration plates of Ireland#History|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] later adopted this scheme in their own ways, and the latter still uses it.)\n\nIn some areas, the available marks within this scheme started to run out in the 1950s, and in those areas, what became known as \"reversed\" registrations \u2013 the letters coming after the numbers \u2013 were introduced. Staffordshire was again the first area to issue such registrations, starting with <code>1000&nbsp;E</code> in 1953. In most cases, the three-letter combinations (e.g. <code>1&nbsp;AHX</code> for [[Middlesex]]) would be issued first, while in later years some areas started with the one- and two-letter combinations and others issued all three at the same time. The ever-increasing popularity of the car meant that by the beginning of the 1960s, these registrations were also running out.\n\nSome three-letter combinations were not authorised for licensing use as they were deemed offensive. These included <code>ARS</code>, <code>BUM</code>, <code>GOD</code>, <code>JEW</code>, <code>SEX</code>, and <code>SOD</code>.<ref>http://www.fergusontractor.co.uk/infofiles/which/regmk.asp  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921180228/http://www.fergusontractor.co.uk/infofiles/which/regmk.asp |date=21 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.templeoftriumph.org/tsoa/TSOAJan72.pdf |first = Graham W. |last = Whitehead |title = Triumph Sells Record Number of Sportscars |journal = Triumph Sports Owners Association |volume = 18 |issue = 1, January 1972 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> <code>DUW</code> was issued in London for several months in 1934 before it was realised it was the Welsh for God, and withdrawn.<ref name=\"Newall\" />\nEven then, there were some registrations which would now be called cherished plates.

This used the scheme introduced in 1932, of a three-letter combination followed by a sequence number from 1 to 999, but also added a letter suffix, which initially changed on 1 January each year. An \"A\" suffix was thus used for 1963, \"B\" for 1964, etc. Middlesex was the first authority to adopt this scheme when it issued <code>AHX&nbsp;1A</code> in February 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pattle/nacc/arc0607.htm |title = UK registration marks from 1904 to August 2001 |publisher = The Moped Archive |accessdate = 29 December 2010 }}</ref> Most other areas followed suit during 1964, but some chose to stick to their own schemes up until 1 January 1965, when the letter suffix was made compulsory.\n\nAs well as yielding many more available numbers, it was a handy way for vehicle buyers to know the age of the vehicle immediately. However, the year letter changing on 1 January each year meant that car retailers soon started to notice that buyers would tend to wait until the New Year for the new letter to be issued, so that they could get a \"newer\" car. This led to major peaks and troughs in sales over the year, and to help flatten this out somewhat the industry lobbied to get the scheme changed, so that the change of year letter occurred on 1 August rather than 1 January. This was done in 1967, when \"E\" suffixes ran only from 1 January to 31 July, before \"F\" suffixes commenced on 1 August.\n\nAt the beginning, plates were black with white or silver characters. Reflective plates were introduced in 1969 and were white on the front and yellow on the rear with black characters.\n\nIn October 1974, responsibility for issuing registrations was transferred from local and regional authorities to specialist Local Vehicle Licensing Offices (LVLOs) or Vehicle Registration Offices (VROs) run by the DVLA. Most of the two-letter area codes allocated during the first scheme continued in their respective areas, albeit now indicating the nearest LVLO/VRO rather than the local or regional authority. However, the decision to streamline the allocations of these codes meant that some were transferred to new areas. For instance, the former [[Suffolk]] code <code>CF</code> was transferred to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], while the former [[Edinburgh]] code <code>WS</code> was re-allocated to [[Bristol]].<ref name=\"regnumbers\" />\n\n==== 1983 to 2001 ====\nBy 1982, the year suffixes had reached Y and so from 1983 onwards the sequence was reversed again, so that the year letter \u2013 starting again at \"A\" \u2014 preceded the numbers then the letters of the registration. The available range was then <code>A21&nbsp;AAA</code> to <code>Y999&nbsp;YYY</code>, the numbers 1\u201320 being held back for the government's proposed, and later implemented, DVLA select registration sales scheme.\nTowards the mid-1990s there was some discussion about introducing a unified scheme for Europe, which would also incorporate the country code of origin of the vehicle, but after much debate such a scheme was not adopted because of lack of countries willing to participate.\n[[File:Q-plate on construction vehicle.jpg|thumb|180px|A construction vehicle bearing a Q number plate, August 2016, UK]]\nThe changes in 1983 also brought the letter Q into use \u2013 although on a very small and limited scale. It was used on vehicles of indeterminate age, such as those assembled from kits, substantial rebuilds, or imported vehicles where the documentation is insufficient to determine the age. There was a marked increase in the use of Q registrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fuelled by car crime.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Many stolen vehicles had false identities given to them, and when this was discovered and the original identity could not be determined, a Q registration would be issued to such vehicle. It was seen as an aid to consumer protection. Due to indeterminate age, origin and specification of Q registration vehicles, most motor insurers are reluctant to offer cover for these 'Q-plate' vehicles.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the range of available numbers was once again starting to run out, exacerbated by a move to biannual changes in registration letters (March and September) in 1999 to smooth out the bulge in registrations every August, so a new scheme needed to be adopted. It was decided to research a system that would be easier for [[traffic collision|crash]] or vehicle related crime witnesses to remember and clearer to read, yet still fit within a normal standard plate size.\n\n==== Year identifiers ====\nIn order to avoid any confusion, the letters I, O, Q, U and Z have never been issued as year identifiers: I because of its similarity to the numeral 1; O and Q because of similarity to a zero; U because of similarity to the letter V; and Z because of similarity to the numeral 2.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n||'''Suffix letter series 1963\u201383'''||'''Prefix letter series 1983\u20132001'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Letter\n! scope=\"col\" | Dates of issue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| February 1963<ref name=\"parkers-77\">{{citation |title = Parker's Car Price Guide |date = September 1977 }}</ref> \u2013 31 December 1963\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| 1 January 1964 \u2013 31 December 1964\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| 1 January 1965 \u2013 31 December 1965\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D\n| 1 January 1966 \u2013 31 December 1966\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E\n| 1 January 1967 \u2013 31 July 1967\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F\n| 1 August 1967 \u2013 31 July 1968\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G\n| 1 August 1968 \u2013 31 July 1969\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | H\n| 1 August 1969 \u2013 31 July 1970\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | J\n| 1 August 1970 \u2013 31 July 1971\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | K\n| 1 August 1971 \u2013 31 July 1972\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | L\n| 1 August 1972 \u2013 31 July 1973\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | M\n| 1 August 1973 \u2013 31 July 1974\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | N\n| 1 August 1974 \u2013 31 July 1975\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | P\n| 1 August 1975 \u2013 31 July 1976\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | R\n| 1 August 1976 \u2013 31 July 1977\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | S\n| 1 August 1977 \u2013 31 July 1978\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\n| 1 August 1978 \u2013 31 July 1979\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| 1 August 1979 \u2013 31 July 1980\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | W\n| 1 August 1980 \u2013 31 July 1981\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | X\n| 1 August 1981 \u2013 31 July 1982\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Y\n| 1 August 1982 \u2013 31 July 1983\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Letter\n! scope=\"col\" | Dates of issue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| 1 August 1983 \u2013 31 July 1984\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| 1 August 1984 \u2013 31 July 1985\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| 1 August 1985 \u2013 31 July 1986\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D\n| 1 August 1986 \u2013 31 July 1987\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E\n| 1 August 1987 \u2013 31 July 1988\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F\n| 1 August 1988 \u2013 31 July 1989\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G\n| 1 August 1989 \u2013 31 July 1990\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | H\n| 1 August 1990 \u2013 31 July 1991\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | J\n| 1 August 1991 \u2013 31 July 1992\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | K\n| 1 August 1992 \u2013 31 July 1993\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | L\n| 1 August 1993 \u2013 31 July 1994\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | M\n| 1 August 1994 \u2013 31 July 1995\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | N\n| 1 August 1995 \u2013 31 July 1996\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | P\n| 1 August 1996 \u2013 31 July 1997\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | R\n| 1 August 1997 \u2013 31 July 1998\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | S\n| 1 August 1998 \u2013 28 February 1999\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\n| 1 March 1999 \u2013 31 August 1999\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| 1 September 1999 \u2013 29 February 2000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | W\n| 1 March 2000 \u2013 31 August 2000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | X\n| 1 September 2000 \u2013 28 February 2001\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Y\n| 1 March 2001 \u2013 31 August 2001\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Pre-2001 codes ====\n\nNormally the last two letters would indicate where the car was initially registered.

Note that pre-2001 number plates where the last two letters indicate the original district of registration is not the same as the first two letters of the post-2001 system so, for example, pre 2001 AB is Worcester, whereas post 2001 AB is Peterborough.\n\nFor the list of Northern Ireland codes, see the [[Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] section of this article.

All possible codes had been allocated by 1957, following which reversed sequences were introduced, the first county to do so being [[County Antrim|Antrim]] in January 1958 with <code>1&nbsp;IA</code>. These reversed sequences were completed quickly, leading to the introduction of the current \"<code>AXX&nbsp;1234</code>\" format in January 1966, where \"<code>XX</code>\" is the county code and \"<code>A</code>\" is a serial letter. This format allowed capacity to be increased. Each county adopted it once they had completed their reversed sequences, the last one to do so being [[County Londonderry]] in October 1973 with <code>AIW&nbsp;1</code>. From November 1985, the first 100 numbers of each series were withheld for use as cherished registrations. From April 1989, the numbers 101-999 were also withheld in this way. Even multiples of 1000 and 1111 (\"four-of-a-kind\") are deemed cherished by the DVLA and thus withheld. Each series ends at 9998 and follows on to the next letter/number combination in the series. \n\nWhen the [[Administrative counties of Ireland|administrative counties of Northern Ireland]] were dissolved in 1972, the responsibility for issuing registrations was transferred to the [[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|NI Ministry of Home Affairs]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisro/1973/337/contents/made|title=The Vehicles Excise (Transfer of Functions) (Supplementary Provisions) Order (Northern Ireland) 1973|work=[[Legislation.gov.uk]]|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> and later the [[Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland)|Department of the Environment NI]].

In the UK, sales of private plates via the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency exceeded \u00a3100&nbsp;million per annum for the first time in 2016. Since 1989 the DVLA has made a total of \u00a32&nbsp;billion from selling private plates. While the wealthy may spend more on a private plate than on their personal vehicle, not all car owners are attracted to private plates. This has not affected number plates from appreciating thousands in value each year.\n\nRegistration <code>1</code> sold for \u00a37.25&nbsp;million and is the highest price paid for a plate \u2013 in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

Eligible officials are required to be accredited by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) who liaise with Specialist Registrations at the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) for issuance. Guidance document: INF267 (4/18) has been produced by the DVLA for accredited officials.\n\nThe distinguishing format is three numbers, space, letter D or X, space and three numbers. The letter D is predominately used for vehicles operated in or around the capital of London with the letter X allocated to vehicles outside London and for international organisations,{{fact|date=November 2018}} unless otherwise stated by bilateral treaty or arrangement. The first group of three numbers identifies the country or international organisation. The second group of three numbers is a serial number sequence starting at 101 for diplomats, 400 for non-diplomatic staff of international organisations, and 700 upwards for consular or other non-diplomatic staff. For example: 101 D 101 identifies the first registration allocated to the Afghanistan embassy and 900 X 400 is a registration allocated to the Commonwealth Secretariat. \n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\"\n|- size=\"40\"  style=\"font-size:14pt; text-align:center; color:black;\"\n|  style=\"background:white; \"| 101 D 101\n|  style=\"background:yellow; \"| 101 D 101\n|-  style=\"font-size:14pt; text-align:center; color:black;\"\n|  style=\"background:white; \"| 900 X 400\n|  style=\"background:yellow; \"| 900 X 400\n|}\n</center>\n\nHonorary consuls are not entitled under UK law to diplomatic vehicle registrations and/or diplomatic driving permits.\n\nA limited number of \"flag\" registrations, bearing a similar format to earlier civilian registrations, have been issued to embassies and high commissions for use instead of a \"D\" or \"X\" registration on its vehicles. For example: United States' embassy is allowed to use the registration USA 1; Zimbabwe's embassy ZIM 1; Jamaica's high commission JAM 1 and South Korea's embassy ROK 1 \u2013 'Republic of Korea'. The North Korean embassy, however, had to buy a vanity plate: PRK 1D.{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\nDiplomats are exempt from payment of vehicle tax (motor car road fund licence duty).\n\n=== Cherished marks (personal, vanity or private number plates) ===\nBy default, a UK registration plate will accompany a vehicle throughout the vehicle's lifetime. There is no requirement to re-register a vehicle when moving to a new part of the country and no requirement that the number be changed when ownership of the vehicle changes. It is, however, possible for another registration number to be transferred, replacing the one originally issued, where owners wish to have a \"[[vanity plate]]\" (sometimes referred to as a \"cherished\" registration) displaying, for instance, their initials. Registration numbers may also be replaced simply to disguise the actual age of the vehicle.\n\nAccording to information on the government DVLA website:\n\n\"Just remember you can make your vehicle look as old as you wish but you can not make it look newer than it is. For example you cannot put a Y registration number on a T registered vehicle but you could choose any prefix range from an A to a T. Each registration has an issue date which is what you must check to ensure you don't make your vehicle appear newer than it is.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/terms/terms-of-sale.html |title = Personalised Registrations: Terms & Conditions of Sale |publisher = [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> However, you are able to put 1955 registered private number plates on a 1949 registered vehicle as there is no year indicator to determine the age of release.\n\nAs many vehicles registered before 1963 have been scrapped, some of their \"dateless\" pre-1963 registration numbers have been transferred to other vehicles as personal plates. They can be valuable, and can also be used to conceal the age of an older vehicle. Many vintage and classic cars no longer bear their original index marks due to the owners being offered high premiums for the desirable registrations. In addition Northern Irish registrations are also regarded as \"dateless\" and are often transferred to vehicles outside Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"New Reg\">{{cite web |title = Northern Irish Registrations |url = http://www.newreg.co.uk/irish-number-plates/ |accessdate = 1 July 2014 }}</ref> Touring coaches often operate in other parts of the UK with registration numbers originally issued in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe DVLA's Personalised Registrations service also allows the purchase and transfer of registration numbers directly from the DVLA.<ref name=\"dvla-pr\">{{cite web |title = DVLA Personalised Registrations |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/ |work = [[Directgov]] |publisher = [[DVLA]] |accessdate = 10 September 2010 }}</ref> Many private dealers act as agents for DVLA issues (and sell DVLA numbers for more than the DVLA asking price, which many buyers do not realise), and also hold their own private stock of dateless registrations and other cherished marks. The DVLA however can only offer for sale registrations that have never previously been issued and thus have a limited offering and limited scope.\n\n=== State vehicles used by the reigning monarch ===\nMotor cars used by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] on official business, which are ({{As of|2017|lc=on}}) all [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royces]] or [[Bentley]]s built to special specifications, do not carry number plates.<ref name=\"royalcars\"/> The monarch's private vehicles carry number plates.\n\n=== Other registration plates ===\n* Tax free export in 1970s had red borders around the plate.\n* United Kingdom American Exchange plates had the prefix \"UKAX\".\n* Some Republic of Ireland number plates have been registered in various motor tax offices in the UK.

Some UK embassy vehicles have I or Z in their number plates e.g. CZE (Dublin) 1, PHI (Tipperary) 1, which have originated in the Irish system.

Some people had street address numbers made up to motor-vehicle standards for their houses. From 2001 plates sold in England and Wales had to be provided by a supplier on the DVLA's Register of Number Plate Suppliers (RNPS) as specified in British Standard BSAU145d. The supplier needs to confirm that the customer is the registered keeper or other authorised person and verify their identity.<ref name=\"directgovhowto\" /> The name and postcode of the supplier must be shown at the bottom of the plate.<ref name=\"v796\" /> Number plates in the UK are usually flat and made of plastic; embossed aluminium plates are available from some suppliers. These rules are generally described as onerous, particularly to company car drivers who do not hold any of the required paperwork themselves (such items usually being stored by a fleet manager or lease hire company).\n\nRegistered number plate suppliers must keep records including the documents produced by their customers; they can be required to be shown to the police, although in reality this has seldom happened. The [[Department for Transport]] holds a full list of suppliers.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.gov.uk/number-plate-supplier |title = Find your nearest number plate supplier |work = gov.uk |year = 2015 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\nSome companies, particularly those based online, sell number plates described as \"show plates\" or \"not for road use\", which may not satisfy the requirements of BSAU145d.

It is compulsory for [[motor vehicles]] used on public roads to display [[vehicle registration plate]]s, with the exception of vehicles of the reigning monarch used on official business.<ref name=\"royalcars\">{{cite web |url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Transport/Cars.aspx |title = The Royal Household \u2013 Transport \u2013 Cars |author = The Royal Household |accessdate = 28 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023110/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Transport/Cars.aspx|archivedate=14 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Motor Car Act 1903]], which came into force on 1 January 1904, required all motor vehicles to be entered on an official [[vehicle register]], and to carry alphanumeric plates. The Act was passed in order that vehicles could be easily traced in the event of an accident, contravention of the law or any other incident. Vehicle registration alphanumeric plates in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law. Front plates are white, whereas rear plates are yellow.\n\nWithin the UK itself, there are two systems: one for [[Great Britain]], which dates from 2001, and another for [[Northern Ireland]], which is similar to the original 1904 system. Both systems are administered by the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] (DVLA) in [[Swansea]]. Until July 2014, Northern Ireland's system was administered by the [[Driver and Vehicle Agency]] (DVA) in [[Coleraine]], which had the same status as the DVLA. Other schemes relating to the UK are also listed below. The international vehicle registration code for the United Kingdom is '''GB''' (Great Britain and Northern Ireland).\n\n== Standard requirements ==\n[[File:United Kingdom license plate KAF 762L 1963.jpg|thumb|200px|Black number plates with white or silver characters are permitted on vehicles constructed over 40 years ago, if registered under the Historic Vehicle taxation class.

The letters '''I''' and '''Q''' are excluded from the three-letter sequence, as are combinations that may appear offensive (including those in foreign languages). Due to batch allocation of new registration marks to dealers, it is common for cars with \"neighbouring\" letter sequences to be of the same manufacturer.\n\nThis scheme has three particular advantages:\n* A buyer of a second-hand vehicle can in theory determine the year of first registration of the vehicle without having to look it up. However, a vehicle is permitted to display a number plate where the age identifier is older (but ''not'' newer) than the vehicle. The wide awareness of how the \"age identifier\" works has led to it being used in advertising by used-car showrooms instead of simply stating a year.\n* In the case of a police investigation of an accident or vehicle-related crime, witnesses usually remember the initial area code letters \u2013 it is then quite simple to narrow down suspect vehicles to a much smaller number by checking the authority's database without having to know the full number.<ref>{{citation |url = http://www.speedyreg.co.uk/platehistory |title = History of Number Plates |publisher = Speedy Registrations Co.

EU member states that require foreign vehicles to display a distinguishing sign of the country of origin (e.g. 'GB' for the United Kingdom) are obliged by Article 3 of EU Regulation No. 2411/98 to accept this standard design as a distinguishing sign when displayed on a vehicle registered in another member state, making a separate sign unnecessary for vehicles registered in the EU.

The width of the previous font was condensed from 57&nbsp;mm to 50&nbsp;mm to allow space for the extra letter and the optional blue EU strip. The letter '''O''' and the digit '''0''' are intentionally identical, as are the letter '''I''' and digit '''1'''. But the typeface accentuates the differences between characters such as '''8''' and '''B''', or '''D''' and '''0''', with [[slab serif]]s to improve the legibility of a plate from a distance. This is especially useful for the [[automatic number plate recognition]] software of [[speed cameras]] and [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]. This accentuation also discourages the tampering that is sometimes practised with the use of black [[insulating tape]] or paint to change letter forms (such as '''P''' to '''R''', or '''9''' to '''8'''), or with the inclusion of carefully positioned black \"fixing screw\" dots that alter the appearance of letters on some [[vanity plate]]s.\n\nThe design has similarities with the [[FE-Schrift]] number-plate font which was introduced in Germany in 1994 and which has been mandatory there since 2000. However, the UK design remains more conventional in its character shapes.\n\n==== Special plates ====\nRegistrations having a combination of characters that are particularly appealing (resembling a name, for example) are auctioned each year. The first of these auctions was in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insidedvla.blog.gov.uk/2014/11/12/25-years-selling-personalised-registrations/|title=25 years selling personalised registrations|first=Damian|last=Lawson|publisher=DVLA|date=12 November 2014|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.numberplates.com/museum/auctions/14_12_89.asp|title=Number Plate Auction - December 1989|publisher=Numberplates.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nFor the 07 registration period a higher than usual number of Scottish 07 codes were retained as Select registrations for sale and an additional allocation of Tx letter pairs were released for use by the local offices in Scotland with the same allocation as the Sx letter pairs (for example Edinburgh with SK to SN allocated had TK to TN added){{ref label|scotland|a|a}}.<ref name=\"Newall\">{{cite book |last = Newall |first = L.H. |title = A History of Motor Vehicle Registration in the United Kingdom |edition = 3rd |year = 2008 |publisher = Newby Books |location = Scarborough |page = 302 |isbn = 978-1-872686-32-5 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 the [[Edinburgh]] DVLA office exceptionally issued <code>TN07</code> prefixed registrations for some vehicles, instead of the expected '<code>SN07</code>'.

Subject to certain conditions, number plates can be transferred between vehicles by the vehicle owner; some of these transfers involve tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds changing hands, because of the desirability of a specific letter/number combination.\n\n=== History ===\n\n==== Before 1932 ====\n[[File:United Kingdom license plate AH 72 Norfolk 1904-1932 Flickr - woody1778a.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Number plate displaying a vehicle registration mark created between 1903 and 1932]]\nThe first series of number plates was issued in [[Motor Car Act 1903|1903]] and ran until 1932, consisting of a one- or two-letter code followed by a sequence number from 1 to 9999.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nationalnumbers.co.uk/number-plate-history.htm |title = A Brief History Lesson on Licensing and Registrations |publisher = Nationalnumbers.co.uk |date = 30 November 1983 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> The code indicated the local authority in whose area the vehicle was registered.

London and [[Middlesex]] quickly took most codes with L and M as the first letter respectively, while [[Surrey]], initially allocated <code>P</code>, took many codes beginning with that letter.\n\nThe first mark to be issued in London was the simple, bold, <code>A 1</code> and this was registered to [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Earl Russell]].

(The [[Vehicle registration plates of Ireland#History|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] later adopted this scheme in their own ways, and the latter still uses it.)\n\nIn some areas, the available marks within this scheme started to run out in the 1950s, and in those areas, what became known as \"reversed\" registrations \u2013 the letters coming after the numbers \u2013 were introduced. Staffordshire was again the first area to issue such registrations, starting with <code>1000&nbsp;E</code> in 1953. In most cases, the three-letter combinations (e.g. <code>1&nbsp;AHX</code> for [[Middlesex]]) would be issued first, while in later years some areas started with the one- and two-letter combinations and others issued all three at the same time. The ever-increasing popularity of the car meant that by the beginning of the 1960s, these registrations were also running out.\n\nSome three-letter combinations were not authorised for licensing use as they were deemed offensive. These included <code>ARS</code>, <code>BUM</code>, <code>GOD</code>, <code>JEW</code>, <code>SEX</code>, and <code>SOD</code>.<ref>http://www.fergusontractor.co.uk/infofiles/which/regmk.asp  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921180228/http://www.fergusontractor.co.uk/infofiles/which/regmk.asp |date=21 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.templeoftriumph.org/tsoa/TSOAJan72.pdf |first = Graham W. |last = Whitehead |title = Triumph Sells Record Number of Sportscars |journal = Triumph Sports Owners Association |volume = 18 |issue = 1, January 1972 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> <code>DUW</code> was issued in London for several months in 1934 before it was realised it was the Welsh for God, and withdrawn.<ref name=\"Newall\" />\nEven then, there were some registrations which would now be called cherished plates. One was RAD10 (BBC) and another was IND1A (Indian high commission).\n\n==== 1963 to 1982 ====\nIn August 1962, an attempt was made to create a national scheme to alleviate the problem of registrations running out. This used the scheme introduced in 1932, of a three-letter combination followed by a sequence number from 1 to 999, but also added a letter suffix, which initially changed on 1 January each year. An \"A\" suffix was thus used for 1963, \"B\" for 1964, etc. Middlesex was the first authority to adopt this scheme when it issued <code>AHX&nbsp;1A</code> in February 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pattle/nacc/arc0607.htm |title = UK registration marks from 1904 to August 2001 |publisher = The Moped Archive |accessdate = 29 December 2010 }}</ref> Most other areas followed suit during 1964, but some chose to stick to their own schemes up until 1 January 1965, when the letter suffix was made compulsory.\n\nAs well as yielding many more available numbers, it was a handy way for vehicle buyers to know the age of the vehicle immediately. However, the year letter changing on 1 January each year meant that car retailers soon started to notice that buyers would tend to wait until the New Year for the new letter to be issued, so that they could get a \"newer\" car. This led to major peaks and troughs in sales over the year, and to help flatten this out somewhat the industry lobbied to get the scheme changed, so that the change of year letter occurred on 1 August rather than 1 January. This was done in 1967, when \"E\" suffixes ran only from 1 January to 31 July, before \"F\" suffixes commenced on 1 August.\n\nAt the beginning, plates were black with white or silver characters. Reflective plates were introduced in 1969 and were white on the front and yellow on the rear with black characters.\n\nIn October 1974, responsibility for issuing registrations was transferred from local and regional authorities to specialist Local Vehicle Licensing Offices (LVLOs) or Vehicle Registration Offices (VROs) run by the DVLA. Most of the two-letter area codes allocated during the first scheme continued in their respective areas, albeit now indicating the nearest LVLO/VRO rather than the local or regional authority. However, the decision to streamline the allocations of these codes meant that some were transferred to new areas. For instance, the former [[Suffolk]] code <code>CF</code> was transferred to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], while the former [[Edinburgh]] code <code>WS</code> was re-allocated to [[Bristol]].<ref name=\"regnumbers\" />\n\n==== 1983 to 2001 ====\nBy 1982, the year suffixes had reached Y and so from 1983 onwards the sequence was reversed again, so that the year letter \u2013 starting again at \"A\" \u2014 preceded the numbers then the letters of the registration. The available range was then <code>A21&nbsp;AAA</code> to <code>Y999&nbsp;YYY</code>, the numbers 1\u201320 being held back for the government's proposed, and later implemented, DVLA select registration sales scheme.\nTowards the mid-1990s there was some discussion about introducing a unified scheme for Europe, which would also incorporate the country code of origin of the vehicle, but after much debate such a scheme was not adopted because of lack of countries willing to participate.\n[[File:Q-plate on construction vehicle.jpg|thumb|180px|A construction vehicle bearing a Q number plate, August 2016, UK]]\nThe changes in 1983 also brought the letter Q into use \u2013 although on a very small and limited scale. It was used on vehicles of indeterminate age, such as those assembled from kits, substantial rebuilds, or imported vehicles where the documentation is insufficient to determine the age. There was a marked increase in the use of Q registrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fuelled by car crime.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Many stolen vehicles had false identities given to them, and when this was discovered and the original identity could not be determined, a Q registration would be issued to such vehicle. It was seen as an aid to consumer protection. Due to indeterminate age, origin and specification of Q registration vehicles, most motor insurers are reluctant to offer cover for these 'Q-plate' vehicles.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the range of available numbers was once again starting to run out, exacerbated by a move to biannual changes in registration letters (March and September) in 1999 to smooth out the bulge in registrations every August, so a new scheme needed to be adopted. It was decided to research a system that would be easier for [[traffic collision|crash]] or vehicle related crime witnesses to remember and clearer to read, yet still fit within a normal standard plate size.\n\n==== Year identifiers ====\nIn order to avoid any confusion, the letters I, O, Q, U and Z have never been issued as year identifiers: I because of its similarity to the numeral 1; O and Q because of similarity to a zero; U because of similarity to the letter V; and Z because of similarity to the numeral 2.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n||'''Suffix letter series 1963\u201383'''||'''Prefix letter series 1983\u20132001'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Letter\n! scope=\"col\" | Dates of issue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| February 1963<ref name=\"parkers-77\">{{citation |title = Parker's Car Price Guide |date = September 1977 }}</ref> \u2013 31 December 1963\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| 1 January 1964 \u2013 31 December 1964\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| 1 January 1965 \u2013 31 December 1965\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D\n| 1 January 1966 \u2013 31 December 1966\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E\n| 1 January 1967 \u2013 31 July 1967\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F\n| 1 August 1967 \u2013 31 July 1968\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G\n| 1 August 1968 \u2013 31 July 1969\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | H\n| 1 August 1969 \u2013 31 July 1970\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | J\n| 1 August 1970 \u2013 31 July 1971\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | K\n| 1 August 1971 \u2013 31 July 1972\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | L\n| 1 August 1972 \u2013 31 July 1973\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | M\n| 1 August 1973 \u2013 31 July 1974\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | N\n| 1 August 1974 \u2013 31 July 1975\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | P\n| 1 August 1975 \u2013 31 July 1976\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | R\n| 1 August 1976 \u2013 31 July 1977\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | S\n| 1 August 1977 \u2013 31 July 1978\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\n| 1 August 1978 \u2013 31 July 1979\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| 1 August 1979 \u2013 31 July 1980\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | W\n| 1 August 1980 \u2013 31 July 1981\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | X\n| 1 August 1981 \u2013 31 July 1982\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Y\n| 1 August 1982 \u2013 31 July 1983\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Letter\n! scope=\"col\" | Dates of issue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| 1 August 1983 \u2013 31 July 1984\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| 1 August 1984 \u2013 31 July 1985\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| 1 August 1985 \u2013 31 July 1986\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D\n| 1 August 1986 \u2013 31 July 1987\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E\n| 1 August 1987 \u2013 31 July 1988\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F\n| 1 August 1988 \u2013 31 July 1989\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G\n| 1 August 1989 \u2013 31 July 1990\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | H\n| 1 August 1990 \u2013 31 July 1991\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | J\n| 1 August 1991 \u2013 31 July 1992\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | K\n| 1 August 1992 \u2013 31 July 1993\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | L\n| 1 August 1993 \u2013 31 July 1994\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | M\n| 1 August 1994 \u2013 31 July 1995\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | N\n| 1 August 1995 \u2013 31 July 1996\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | P\n| 1 August 1996 \u2013 31 July 1997\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | R\n| 1 August 1997 \u2013 31 July 1998\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | S\n| 1 August 1998 \u2013 28 February 1999\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\n| 1 March 1999 \u2013 31 August 1999\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| 1 September 1999 \u2013 29 February 2000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | W\n| 1 March 2000 \u2013 31 August 2000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | X\n| 1 September 2000 \u2013 28 February 2001\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Y\n| 1 March 2001 \u2013 31 August 2001\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Pre-2001 codes ====\n\nNormally the last two letters would indicate where the car was initially registered.

This particular plate uses an old-style font.]]\n\nNorthern Ireland uses a modified version of the national system initiated for the whole of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1903, with two-letter county and city codes featuring the letters I or Z representing [[Ireland]]. \n\nAs in Great Britain, each code originally ran from 1 to 9999, and when one was completed, another was allocated. All possible codes had been allocated by 1957, following which reversed sequences were introduced, the first county to do so being [[County Antrim|Antrim]] in January 1958 with <code>1&nbsp;IA</code>. These reversed sequences were completed quickly, leading to the introduction of the current \"<code>AXX&nbsp;1234</code>\" format in January 1966, where \"<code>XX</code>\" is the county code and \"<code>A</code>\" is a serial letter. This format allowed capacity to be increased. Each county adopted it once they had completed their reversed sequences, the last one to do so being [[County Londonderry]] in October 1973 with <code>AIW&nbsp;1</code>. From November 1985, the first 100 numbers of each series were withheld for use as cherished registrations. From April 1989, the numbers 101-999 were also withheld in this way. Even multiples of 1000 and 1111 (\"four-of-a-kind\") are deemed cherished by the DVLA and thus withheld. Each series ends at 9998 and follows on to the next letter/number combination in the series. \n\nWhen the [[Administrative counties of Ireland|administrative counties of Northern Ireland]] were dissolved in 1972, the responsibility for issuing registrations was transferred to the [[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|NI Ministry of Home Affairs]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisro/1973/337/contents/made|title=The Vehicles Excise (Transfer of Functions) (Supplementary Provisions) Order (Northern Ireland) 1973|work=[[Legislation.gov.uk]]|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> and later the [[Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland)|Department of the Environment NI]]. From 21 July 2014, vehicle registration in Northern Ireland became the responsibility of the DVLA in Swansea. The pre-1972 format of Northern Ireland registration plates continues unchanged.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/vehicle-registration-from-21-july-2014 |title = Vehicle registration from 21 July 2014 |publisher = nidirect |accessdate = 15 August 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916004242/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/vehicle-registration-from-21-july-2014 |archive-date = 16 September 2014 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Most expensive plates ==\nAs popularity grows, the prices reached for the most expensive plates have increased with many motorists attracted by the investment potential as well as vanity. In the UK, sales of private plates via the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency exceeded \u00a3100&nbsp;million per annum for the first time in 2016. Since 1989 the DVLA has made a total of \u00a32&nbsp;billion from selling private plates. While the wealthy may spend more on a private plate than on their personal vehicle, not all car owners are attracted to private plates. This has not affected number plates from appreciating thousands in value each year.\n\nRegistration <code>1</code> sold for \u00a37.25&nbsp;million and is the highest price paid for a plate \u2013 in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It was purchased by Abu Dhabi businessman Saeed Abdul Ghaffar Khouri in 2008.

Other popular plates include BO55 EGO. It has previously gone on auction in 2016 where the owner rejected the highest asking of \u00a3127,000.\n\nThe popularity of race-related plates led the [[Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency]] to make a motor racing game to mark the profits it has made from the sales of private plates. The celebration took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2010.<ref name=\"racergame\">{{cite web |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/goodwood2010/ |title = dvla's good wood soapbox reader game |author = dvlaregistrations |date = 2010}}</ref> On 25 January 2008 the registration <code>F1</code> sold for \u00a3440,000 to Bradford Car design [[entrepreneur]] Afzal Kahn.

Since 1970, all trade plates have used the red-on-white format.

Eligible officials are required to be accredited by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) who liaise with Specialist Registrations at the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) for issuance. Guidance document: INF267 (4/18) has been produced by the DVLA for accredited officials.\n\nThe distinguishing format is three numbers, space, letter D or X, space and three numbers. The letter D is predominately used for vehicles operated in or around the capital of London with the letter X allocated to vehicles outside London and for international organisations,{{fact|date=November 2018}} unless otherwise stated by bilateral treaty or arrangement. The first group of three numbers identifies the country or international organisation. The second group of three numbers is a serial number sequence starting at 101 for diplomats, 400 for non-diplomatic staff of international organisations, and 700 upwards for consular or other non-diplomatic staff. For example: 101 D 101 identifies the first registration allocated to the Afghanistan embassy and 900 X 400 is a registration allocated to the Commonwealth Secretariat. \n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\"\n|- size=\"40\"  style=\"font-size:14pt; text-align:center; color:black;\"\n|  style=\"background:white; \"| 101 D 101\n|  style=\"background:yellow; \"| 101 D 101\n|-  style=\"font-size:14pt; text-align:center; color:black;\"\n|  style=\"background:white; \"| 900 X 400\n|  style=\"background:yellow; \"| 900 X 400\n|}\n</center>\n\nHonorary consuls are not entitled under UK law to diplomatic vehicle registrations and/or diplomatic driving permits.\n\nA limited number of \"flag\" registrations, bearing a similar format to earlier civilian registrations, have been issued to embassies and high commissions for use instead of a \"D\" or \"X\" registration on its vehicles. For example: United States' embassy is allowed to use the registration USA 1; Zimbabwe's embassy ZIM 1; Jamaica's high commission JAM 1 and South Korea's embassy ROK 1 \u2013 'Republic of Korea'. The North Korean embassy, however, had to buy a vanity plate: PRK 1D.{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\nDiplomats are exempt from payment of vehicle tax (motor car road fund licence duty).\n\n=== Cherished marks (personal, vanity or private number plates) ===\nBy default, a UK registration plate will accompany a vehicle throughout the vehicle's lifetime. There is no requirement to re-register a vehicle when moving to a new part of the country and no requirement that the number be changed when ownership of the vehicle changes. It is, however, possible for another registration number to be transferred, replacing the one originally issued, where owners wish to have a \"[[vanity plate]]\" (sometimes referred to as a \"cherished\" registration) displaying, for instance, their initials. Registration numbers may also be replaced simply to disguise the actual age of the vehicle.\n\nAccording to information on the government DVLA website:\n\n\"Just remember you can make your vehicle look as old as you wish but you can not make it look newer than it is. For example you cannot put a Y registration number on a T registered vehicle but you could choose any prefix range from an A to a T. Each registration has an issue date which is what you must check to ensure you don't make your vehicle appear newer than it is.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/terms/terms-of-sale.html |title = Personalised Registrations: Terms & Conditions of Sale |publisher = [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> However, you are able to put 1955 registered private number plates on a 1949 registered vehicle as there is no year indicator to determine the age of release.\n\nAs many vehicles registered before 1963 have been scrapped, some of their \"dateless\" pre-1963 registration numbers have been transferred to other vehicles as personal plates. They can be valuable, and can also be used to conceal the age of an older vehicle. Many vintage and classic cars no longer bear their original index marks due to the owners being offered high premiums for the desirable registrations. In addition Northern Irish registrations are also regarded as \"dateless\" and are often transferred to vehicles outside Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"New Reg\">{{cite web |title = Northern Irish Registrations |url = http://www.newreg.co.uk/irish-number-plates/ |accessdate = 1 July 2014 }}</ref> Touring coaches often operate in other parts of the UK with registration numbers originally issued in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe DVLA's Personalised Registrations service also allows the purchase and transfer of registration numbers directly from the DVLA.<ref name=\"dvla-pr\">{{cite web |title = DVLA Personalised Registrations |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/ |work = [[Directgov]] |publisher = [[DVLA]] |accessdate = 10 September 2010 }}</ref> Many private dealers act as agents for DVLA issues (and sell DVLA numbers for more than the DVLA asking price, which many buyers do not realise), and also hold their own private stock of dateless registrations and other cherished marks. The DVLA however can only offer for sale registrations that have never previously been issued and thus have a limited offering and limited scope.\n\n=== State vehicles used by the reigning monarch ===\nMotor cars used by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] on official business, which are ({{As of|2017|lc=on}}) all [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royces]] or [[Bentley]]s built to special specifications, do not carry number plates.<ref name=\"royalcars\"/> The monarch's private vehicles carry number plates.\n\n=== Other registration plates ===\n* Tax free export in 1970s had red borders around the plate.\n* United Kingdom American Exchange plates had the prefix \"UKAX\".\n* Some Republic of Ireland number plates have been registered in various motor tax offices in the UK.

Vehicles registered in Ireland under the new system (87 onwards) and which are exported to the UK must de-register their new Irish county (or in many cases, their Irish export ZZ 5 digit plate) with the DVLA who will issue them with a new UK number.\n\n== Fraudulent use ==\nCriminals sometimes use copies of number plates legitimately used on a vehicle of identical type and colour to the one used, known as \"cloning\", to avoid being identified.<ref>[http://www.nationalnumbers.co.uk/articles/man-jailed-for-using-fake-plates-on-stolen-cars-2570] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140117135341/http://www.nationalnumbers.co.uk/articles/man-jailed-for-using-fake-plates-on-stolen-cars-2570|date=17 January 2014}}</ref> A routine police computer check shows the plate matching the type of vehicle and does not appear suspicious.\n\nThe UK Government introduced on 1 August 2008 regulations requiring the production of personal identification and vehicle registration documents when having number plates made by a retailer.<ref name=\"directgovhowto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/BuyingAndSellingAVehicle/PersonalisedRegAndNumberPlates/DG_4022573 |title = How to get a number plate made up |author = Directgov |accessdate = 28 September 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205022837/http://www.direct.gov.uk./en/Motoring/BuyingAndSellingAVehicle/PersonalisedRegAndNumberPlates/DG_4022573 |archive-date = 5 December 2008 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The organisation that makes the plate is required to display their name and postcode, usually in small print at bottom centre, to aid in tracing false plates and their purchaser.<ref name=\"v796\" /> This requirement was introduced in 2001 when the new character style and two-digit year identifier came into force, and applies to all registration plates made after that date regardless of the year of the vehicle.\n\n== Registration plate suppliers ==\nNumber plates were initially made by the motor vehicle's original supplier, and replacement plates meeting standards could be made by anybody. Some people had street address numbers made up to motor-vehicle standards for their houses. From 2001 plates sold in England and Wales had to be provided by a supplier on the DVLA's Register of Number Plate Suppliers (RNPS) as specified in British Standard BSAU145d. The supplier needs to confirm that the customer is the registered keeper or other authorised person and verify their identity.<ref name=\"directgovhowto\" /> The name and postcode of the supplier must be shown at the bottom of the plate.<ref name=\"v796\" /> Number plates in the UK are usually flat and made of plastic; embossed aluminium plates are available from some suppliers. These rules are generally described as onerous, particularly to company car drivers who do not hold any of the required paperwork themselves (such items usually being stored by a fleet manager or lease hire company).\n\nRegistered number plate suppliers must keep records including the documents produced by their customers; they can be required to be shown to the police, although in reality this has seldom happened. The [[Department for Transport]] holds a full list of suppliers.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.gov.uk/number-plate-supplier |title = Find your nearest number plate supplier |work = gov.uk |year = 2015 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\nSome companies, particularly those based online, sell number plates described as \"show plates\" or \"not for road use\", which may not satisfy the requirements of BSAU145d. However, if so specified, these products can be identical to number plates sold by approved RNPS registered supplier. Many of these companies do not ask customers to prove ownership of the registration they are purchasing, and try to circumvent the law by placing disclaimers on their websites. Despite these disclaimers, it is still not legal to produce any registration plates without seeing proof of identity of the purchaser (such as a driving licence), and proof of their connection to the registration (such as a V5C or retention certificate).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.plate-trader.com/documents_required.php |title = Documents required from registered number plate suppliers |publisher = Plate-Trader.com |accessdate = 6 May 2014 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Vehicle registration plate]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of the European Union]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of the Isle of Man]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of the Channel Islands]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of British overseas territories]]\n* [[Vehicle Excise Duty]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|License plates of the United Kingdom}}\n\n{{Vehicle registration plates of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vehicle Registration Plates of the United Kingdom}}\n[[Category:Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom| ]]\n[[Category:Road transport in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Vehicle registration plates by country|United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:United Kingdom transport-related lists]]\n", "name_user": "86.181.247.97", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMost expensive plates)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_Kingdom"}
