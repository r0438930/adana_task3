From 1991 it was known as '''Tilbury Douglas''' following a merger with RM Douglas, but in 2001 rebranded as '''Interserve plc'''. The name change partly reflected a shift in focus during the 1990s towards [[Property maintenance|maintenance]] and [[facilities management]] services sectors, and this continued in the 2000s, buoyed by further acquisitions.\n\nHowever, financial issues including problem contracts in Interserve's [[energy-from-waste]] business led to profit warnings in 2017. The company was forced to restructure and refinance in March 2018. Its financial situation worsened in late 2018, and debt holders started discussing a further financial restructuring of the business. The debt-for-equity plan was rejected at an [[annual general meeting]] on 15 March 2019, and the parent company went into [[administration (law)|administration]] owing creditors over \u00a3100m. In a [[Pre-packaged insolvency|pre-pack deal]], the rest of the group was immediately sold to a newly incorporated company owned by lenders, '''Interserve Group Ltd''', with a break-up of the company expected in 2020.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history \u2013 1884 to 1930s===\n\n====Origins====\nInterserve traces its origins to 1884, when the '''London and Tilbury Lighterage Company Limited''' was formed to transfer [[good (economics)|goods]] by [[Thames sailing barge|sailing barge]] to and from [[ships]] on the [[River Thames]], [[London]], [[England]].<ref name=history>[http://www.interserve.com/about-interserve/our-history Interserve History] Company website Retrieved 11 March 2013</ref> A [[Lightering|lighterage]] is the fee paid for the use of a [[lighter (barge)|lighter]],<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lighterage Dictionary.com] Definition of Lighterage</ref> a large, open, flat bottomed barge, that could transport goods a short distance in shallow waters.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lighter Dictionary.com] Definition of Lighter</ref> At the time London was the busiest [[port]] in the [[world]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nYh5KtDGt7IC&pg=PT16&lpg=PT16&dq=the+busiest+port+in+the+world+1880 |title=City Of Cities: The Birth Of Modern London |year=2011 |author1=  Inwood, Stephen. |accessdate=13 March 2013 |isbn=978-0330540674 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |location =London, UK}}</ref> Lightering provided a service  much in demand in the overcrowded river because of the need to transship goods from ships berthed there and to convey them to the riverside [[wharf|wharves]], where the larger open water [[cargo ship]]s were unable to dock due to their size and [[Draft (hull)|draft]] or, to more efficiently and effectively deal with the number of ships congregating in the river.<ref>[http://www.lighteragetugs.co.uk/ London Lighterage Tugs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327143350/http://www.lighteragetugs.co.uk/ |date=27 March 2013 }} London Lighterage Tugs website Retrieved 13 March 2013</ref> By 1887 the company is recorded as occupying premises of a former [[Lloyd's Register]] Proving House and Chain-Testing Shed and subsequent Police Station at Preston Road, [[West India Docks]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46541&strquery=tilbury+lighterage |title=Southern Blackwall: Preston's Road area |author=Hermione Hobhouse (General Editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1994 |work=Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs |accessdate=18 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1888 the company expanded into [[dredging]], where mechanisation led to greatly improved [[productivity]], and secured a [[contract]] with the [[Port of London]] (PLA) to remove dredged ballast.<ref name=history/> This new venture was complementary to the existing business,  utilising the barges already owned by the company, together with their knowledge of the river and its tides. There was a further synergy between lightering and dredging; lightering was necessary where ports were shallow and the draft of a vessel needed to be reduced to facilitate their entry into [[port]], whereas dredging increased the depth of river channels to enable vessels with a larger draft to [[Berth (moorings)|berth]] into port. The company's move into dredging therefore protected its commercial interest against the perceived threat to lightering. This can be seen vindicated by the decline in lighterage for dry [[bulk cargo]] after the middle of the 20th century, although the eventual decline in lighterage was caused by the adoption of [[road haulage]] as the main distribution method when London's docks moved downstream (away from what is now known as [[London Docklands|Docklands]]) and [[shipping]] adopted [[containerisation]] methods.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1967/dec/18/thames-lighterage-industry UK Parliamentary Debate 18 December 1967] Hansard 18 December 1967 Retrieved 18 March 2013</ref> However, for the time being lightering still thrived and the [[New Zealand]]-based ''[[Ashburton Guardian]]'' reported in 1890 that the company was an early pioneer in the transshipment of frozen meat.

From 1991 it was known as '''Tilbury Douglas''' following a merger with RM Douglas, but in 2001 rebranded as '''Interserve plc'''. The name change partly reflected a shift in focus during the 1990s towards [[Property maintenance|maintenance]] and [[facilities management]] services sectors, and this continued in the 2000s, buoyed by further acquisitions.\n\nHowever, financial issues including problem contracts in Interserve's [[energy-from-waste]] business led to profit warnings in 2017. The company was forced to restructure and refinance in March 2018. Its financial situation worsened in late 2018, and debt holders started discussing a further financial restructuring of the business. The debt-for-equity plan was rejected at an [[annual general meeting]] on 15 March 2019, and the parent company went into [[administration (law)|administration]] owing creditors over \u00a3100m.

There was a further synergy between lightering and dredging; lightering was necessary where ports were shallow and the draft of a vessel needed to be reduced to facilitate their entry into [[port]], whereas dredging increased the depth of river channels to enable vessels with a larger draft to [[Berth (moorings)|berth]] into port. The company's move into dredging therefore protected its commercial interest against the perceived threat to lightering. This can be seen vindicated by the decline in lighterage for dry [[bulk cargo]] after the middle of the 20th century, although the eventual decline in lighterage was caused by the adoption of [[road haulage]] as the main distribution method when London's docks moved downstream (away from what is now known as [[London Docklands|Docklands]]) and [[shipping]] adopted [[containerisation]] methods.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1967/dec/18/thames-lighterage-industry UK Parliamentary Debate 18 December 1967] Hansard 18 December 1967 Retrieved 18 March 2013</ref> However, for the time being lightering still thrived and the [[New Zealand]]-based ''[[Ashburton Guardian]]'' reported in 1890 that the company was an early pioneer in the transshipment of frozen meat.
