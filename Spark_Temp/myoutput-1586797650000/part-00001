It was held at the [[Malta Fairs & Conventions Centre]] in [[Ta' Qali]] on 24 and 26 January, and the winning song, [[Vodka (song)|Vodka]], was sung by [[Morena (singer)|Morena]].\n\nAfter the bad results in the two previous contests, some changes were made to the regulations by the MaltaSong board. Long discussions took place with UKAM (Maltese union to represent musicians) for the final regulations to be signed.  Not withstanding the proposed changes, the chosen song still failed to reach the final evening of the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n225 songs were submitted to compete in the first phase of the Malta Song for Europe 2008, which was judged behind closed doors. From the first phase only 36 songs made it through, judged by international jury between the 19th and 21 November 2007.\n\nThe edition was hosted by [[John Demanuele]], [[Ruth Casingena]] and [[Chiara Siracusa]].  [[Australian Idol (season 5)|Australian Idol]] winner [[Natalie Gauci]], who is of Maltese descent, performed during the national finale.\n\n==Results==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
