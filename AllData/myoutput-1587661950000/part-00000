Over the years, the school has been heavily criticized for its mascot, the Indians.\n\n==History==\nThis school opened in 1956, having moved from its location in [[Katonah]], which is now Katonah Elementary School, still part of the Katonah-Lewisboro School District. Prior to the [[settler colonialism]] of the late 17th century, this land belonged to [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]], sachem of the Ramapo Indians and the primary proprietor of the lands around [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]], including the lands upon which John Jay High School was constructed.<ref name=\"Melvin\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/05/nyregion/indians-no-more-john-jay-vote-rejects-school-s-symbol.html|title=Indians No More?

The extract included the word \"[[vagina]]\", and the girls had been asked to edit the word out because of the expected crowd which would include many young children. They said they would follow this order but then disobeyed (they underlined the word by saying it in unison). The school gave them a one-day suspension - not for what was said, but for their insubordination. The girls decided not to appeal their suspension. They agreed they had been insubordinate, but the incident was widely reported and the original order criticized as an act of [[censorship]]. Many students protested the punishment to no avail.  However, many students also protested the media's portrayal of the situation, believing that the school had acted correctly and that the girls deserved to be punished for their insubordination, for they had previously agreed not to say the word.  The play's author [[Eve Ensler]] gave the students her support<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312121748/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17535427/ Appearance] on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' by the students, the author and the president of the school district's education board</ref> and was invited by parents for a school visit.

John Jay High School has utilized [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]] as their mascot since their founding. Significant debate has surrounded this choice since the late 1980s. In October 1989, after six months of debates in assemblies and classrooms, John Jay Campus Congress, a coalition of students, parents and faculty, voted to abandon their mascot, [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]]. They claimed that the imagery, including feathers, tomahawks, headdresses, and loin-cloth clad natives spearing buffalo,\u00a0perpetuated negative stereotypes about Native Americans and created false associations of violence and savagery that were then applied as generalizations onto indigenous people as a group.<ref name=\"Melvin\"/> The October 1989 decision to eliminate the Indian mascot was ultimately rejected, as the community was particularly swayed by a Cherokee faculty member who argued that the mascot was a means to honor the chief.<ref name=\"Melvin\"/> The school principal at the time, John A. Chambers, also argued for the importance of maintaining tradition and school spirit, and the Indians remained intact.\n\nAlmost 30 years later, in 2017, the controversy came to the fore of public discussion once more. On December 19, 2017, John Jay High School students took a poll aimed at gauging opinions on the mascot's potential removal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/12/12/john-jay-cross-river-indian-mascot-must-go/941857001/|title=lohud.com|website=lohud.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Prior to the poll, numerous student and news publications posted articles surrounding the debate, either outlining an overview of the debate in general<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/john-jay-students-to-vote-on-school-mascot-name-change/728923/|title=John Jay Students To Vote On School Mascot Name Change|date=2017-12-20|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref name=\"dailyvoice.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/john-jay-students-vote-to-keep-indians-nickname/729427/|title=John Jay Students Vote To Keep 'Indians' Nickname|date=2017-12-20|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> or articulating arguments against the maintenance of the current mascot on the grounds of cultural appropriation.<ref name=\"What\u2019s in a Name\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.studio23.com/uncategorized/whats-in-a-name|title=What\u2019s in a Name?|website=Studio 23|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref name=\"Shelbred\">{{Cite web|url=https://jjhsfocus.com/2444/opinions/the-john-jay-indians-respectful-or-racist/|title=The John Jay Indians \u2013 Respectful or Racist?|last=Shelbred|first=Liz|website=The FOCUS|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> These students cited [[cultural appropriation]] as harmful, claiming those who support the mascot trivialize historical oppression by claiming it \u201chonors\u201d Native Americans.<ref name=\"What\u2019s in a Name\"/> Not only that, but arguments have been made that the presence of this mascot, as seen through the lens of cultural appropriation, enables privileged individuals to commercialize the stereotypical imagery, as seen through the numerous sweatshirts, caps, and athletic gear emblazoned with images of arrowheads or headdresses, but simultaneously remain prejudiced against those same individuals off whom they are profiting.<ref name=\"Shelbred\"/> Finally, student activists have cited that the use of an \u201cIndian\u201d as a mascot mirrors a larger-scale issue at hand: the district's lack of consciousness related to Native American history.<ref name=\"Shelbred\"/> Ultimately, despite these arguments, the results of the poll showed that 58% of students were in favor of keeping the mascot.<ref name=\"dailyvoice.com\"/>\n\nTwo years later, on October 17, 2019, a Board of Education meeting created further discussion surrounding the removal of the mascot. In this meeting, the Board agreed that the mascot was dated and not politically correct, and requested the School Superintendent, Andrew Selesnick, make a change on the grounds of adherence to fundamental school principles of inclusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://westchester.news12.com/story/41203148/debate-over-katonah-lewisboros-indian-mascot-picks-up-at-school-board-meeting|title=Debate over Katonah Lewisboro's \u2018Indian\u2019 mascot picks up at school board meeting|website=westchester.news12.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/katonah-lewisboro-school-board-could-be-close-to-replacing-indians-mascot/777766/|title=Katonah-Lewisboro School Board Could Be Close To Replacing Indians Mascot|date=2019-10-18|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/news/education/2019/10/18/katonah-lewisboro-considering-replacing-john-jay-hss-indian-mascot/4018014002/|title=Kat-Lew board considers replacing John Jay HS's 'Indians' mascot|last=Grosserode|first=Sophie|website=lohud.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> In response to this meeting, Selesnick composed a letter on October 18, sharing his thoughts. In this letter, he suggests that the mascot is no longer appropriate and that additional discussion regarding the topic should be encouraged. He cites the need for the school to uphold its adherence to the [[Dignity for All Students Act]], which seeks to provide all students with a safe and supportive environment free from discrimination, intimidation, taunting, harassment, and bullying. Thus, if a student expresses that the school's actions are causing harm, the school is responsible to change its behavior. He also emphasizes the ability to maintain school spirit and tradition without causing offense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.klschools.org/groups/7420/superintendent/101819|title=October 18, 2019 - Katonah - Lewisboro School District|website=www.klschools.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Following this letter, a public conversation was hosted on October 28, 2019, open to community members, district residents, and KLSD faculty and administrators, regarding why the Indians mascot has been a conversation in our District since the late 1980s, why it is again today, and possible steps to move forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/77915927637?aff=efbneb|title=KLSD Learning Cafe: The John Jay mascot and how we move forward together|website=Eventbrite|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Information regarding the contents of this meeting has yet to be released.

Over the years, the school has been heavily criticized for its mascot, the Indians.\n\n==History==\nThis school opened in 1956, having moved from its location in [[Katonah]], which is now Katonah Elementary School, still part of the Katonah-Lewisboro School District. Prior to the [[settler colonialism]] of the late 17th century, this land belonged to [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]], sachem of the Ramapo Indians and the primary proprietor of the lands around [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]], including the lands upon which John Jay High School was constructed.<ref name=\"Melvin\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/05/nyregion/indians-no-more-john-jay-vote-rejects-school-s-symbol.html|title=Indians No More?

The extract included the word \"[[vagina]]\", and the girls had been asked to edit the word out because of the expected crowd which would include many young children. They said they would follow this order but then disobeyed (they underlined the word by saying it in unison). The school gave them a one-day suspension - not for what was said, but for their insubordination. The girls decided not to appeal their suspension. They agreed they had been insubordinate, but the incident was widely reported and the original order criticized as an act of [[censorship]]. Many students protested the punishment to no avail.  However, many students also protested the media's portrayal of the situation, believing that the school had acted correctly and that the girls deserved to be punished for their insubordination, for they had previously agreed not to say the word.  The play's author [[Eve Ensler]] gave the students her support<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312121748/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17535427/ Appearance] on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' by the students, the author and the president of the school district's education board</ref> and was invited by parents for a school visit.

John Jay High School has utilized [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]] as their mascot since their founding. Significant debate has surrounded this choice since the late 1980s. In October 1989, after six months of debates in assemblies and classrooms, John Jay Campus Congress, a coalition of students, parents and faculty, voted to abandon their mascot, [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]]. They claimed that the imagery, including feathers, tomahawks, headdresses, and loin-cloth clad natives spearing buffalo,\u00a0perpetuated negative stereotypes about Native Americans and created false associations of violence and savagery that were then applied as generalizations onto indigenous people as a group.<ref name=\"Melvin\"/> The October 1989 decision to eliminate the Indian mascot was ultimately rejected, as the community was particularly swayed by a Cherokee faculty member who argued that the mascot was a means to honor the chief.<ref name=\"Melvin\"/> The school principal at the time, John A. Chambers, also argued for the importance of maintaining tradition and school spirit, and the Indians remained intact.\n\nAlmost 30 years later, in 2017, the controversy came to the fore of public discussion once more. On December 19, 2017, John Jay High School students took a poll aimed at gauging opinions on the mascot's potential removal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/12/12/john-jay-cross-river-indian-mascot-must-go/941857001/|title=lohud.com|website=lohud.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Prior to the poll, numerous student and news publications posted articles surrounding the debate, either outlining an overview of the debate in general<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/john-jay-students-to-vote-on-school-mascot-name-change/728923/|title=John Jay Students To Vote On School Mascot Name Change|date=2017-12-20|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref name=\"dailyvoice.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/john-jay-students-vote-to-keep-indians-nickname/729427/|title=John Jay Students Vote To Keep 'Indians' Nickname|date=2017-12-20|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> or articulating arguments against the maintenance of the current mascot on the grounds of cultural appropriation.<ref name=\"What\u2019s in a Name\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.studio23.com/uncategorized/whats-in-a-name|title=What\u2019s in a Name?|website=Studio 23|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref name=\"Shelbred\">{{Cite web|url=https://jjhsfocus.com/2444/opinions/the-john-jay-indians-respectful-or-racist/|title=The John Jay Indians \u2013 Respectful or Racist?|last=Shelbred|first=Liz|website=The FOCUS|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> These students cited [[cultural appropriation]] as harmful, claiming those who support the mascot trivialize historical oppression by claiming it \u201chonors\u201d Native Americans.<ref name=\"What\u2019s in a Name\"/> Not only that, but arguments have been made that the presence of this mascot, as seen through the lens of cultural appropriation, enables privileged individuals to commercialize the stereotypical imagery, as seen through the numerous sweatshirts, caps, and athletic gear emblazoned with images of arrowheads or headdresses, but simultaneously remain prejudiced against those same individuals off whom they are profiting.<ref name=\"Shelbred\"/> Finally, student activists have cited that the use of an \u201cIndian\u201d as a mascot mirrors a larger-scale issue at hand: the district's lack of consciousness related to Native American history.<ref name=\"Shelbred\"/> Ultimately, despite these arguments, the results of the poll showed that 58% of students were in favor of keeping the mascot.<ref name=\"dailyvoice.com\"/>\n\nTwo years later, on October 17, 2019, a Board of Education meeting created further discussion surrounding the removal of the mascot. In this meeting, the Board agreed that the mascot was dated and not politically correct, and requested the School Superintendent, Andrew Selesnick, make a change on the grounds of adherence to fundamental school principles of inclusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://westchester.news12.com/story/41203148/debate-over-katonah-lewisboros-indian-mascot-picks-up-at-school-board-meeting|title=Debate over Katonah Lewisboro's \u2018Indian\u2019 mascot picks up at school board meeting|website=westchester.news12.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/katonah-lewisboro-school-board-could-be-close-to-replacing-indians-mascot/777766/|title=Katonah-Lewisboro School Board Could Be Close To Replacing Indians Mascot|date=2019-10-18|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/news/education/2019/10/18/katonah-lewisboro-considering-replacing-john-jay-hss-indian-mascot/4018014002/|title=Kat-Lew board considers replacing John Jay HS's 'Indians' mascot|last=Grosserode|first=Sophie|website=lohud.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> In response to this meeting, Selesnick composed a letter on October 18, sharing his thoughts. In this letter, he suggests that the mascot is no longer appropriate and that additional discussion regarding the topic should be encouraged. He cites the need for the school to uphold its adherence to the [[Dignity for All Students Act]], which seeks to provide all students with a safe and supportive environment free from discrimination, intimidation, taunting, harassment, and bullying. Thus, if a student expresses that the school's actions are causing harm, the school is responsible to change its behavior. He also emphasizes the ability to maintain school spirit and tradition without causing offense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.klschools.org/groups/7420/superintendent/101819|title=October 18, 2019 - Katonah - Lewisboro School District|website=www.klschools.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Following this letter, a public conversation was hosted on October 28, 2019, open to community members, district residents, and KLSD faculty and administrators, regarding why the Indians mascot has been a conversation in our District since the late 1980s, why it is again today, and possible steps to move forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/77915927637?aff=efbneb|title=KLSD Learning Cafe: The John Jay mascot and how we move forward together|website=Eventbrite|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Information regarding the contents of this meeting has yet to be released.
