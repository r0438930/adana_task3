{"title_page": "Alfred Latour", "text_new": "'''Alfred Latour''' (1888, [[Paris]] \u2013 1964, [[Eygali\u00e8res]]) was a French painter and engraver who also worked extensively as a graphic designer and as an advertiser. He was notoriously against the opposition between so-called major and minor arts; he was a man of many talents, passionate about all the expressive possibilities of visual arts, crafts, and modes of expression.\n<br />\nHis vast and multifarious work includes hundreds of oils, watercolours, drawings, illustrated books, advertisement posters, vignettes and printed fabrics, some of which are still produced by the Abbaye de Fontenay. All his works express both his sense of freedom and his rigorous seriousness. His Fauve palette is combined with essential lightness and simplicity of form.\nHis works can be seen in museums in [[France]] ([[Paris]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseilles]], [[Arles]], [[Martigues]]), in [[Great Britain]] ([[The British Museum]] and [[The Victoria and Albert Museum]]), and in [[National Library of the Netherlands]]. They are also part of many private art collections around the world.\n\nLatour was always highly independent and reserved, and had no inclination to draw attention on himself. As a result, he became a recognized painter and a successful graphic designer, but he never acquired the public recognition his work should have bestowed on him. In 2004, the [http://www.alfred-latour.org Alfred Latour Foundation] was established in [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]]. It is presided by Claude Latour, Alfred Latour's nephew, and is dedicated to preserving and promoting Alfred Latour's work.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nAlfred Latour was the youngest of four brothers; his father was a printer and typographer at the [[Imprimerie Nationale]]. He was born on 27 August 1888 in a working-class neighbourhood of the 12th arrondissement in [[Paris]]. From early childhood his love of drawing\u2014his parents' slight resistance notwithstanding\u2014marked him to become an artist.\n\nHis formation was very diverse. He started with evening classes in his neighbourhood, in Rue d'Aligre, and for a short time he was a student at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts|Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts]]. However, he was rapidly turned off by the academicism of the teaching. He preferred to spend his time in the [[National Museums of Paris]] where he took many notes and made many sketches and drawings. In 1908, he received a grant from the [[Paris|City of Paris]] to attend the [[Ecole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]]. At that school he received a solid technical formation and trained his eye and his hand while searching for his own style. After he sold his first canvases, he went on a journey to the south of France, which proved to be a form of revelation whose enchantment would last all his life.\n\nHowever, Latour was conscripted in 1909 and stationed in [[Granville, Manche|Granville]], in [[Normandy]]. While on his leaves, he discovered the coast of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] of which he produced many sketches and pochades: small sketches that captured the outline and colours of the landscape.\n\nIn 1913, he settled in Paris again, on the [[Ile Saint-Louis]], which was still at the time a sort of village at the heart of the capital. He lived off the sale of canvases and drawings (mostly views of Paris and scenes of Parisian life), but also off set design for the theatre and graphic design patterns for household objects (boxes, plates, lamps and the like). That year, he presented his work for the first time at the [[Salon d'automne]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\">[http://www.alfred-latour.org/alfred_latour/files/latour_biography.pdf Biography on the website of the Foundation Alfred Latour]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>\n\nDuring that period, he started his work as a wood engraver. His professionalism, skilfulness and taste for meticulous and rigorous work quickly drew the recognition of his peers. The symbolist painter [[\u00c9mile Bernard]], who was practically his neighbour, commissioned the engraving of his drawings illustrating [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]]'s Les Amours and [[Les Fleurs du mal|Baudelaire's ''Les Fleurs du Mal'']], which [[Ambroise Vollard]] then published in 1914 and 1916.\n<br />\nWith the start of World War I in 1914, Latour was mobilized, and on 22 September he was seriously wounded in [[Picardy]]. While convalescing in hospital he met Madeleine Cosnard who would become his wife in 1917 and the mother of his two sons, Jacques and Jean. During these war years Latour produced a large number of drawings and snapshot-like sketches of silhouetted comrades in their daily lives and of the landscapes he passed through.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to the [[Ile Saint-Louis]] where he dedicated himself exclusively to perfecting his art as a woodcutter and graphic designer. His work clearly belonged to the French tradition, but he also radically renewed that tradition with his use of colours and his acute sense of simplicity in decoration. His talent did not go unnoticed; he started to exhibit his works regularly at the [[Salon d'Automne]], at the [[Petit Palais]], where he was the recipient of several prizes, and art patrons started to include him in their collections.<ref>In June 1921, financier and famous art collector [[Otto H. Kahn]] (1867-1934) purchased several of Latour's woodcuts to donate them to American museums, in particular to the (now closed) Mus\u00e9e d'Art Fran\u00e7ais in New York. In 1925, American banker [[Jules Bache]] (1861-1944), a prominent entrepreneur and art collector who owned a splendid collection including pieces by [[Rembrandt]], [[D\u00fcrer]], and [[Velasquez]], purchased six woodcuts which he donated to the [[New York Public Library]]. In 1926, the curator of the Department of Prints wrote to Latour to tell him about an important exhibition on four centuries of the art of woodcutting; in that letter, the curator wrote: \"We are very pleased to have works of yours in the collection.\"</ref> In 1925, he was awarded the Grand Prix for book illustration at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\"/> That same year, he created graphic and typographic vignettes for the [[Deberny and Peignot]] foundry. Latour's innovative idea was to create iterative motifs that could be combined ad infinitum like the letters of the alphabet; the motive would prove to be a commercial success for many years.\n\nIn 1927, he settled in [[Montparnasse]], the hub of Paris artistic and intellectual life that attracted many painters, writers and musicians, many of whom were exiles. He became involved with the art book milieu, starting to work on bookbinding, embellishments and illustrations of more than thirty books.<ref>[[Louis Koopman]], a scientist, high-tech entrepreneur, art connoisseur and book lover particularly fond of French literature, included Le Voyage d'Urien, along with other books illustrated by Latour, in his famous collection of rare books. The collection is currently in the holdings of The National Library of the Netherlands.</ref> This work enabled him to become friends with many authors including poet [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]], novelist [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], and art historian [[Andr\u00e9 Focillon]].<ref>In 1920 art historian [[Henri Focillon]] commissioned Latour to illustrate his book \"L'Ile oubli\u00e9e\" (\"The Forgotten Island\"); in 1953, he published an article titled ''Estampes en couleurs grav\u00e9es sur bois'' (\"Colour Woodcuts and Prints\") in Arts et M\u00e9tiers Graphiques (N\u00b029, 1953) where he wrote: \"Latour considers that wood is not simply the substance of graphic speculation, but that it also offers rich plastic possibilities that can admit the dreams of a painter.\"</ref> It also led him to receiving several prizes in international exhibitions, which he shared with renowned artists such as [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]], [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]], [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Raoul Dufy|Dufy]], [[Picasso]], and [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]]. His modernist aesthetic and his sober and refined style also drew the attention of the [[Lyon]] silk manufacturers [http://www.bianchiniferier.com Maison Bianchini-F\u00e9rier] who commissioned him several designs for their exclusive fabrics.\n\nHe then turned to photography, which revealed yet another aspect of his talent. He became the Paris correspondent of an international press agency.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\">Documents belonging to the Latour family (available upon request for consultation, please contact the [http://www.alfred-latour.org Foundation]).</ref> His favourite subjects were street scenes, fairs and the fishermen on the banks of the [[Seine]]. He captured these slices of life for the newspaper [[L'Ami du peuple]]<ref>[[Laure Albin Guillot]] who photographed the Parisian intelligentsia of arts and letters photographed Latour for her exhibition titled \"Portraits of Men\" that included portraits of [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]], [[Julien Green]], [[Mo\u00efse Kisling]], [[Louis Lumi\u00e8re]], [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] and [[Darius Milhaud]].</ref> with his quick look and his original sense of framing.\n<br />\nSuccess, however, never went to Latour's head; it actually started to irk him. He felt he needed silence and concentration to deepen his work. In 1932, he broke away from Parisian metropolitan life for which he had no affinity and bought a \"[[Mas (Proven\u00e7al farmhouse)|mas]]\" (a former sheep stable) in Eygali\u00e8res at the foot of the [[Alpilles]] mountains. In the long-desired solitude of the [[Provence]], he launched on a quest for renewed freedom; he gave up the constraints of woodcutting to devote himself freely to watercolours.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/><ref>In 1932, Latour showed his work at the Galerie La Tortue in Paris. The exhibit was very favorably reviewed in the magazine Les Echos des Arts: \"It comes as no surprise that [Latour's] painting should be as bold, as innovative in its lines, as profound in its composition and as meticulous in its design as his woodcuts were.\".</ref>\n\nIn 1934, he started to work for the wine merchant [http://www.nicolas.com [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Nicolas]]]. Their collaboration would last 30 years during which Latour produced much of the advertisement for the company, including posters and the prestigious yearly catalogue of fine wines, which artists as famous as [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Kees van Dongen|Van Dongen]] and [[Bernard Buffet]] had illustrated before him.<ref>In 1928 the dynamic director of [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Vins Nicolas]], the wine company to which he gave his name, started a luxurious yearly catalogue of his products. Famous designer and publicist [[Cassandre]] was mandated with the typography. In 1940 Latour took over the mandate and continued with this work all his life.</ref> On the other hand, when the renowned printing house Draeger that produced the material for [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Nicolas]] offered Latour to become their Artistic Director, he turned down the offer saying: \"I don't want a collar on my neck, albeit a golden one.\".<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/>\n\nLatour always observed at a distance the vanguard artistic movements of his time. Between 1935 and 1936 he joined the UAM (the [[Union des Artistes Modernes]]) a movement founded in 1929 by architect [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] in reaction to the academicism of the era and the established hierarchies between major and minor arts. Prominent members of the UAM included [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], [[Charlotte Perriand]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Man Ray]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Walter Gropius]]. In the UAM pavilion of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]], Latour presented works in three categories: Art Books and Illustration, Graphic Art, and Advertisement.\n\nWhen the [[Second World War]] broke out, Latour was revolted by the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]] France signed with Germany, which he considered a humiliating capitulation. Ostensibly, he led a quiet life as a painter in [[Eygali\u00e8res]], returning to oil painting, which he had abandoned 20 years previously. At the age of 52, however, he decided to join his son Jacques who was fighting with the partisans of the [[French R\u00e9sistance]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\"/><ref>Jacques participated in the actions of the [[Special Operations Executive|S.O.E.]] and was in charge of organizing the connections with England and the airdrop of armed groups placed under the authority of Commander Buckmaster in [[London]]. In France, the [[Zone libre|Zone Sud]], where Latour and his son resided, was commanded by [[Peter Churchill]]. (He was not related to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]).</ref> In 1944, Jacques was arrested and deported to [[Dachau]]. He survived and became the curator of the Arles museums after the war. Latour managed to escape arrest thanks to an early warning and hid in Lyon in a hospital administered by a religious order. This forced retreat gave him time for reflection, meditation and produced in him a late awakening to religious faith.\n\nIn 1946, he bought another house on the rocky heights of Eygali\u00e8res where he settled in two studios. One was devoted to his graphic work, while the other was the very private space he reserved for painting. The graphic work included the design of new fonts, page setting and illustrations that he worked on for the wine merchant Nicolas.<ref>Latour participated each year in the Rencontres Internationales de Lure founded by [[Maximilien Vox]]. The exposition gathered typographers, printers, designers, advertisers and publishers. Latour also became a member of the [[ATypI|International Association of Typography (ATypI)]] founded in 1951 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. The Association was founded by Charles Peignot and held its yearly conventions in different European capitals.</ref> He also started working with his friend Pierre Aynard, a silk manufacturer from [[Lyon]] and the owner of the [[Abbaye de Fontenay]]. He thus designed patterns for silk fabrics used in haute couture or in exclusive tapestries.<ref>In 1950, Brunet Lecomte produced a limited series of seven of the so-called Canvases of Fontenay. Latour would then show printed tapestries under the brand Edition des \"Toiles de Fontenay\" at the 1950 [[Salon d'Automne]].</ref>\n\nLatour kept following the developments of the arts in Paris from afar, but was irritated by the increasing influence of the art market. One day he even packed up his canvases that were about to be exhibited at the prestigious [http://www.galeriedefrance.com Galerie de France]: \"How can painters be raised in stables like race horses?\" And: \"How can their work be sold like any old kind of stuff,\" Latour protested.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/>\n<br />\nIn his [[Provence]] retreat Latour thought of nothing but painting, though that did not keep him from cordially welcoming occasional visitors such as painter [[Mario Prassinos]], actors [[G\u00e9rard Philippe]] and [[Nicolas Bataille]], poet [[Henri Pichette]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Allix]], the Rector of the [[University of Lyon]]. Upon the insistence of his friends he also agreed to participate in a few group exhibitions and in the newly created [[Salon de Mai]]. In 1953, he exceptionally agreed to lend his works to the Parisian Galerie Carmine for a personal exhibit that turned out to be quite a success.<ref name=\"Newspaper reviews\">On 7 March 1953 Robert Vrinat wrote in L'Actualit\u00e9 Artistique Internationale: \"Alfred Latour is an artist with a rich past. This does not keep him from being on the lookout for new possibilities and from progressing with his work. In our time so agitated by multiple tendencies and trends, he develops his very personal and profoundly interesting style.\" Among the throngs of visitors one could distinguish some particularly informed amateurs, such as art critic and curator of the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] [[Jean Cassou]], Latour's patron and friend Etienne Nicolas, art critic and professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France [[Andr\u00e9 Chastel]], the celebrated typographer [[Maximilien Vox]], renowned printer [[Charles Peignot]], and of course fellow painters, [[Yves Brayer]], [[L\u00e9on Gischia]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Andr\u00e9 Marchand (painter)|Andr\u00e9 Marchand]] and many others. On 1 April 1962 Francis Carlier, wrote in [[Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]]: \"Latour's colors welcome the spectator with great commotion. His paintings have attracted to the Galerie La Calade a throng of art amateurs and connoisseurs. (...) Despite the calculated rigidity of their lines, all the works of the exhibition give the impression of intense life and silent poetry.\"\n\nOn 1 April 1962 Le M\u00e9ridional-La France published an article that said: \"Alfred Latour is a modern painter who does not yield to excess; his soul is strong, sensitive, clear and humane. Everything in his work bears the mark of great care. His motto may well be: \"put your work twenty times upon the anvil.\"\n\nIn [[Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises]], on 19 April 1962, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cingria wrote: \"Everything in Latour's painting reminds us that he has been at the same time an extraordinary engraver and a typographer. Through his paintings we see that man whose talent has been admired by all specialists\u2014.\"\n\nLe M\u00e9ridional \u2013 La France, on 22 April 1962, insisted: \"Alfred Latour is the author of a considerable oeuvre, but as a painter he has seldom been exhibited. That is why many connoisseurs discover his talent in that field only now. Latour leaves the beaten track and in all his works he expresses original personality. In everyday life, his main trait is his modesty which is only equaled by his immense talent.\"\n\nOn 19 April 1962, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cingria wrote in [[Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises]]: \"Everything in Latour's painting reminds us that he has been at the same time an extraordinary engraver and a typographer.

In everyday life, his main trait is his modesty which is only equalled by his immense talent.\"\n\nJ. Samat wrote in Le M\u00e9ridional on 15 December 1962: \"Alfred Latour steers clear of any artificiality and any obvious creative process; most of all, he is not sensitive to any of the fads of the time. (...) Because he has definitively overcome all technical problems, his conception of nature reaches us through movingly sparse expression and it seems that each work is an open window onto his soul, as each work fills us with a wonderful feeling of peace, light and youth.\n<br />\nLast, but not least, Camille Rouvier, in Le Proven\u00e7al on 19 December 1962 stated: \"Latour's work is made of classic balance \u2014 it is a balance that is eternal and always new! His art is that of the geometry of space. The straight line, the Golden Rule of drawing, is the trademark of his righteousness and probity. Some complain that they find that this painting cold \u2014 as if Bach's music was could be cold!\"\n</ref> However, Latour only started to feel the pressing need to make his painting better known after 1962 when he started to become alarmed by his developing heart condition. He then showed his work at the Galerie La Calade, in [[Avignon]], the Galerie Garibaldi in [[Marseille]], as well as at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in [[Paris]]. In all cases the reviews were unanimously eulogistic.\n\nLatour died in his studio after suffering a stroke on 4 March 1964 at the age of 76.\n\n== The Work of Alfred Latour ==\n\nRigorousness and freedom, modernity and independence, geometry and lyricism: these could be the key words defining the vast variety of Latour's talents and skills. The man was an explorer of art and he loved to venture into uncharted territories, meet new challenges and develop new techniques of visual expression. However, to him this diversity of approaches really meant searching for profound coherence. Whether it was in a landscape, in framing a photograph, etching a vignette, conceiving a poster for an ad or drawing a design for a fabric, he permanently rejected academicism, hackneyed tradition and ready-made solutions. He always showed his independence and resolutely refused to be enrolled in any school or movement. The history of these vanguards and their ideologies bore little relation to his personal history. Latour was certainly a Modernist, but not a diehard revolutionary artist: he sought to reinterpret the artistic tradition in the light of his own perception of the world and reach through it an ideal of essential simplicity.\n\n=== The Painted Work and Drawing ===\n\nAt the [[Ecole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]], the teaching of painting was still very much under the influence of [[Impressionism]]. In 1908, however, [[Impressionism]] had lost most of its attraction; even [[Monet]] had left it behind to explore new forms. At the 1905 [[Salon d'Automne]], [[Matisse]] and the other [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] scandalized the small world of art by totally freeing color, and in 1907 [[Picasso]]'s [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] ignited the controversy of the [[Cubist|Cubism]] revolution and its ingenious deconstruction of space. Latour observed all this, but kept looking for a language of his own.\n<br />\nFrom his early sketches in Paris or in Normandy, Latour's technique had always been sure, self-reliant and fluid; he never sought to describe but rather to evoke with an innate sense of formal ellipsis and economy of means. His impressionist schooling gave him a feel for atmospheric skies, moving waters and intense ambiances that he produced through the supple strokes of his brush. From the start too he sought to push very far the simplification of forms, leaving details aside to attain comprehensible and vivid, though pared down, visions of the world.\n\nHis work is akin to visual haikus: the painting bears the somewhat hard trace of his brush; his drawings are \"written\" in hasty and tense ink gravid with allusion. Latour was a master of blacks and greys on bistre-coloured paper; with a few strokes he knew how to enhance the light on the paper and thus managed to convey the vastness and the energy of skies and sees in very small pieces. Even diminutive woodcuts, be they portraits or landscapes, bear the mark of his spirited style.\n<br />\nThe encounter with the southern light of [[Provence]] in the 1930s and 1940s opened up his palette and enriched it with the solar hues of a tamed [[Fauvism]]. The colours of the works of that period are intense but much less burning than [[Matisse]]'s, [[Derain]]'s and [[Braque]]'s pyrotechnics of the 1910s. From 1940, Latour returned to oil painting that he had abandoned 20 years before and developed a chromatist lyricism he had inherited from [[Fauvism]]. He also used this chromatic palette with bluish shadows that structure the arid and rocky landscapes he painted of [[Eygali\u00e8res]].\n<br />\nLatour's quest for formal freedom, for more light and simplicity, did not stop there. He was a man that kept going back indefatigably, almost obsessively, to his work. In the mid-1940s oil painting had the lion's share in Latour's production, which expressed the evident pleasure he must have had to paint. The post-war years were a new era for him, and in his increasingly free style pieces such as \"The Banks of the Rh\u00f4ne\", \"Les Sainte-Maries de la Mer\", and \"Avignon\" now consisted of solid surfaces of color, silhouetted shapes and stylized forms. The drawings too seem to have been made with one quick remorseless stroke and capture stenographically the laconic and expressive sparseness of the [[Alpilles]] or the [[Camargue]].\n\nLatour's quest for simplicity took him to the brim of abstraction, though he never made the final step. His work gradually evolved toward a poetic code that enabled him to evoke with a few lines and a few colour strokes a \"Landscape in the [[Beaujolais]]\", the contours of \"Avignon\", \"Collioures\", the mountains, the [[Alpilles]], white clouds, rice fields, and \"Tulips against a Red Backdrop\". From the end of the 1940s to his last landscapes and bouquets, Latour flirted with geometry both rigorously and playfully. His geometric compositions are made of colour surfaces that his drawing lines\u2014sometimes as fine as a pencil and sometimes as thick as brush stroke\u2014cross freely. In these late works it is as if colour and form were autonomous; they are like two musical scores that respond to and echo each other in superimpositions, crossings and counterpoint.\n\nThe novelist [[Henri Feyt]] and the Director of [[Gallimard]], [[Louis Evrard]], tell the following anecdote: on a spring day of 1969, [[Picasso]]\u2014who would never miss the Easter bullfight in [[Arles]]\u2014noticed a painting on the wall of Andr\u00e9's bookstore in that town. \"Who is this by?\" he asked. \"Alfred Latour; he is dead now,\" was the storeowner's reply. \"How come I never met him?\" wondered the great Pablo.<ref>The anecdote was told to Madeleine Latour by Mr. Andr\u00e9, the owner of the bookshop: page 27 of the full biography of Alfred Latour [http://www.alfred-latour.org/alfred_latour/files/latour_biography.pdf internet site]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from the Foundation Alfred Latour</ref>\n\n=== The Graphic Work ===\n\nLatour's graphic work may appear to be close to that of [[Raoul Dufy]], not just because the two men were born and died exactly 11 years apart, but more importantly because like him he was a one-man band of visual arts. He was an artist who mastered (almost) all techniques and languages of pictorial representation: he was a painter and a drawer, of course, but also a wood engraver, a publicist, a font designer, a bookbinder, an illustrator, a set designer, a graphic designer for objects and fabric patterns, a tapestry designer and a photographer. Although painting was at the heart of his creation, the rest of his activities were not mere potboilers. The diversity of his activities was central to the UAM's ([[Union des Artistes Modernes]]) programme, the movement founded in 1929 by [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]]. Although he detested being enrolled in anything, Latour joined the movement in 1935-36 as a \"graphic designer.\" Latour was thus close to [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], [[Charlotte Perriand]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Man Ray]], [[Cassandre]], [[Jean Lur\u00e7at]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Walter Gropius]], who all shared a distaste for the academicism of the era and the hierarchies between so-called major and minor arts.\n<br />\nLatour's father was a printer and a typographer. The son inherited a sense for good work and a permanent yearning for perfection from his father. Latour's graphic work has \"secured him a choice place in the Golden Book of Print,\" said Roger Ch\u00e2telain, a former Dean of the [[Lausanne]] [[Ecole Romande d'Art Graphiques]] (ERAG). Ch\u00e2telain also underlined the very special place Latour occupies in that book. As with painting, Latour never sought to make his graphic work part of the vanguard that was made up of the Russian [[Suprematism|Suprematists]], the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]], the Dutch of the [[De Stijl]] group and the German school of the [[Bauhaus]].\n<br />\nIn 1908, Austrian architect [[Adolph Loos]] had summed up the extreme rigorousness of radical [[Modernists]] by declaring: \"Ornament is a crime.\" Latour remained faithful to the French tradition he inherited from his father whose taste, in particular for ornament, was resolutely old-fashioned in comparison with the Modernism of the time. Latour's first woodcuts for book illustrations\u2014head letters, frontispieces, ex libris, views of Paris, landscapes and still lives\u2014show Latour was still very much influenced by the French tradition, though they also show his tendency to simplification and graphic effectiveness. The same can be observed in his early illustrated books with works by [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Henri Focillon]]. Soon, however, Latour's graphic work took a sharp modern turn, in particular in his posters, his ads for the newspapers, his surprisingly simple and purified bookbinding design and his inventively simple fabric designs. All these creations bear witness to his tasteful use of colour and the refined rigorousness with which he introduced combinations and variations on playful geometry and sparse composition.\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nCamera in hand, Latour immediately demonstrated he had a photographer's eye. He did not leave an extensive photographic output, but it is of high quality. Latour was the correspondent of a press agency, but his work is not so much documentary as poetic. He seized in black and white shards of life and of the world, minuscule evanescent events of everyday life that his camera arrested in flight. His subjects include pedestrians crossing a street viewed from below knee level, a motorcycle hoisted aboard a ship that seems to be flying through the air, or a fisherman whose amiable smile appears to be squeezed between his Gallic moustache and the beret jammed on his head. He also captured passers-by that look like Lilliputians in front of a giant advertisement for the [[Galeries Lafayette]], people seen from the back as they are looking from a bridge on the [[Seine]] which is not visible in the picture, or an odd and playful accumulation of pipes, wigs, hot-water bottles in a store window. Latour was artistic kin to other street poets like [[Robert Doisneau]], [[Willy Ronis]] and [[Edouard Boubat]]. His keen and mobile eye sought new angles, from above or from below: a bird's-eye view of a bottle of wine and a slice of bread transforms the latter into an original still life. He could focus on a detail and find delight in almost nothing. He would frame precisely and only what he was interested in, even if that meant cutting heads, leaving out the second wheel of a bicycle, or use the windshield of a car as a frame within the frame.\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n=== Painting and drawing ===\n* 1910: Grandville, drawing, ink and pencil, 11,5 x 17,5&nbsp;cm.\n* 1913: The Woods, woodcut, 13 x 18&nbsp;cm.\n* 1916: War Sketch, ink, 10,4 x 16,2&nbsp;cm.\n* 1936: Mas in the Alpilles, watercolor, 29 x 43&nbsp;cm.\n* 1941: Eygali\u00e8res, oil on cardboard, 33 x 41&nbsp;cm.\n* 1945: Avignon, oil on paper, 50 x 65&nbsp;cm.\n* 1948: Landscape of the Beaujolais, oil on canvas, 73 x 92&nbsp;cm.\n* 1954: The Alpilles and White Clouds, oil on canvas, 115 x 146&nbsp;cm.\n* 1957: Tulips on Red Backdrop, oil on canvas, 65 x 50&nbsp;cm.\n\n=== Graphic work ===\n* 1920: Henri Focillon, L'\u00eele oubli\u00e9e (\"The Forgotten Island\"), illustrated book, woodcut, 11 x 9&nbsp;cm, (1 picture).\n* 1928: Charles Baudelaire, The Flowers of Evil, frontispiece, Illustrated book, woodcut, 12 x 8&nbsp;cm.\n* c. 1960: Nicolas Wines: Advertisement poster, 300 x 500&nbsp;cm.\n* 1929: Les Coquillages (\"Shells\"), graphic design on fabric, (printed Tournon fabric), 31 x 28&nbsp;cm.\n* 1948: design for fabric, 49 x 64&nbsp;cm.\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nFrom the Catalogue of Latour's Works, nt., nd.\n* P. 9 : The Wigmaker's Shop Window (c. 1936).\n* P. 14: Photo journalism: Sleepers on a Bench (c. 1936).\n* pp.&nbsp;16\u201317: Passers-By (c. 1936).\n* pp.&nbsp;22\u201323: Portrait of a Fisherman and Sill Life (c. 1936).\n* P. 27: The Flying Motorcycle (c. 1932).\n\n== Main distinctions and exhibitions ==\n* 1913: Paris Salon d'Automne.

He was notoriously against the opposition between so-called major and minor arts; he was a man of many talents, passionate about all the expressive possibilities of visual arts, crafts, and modes of expression.\n<br />\nHis vast and multifarious work includes hundreds of oils, watercolours, drawings, illustrated books, advertisement posters, vignettes and printed fabrics, some of which are still produced by the Abbaye de Fontenay. All his works express both his sense of freedom and his rigorous seriousness. His Fauve palette is combined with essential lightness and simplicity of form.\nHis works can be seen in museums in [[France]] ([[Paris]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseilles]], [[Arles]], [[Martigues]]), in [[Great Britain]] ([[The British Museum]] and [[The Victoria and Albert Museum]]), and in [[National Library of the Netherlands]]. They are also part of many private art collections around the world.\n\nLatour was always highly independent and reserved, and had no inclination to draw attention on himself. As a result, he became a recognized painter and a successful graphic designer, but he never acquired the public recognition his work should have bestowed on him. In 2004, the [http://www.alfred-latour.org Alfred Latour Foundation] was established in [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]]. It is presided by Claude Latour, Alfred Latour's nephew, and is dedicated to preserving and promoting Alfred Latour's work.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nAlfred Latour was the youngest of four brothers; his father was a printer and typographer at the [[Imprimerie Nationale]]. He was born on 27 August 1888 in a working-class neighbourhood of the 12th arrondissement in [[Paris]]. From early childhood his love of drawing\u2014his parents' slight resistance notwithstanding\u2014marked him to become an artist.\n\nHis formation was very diverse. He started with evening classes in his neighbourhood, in Rue d'Aligre, and for a short time he was a student at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts|Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts]]. However, he was rapidly turned off by the academicism of the teaching. He preferred to spend his time in the [[National Museums of Paris]] where he took many notes and made many sketches and drawings. In 1908, he received a grant from the [[Paris|City of Paris]] to attend the [[Ecole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]]. At that school he received a solid technical formation and trained his eye and his hand while searching for his own style. After he sold his first canvases, he went on a journey to the south of France, which proved to be a form of revelation whose enchantment would last all his life.\n\nHowever, Latour was conscripted in 1909 and stationed in [[Granville, Manche|Granville]], in [[Normandy]]. While on his leaves, he discovered the coast of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] of which he produced many sketches and pochades: small sketches that captured the outline and colours of the landscape.\n\nIn 1913, he settled in Paris again, on the [[Ile Saint-Louis]], which was still at the time a sort of village at the heart of the capital. He lived off the sale of canvases and drawings (mostly views of Paris and scenes of Parisian life), but also off set design for the theatre and graphic design patterns for household objects (boxes, plates, lamps and the like). That year, he presented his work for the first time at the [[Salon d'automne]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\">[http://www.alfred-latour.org/alfred_latour/files/latour_biography.pdf Biography on the website of the Foundation Alfred Latour]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>\n\nDuring that period, he started his work as a wood engraver. His professionalism, skilfulness and taste for meticulous and rigorous work quickly drew the recognition of his peers. The symbolist painter [[\u00c9mile Bernard]], who was practically his neighbour, commissioned the engraving of his drawings illustrating [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]]'s Les Amours and [[Les Fleurs du mal|Baudelaire's ''Les Fleurs du Mal'']], which [[Ambroise Vollard]] then published in 1914 and 1916.\n<br />\nWith the start of World War I in 1914, Latour was mobilized, and on 22 September he was seriously wounded in [[Picardy]]. While convalescing in hospital he met Madeleine Cosnard who would become his wife in 1917 and the mother of his two sons, Jacques and Jean. During these war years Latour produced a large number of drawings and snapshot-like sketches of silhouetted comrades in their daily lives and of the landscapes he passed through.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to the [[Ile Saint-Louis]] where he dedicated himself exclusively to perfecting his art as a woodcutter and graphic designer. His work clearly belonged to the French tradition, but he also radically renewed that tradition with his use of colours and his acute sense of simplicity in decoration. His talent did not go unnoticed; he started to exhibit his works regularly at the [[Salon d'Automne]], at the [[Petit Palais]], where he was the recipient of several prizes, and art patrons started to include him in their collections.<ref>In June 1921, financier and famous art collector [[Otto H. Kahn]] (1867-1934) purchased several of Latour's woodcuts to donate them to American museums, in particular to the (now closed) Mus\u00e9e d'Art Fran\u00e7ais in New York. In 1925, American banker [[Jules Bache]] (1861-1944), a prominent entrepreneur and art collector who owned a splendid collection including pieces by [[Rembrandt]], [[D\u00fcrer]], and [[Velasquez]], purchased six woodcuts which he donated to the [[New York Public Library]]. In 1926, the curator of the Department of Prints wrote to Latour to tell him about an important exhibition on four centuries of the art of woodcutting; in that letter, the curator wrote: \"We are very pleased to have works of yours in the collection.\"</ref> In 1925, he was awarded the Grand Prix for book illustration at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\"/> That same year, he created graphic and typographic vignettes for the [[Deberny and Peignot]] foundry. Latour's innovative idea was to create iterative motifs that could be combined ad infinitum like the letters of the alphabet; the motive would prove to be a commercial success for many years.\n\nIn 1927, he settled in [[Montparnasse]], the hub of Paris artistic and intellectual life that attracted many painters, writers and musicians, many of whom were exiles. He became involved with the art book milieu, starting to work on bookbinding, embellishments and illustrations of more than thirty books.<ref>[[Louis Koopman]], a scientist, high-tech entrepreneur, art connoisseur and book lover particularly fond of French literature, included Le Voyage d'Urien, along with other books illustrated by Latour, in his famous collection of rare books. The collection is currently in the holdings of The National Library of the Netherlands.</ref> This work enabled him to become friends with many authors including poet [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]], novelist [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], and art historian [[Andr\u00e9 Focillon]].<ref>In 1920 art historian [[Henri Focillon]] commissioned Latour to illustrate his book \"L'Ile oubli\u00e9e\" (\"The Forgotten Island\"); in 1953, he published an article titled ''Estampes en couleurs grav\u00e9es sur bois'' (\"Colour Woodcuts and Prints\") in Arts et M\u00e9tiers Graphiques (N\u00b029, 1953) where he wrote: \"Latour considers that wood is not simply the substance of graphic speculation, but that it also offers rich plastic possibilities that can admit the dreams of a painter.\"</ref> It also led him to receiving several prizes in international exhibitions, which he shared with renowned artists such as [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]], [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]], [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Raoul Dufy|Dufy]], [[Picasso]], and [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]]. His modernist aesthetic and his sober and refined style also drew the attention of the [[Lyon]] silk manufacturers [http://www.bianchiniferier.com Maison Bianchini-F\u00e9rier] who commissioned him several designs for their exclusive fabrics.\n\nHe then turned to photography, which revealed yet another aspect of his talent. He became the Paris correspondent of an international press agency.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\">Documents belonging to the Latour family (available upon request for consultation, please contact the [http://www.alfred-latour.org Foundation]).</ref> His favourite subjects were street scenes, fairs and the fishermen on the banks of the [[Seine]]. He captured these slices of life for the newspaper [[L'Ami du peuple]]<ref>[[Laure Albin Guillot]] who photographed the Parisian intelligentsia of arts and letters photographed Latour for her exhibition titled \"Portraits of Men\" that included portraits of [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]], [[Julien Green]], [[Mo\u00efse Kisling]], [[Louis Lumi\u00e8re]], [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] and [[Darius Milhaud]].</ref> with his quick look and his original sense of framing.\n<br />\nSuccess, however, never went to Latour's head; it actually started to irk him. He felt he needed silence and concentration to deepen his work. In 1932, he broke away from Parisian metropolitan life for which he had no affinity and bought a \"[[Mas (Proven\u00e7al farmhouse)|mas]]\" (a former sheep stable) in Eygali\u00e8res at the foot of the [[Alpilles]] mountains. In the long-desired solitude of the [[Provence]], he launched on a quest for renewed freedom; he gave up the constraints of woodcutting to devote himself freely to watercolours.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/><ref>In 1932, Latour showed his work at the Galerie La Tortue in Paris. The exhibit was very favorably reviewed in the magazine Les Echos des Arts: \"It comes as no surprise that [Latour's] painting should be as bold, as innovative in its lines, as profound in its composition and as meticulous in its design as his woodcuts were.\".</ref>\n\nIn 1934, he started to work for the wine merchant [http://www.nicolas.com [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Nicolas]]]. Their collaboration would last 30 years during which Latour produced much of the advertisement for the company, including posters and the prestigious yearly catalogue of fine wines, which artists as famous as [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Kees van Dongen|Van Dongen]] and [[Bernard Buffet]] had illustrated before him.<ref>In 1928 the dynamic director of [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Vins Nicolas]], the wine company to which he gave his name, started a luxurious yearly catalogue of his products. Famous designer and publicist [[Cassandre]] was mandated with the typography. In 1940 Latour took over the mandate and continued with this work all his life.</ref> On the other hand, when the renowned printing house Draeger that produced the material for [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Nicolas]] offered Latour to become their Artistic Director, he turned down the offer saying: \"I don't want a collar on my neck, albeit a golden one.\".<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/>\n\nLatour always observed at a distance the vanguard artistic movements of his time. Between 1935 and 1936 he joined the UAM (the [[Union des Artistes Modernes]]) a movement founded in 1929 by architect [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] in reaction to the academicism of the era and the established hierarchies between major and minor arts. Prominent members of the UAM included [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], [[Charlotte Perriand]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Man Ray]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Walter Gropius]]. In the UAM pavilion of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]], Latour presented works in three categories: Art Books and Illustration, Graphic Art, and Advertisement.\n\nWhen the [[Second World War]] broke out, Latour was revolted by the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]] France signed with Germany, which he considered a humiliating capitulation. Ostensibly, he led a quiet life as a painter in [[Eygali\u00e8res]], returning to oil painting, which he had abandoned 20 years previously. At the age of 52, however, he decided to join his son Jacques who was fighting with the partisans of the [[French R\u00e9sistance]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\"/><ref>Jacques participated in the actions of the [[Special Operations Executive|S.O.E.]] and was in charge of organizing the connections with England and the airdrop of armed groups placed under the authority of Commander Buckmaster in [[London]]. In France, the [[Zone libre|Zone Sud]], where Latour and his son resided, was commanded by [[Peter Churchill]]. (He was not related to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]).</ref> In 1944, Jacques was arrested and deported to [[Dachau]]. He survived and became the curator of the Arles museums after the war. Latour managed to escape arrest thanks to an early warning and hid in Lyon in a hospital administered by a religious order. This forced retreat gave him time for reflection, meditation and produced in him a late awakening to religious faith.\n\nIn 1946, he bought another house on the rocky heights of Eygali\u00e8res where he settled in two studios. One was devoted to his graphic work, while the other was the very private space he reserved for painting. The graphic work included the design of new fonts, page setting and illustrations that he worked on for the wine merchant Nicolas.<ref>Latour participated each year in the Rencontres Internationales de Lure founded by [[Maximilien Vox]]. The exposition gathered typographers, printers, designers, advertisers and publishers. Latour also became a member of the [[ATypI|International Association of Typography (ATypl)]] founded in 1951 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. The Association was founded by Charles Peignot and held its yearly conventions in different European capitals.</ref> He also started working with his friend Pierre Aynard, a silk manufacturer from [[Lyon]] and the owner of the [[Abbaye de Fontenay]]. He thus designed patterns for silk fabrics used in haute couture or in exclusive tapestries.<ref>In 1950, Brunet Lecomte produced a limited series of seven of the so-called Canvases of Fontenay. Latour would then show printed tapestries under the brand Edition des \"Toiles de Fontenay\" at the 1950 [[Salon d'Automne]].</ref>\n\nLatour kept following the developments of the arts in Paris from afar, but was irritated by the increasing influence of the art market. One day he even packed up his canvases that were about to be exhibited at the prestigious [http://www.galeriedefrance.com Galerie de France]: \"How can painters be raised in stables like race horses?\" And: \"How can their work be sold like any old kind of stuff,\" Latour protested.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/>\n<br />\nIn his [[Provence]] retreat Latour thought of nothing but painting, though that did not keep him from cordially welcoming occasional visitors such as painter [[Mario Prassinos]], actors [[G\u00e9rard Philippe]] and [[Nicolas Bataille]], poet [[Henri Pichette]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Allix]], the Rector of the [[University of Lyon]]. Upon the insistence of his friends he also agreed to participate in a few group exhibitions and in the newly created [[Salon de Mai]]. In 1953, he exceptionally agreed to lend his works to the Parisian Galerie Carmine for a personal exhibit that turned out to be quite a success.<ref name=\"Newspaper reviews\">On 7 March 1953 Robert Vrinat wrote in L'Actualit\u00e9 Artistique Internationale: \"Alfred Latour is an artist with a rich past. This does not keep him from being on the lookout for new possibilities and from progressing with his work. In our time so agitated by multiple tendencies and trends, he develops his very personal and profoundly interesting style.\" Among the throngs of visitors one could distinguish some particularly informed amateurs, such as art critic and curator of the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] [[Jean Cassou]], Latour's patron and friend Etienne Nicolas, art critic and professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France [[Andr\u00e9 Chastel]], the celebrated typographer [[Maximilien Vox]], renowned printer [[Charles Peignot]], and of course fellow painters, [[Yves Brayer]], [[L\u00e9on Gischia]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Andr\u00e9 Marchand (painter)|Andr\u00e9 Marchand]] and many others. On 1 April 1962 Francis Carlier, wrote in [[Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]]: \"Latour's colors welcome the spectator with great commotion. His paintings have attracted to the Galerie La Calade a throng of art amateurs and connoisseurs. (...) Despite the calculated rigidity of their lines, all the works of the exhibition give the impression of intense life and silent poetry.\"\n\nOn 1 April 1962 Le M\u00e9ridional-La France published an article that said: \"Alfred Latour is a modern painter who does not yield to excess; his soul is strong, sensitive, clear and humane. Everything in his work bears the mark of great care. His motto may well be: \"put your work twenty times upon the anvil.\"\n\nIn [[Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises]], on 19 April 1962, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cingria wrote: \"Everything in Latour's painting reminds us that he has been at the same time an extraordinary engraver and a typographer. Through his paintings we see that man whose talent has been admired by all specialists\u2014.\"\n\nLe M\u00e9ridional \u2013 La France, on 22 April 1962, insisted: \"Alfred Latour is the author of a considerable oeuvre, but as a painter he has seldom been exhibited. That is why many connoisseurs discover his talent in that field only now. Latour leaves the beaten track and in all his works he expresses original personality. In everyday life, his main trait is his modesty which is only equaled by his immense talent.\"\n\nOn 19 April 1962, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cingria wrote in [[Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises]]: \"Everything in Latour's painting reminds us that he has been at the same time an extraordinary engraver and a typographer.

Samat wrote in Le M\u00e9ridional on 15 December 1962: \"Alfred Latour steers clear of any artificiality and any obvious creative process; most of all, he is not sensitive to any of the fads of the time. (...) Because he has definitively overcome all technical problems, his conception of nature reaches us through movingly sparse expression and it seems that each work is an open window onto his soul, as each work fills us with a wonderful feeling of peace, light and youth.\n<br />\nLast, but not least, Camille Rouvier, in Le Proven\u00e7al on 19 December 1962 stated: \"Latour's work is made of classic balance \u2014 it is a balance that is eternal and always new! His art is that of the geometry of space. The straight line, the Golden Rule of drawing, is the trademark of his righteousness and probity. Some complain that they find that this painting cold \u2014 as if Bach's music was could be cold!\"\n</ref> However, Latour only started to feel the pressing need to make his painting better known after 1962 when he started to become alarmed by his developing heart condition. He then showed his work at the Galerie La Calade, in [[Avignon]], the Galerie Garibaldi in [[Marseille]], as well as at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in [[Paris]]. In all cases the reviews were unanimously eulogistic.\n\nLatour died in his studio after suffering a stroke on 4 March 1964 at the age of 76.\n\n== The Work of Alfred Latour ==\n\nRigorousness and freedom, modernity and independence, geometry and lyricism: these could be the key words defining the vast variety of Latour's talents and skills. The man was an explorer of art and he loved to venture into uncharted territories, meet new challenges and develop new techniques of visual expression. However, to him this diversity of approaches really meant searching for profound coherence. Whether it was in a landscape, in framing a photograph, etching a vignette, conceiving a poster for an ad or drawing a design for a fabric, he permanently rejected academicism, hackneyed tradition and ready-made solutions. He always showed his independence and resolutely refused to be enrolled in any school or movement. The history of these vanguards and their ideologies bore little relation to his personal history. Latour was certainly a Modernist, but not a diehard revolutionary artist: he sought to reinterpret the artistic tradition in the light of his own perception of the world and reach through it an ideal of essential simplicity.\n\n=== The Painted Work and Drawing ===\n\nAt the [[Ecole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]], the teaching of painting was still very much under the influence of [[Impressionism]]. In 1908, however, [[Impressionism]] had lost most of its attraction; even [[Monet]] had left it behind to explore new forms. At the 1905 [[Salon d'Automne]], [[Matisse]] and the other [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] scandalized the small world of art by totally freeing color, and in 1907 [[Picasso]]'s [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] ignited the controversy of the [[Cubist|Cubism]] revolution and its ingenious deconstruction of space. Latour observed all this, but kept looking for a language of his own.\n<br />\nFrom his early sketches in Paris or in Normandy, Latour's technique had always been sure, self-reliant and fluid; he never sought to describe but rather to evoke with an innate sense of formal ellipsis and economy of means. His impressionist schooling gave him a feel for atmospheric skies, moving waters and intense ambiances that he produced through the supple strokes of his brush. From the start too he sought to push very far the simplification of forms, leaving details aside to attain comprehensible and vivid, though pared down, visions of the world.\n\nHis work is akin to visual haikus: the painting bears the somewhat hard trace of his brush; his drawings are \"written\" in hasty and tense ink gravid with allusion. Latour was a master of blacks and greys on bistre-coloured paper; with a few strokes he knew how to enhance the light on the paper and thus managed to convey the vastness and the energy of skies and sees in very small pieces. Even diminutive woodcuts, be they portraits or landscapes, bear the mark of his spirited style.\n<br />\nThe encounter with the southern light of [[Provence]] in the 1930s and 1940s opened up his palette and enriched it with the solar hues of a tamed [[Fauvism]]. The colours of the works of that period are intense but much less burning than [[Matisse]]'s, [[Derain]]'s and [[Braque]]'s pyrotechnics of the 1910s. From 1940, Latour returned to oil painting that he had abandoned 20 years before and developed a chromatist lyricism he had inherited from [[Fauvism]]. He also used this chromatic palette with bluish shadows that structure the arid and rocky landscapes he painted of [[Eygali\u00e8res]].\n<br />\nLatour's quest for formal freedom, for more light and simplicity, did not stop there. He was a man that kept going back indefatigably, almost obsessively, to his work. In the mid-1940s oil painting had the lion's share in Latour's production, which expressed the evident pleasure he must have had to paint. The post-war years were a new era for him, and in his increasingly free style pieces such as \"The Banks of the Rh\u00f4ne\", \"Les Sainte-Maries de la Mer\", and \"Avignon\" now consisted of solid surfaces of color, silhouetted shapes and stylized forms. The drawings too seem to have been made with one quick remorseless stroke and capture stenographically the laconic and expressive sparseness of the [[Alpilles]] or the [[Camargue]].\n\nLatour's quest for simplicity took him to the brim of abstraction, though he never made the final step. His work gradually evolved toward a poetic code that enabled him to evoke with a few lines and a few colour strokes a \"Landscape in the [[Beaujolais]]\", the contours of \"Avignon\", \"Collioures\", the mountains, the [[Alpilles]], white clouds, rice fields, and \"Tulips against a Red Backdrop\". From the end of the 1940s to his last landscapes and bouquets, Latour flirted with geometry both rigorously and playfully. His geometric compositions are made of colour surfaces that his drawing lines\u2014sometimes as fine as a pencil and sometimes as thick as brush stroke\u2014cross freely. In these late works it is as if colour and form were autonomous; they are like two musical scores that respond to and echo each other in superimpositions, crossings and counterpoint.\n\nThe novelist [[Henri Feyt]] and the Director of [[Gallimard]], [[Louis Evrard]], tell the following anecdote: on a spring day of 1969, [[Picasso]]\u2014who would never miss the Easter bullfight in [[Arles]]\u2014noticed a painting on the wall of Andr\u00e9's bookstore in that town. \"Who is this by?\" he asked. \"Alfred Latour; he is dead now,\" was the storeowner's reply. \"How come I never met him?\" wondered the great Pablo.<ref>The anecdote was told to Madeleine Latour by Mr. Andr\u00e9, the owner of the bookshop: page 27 of the full biography of Alfred Latour [http://www.alfred-latour.org/alfred_latour/files/latour_biography.pdf internet site]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from the Foundation Alfred Latour</ref>\n\n=== The Graphic Work ===\n\nLatour's graphic work may appear to be close to that of [[Raoul Dufy]], not just because the two men were born and died exactly 11 years apart, but more importantly because like him he was a one-man band of visual arts. He was an artist who mastered (almost) all techniques and languages of pictorial representation: he was a painter and a drawer, of course, but also a wood engraver, a publicist, a font designer, a bookbinder, an illustrator, a set designer, a graphic designer for objects and fabric patterns, a tapestry designer and a photographer. Although painting was at the heart of his creation, the rest of his activities were not mere potboilers. The diversity of his activities was central to the UAM's ([[Union des Artistes Modernes]]) programme, the movement founded in 1929 by [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]]. Although he detested being enrolled in anything, Latour joined the movement in 1935-36 as a \"graphic designer.\" Latour was thus close to [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], [[Charlotte Perriand]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Man Ray]], [[Cassandre]], [[Jean Lur\u00e7at]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Walter Gropius]], who all shared a distaste for the academicism of the era and the hierarchies between so-called major and minor arts.\n<br />\nLatour's father was a printer and a typographer. The son inherited a sense for good work and a permanent yearning for perfection from his father. Latour's graphic work has \"secured him a choice place in the Golden Book of Print,\" said Roger Ch\u00e2telain, a former Dean of the [[Lausanne]] [[Ecole Romande d'Art Graphiques]] (ERAG). Ch\u00e2telain also underlined the very special place Latour occupies in that book. As with painting, Latour never sought to make his graphic work part of the vanguard that was made up of the Russian [[Suprematism|Suprematists]], the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]], the Dutch of the [[De Stijl]] group and the German school of the [[Bauhaus]].\n<br />\nIn 1908, Austrian architect [[Adolph Loos]] had summed up the extreme rigorousness of radical [[Modernists]] by declaring: \"Ornament is a crime.\" Latour remained faithful to the French tradition he inherited from his father whose taste, in particular for ornament, was resolutely old-fashioned in comparison with the Modernism of the time. Latour's first woodcuts for book illustrations\u2014head letters, frontispieces, ex libris, views of Paris, landscapes and still lives\u2014show Latour was still very much influenced by the French tradition, though they also show his tendency to simplification and graphic effectiveness. The same can be observed in his early illustrated books with works by [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Henri Focillon]]. Soon, however, Latour's graphic work took a sharp modern turn, in particular in his posters, his ads for the newspapers, his surprisingly simple and purified bookbinding design and his inventively simple fabric designs. All these creations bear witness to his tasteful use of colour and the refined rigorousness with which he introduced combinations and variations on playful geometry and sparse composition.\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nCamera in hand, Latour immediately demonstrated he had a photographer's eye. He did not leave an extensive photographic output, but it is of high quality. Latour was the correspondent of a press agency, but his work is not so much documentary as poetic. He seized in black and white shards of life and of the world, minuscule evanescent events of everyday life that his camera arrested in flight. His subjects include pedestrians crossing a street viewed from below knee level, a motorcycle hoisted aboard a ship that seems to be flying through the air, or a fisherman whose amiable smile appears to be squeezed between his Gallic moustache and the beret jammed on his head. He also captured passers-by that look like Lilliputians in front of a giant advertisement for the [[Galeries Lafayette]], people seen from the back as they are looking from a bridge on the [[Seine]] which is not visible in the picture, or an odd and playful accumulation of pipes, wigs, hot-water bottles in a store window. Latour was artistic kin to other street poets like [[Robert Doisneau]], [[Willy Ronis]] and [[Edouard Boubat]]. His keen and mobile eye sought new angles, from above or from below: a bird's-eye view of a bottle of wine and a slice of bread transforms the latter into an original still life. He could focus on a detail and find delight in almost nothing. He would frame precisely and only what he was interested in, even if that meant cutting heads, leaving out the second wheel of a bicycle, or use the windshield of a car as a frame within the frame.\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n=== Painting and drawing ===\n* 1910: Grandville, drawing, ink and pencil, 11,5 x 17,5&nbsp;cm.\n* 1913: The Woods, woodcut, 13 x 18&nbsp;cm.\n* 1916: War Sketch, ink, 10,4 x 16,2&nbsp;cm.\n* 1936: Mas in the Alpilles, watercolor, 29 x 43&nbsp;cm.\n* 1941: Eygali\u00e8res, oil on cardboard, 33 x 41&nbsp;cm.\n* 1945: Avignon, oil on paper, 50 x 65&nbsp;cm.\n* 1948: Landscape of the Beaujolais, oil on canvas, 73 x 92&nbsp;cm.\n* 1954: The Alpilles and White Clouds, oil on canvas, 115 x 146&nbsp;cm.\n* 1957: Tulips on Red Backdrop, oil on canvas, 65 x 50&nbsp;cm.\n\n=== Graphic work ===\n* 1920: Henri Focillon, L'\u00eele oubli\u00e9e (\"The Forgotten Island\"), illustrated book, woodcut, 11 x 9&nbsp;cm, (1 picture).\n* 1928: Charles Baudelaire, The Flowers of Evil, frontispiece, Illustrated book, woodcut, 12 x 8&nbsp;cm.\n* c. 1960: Nicolas Wines: Advertisement poster, 300 x 500&nbsp;cm.\n* 1929: Les Coquillages (\"Shells\"), graphic design on fabric, (printed Tournon fabric), 31 x 28&nbsp;cm.\n* 1948: design for fabric, 49 x 64&nbsp;cm.\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nFrom the Catalogue of Latour's Works, nt., nd.\n* P. 9 : The Wigmaker's Shop Window (c. 1936).\n* P. 14: Photo journalism: Sleepers on a Bench (c. 1936).\n* pp.&nbsp;16\u201317: Passers-By (c. 1936).\n* pp.&nbsp;22\u201323: Portrait of a Fisherman and Sill Life (c. 1936).\n* P. 27: The Flying Motorcycle (c. 1932).\n\n== Main distinctions and exhibitions ==\n* 1913: Paris Salon d'Automne.
