It had been hoped that the amphibian would control the [[cane beetle]] but it became highly destructive within the ecosystem. Spraying the disinfectant at close range has been shown to cause rapid death to toads. It is not known whether the toxins are persistent or whether they harm other Australian flora and fauna.\n\nOwing to concerns over potential harm to other Australian wildlife species, the use of chloroxylenol as an agent for pest control was banned in Western Australia by the [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|Department of Environment and Conservation]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/cane-toad-poison-banned/story-e6frg12c-1225715177178 |title=Cane toad poison banned |date=23 May 2009 |author=Narelle Towie |publisher=Perth Now |accessdate=2 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115231500/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/cane-toad-poison-banned/story-e6frg12c-1225715177178 |archivedate=15 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nSoon after it was created ''parachlorometaxylenol'' was then called ''PCMX'', but this was thought to be a poor name and it was renamed ''Dettol''.
