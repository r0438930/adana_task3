It was founded in 1983 by [[Egypt]]ian-born [[Frank Agrama]] and is managed by his daughter, Jehan F.

They also operate a screening room in Los Angeles.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings in late 1970s===\nIn 1976, [[Frank Agrama]] began selling broadcast rights from [[Paramount Pictures]] to his friend, former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi|Silvio Berlusconi's]] [[Mediaset]] media company. In the late 1970s, Agrama, while in a trade fair in [[Cannes]], [[France]], met [[Hong Kong]] [[entrepreneur]]s Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun. The three agreed to form a collaboration to trade movie rights internationally. Chan set up Hong Kong-based company Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, while Agrama set up Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>  \nIn 1983, Agrama founded Harmony Gold USA.

Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}</ref> The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]]. The opening credits featured Harmony Gold, with Frank Agrama listed as associate producer.\n\n''Shaka Zulu'' went on to become a massive success worldwide, and has developed a [[cult following]] since its premiere in 1986. It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the [[United States]]. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'' and the later ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0703/ktfr15.html|title=Shaka Zulu and visual constructions of history|publisher=Screening the Past|date=30 June 2003}}</ref> Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://camerainthesun.com/?p=25727|title=Joshua Sinclair on Shaka Zulu and apartheid|publisher=Camera in the Sun|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====''Robotech'' (1985)====\nIn the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired [[Carl Macek]] to adapt [[Japan]]ese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' only, but was instead forced to combine it with two other [[anime]] series together, even though they had no relation to Macross. These three series became ''[[Robotech]]''. The other two series used are:\n\n#''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]''\n#''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''<ref>(NOTE: ''[[Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' was originally planned to be used as the third \"season\" after ''Macross'' & ''Southern Cross''. However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''. Additionally, both Mospeada, and Orguss predate Southern Cross)</ref>\n\nHarmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit an American produced movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.\n\n===Late 1980s to early 2000s===\nIn 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.\n\nIn 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].\n\nFrom 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', which would have been an American produced spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.\n\n===2000s and beyond===\nHarmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release the American produced ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.\n\nIn August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.\n\n==Legal problems==\n\nHarmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.\n\n===Mediaset conviction===\nOn November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's [[Mediaset]] media empire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/29/local/me-agrama29|title=Federal agents search producer's home, office|language=English|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi#Mediaset television and cinema rights .28false accounting.2C embezzlement and tax fraud.29|trial]] involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices.<ref name=\"bbcfraud\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentenced for tax fraud | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207101452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|archivedate=7 February 2014}}</ref> As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', on November 21, 2006 prosecutors in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] charged Agrama, along with Berlusconi and ten others, in a trial over tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting at Mediaset.\n\n===Mediatrade acquittal===\n\nIn October 2011, Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun, along with nine others (including Frank Agrama and [[Pier Silvio Berlusconi]], son of Silvio Berlusconi), were indicted by a Milan court and charged with buying rights for US television series and movies, then reselling them to broadcasting rights firm Mediatrade (a subsidiary of Mediaset) at inflated prices and laundering the money in a complex scheme. The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediaset-mediatrade-idUSKBN0E21FH20140522#DvRYAqYgWZjC0iay.97|title=Hong Kong set to hand over Berlusconi-related evidence|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in [[Cannes]], [[France]] in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.\n\nProsecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million. Earlier in 2005, Swiss investigators froze 150 million francs (HK$1.29 billion) at a UBS branch in Lugano belonging to Harmony Gold, Wiltshire Trading and other companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 24, 2014, [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] reported that some of the charges have been dropped due to expiring [[statute of limitations]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957401.html?categoryid=22&cs=1 | title=Judge throws out some Berlusconi charges | author=Nick Vivarelli | work=Variety | accessdate=2015-12-11 | date=2014}}</ref> An appeals hearing was set to take place January 20, 2016.<ref name=\"afr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-duesse.it/News/Televisione/Mediatrade-il-20-gennaio-inizia-l-appello-195937|work=e-duesse|date=November 9, 2015|title=Mediatrade, il 20 gennaio inizia l\u2019appello|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> On January 18, 2016, all charges against Frank Agrama and five other people were dropped.

They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.\n\nMost notably, many early designs used in ''[[BattleTech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of ''Macross'', with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of BattleTech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.\n\nHarmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>  The company claims that the images portray \u2019mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213803/http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | archive-date=2012-09-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set \"G.I.

Harmony Gold's license for ''Macross'' came from [[Tatsunoko Production]], but Japanese courts ruled that it was [[Studio Nue]] (creators of the series) that controls the ''Macross'' intellectual property. The license Tatsunoko was given was for international distribution outside Japan only, and does not allow them to control the intellectual property.\n\nIn November 2016, Harmony Gold initiated arbitration against Tatsunoko, to which Tatsunoko responded with counterclaims.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knaub|first1=Kelly|title=Judge OKs Production Co.'s $850K Award In License Dispute - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/957616/judge-oks-production-co-s-850k-award-in-license-dispute|website=Law360|accessdate=19 September 2017|location=New York|date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> With the exception of the original visual depictions of 41 characters, which are owned by [[Big West Advertising]] not Tatsunoko, the arbitrator found that Harmony Gold had the rights to ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'', ''Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross'', and ''Genesis Climber MOSPEADA'' until their expiry on March 14, 2021, as per the licensing agreement. Harmony Gold also holds several trademarks related to ''Macross'' and its trademark for the ''Macross'' series was renewed on December 26, 2012. The expiration date for these was set to take place ten years from that date, on December 26, 2022.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmony Gold's Macross, Mospeada, Southern Cross Licenses Still Expire in 2021|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-09-14/harmony-gold-macross-mospeada-southern-cross-licenses-still-expire-in-2021/.121372|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=19 September 2017|date=14 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn July 5, 2019, Harmony Gold confirmed that their license with Tatsunoko had been renewed again, extending their ownership of the ''Macross'' franchise's co-copyright past the original 2021 expiration date.

Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example ''The Brave Frog'' and ''Robotech'' in the UK.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Empty section|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official|http://www.harmonygold.com/}}\n* {{IMDb company|id=0027738}}\n\n{{Robotech}}\n{{Animated television series created for syndication}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harmony Gold Usa}}\n[[Category:Anime companies]]\n[[Category:Dubbing (filmmaking)]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Macross]]\n[[Category:Robotech]]\n[[Category:Television production companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Video game development companies]]\n[[Category:Video game publishers]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=May 2016}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name           = Harmony Gold USA, Inc.\n| trade_name     = Harmony Gold\n| logo           = HarmonyGoldLogo.jpg\n| logo_size      = 240px\n| type           = [[Private company]]\n| foundation     = {{start date and age|1983}}\n| location       = [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], U.S.\n| key_people     = {{plainlist|\n*Frank Agrama, [[Chairman]]\n*Jehan F.

In the late 1970s, Agrama, while in a trade fair in [[Cannes]], [[France]], met [[Hong Kong]] [[entrepreneur]]s Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun. The three agreed to form a collaboration to trade movie rights internationally. Chan set up Hong Kong-based company Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, while Agrama set up Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>  \nIn 1983, Agrama founded Harmony Gold USA.

Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}</ref> The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]]. The opening credits featured Harmony Gold, with Frank Agrama listed as associate producer.\n\n''Shaka Zulu'' went on to become a massive success worldwide, and has developed a [[cult following]] since its premiere in 1986. It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the [[United States]]. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'' and the later ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0703/ktfr15.html|title=Shaka Zulu and visual constructions of history|publisher=Screening the Past|date=30 June 2003}}</ref> Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://camerainthesun.com/?p=25727|title=Joshua Sinclair on Shaka Zulu and apartheid|publisher=Camera in the Sun|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====''Robotech'' (1985)====\nIn the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired [[Carl Macek]] to adapt [[Japan]]ese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' only, but was instead forced to combine it with two other [[anime]] series together, even though they had no relation to Macross. These three series became ''[[Robotech]]''. The other two series used are:\n\n#''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]''\n#''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''<ref>(NOTE: ''[[Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' was originally planned to be used as the third \"season\" after ''Macross'' & ''Southern Cross''. However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''. Additionally, both Mospeada, and Orguss predate Southern Cross)</ref>\n\nHarmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit an American produced movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.\n\n===Late 1980s to early 2000s===\nIn 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.\n\nIn 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].\n\nFrom 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', which would have been an American produced spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.\n\n===2000s and beyond===\nHarmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release the American produced ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.\n\nIn August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.\n\n==Legal problems==\n\nHarmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.\n\n===Mediaset conviction===\nOn November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's [[Mediaset]] media empire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/29/local/me-agrama29|title=Federal agents search producer's home, office|language=English|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi#Mediaset television and cinema rights .28false accounting.2C embezzlement and tax fraud.29|trial]] involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices.<ref name=\"bbcfraud\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentenced for tax fraud | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207101452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|archivedate=7 February 2014}}</ref> As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', on November 21, 2006 prosecutors in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] charged Agrama, along with Berlusconi and ten others, in a trial over tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting at Mediaset.\n\n===Mediatrade acquittal===\n\nIn October 2011, Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun, along with nine others (including Frank Agrama and [[Pier Silvio Berlusconi]], son of Silvio Berlusconi), were indicted by a Milan court and charged with buying rights for US television series and movies, then reselling them to broadcasting rights firm Mediatrade (a subsidiary of Mediaset) at inflated prices and laundering the money in a complex scheme. The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediaset-mediatrade-idUSKBN0E21FH20140522#DvRYAqYgWZjC0iay.97|title=Hong Kong set to hand over Berlusconi-related evidence|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in [[Cannes]], [[France]] in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.\n\nProsecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million. Earlier in 2005, Swiss investigators froze 150 million francs (HK$1.29 billion) at a UBS branch in Lugano belonging to Harmony Gold, Wiltshire Trading and other companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 24, 2014, [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] reported that some of the charges have been dropped due to expiring [[statute of limitations]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957401.html?categoryid=22&cs=1 | title=Judge throws out some Berlusconi charges | author=Nick Vivarelli | work=Variety | accessdate=2015-12-11 | date=2014}}</ref> An appeals hearing was set to take place January 20, 2016.<ref name=\"afr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-duesse.it/News/Televisione/Mediatrade-il-20-gennaio-inizia-l-appello-195937|work=e-duesse|date=November 9, 2015|title=Mediatrade, il 20 gennaio inizia l\u2019appello|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> On January 18, 2016, all charges against Frank Agrama and five other people were dropped.

They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.\n\nMost notably, many early designs used in ''[[Battletech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of ''Macross'', with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of Battletech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.\n\nHarmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>  The company claims that the images portray \u2019mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213803/http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | archive-date=2012-09-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set \"G.I.

Harmony Gold's license for ''Macross'' came from [[Tatsunoko Production]], but Japanese courts ruled that it was [[Studio Nue]] (creators of the series) that controls the ''Macross'' intellectual property. The license Tatsunoko was given was for international distribution outside Japan only, and does not allow them to control the intellectual property.\n\nIn November 2016, Harmony Gold initiated arbitration against Tatsunoko, to which Tatsunoko responded with counterclaims.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knaub|first1=Kelly|title=Judge OKs Production Co.'s $850K Award In License Dispute - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/957616/judge-oks-production-co-s-850k-award-in-license-dispute|website=Law360|accessdate=19 September 2017|location=New York|date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> With the exception of the original visual depictions of 41 characters, which are owned by [[Big West Advertising]] not Tatsunoko, the arbitrator found that Harmony Gold had the rights to ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'', ''Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross'', and ''Genesis Climber MOSPEADA'' until their expiry on March 14, 2021, as per the licensing agreement. Harmony Gold also holds several trademarks related to ''Macross'' and its trademark for the ''Macross'' series was renewed on December 26, 2012.

They released the same films on another UK label Kids Cartoon Collection for the home market during the 1985. Finding a MasterVision or Kids Cartoon Collection (a.k.a. Harmony Gold in the UK) is like striking a pot of Harmony Gold, as they were a rare brand of VHS in the UK. Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example ''The Brave Frog'' and ''Robotech'' in the UK.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Empty section|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official|http://www.harmonygold.com/}}\n* {{IMDb company|id=0027738}}\n\n{{Robotech}}\n{{Animated television series created for syndication}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harmony Gold Usa}}\n[[Category:Anime companies]]\n[[Category:Dubbing (filmmaking)]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Macross]]\n[[Category:Robotech]]\n[[Category:Television production companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Video game development companies]]\n[[Category:Video game publishers]]\n", "name_user": "Bumm13", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLegal issues regarding Macross copyright:capitalization/spelling fixes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Gold_USA"}
