Inspired by prominent public artist Don Rankin to create his own piece of public art, John embarked on the Diver project in 1995. Initially he financed the project himself but later received funding from [[Veolia|Cleanaway]], a local refuse company. Receiving mentoring from Don Rankin, support from the Havering London Borough Council in the person of Adam Nardell and additional financial support from friend, John Bowyer, John was able to complete and site the statue in August 2000 in its current location. It was installed at 3:30 am in order to avoid river traffic.\n\nThe piece is inspired by Kaufman's own family history. His grandfather Friederich Johann Andreas Kaufmann was a diver in the [[London Docks]]<ref name=\"pmsa\">[http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/UEL/HA006.htm Public Monument and Sculpture Association] \u2013 National Recording Project</ref> c. 1900. The sculpture stands as a monument to this man and all working men of the area who have worked in difficult and dangerous conditions. \n\nSoon after the completion of the sculpture, John fell ill and died in 2002.
