The owner of the copyright in a work has the exclusive right to exploit the economic rights. A person infringes copyright in a work when he or she, other than pursuant to a copyright licence, does any of the following \u201crestricted acts\u201d, either in relation to the work as a whole or any \u201csubstantial part\u201d of it: <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/business/intellectual-property/copyright/copyright-protection-in-new-zealand/|title=Copyright protection in New Zealand {{!}} Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment|website=www.mbie.govt.nz|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>\n\n* copying the work\n* publishing, issuing or selling copies to the public\n* performing, playing or showing the work in public\n* broadcasting the work\n* making any work derived or adapted from the copyright work\nAnyone who wants to use someone else\u2019s work requires the permission of the right owner. The copyright owner can assign, transfer, and license the economic rights in the work.\n\n== Copyright works ==\nCopyright automatically applies (no registration required) to original works in the following categories:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Literary works (novels, poems, song lyrics, computer programming/programmes, compilations of data)\n* Dramatic works (scripts for films or plays)\n* Artistic works (paintings, plans, maps, photographs, sculptures, models, buildings)\n* Musical works (scores and arrangements)\n* Sound recordings (of musical, literary or dramatic works)\n* Films\n* Broadcasts (radio, TV, cable)\n* Typographical arrangement of published editions (this exists independent of copyright in the published work, if any)\n\nCopyright does not apply to certain government works, such as Acts of Parliament, Regulations, Parliamentary debates, Court judgments and reports of Select Committees, Royal Commissions, Commissions of Inquiry, etc.\n\n== Copyright term ==\n\nCopyright protection does not last forever. The duration of copyright protection depends on the type of work. The work will eventually enter the public domain. This means that once copyright has expired, everyone can freely use the work. Before such time permission of the rights holder is required to use a copyrighted work. New Zealand's copyright term is largely consistent with [[List of countries' copyright length|other countries]], and complies with the [[WIPO]] standard. The copyright term depends on the type of work in question. \nHere are some examples: <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works: 50 years from the death of the author\n* Sound recordings and films: 50 years from when it is available to the public\n* Broadcasts and cable: 50 years from broadcast\n* Typographical arrangements: 25 years from first publishing\n* Computer-generated work: 50 years after being made \n* Crown copyright: 100 years\n* Artistic works industrially applied: 16 years from when the work is applied\n* Artistic craftsmanship industrially applied: 25 years from when the work is applied\n\n== Exclusions and fair dealing ==\nThe Copyright Act allows for certain permitted acts to be exempted from copyright restrictions. These include: \n* [[fair dealing]] for the purpose of criticism, review, news reporting, research or private study\n* certain educational purposes\n* [[time shifting]] of TV programmes for viewing at a later time\n* [[format shifting]] of music\n* back up of computer programs\n* braille copies of literary or dramatic works\n\n== Moral rights ==\nBesides protecting the economic rights of the author, copyright law also protects the moral rights of an author. Moral rights protect the author from distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work where that act would be or is prejudicial to the reputation of the author. Moral rights are inalienably attached to the author and cannot be transferred. Some moral rights can, however, be waived. Moral rights give the author for instance the right to:\n* be identified as the author (right of attribution)\n* object to derogatory treatment of the work (right of integrity)\n* not have work falsely attributed to them\n\n== New technologies amendments ==\nIn 2001,<ref name=\"review2001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____991.aspx|title=Digital Technology and the Copyright Act 1994: A Discussion Paper|publisher=MED|date=July 2001}}</ref> the Ministry of Economic Development initiated a major review of copyright law, in light of new technologies, such as media in digital form and communications via the internet.
