These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government.

While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an \"equalization\" of all communities, differences still remain.\n\n===The Statute of Autonomy===\n{{Main|Statute of Autonomy}}\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an \"Organic Law\", requiring the favourable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]].\n\nFor communities that acceded to autonomy through the \"fast route\", a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable.\n\nThe constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the state\u2014the central government\u2014in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the state.<ref name=\"article143\" /> In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.<ref name=article143/> In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].\n\n===Institutional organization===\nAll autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:\n* A Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented\n* A Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a prime minister, whose official title is \"president\",{{efn|name=lehendakari|In the Basque Country, the head of government is officially known as ''[[lehendakari]]'' in Basque, or by the Spanish rendering of the title, ''lendakari''.}}{{efn-lr|\"Autonomic president\", \"regional president\", or simply \"president\" (in Spanish: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente regional'', or simply ''presidente''; in Catalan/Valencian: ''president auton\u00f2mic'', ''president regional'', or simply ''president''; in Galician: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente rexional'', or simply ''presidente'').

Despite minor differences, all communities use [[proportional representation]] following [[D'Hondt method]]; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four-year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless in all communities except for the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia elections are held the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all Spain.<ref name=carreras>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Descentralizaci%C3%B3n_en_Perspectiva_Compar.html?id=zkclm60b_yoC|first=Francesc|last=de Carreras Serra|title=El Estado de las Autonom\u00edas en Espa\u00f1a|work=Descentralizaci\u00f3n en Perspectiva Comparada: Espa\u00f1a, Colombia y Brasil|publisher=Plural Editores|year=2005|accessdate=12 October 2012|isbn=978-9990563573}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish Crown\u2014like the Generalitat of Catalonia\u2014while others are entirely new creations.\n\nIn some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. A specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, ''junta'' may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three \"historical nationalities\", have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance with their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Valencian Community]].\n\n{{Anchor|Autonomous cities}}The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, who is also the mayor of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councillors.\n\n===Legal powers===\nThe autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize powers (competences) devolved to the 17 autonomous communities, within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an \"asymmetrical homogeneity\".<ref name=perez/> In the words of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] in its ruling of August 5, 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their \"homogeneity and diversity...equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of competences. The autonomic regime is characterized by an equilibrium between homogeneity and diversity ... Without the former there will be no unity or integration in the state's ensemble; without the latter, there would not be [a] true plurality and the capacity of self-government\".<ref name=sinopsis137>{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=137&tipo=2|title=Sin\u00f3psis art\u00edculo 137|first=Julio|last=Castelao|work=Constituci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola (con sin\u00f3psis)| publisher=[[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of the Deputies]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ertzaintza Volkswagen Bilbao.jpg|thumb|An [[Ertzaintza]] police car in the Basque Country]]\nThe asymmetrical devolution is a unique characteristic of the territorial structure of Spain, in that the autonomous communities have a different range of devolved competences.

These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government.

They could have established a parliamentary system like the \"historical nationalities\", or they could have not assumed any legislative powers and simply established mechanisms for the administration of the competences they were granted.<ref name=perez/><ref name=clavero/>\n\nOnce the autonomous communities were created, Article 145 prohibits the \"federation of autonomous communities\".

While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an \"equalization\" of all communities, differences still remain.\n\n===The Statute of Autonomy===\n{{Main|Statute of Autonomy}}\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an \"Organic Law\", requiring the favourable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]].\n\nFor communities that acceded to autonomy through the \"fast route\", a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable.\n\nThe constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the state\u2014the central government\u2014in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the state.<ref name=\"article143\" /> In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.<ref name=article143/> In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].\n\n===Institutional organization===\nAll autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:\n* A Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented\n* A Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a prime minister, whose official title is \"president\",{{efn|name=lehendakari|In the Basque Country, the head of government is officially known as ''[[lehendakari]]'' in Basque, or by the Spanish rendering of the title, ''lendakari''.}}{{efn-lr|\"Autonomic president\", \"regional president\", or simply \"president\" (in Spanish: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente regional'', or simply ''presidente''; in Catalan/Valencian: ''president auton\u00f2mic'', ''president regional'', or simply ''president''; in Galician: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente rexional'', or simply ''presidente'').

Despite minor differences, all communities use [[proportional representation]] following [[D'Hondt method]]; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four-year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless in all communities except for the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia elections are held the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all Spain.<ref name=carreras>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Descentralizaci%C3%B3n_en_Perspectiva_Compar.html?id=zkclm60b_yoC|first=Francesc|last=de Carreras Serra|title=El Estado de las Autonom\u00edas en Espa\u00f1a|work=Descentralizaci\u00f3n en Perspectiva Comparada: Espa\u00f1a, Colombia y Brasil|publisher=Plural Editores|year=2005|accessdate=12 October 2012|isbn=978-9990563573}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish Crown\u2014like the Generalitat of Catalonia\u2014while others are entirely new creations.\n\nIn some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. A specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, ''junta'' may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three \"historical nationalities\", have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance with their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Valencian Community]].\n\n{{Anchor|Autonomous cities}}The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, who is also the mayor of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councillors.\n\n===Legal powers===\nThe autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize powers (competences) devolved to the 17 autonomous communities, within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an \"asymmetrical homogeneity\".<ref name=perez/> In the words of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] in its ruling of August 5, 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their \"homogeneity and diversity...equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of competences.
