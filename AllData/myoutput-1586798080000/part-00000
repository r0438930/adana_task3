In 1812, he was governor of Moscow during the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|invasion]] of the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] under [[Napoleon I of France]]. While facts concerning the origin of the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|great fire of Moscow]] are disputed by historians, Sophie Rostopchine's father has been said by some to have organized (despite opposition from the wealthy property-owners in the city) the great fire which forced Napoleon to make a disastrous retreat.\n\nIn 1814 the Rostopchine family left [[Imperial Russia]] for exile, going first to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], then to the [[German Confederation]] and the [[Italian peninsula]] and finally in 1817 to [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|France under the Bourbon Restoration]].

The marriage was largely an unhappy one: her husband was flighty, distant and poor (until being made a [[Peerage of France|Peer of France]] in 1830), and his infrequent conjugal visits to their ch\u00e2teau des Nouettes (near [[L'Aigle]], Orne) produced eight children, including the father of the historian [[Pierre de S\u00e9gur]] (Eug\u00e8ne de S\u00e9gur is said to have called his wife \"la m\u00e8re Gigogne\", or \"Mother Gigogne\" in reference to a theatre character of 1602, an enormous woman out of whose skirts a crowd of children appeared).\n\nThe Comtesse de S\u00e9gur wrote her first novel at the age of 58.\n\n==Novels==\nThe novels of the Countess of S\u00e9gur were published from 1857 to 1872 in the \"Biblioth\u00e8que rose illustr\u00e9e\" by the publishing house [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette]].
