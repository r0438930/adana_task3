When no respirators are left, workers who are at higher risk for severe illness may be excluded from caring for patients, and workers who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 may be preferred to care for patients.  Portable fans with [[HEPA]] filters may also be used to increase ventilation in isolation rooms when surgical masks are being used in place of respirators.

In this case, best practices for getting a good face seal include trying different models or sizes, using a mirror or asking a colleague to check that the respirator is touching the face, and doing multiple user seal checks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGiven that the global supply of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) is insufficient during the pandemic, the [[World Health Organization]] recommends minimizing the need for PPE through [[telemedicine]], physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE [[supply chain]], and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite web|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331215/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf|title=Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)|last=|first=|date=2020-02-27|website=World Health Organization|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nWhen it is no longer possible for all healthcare workers to wear N95 respirators when caring for a COVID-19 patient, CDC recommends that respirators be prioritized for workers performing aerosol-generating procedures on symptomatic persons, and those within three feet of an unmasked symptomatic person. Under these conditions, masking of symptomatic patients with a [[surgical mask]] and maintaining distance from the patient are particularly important to reduce the risk of transmission.  When no respirators are left, workers who are at higher risk for severe illness may be excluded from caring for patients, and workers who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 may be preferred to care for patients.  Portable fans with [[HEPA]] filters may also be used to increase ventilation in isolation rooms when surgical masks are being used in place of respirators.  If neither respirators nor surgical masks are available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for healthcare workers to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks, such as [[Cloth face mask|cloth face masks]], though caution should be exercised when considering this option.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Decontamination ====\nDisposable filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 masks are not approved for routine decontamination and reuse as standard of care.
