They suggested he do a duet with [[Shaun Murphy (singer)|Shaun \"Stoney\" Murphy]], who had performed with him in ''Hair'', to which he agreed. The Motown production team in charge of the album wrote and selected the songs while Meat Loaf and Stoney came in only to lay down their vocals. The album, titled ''[[Stoney & Meatloaf]]'' (with Meat Loaf misspelled as one word) was completed in the summer of 1971 and released in September of that year. A single released in advance of the album, \"What You See Is What You Get\", reached number thirty-six on the Best Selling Soul Singles chart (the same chart is now titled [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]) and seventy-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. To support their album, Meat Loaf and Stoney toured with [[Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers]], opening for [[Richie Havens]], [[the Who]], [[the Stooges]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]]. Meat Loaf left soon after Motown replaced his and Stoney's vocals from the one song he liked, \"Who Is the Leader of the People?\" with new vocals by [[Edwin Starr]]. The album has been re-released after Meat Loaf's success, with Stoney's vocals removed. Meat Loaf's version of \"Who Is the Leader of the People?\" was released; however, the album failed.\n\nIn December 1972, Meat Loaf was in the original [[off-Broadway]] production of ''Rainbow'' at the Orpheum Theatre in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/meat-loaf-rainbow-james-rado-broadway-1792824065|title=Meat Loaf \"RAINBOW\" James Rado / Off-Broadway Musical 1972 Premiere Playbill {{!}} #1792824065|website=Worthpoint.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>\n\n===''More Than You Deserve''===\nAfter the tour, Meat Loaf rejoined the cast of ''Hair'', this time on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]].

He sang a former Stoney and Meatloaf favorite of his, \"(I'd Love to Be) As Heavy as Jesus\", and subsequently got the part of Rabbit, a maniac that blows up his fellow soldiers so they can \"go home.\" [[Ron Silver]] and [[Fred Gwynne]] were also in the show. In the summer between the show's workshop production (April 1973) and full production (Nov 1973 - Jan 1974), he appeared in a [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare In The Park]] production of ''[[As You Like It]]'' with [[Raul Julia]] and [[Mary Beth Hurt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/bf9f8856-a142-7a91-e040-e00a18062ca3|title=Meat Loaf and Raul Julia in the New York Shakespeare Festival stage production As You Like It|website=Digitalcollections.nypl.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>\n\nHe recorded a single of \"More Than You Deserve\", with a [[cover version|cover]] of \"[[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|Presence of the Lord]]\" as the B-side.

Meat Loaf convinced [[Epic Records]] to shoot [[music video|videos]] for four songs, \"[[Bat Out of Hell (song)|Bat Out of Hell]]\", \"[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]\", \"[[You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth]]\", and \"[[Two Out of Three Ain't Bad]]\". He then convinced [[Lou Adler]], the producer of ''Rocky Horror'', to run the \"Paradise\" video as a trailer to the movie. Meat Loaf's final theatrical show in New York was [[Gower Champion]]'s ''[[Rockabye Hamlet]]'', a [[Hamlet]] musical. It closed two weeks into its initial run. Meat Loaf later returned occasionally to perform \"[[Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\" for a special ''Rocky Horror'' reunion or convention, and rarely at his own live shows (one performance of which was released in the 1996 ''[[Live Around the World (Meat Loaf album)|Live Around the World]]'' CD set).\n\nDuring his recording of the soundtrack for ''Rocky Horror'', Meat Loaf recorded two more songs: \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\" (a [[Ben E. King]] cover), and \"Clap Your Hands\". They remained unreleased until 1984, when they appeared as B-sides to the \"[[Nowhere Fast (song)|Nowhere Fast]]\" single.\n\nIn 1976, Meat Loaf recorded lead vocals for [[Ted Nugent]]'s album ''[[Free-for-All (Ted Nugent album)|Free-for-All]]'' when regular Nugent lead vocalist [[Derek St. Holmes]] temporarily quit the band. Meat Loaf sang lead on five of the album's nine tracks. As on the \"Stoney & Meatloaf\" album, he was credited as Meatloaf (one word) on the \"Free-for-All\" liner notes.\n\n===''Bat Out of Hell''===\nMeat Loaf and Steinman started ''[[Bat Out of Hell]]'' in 1972, but did not get serious about it until the end of 1974. Meat Loaf decided to leave theatre, and concentrate exclusively on music. Then the [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] show ''[[Lemmings (National Lampoon)|Lemmings]]'' opened on Broadway and it needed an understudy for [[John Belushi]], a close friend of Meat Loaf since 1972. It was at the ''Lampoon'' show that Meat Loaf met [[Ellen Foley]], the co-star who sang \"[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]\" and \"[[Bat Out of Hell (song)|Bat Out of Hell]]\" with him on the album ''Bat Out of Hell''.\n\nAfter the ''Lampoon'' show ended, Meat Loaf and Steinman spent time seeking a record deal. Their approaches were rejected by each record company, because their songs did not fit any specific recognized [[music industry]] style. Finally, they performed the songs for [[Todd Rundgren]], who decided to produce the album, as well as play lead guitar on it (other members of Rundgren's band [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] also lent their musical talents).<ref>[http://trbazaar.com/rogerpowell.htm Roger Powell, keyboardist for Utopia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418072915/http://trbazaar.com/rogerpowell.htm |date=April 18, 2008 }}. Retrieved April 30, 2010.</ref> They then shopped the record around, but still had no takers until [[Cleveland International Records]] decided to take a chance. In October 1977, ''Bat Out of Hell'' was finally released.\n\nMeat Loaf and Steinman formed the band [[Neverland Express|The Neverland Express]] to tour in support of ''Bat Out of Hell''. Their first gig was opening for [[Cheap Trick]] in Chicago. He gained national exposure as musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on March 25, 1978. Guest host [[Christopher Lee]] introduced him by saying, \"And now ladies and gentlemen I would like you to meet Loaf. (pauses, looks dumbfounded) I beg your pardon, what? (he listens to the director's aside) Oh! Why...why I'm sorry, yes, of course...ah... Ladies and gentlemen, Meat Loaf!\"\n\n''Bat Out of Hell'' has sold an estimated 43 million copies globally (15 million of those in the United States),<ref name=\"Steinman\"/> making it one of the highest selling albums of all time. In the United Kingdom alone, its 2.1 million sales put it in 38th place. Despite peaking at No. 9 and spending only two weeks in the top ten in 1981, it has now clocked up 485 weeks on the [[UK Albums Chart]] (May 2015), a figure bettered only by ''Rumours'' by Fleetwood Mac\u2014487 weeks.<ref>{{cite news|title=Meat Loaf: In and Out of Hell|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04xdrrb|agency=BBC|date=July 15, 2015}}</ref> In Australia, it knocked the [[Bee Gees]] off the number No. 1 spot and went on to become the biggest-selling Australian album of all time. ''Bat Out of Hell'' is also one of only two albums that has never exited the Top 200 in the UK charts;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/meat%20loaf/ |title=MEAT LOAF &#124; Artist |publisher=Official Charts |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> this makes it the longest stay in any music chart in the world, although the ''published'' chart contains just 75 positions.\n\n===''Dead Ringer''===\nIn 1976, Meat Loaf appeared in the short-lived Broadway production of the rock musical ''[[Rockabye Hamlet]]''.\n\nSteinman started to work on ''[[Bad for Good]]'', the album that was supposed to be the follow-up to 1977's ''Bat out of Hell'', in 1979. During that time, a combination of touring, drugs and exhaustion had caused Meat Loaf to lose his voice. Without a singer, and pressured by the record company, Steinman decided that he should sing on ''Bad for Good'' himself, and write a new album for Meat Loaf; the result was ''[[Dead Ringer (album)|Dead Ringer]]'', which was later released in 1981, after the release of Steinman's ''Bad for Good''.\n\nAfter playing the role of Travis Redfish in the movie ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', Meat Loaf's singing voice returned, and he started to work on his new album in 1980. Steinman had written five new songs which, in addition to the track \"More Than You Deserve\" (sung by Meat Loaf in the stage musical of the same name) and a reworked monologue, formed the album ''Dead Ringer'', which was produced by Meat Loaf and Stephan Galfas, with backing tracks produced by [[Todd Rundgren]], Jimmy Iovine, and Steinman. (In 1976, Meat Loaf appeared on the track \"Keeper Keep Us\", from the Intergalactic Touring Band's self-titled album, produced by Galfas.) The song \"[[Dead Ringer for Love]]\" was the pinnacle of the album, and launched Meat Loaf to even greater success after it reached No. 5 in the United Kingdom and stayed in the charts for a surprising 19 weeks. [[Cher]] provided the lead female vocals in the song.\n\nA comedy/documentary movie was filmed to accompany the release of \"Dead Ringer\", written and produced by Meat Loaf's managers [[David Sonenberg]] and [[Al Dellentash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101673/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_1 |title=Dead Ringer for Love |publisher=IMDB.com }}</ref> It featured Meat Loaf playing two roles: himself, and a Meat Loaf fan, 'Marvin'. Sonenberg persuaded [[CBS]] to advance money for the making of the movie, which was shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and won some favorable reviews.\n\nThe album reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom, and three singles were released from the album: \"Dead Ringer for Love\" (with [[Cher]]), \"I'm Gonna Love Her for Both of Us\", and \"Read 'Em and Weep\".\n\n===''Midnight at the Lost and Found''===\nFollowing a dispute with his former songwriter Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf was contractually obliged to release a new album. Struggling for time, and with, it seemed, no resolution to his arguments with Steinman on the horizon (eventually, Steinman sued Meat Loaf, who subsequently sued Steinman as well), he was forced to find songwriters wherever he could. The resulting album was ''[[Midnight at the Lost and Found]]''.\n\nAccording to Meat Loaf, Steinman had given the songs \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\" and \"[[Making Love Out of Nothing at All]]\" to Meat Loaf for this album. However, Meat Loaf's record company refused to pay for Steinman.<ref>{{cite news|first=Cameron|last=Adams|title=Meat Loaf's a Hell raiser|work=Herald Sun|url= http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/meat-loafs-a-hell-raiser/story-e6frf9hf-1111112415532|date=October 26, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> This was hard luck for Meat Loaf, as [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s version of \"Eclipse\" and [[Air Supply]]'s version of \"Making Love\" topped the charts together, holding No. 1 and No. 2 for a period during 1983.\n\nMeat Loaf is credited with having been involved in the writing of numerous tracks on the album, including the title track, \"Midnight at the Lost and Found\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Giles |first1=Jeff |title=How Meat Loaf Crashed on \u2018Midnight at the Lost and Found\u2019|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/meat-loaf-midnight-at-the-lost-and-found/ |website=ultimateclassicrock.com |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe title track still regularly forms part of Meat Loaf concerts, and was one of few 1980s songs to feature on the 1998 hit album ''[[The Very Best of Meat Loaf]]''.

It was also his last album release via [[Sony Music]] until 2011's ''[[Hell In A Handbasket]].\n\nOn December 5, 1981, Meat Loaf and the Neverland Express were the musical guests for ''Saturday Night Live'' where he and former fellow ''Rocky Horror Picture Show'' actor [[Tim Curry]] performed a skit depicting a One-Stop Rocky Horror Shop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/49706/rocky-horror-facts/|title=Rocky Horror Turns 40: Time Warp to 40 Facts About the Cult Classic|last=McPadden August 15, 2015|first=Mike|website=Vh1.com|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-7/episode/7-tim-curry-with-meat-loaf-65051|title=SNL Season 07 Episode 07 - Tim Curry, Meat Loaf |website=Nbc.com|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> Later, Curry performed \"The Zucchini Song\" and Meat Loaf & the Neverland Express performed \"Bat Out of Hell\" and \"Promised Land\". In 1983, he released the self written ''[[Midnight at the Lost and Found]]''.\n\n===''Bad Attitude''===\nIn 1984, Meat Loaf went to England to record the album ''[[Bad Attitude (album)|Bad Attitude]]''; it was released that year. It features two songs by Steinman, both previously recorded. It was a minor success with a few commercially successful singles, the most successful being \"[[Modern Girl (Meat Loaf song)|Modern Girl]]\". The American release on RCA Records was in April 1985 and features a slightly different track list, as well as alternate mixes for some songs. The title track features a duet with [[the Who]]'s lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]].\n\n\"Modern Girl\" was the first single taken from the album but was only a moderate success on the European Charts.\n\nIn 1986 he and songwriter [[John Parr]] started recording a new album, ''[[Blind Before I Stop]]''. In 1985, Meat Loaf took part in some comedy sketches in the UK, with [[Hugh Laurie]]. Meat Loaf also tried stand-up comedy, appearing several times in Connecticut.<ref name=sagoml/>\n\n===''Blind Before I Stop''===\n''[[Blind Before I Stop]]'' was released in 1986.

The new names included Popcorn Blizzard and Floating Circus.<ref name=\"rickbozzo.com\">{{cite web| url=http://www.rickbozzo.com/meatandme.html| title=Meat Loaf and Me| last=Bozzo| first=Rick| accessdate=January 17, 2009}}</ref> As Floating Circus, they opened for [[the Who]], [[the Fugs]], [[the Stooges]], [[MC5]], [[Grateful Dead]], and [[the Grease Band]]. Their regional success led them to release a single, \"Once Upon a Time\", backed with \"Hello\". Then Meat Loaf joined the Los Angeles production of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.<ref name=\"rickbozzo.com\"/> During an interview with New Zealand radio station [[ZM (New Zealand)|ZM]], Meat Loaf stated that the biggest life struggle he had to overcome was not being taken seriously in the music industry. He compared his treatment to that of a \"circus clown\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zmonline.com/WhosOn/MorningCrew/Highlights/Detail.aspx?id=14469|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222100623/http://zmonline.com/WhosOn/MorningCrew/Highlights/Detail.aspx?id=14469|url-status=dead|title=Meat Loaf interview with ZM's Polly Gillespie|archivedate=December 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stoney & Meat Loaf===\nWith the publicity generated from ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', Meat Loaf was invited to record with [[Motown]]. They suggested he do a duet with [[Shaun Murphy (singer)|Shaun \"Stoney\" Murphy]], who had performed with him in ''Hair'', to which he agreed. The Motown production team in charge of the album wrote and selected the songs while Meat Loaf and Stoney came in only to lay down their vocals. The album, titled ''[[Stoney & Meatloaf]]'' (with Meat Loaf misspelled as one word) was completed in the summer of 1971 and released in September of that year. A single released in advance of the album, \"What You See Is What You Get\", reached number thirty-six on the Best Selling Soul Singles chart (the same chart is now titled [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]) and seventy-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. To support their album, Meat Loaf and Stoney toured with [[Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers]], opening for [[Richie Havens]], [[the Who]], [[the Stooges]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]]. Meat Loaf left soon after Motown replaced his and Stoney's vocals from the one song he liked, \"Who Is the Leader of the People?\" with new vocals by [[Edwin Starr]]. The album has been re-released after Meat Loaf's success, with Stoney's vocals removed. Meat Loaf's version of \"Who Is the Leader of the People?\" was released; however, the album failed.\n\nIn December 1972, Meat Loaf was in the original [[off-Broadway]] production of ''Rainbow'' at the Orpheum Theatre in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/meat-loaf-rainbow-james-rado-broadway-1792824065|title=Meat Loaf \"RAINBOW\" James Rado / Off-Broadway Musical 1972 Premiere Playbill {{!}} #1792824065|website=Worthpoint.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>\n\n===''More Than You Deserve''===\nAfter the tour, Meat Loaf rejoined the cast of ''Hair'', this time on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]. After he hired an agent, he auditioned for the [[Public Theater]]'s production of ''[[More Than You Deserve]]''. During the audition Meat Loaf met his future collaborator [[Jim Steinman]]. He sang a former Stoney and Meatloaf favorite of his, \"(I'd Love to Be) As Heavy as Jesus\", and subsequently got the part of Rabbit, a maniac that blows up his fellow soldiers so they can \"go home.\" [[Ron Silver]] and [[Fred Gwynne]] were also in the show. In the summer between the show's workshop production (April 1973) and full production (Nov 1973 - Jan 1974), he appeared in a [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare In The Park]] production of ''[[As You Like It]]'' with [[Raul Julia]] and [[Mary Beth Hurt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/bf9f8856-a142-7a91-e040-e00a18062ca3|title=Meat Loaf and Raul Julia in the New York Shakespeare Festival stage production As You Like It|website=Digitalcollections.nypl.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>\n\nHe recorded a single of \"More Than You Deserve\", with a [[cover version|cover]] of \"[[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|Presence of the Lord]]\" as the B-side. He was only able to save three copies of it, because the record company did not allow its release.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. He recorded it again (1981) in a slightly rougher voice. The original single came out on RSO SO-407 with some promotional copies bearing both songs, while some were double-A side copies with \"More Than You Deserve\" in mono and stereo on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/artist/meatloaf/us|title=Meatloaf Discography - USA |website=45cat.com}}</ref>\n\n===''The Rocky Horror Picture Show''===\n{{Main|The Rocky Horror Show|The Rocky Horror Picture Show}}\nIn late 1973, Meat Loaf was cast in the original L.A.

Meat Loaf convinced [[Epic Records]] to shoot [[music video|videos]] for four songs, \"[[Bat Out of Hell (song)|Bat Out of Hell]]\", \"[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]\", \"[[You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth]]\", and \"[[Two Out of Three Ain't Bad]]\". He then convinced [[Lou Adler]], the producer of ''Rocky Horror'', to run the \"Paradise\" video as a trailer to the movie. Meat Loaf's final theatrical show in New York was [[Gower Champion]]'s ''[[Rockabye Hamlet]]'', a [[Hamlet]] musical. It closed two weeks into its initial run. Meat Loaf later returned occasionally to perform \"[[Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\" for a special ''Rocky Horror'' reunion or convention, and rarely at his own live shows (one performance of which was released in the 1996 ''[[Live Around the World (Meat Loaf album)|Live Around the World]]'' CD set).\n\nDuring his recording of the soundtrack for ''Rocky Horror'', Meat Loaf recorded two more songs: \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\" (a [[Ben E. King]] cover), and \"Clap Your Hands\". They remained unreleased until 1984, when they appeared as B-sides to the \"[[Nowhere Fast (song)|Nowhere Fast]]\" single.\n\nIn 1976, Meat Loaf recorded lead vocals for [[Ted Nugent]]'s album ''[[Free-for-All (Ted Nugent album)|Free-for-All]]'' when regular Nugent lead vocalist [[Derek St. Holmes]] temporarily quit the band. Meat Loaf sang lead on five of the album's nine tracks. As on the \"Stoney & Meatloaf\" album, he was credited as Meatloaf (one word) on the \"Free-for-All\" liner notes.\n\n===''Bat Out of Hell''===\nMeat Loaf and Steinman started ''[[Bat Out of Hell]]'' in 1972, but did not get serious about it until the end of 1974. Meat Loaf decided to leave theatre, and concentrate exclusively on music. Then the [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] show ''[[Lemmings (National Lampoon)|Lemmings]]'' opened on Broadway and it needed an understudy for [[John Belushi]], a close friend of Meat Loaf since 1972. It was at the ''Lampoon'' show that Meat Loaf met [[Ellen Foley]], the co-star who sang \"[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]\" and \"[[Bat Out of Hell (song)|Bat Out of Hell]]\" with him on the album ''Bat Out of Hell''.\n\nAfter the ''Lampoon'' show ended, Meat Loaf and Steinman spent time seeking a record deal. Their approaches were rejected by each record company, because their songs did not fit any specific recognized [[music industry]] style. Finally, they performed the songs for [[Todd Rundgren]], who decided to produce the album, as well as play lead guitar on it (other members of Rundgren's band [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] also lent their musical talents).<ref>[http://trbazaar.com/rogerpowell.htm Roger Powell, keyboardist for Utopia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418072915/http://trbazaar.com/rogerpowell.htm |date=April 18, 2008 }}. Retrieved April 30, 2010.</ref> They then shopped the record around, but still had no takers until [[Cleveland International Records]] decided to take a chance. In October 1977, ''Bat Out of Hell'' was finally released.\n\nMeat Loaf and Steinman formed the band [[Neverland Express|The Neverland Express]] to tour in support of ''Bat Out of Hell''. Their first gig was opening for [[Cheap Trick]] in Chicago. He gained national exposure as musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on March 25, 1978. Guest host [[Christopher Lee]] introduced him by saying, \"And now ladies and gentlemen I would like you to meet Loaf. (pauses, looks dumbfounded) I beg your pardon, what? (he listens to the director's aside) Oh! Why...why I'm sorry, yes, of course...ah... Ladies and gentlemen, Meat Loaf!\"\n\n''Bat Out of Hell'' has sold an estimated 43 million copies globally (15 million of those in the United States),<ref name=\"Steinman\"/> making it one of the highest selling albums of all time. In the United Kingdom alone, its 2.1 million sales put it in 38th place. Despite peaking at No. 9 and spending only two weeks in the top ten in 1981, it has now clocked up 485 weeks on the [[UK Albums Chart]] (May 2015), a figure bettered only by ''Rumours'' by Fleetwood Mac\u2014487 weeks.<ref>{{cite news|title=Meat Loaf: In and Out of Hell|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04xdrrb|agency=BBC|date=July 15, 2015}}</ref> In Australia, it knocked the [[Bee Gees]] off the number No. 1 spot and went on to become the biggest-selling Australian album of all time. ''Bat Out of Hell'' is also one of only two albums that has never exited the Top 200 in the UK charts;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/meat%20loaf/ |title=MEAT LOAF &#124; Artist |publisher=Official Charts |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> this makes it the longest stay in any music chart in the world, although the ''published'' chart contains just 75 positions.\n\n===''Dead Ringer''===\nIn 1976, Meat Loaf appeared in the short-lived Broadway production of the rock musical ''[[Rockabye Hamlet]]''.\n\nSteinman started to work on ''[[Bad for Good]]'', the album that was supposed to be the follow-up to 1977's ''Bat out of Hell'', in 1979. During that time, a combination of touring, drugs and exhaustion had caused Meat Loaf to lose his voice. Without a singer, and pressured by the record company, Steinman decided that he should sing on ''Bad for Good'' himself, and write a new album for Meat Loaf; the result was ''[[Dead Ringer (album)|Dead Ringer]]'', which was later released in 1981, after the release of Steinman's ''Bad for Good''.\n\nAfter playing the role of Travis Redfish in the movie ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', Meat Loaf's singing voice returned, and he started to work on his new album in 1980. Steinman had written five new songs which, in addition to the track \"More Than You Deserve\" (sung by Meat Loaf in the stage musical of the same name) and a reworked monologue, formed the album ''Dead Ringer'', which was produced by Meat Loaf and Stephan Galfas, with backing tracks produced by [[Todd Rundgren]], Jimmy Iovine, and Steinman. (In 1976, Meat Loaf appeared on the track \"Keeper Keep Us\", from the Intergalactic Touring Band's self-titled album, produced by Galfas.) The song \"[[Dead Ringer for Love]]\" was the pinnacle of the album, and launched Meat Loaf to even greater success after it reached No. 5 in the United Kingdom and stayed in the charts for a surprising 19 weeks. [[Cher]] provided the lead female vocals in the song.\n\nA comedy/documentary movie was filmed to accompany the release of \"Dead Ringer\", written and produced by Meat Loaf's managers [[David Sonenberg]] and [[Al Dellentash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101673/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_1 |title=Dead Ringer for Love |publisher=IMDB.com }}</ref> It featured Meat Loaf playing two roles: himself, and a Meat Loaf fan, 'Marvin'. Sonenberg persuaded [[CBS]] to advance money for the making of the movie, which was shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and won some favorable reviews.\n\nThe album reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom, and three singles were released from the album: \"Dead Ringer for Love\" (with [[Cher]]), \"I'm Gonna Love Her for Both of Us\", and \"Read 'Em and Weep\".\n\n===''Midnight at the Lost and Found''===\nFollowing a dispute with his former songwriter Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf was contractually obliged to release a new album. Struggling for time, and with, it seemed, no resolution to his arguments with Steinman on the horizon (eventually, Steinman sued Meat Loaf, who subsequently sued Steinman as well), he was forced to find songwriters wherever he could. The resulting album was ''[[Midnight at the Lost and Found]]''.\n\nAccording to Meat Loaf, Steinman had given the songs \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\" and \"[[Making Love Out of Nothing at All]]\" to Meat Loaf for this album. However, Meat Loaf's record company refused to pay for Steinman.<ref>{{cite news|first=Cameron|last=Adams|title=Meat Loaf's a Hell raiser|work=Herald Sun|url= http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/meat-loafs-a-hell-raiser/story-e6frf9hf-1111112415532|date=October 26, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> This was hard luck for Meat Loaf, as [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s version of \"Eclipse\" and [[Air Supply]]'s version of \"Making Love\" topped the charts together, holding No. 1 and No. 2 for a period during 1983.\n\nMeat Loaf is credited with having been involved in the writing of numerous tracks on the album, including the title track, \"Midnight at the Lost and Found\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Giles |first1=Jeff |title=How Meat Loaf Crashed on \u2018Midnight at the Lost and Found\u2019|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/meat-loaf-midnight-at-the-lost-and-found/ |website=ultimateclassicrock.com |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe title track still regularly forms part of Meat Loaf concerts, and was one of few 1980s songs to feature on the 1998 hit album ''[[The Very Best of Meat Loaf]]''.

It was also his last album release via [[Sony Music]] until 2011's ''[[Hell In A Handbasket]].\n\nOn December 5, 1981, Meat Loaf and the Neverland Express were the musical guests for ''Saturday Night Live'' where he and former fellow ''Rocky Horror Picture Show'' actor [[Tim Curry]] performed a skit depicting a One-Stop Rocky Horror Shop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/49706/rocky-horror-facts/|title=Rocky Horror Turns 40: Time Warp to 40 Facts About the Cult Classic|last=McPadden August 15, 2015|first=Mike|website=Vh1.com|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-7/episode/7-tim-curry-with-meat-loaf-65051|title=SNL Season 07 Episode 07 - Tim Curry, Meat Loaf |website=Nbc.com|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> Later, Curry performed \"The Zucchini Song\" and Meat Loaf & the Neverland Express performed \"Bat Out of Hell\" and \"Promised Land\". In 1983, he released the self written ''[[Midnight at the Lost and Found]]''.\n\n===''Bad Attitude''===\nIn 1984, Meat Loaf went to England to record the album ''[[Bad Attitude (album)|Bad Attitude]]''; it was released that year. It features two songs by Steinman, both previously recorded. It was a minor success with a few commercially successful singles, the most successful being \"[[Modern Girl (Meat Loaf song)|Modern Girl]]\". The American release on RCA Records was in April 1985 and features a slightly different track list, as well as alternate mixes for some songs. The title track features a duet with [[the Who]]'s lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]].\n\n\"Modern Girl\" was the first single taken from the album but was only a moderate success on the European Charts.\n\nIn 1986 he and songwriter [[John Parr]] started recording a new album, ''[[Blind Before I Stop]]''. In 1985, Meat Loaf took part in some comedy sketches in the UK, with [[Hugh Laurie]]. Meat Loaf also tried stand-up comedy, appearing several times in Connecticut.<ref name=sagoml/>\n\n===''Blind Before I Stop''===\n''[[Blind Before I Stop]]'' was released in 1986. It features production, mixing, and general influence by [[Frank Farian]]. Meat Loaf gave songwriting another shot with this album and wrote three of the songs on the album. Released as a single (in the United Kingdom) was ''Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries'', which was a duet with rock singer [[John Parr]]. Another single released in the United Kingdom was \"Special Girl\".\n\nAccording to Meat Loaf's 1998 autobiography, the album sold poorly because of its production.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Meat Loaf would have preferred to cancel the project and wait to work with more Steinman material.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} However, the album gained a cult following over the years, with the songs \"Execution Day\" and \"Standing on the Outside\" as standout tracks on the record.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} \"Standing on the Outside\" was also featured during the third season of the 1980s television series ''[[Miami Vice]]'';<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0647064/soundtrack|title=Miami Vice, Forgive Us Our Debts, Soundtrack (1986)|publisher=IMDB.com|accessdate=June 3, 2019}}</ref> it was used several times during the episode titled \"Forgive Us Our Debts\" (first aired December 12, 1986).\n\nIn the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]], this was the first Meat Loaf album officially permitted to be published, in connection with the beginning of the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThe song ''Masculine'' was the only song from the record that was a live show mainstay from 1987 to 1992.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} He then omitted that song in favor of ''Life Is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back'', with the success of ''Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nMeat Loaf performed \"Thrashin\" for the soundtrack of the 1986 skateboarding film ''[[Thrashin' (film)|Thrashin']]'' (directed by [[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]] and starring [[Josh Brolin]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092085/soundtrack|title=Soundtracks for Thrashin' (1986)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=December 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===''Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell''===\nFollowing the success of Meat Loaf's touring in the 1980s, he and Steinman began work during the Christmas of 1990 on the sequel to ''Bat Out of Hell''.
