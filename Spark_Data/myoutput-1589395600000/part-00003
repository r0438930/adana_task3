The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. ''lokottara'') and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supramundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such \"in conformity with the world\"; omniscience, and the ability to \"suppress karma\".{{sfn|Jones|1956|p=}} As noted by Andrew Skilton, the Buddha was often described as being superhuman, including descriptions of him having the 32 major and 80 minor marks of a \"great man,\" and the idea that the Buddha could live for as long as an aeon if he wished (see DN 16).{{sfn|Skilton|2004|pp=64\u201365}} \n\nThe ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the [[Jain Agamas (\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara)|Jain scriptures]], and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in [[History of India|Indian history]] for which significant accounts exist.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=15}} British author [[Karen Armstrong]] writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure.{{sfn|Armstrong|2000|p=xii}} Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of \"birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death\" must be true.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=}}\n\n== Previous lives ==\n[[File:Ascetic Sumedha and Dipankara Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|The legendary Jataka collections depict the Buddha-to-be in a previous life prostrating before the past Buddha [[Dipankara]], making a resolve to be a Buddha, and receiving a prediction of future Buddhahood.]]\nLegendary biographies like the Pali ''[[Buddhava\u1e43sa]]'' and the Sanskrit ''J\u0101takam\u0101l\u0101'' depict the Buddha's (referred to as \"[[bodhisattva]]\" before his awakening) career as spanning hundreds of lifetimes before his last birth as Gautama.

As noted by Analayo's comparative study of this topic, there are various versions of this event depicted in the different early Buddhist texts.<ref>Analayo (2016), pp. 40\u201341. Analayo draws from seven early sources: \"the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in Four Parts, preserved in Chinese; \u2013 a *Vinayam\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101 preserved in Chinese translation, which some scholars suggest represents the Haimavata tradition; the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika-Lokottarav\u0101da Vinaya, preserved in Sanskrit; \u2013 the Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya in Five Parts, preserved in Chinese; \u2013 the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Vinaya, where the episode is extant in Chinese and Tibetan translation, with considerable parts also preserved in Sanskrit fragments; \u2013 a discourse in the Madhyama-\u0101gama, preserved in Chinese, probably representing the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da tradition; a P\u0101li discourse found among the Eights of the A\u1e45guttara-nik\u0101ya; the same account is also found in the Therav\u0101da Vinaya preserved in P\u0101li.\"  </ref>\n\nAccording to all the major versions surveyed by Analayo, [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b Gautam\u012b]], Buddha's step-mother, is initially turned down by the Buddha after requesting ordination for her and some other women. Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b and her followers then shave their hair, don robes and begin following the Buddha on his travels. The Buddha is eventually convinced by \u0100nanda to grant ordination to Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b on her acceptance of [[Eight Garudhammas|eight conditions called gurudharmas]] which focus on the relationship between the new order of nuns and the monks.<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 43. </ref>\n\nAccording to Analayo, the only argument common to all the versions that Ananda uses to convince the Buddha is that women have the same ability to reach all stages of awakening.<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 79.</ref> Analayo also notes that some modern scholars have questioned the authenticity of the eight gurudharmas in their present form due to various inconsistencies. He holds that the historicity of the current lists of eight is doubtful, but that they may have been based on earlier injunctions by the Buddha.<ref>[[Bhikkhu Analayo|Analayo, Bhikkhu]] (2013). \"The Gurudharmaon Bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b Ordination in the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Tradition\" (PDF).

Due to this, the gurudharma injunctions may have been a way to place \"the newly founded order of nuns in a relationship to its male counterparts that resembles as much as possible the protection a laywoman could expect from her male relatives.\"<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 127.</ref>\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Procession of Prasenajit of Kosala leaving Sravasti to meet the Buddha.jpg|thumb|Procession of King [[Prasenajit]] of [[Kosala]] leaving [[Sravasti]] to meet the Buddha.

Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 136.</ref>\n\nAs the sangha grew in size, the need for a standardized set of monastic rules arose and the Buddha seems to have developed a set of regulations for the sangha. These are preserved in various texts called \"[[Pratimok\u1e63a|Pratimoksa]]\" which were recited by the community every fortnight. The Pratimoksa includes general ethical precepts, as well as rules regarding the essentials of monastic life, such as bowls and robes.<ref>[[John S.

The ''Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta'' identifies six such sects.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 215.</ref>\n\nThe early texts also depict the elderly Buddha as suffering from back pain. Several texts depict him delegating teachings to his chief disciples since his body now needed more rest.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 232.</ref> However, the Buddha continued teaching well into his old age.  \n\nOne of the most troubling events during the Buddha's old age was [[Devadatta|Devadatta's]] schism. Early sources speak of how the Buddha's cousin, Devadatta, attempted to take over leadership of the order and then left the sangha with several Buddhist monks and formed a rival sect. This sect is said to have also been supported by King Ajatasattu.<ref>Analayo (2011).

The [[Sthavira nik\u0101ya|Sthavira]] texts generally focus on \"five points\" which are seen as excessive ascetic practices, while the [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika|Mah\u0101sa\u1e45ghika]] Vinaya speaks of a more comprehensive disagreement, which has Devadatta alter the discourses as well as monastic discipline.<ref>Bhikkhu Sujato (2012), ''[http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/WhyDevadattaWasNoSaint.pdf \"Why Devadatta Was No Saint, A critique of Reginald Ray\u2019s thesis of the \u2018condemned saint\u2019\"]'' </ref>\n\nAt around the same time of Devadatta's schism, there was also war between Ajatasattu's Kingdom of Magadha, and Kosala, led by an elderly king Pasenadi.<ref>[[\u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 280.</ref> Ajatasattu seems to have been victorious, a turn of events the Buddha is reported to have regretted.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 239.</ref>\n\n=== Last days and ''parinirvana''  ===\n[[File:040 Ananda worships Buddha (25595318747).jpg|thumb|This East Javanese relief depicts the Buddha in his final days, and [[\u0100nanda]], his chief attendant. |alt=Metal relief |upright=1.3]]\n\nThe main narrative of the Buddha's last days, death and the events following his death is contained in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]'' (DN 16) and its various parallels in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan.<ref>[[John S.

It also depicts him as stating that he cannot promote anyone to be his successor. When \u0100nanda requested this, the ''Mahaparinibbana'' records his response as follows:<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 246.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Ananda, why does the Order of monks expect this of me?

If there is anyone who thinks: \u201cI shall take charge of the Order\u201d, or \u201cthe Order is under my leadership\u201d, such a person would have to make arrangements about the Order. The Tathagata does not think in such terms. Why should the Tathagata make arrangements for the Order? I am now old, worn out . . . I have reached the term of life, I am turning eighty years of age. Just as an old cart is made to go by being held together with straps, so the Tathagata's body is kept going by being bandaged up . . .

Various conditions are outlined in the early texts, such as [[Ta\u1e47h\u0101|craving (''ta\u1e47h\u0101'')]], but the three most basic ones are [[Three poisons|greed, aversion and delusion]].<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 72\u201373.</ref>\n*If the conditions for dukkha cease, dukkha also ceases. This is \"[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]\" (literally 'blowing out' or 'extinguishing').<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 75.</ref>\n*There is path to follow that leads to Nirvana. \n\nAccording to [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], the four truths schema appears to be based \"on an analogy with [[Ayurveda|Indian medical]] diagnosis\" (with the form: \"disease, pathogen, health, cure\") and this comparison is \"explicitly made in several early Buddhist texts\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn another Pali sutta, the Buddha outlines how \"eight worldly conditions\", \"keep the world turning around...Gain and loss, fame and disrepute, praise and blame, pleasure and pain.\" He then explains how the difference between a noble (''arya'') person and an uninstructed worldling is that a noble person reflects on and understands the impermanence of these conditions.<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 32-33.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's analysis of existence includes an understanding that [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] are part of life. According to the Buddha, the constant cycle of dying and being reborn (i.e. sa\u1e43s\u0101ra) according to one's karma is just dukkha and the ultimate spiritual goal should be liberation from this cycle.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 12.</ref> According to the Pali suttas, the Buddha stated that \"this sa\u1e43s\u0101ra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving.\"<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 39.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's teaching of karma differed to that of the Jains and Brahmins, in that on his view, karma is primarily mental intention (as opposed to mainly physical action or ritual acts).<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> The Buddha is reported to have said \"By karma I mean intention.\"<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 49.</ref> Richard Gombrich summarizes the Buddha's view of karma as follows: \"all thoughts, words, and deeds derive their moral value, positive or negative, from the intention behind them.\"<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 13.</ref>\n\nFor the Buddha, our karmic acts also affected the rebirth process in a positive or negative way. This was seen as an impersonal natural law similar to how certain seeds produce certain plants and fruits (in fact, the result of a karmic act was called its \"fruit\" by the Buddha).<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 19.</ref> However, it is important to note that the Buddha did not hold that everything that happens is the result of karma alone. In fact when the Buddha was asked to state the causes of pain and pleasure he listed various physical and environmental causes alongside karma.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 20.</ref>\n\n====Dependent Origination====\n[[File:Buddha teaching Dharma, on lion throne.jpg|thumb|150px|Schist Buddha statue with the famed [[Ye Dharma Hetu]] [[dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b]] around the head, which was used as a common summary of Dependent Origination. It states: \"Of those experiences that arise from a cause, The Tath\u0101gata has said: 'this is their cause, And this is their cessation': This is what the Great \u015arama\u1e47a teaches.\"]]\nIn the early texts, the process of the arising of dukkha is most thoroughly explained by the Buddha through the teaching of [[Dependent Origination]].<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> At its most basic level, Dependent Origination is an empirical teaching on the nature of phenomena which says that nothing is experienced independently of its conditions.<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 22.</ref>\n\nThe most basic formulation of Dependent Origination is given in the early texts as: 'It being thus, this comes about' (Pali: ''evam sati idam hoti'').<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref> This can be taken to mean that certain phenomena only arise when there are other phenomena present (example: when there is craving, suffering arises), and so, one can say that their arising is \"dependent\" on other phenomena. In other words, nothing in experience exists without a cause.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn numerous early texts, this basic principle is expanded with a list of phenomena that are said to be conditionally dependent.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 141\u2013142.</ref>{{refn|group=note|One common basic list of twelve elements in the Early Buddhist Texts goes as follows: \"Conditioned by (1) ignorance are (2) formations, conditioned by formations is (3) consciousness, conditioned by consciousness is (4) mind-and-body, conditioned by mind-and-body are (5) the six senses, conditioned by the six senses is (6) sense-contact, conditioned by sense-contact is (7) feeling, conditioned by feeling is (8) craving, conditioned by craving is (9) grasping, conditioned by grasping is (10) becoming, conditioned by becoming is (11) birth, conditioned by birth is (12) old-age and death-grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair come into being. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.\"<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 141\u2013142.</ref>}} These phenomena are supposed to provide an analysis of the cycle of dukkha as experienced by sentient beings. The philosopher Mark Siderits has outlined the basic idea of the Buddha's teaching of Dependent Origination of dukkha as follows: \n\n<blockquote>given the existence of a fully functioning assemblage of psycho-physical elements (the parts that make up a sentient being), ignorance concerning the three characteristics of sentient existence\u2014suffering, impermanence and non-self\u2014will lead, in the course of normal interactions with the environment, to appropriation (the identification of certain elements as \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018mine\u2019). This leads in turn to the formation of attachments, in the form of desire and aversion, and the strengthening of ignorance concerning the true nature of sentient existence. These ensure future rebirth, and thus future instances of old age, disease and death, in a potentially unending cycle.<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Buddha saw his analysis of Dependent Origination as a \"Middle Way\" between \"eternalism\" (''sassatavada'', the idea that some essence exists eternally) and \"annihilationism\" (''ucchedavada'', the idea that we go completely out of existence at death).<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref> This middle way is basically the view that, conventionally speaking, persons are just a causal series of impermanent psycho-physical elements.<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\n==== Metaphysics and personal identity ====\nClosely connected to the idea that experience is dependently originated is the Buddha's teaching that there is no independent or permanent self (Sanskrit: [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|''atman'']], Pali: ''atta'').<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 22.</ref>\n\nDue to this view which (termed [[anatta|''anatta'']]), the Buddha's teaching was opposed to all soul theories of his time, including the Jain theory of a ''\"[[jiva]]\"'' (\"life monad\") and the Brahmanical theories of atman and [[purusha]]. All of these theories held that there was an eternal unchanging [[essence]] to a person which transmigrated from life to life.<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 20.</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 62\u201364.</ref><ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\nWhile Brahminical teachers affirmed atman theories in an attempt to answer the question of what really exists ultimately, the Buddha saw this question as not being useful, as illustrated in [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow|the parable of the poisoned arrow]].<ref>Hamilton (2000) pp. 23\u201325.</ref>\n\nFor the Buddha's contemporaries, the atman was also seen to be the unchanging constant which was separate from all changing experiences and the inner controller in a person.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref> The Buddha instead held that all things in the world of our experience are transient and that there is no unchanging part to a person.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 9, 67.</ref> According to Richard Gombrich, the Buddha's position is simply that \"everything is process\".<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 10.</ref> However, this [[Anti-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] view still includes an understanding of continuity through rebirth, it is just the rebirth of a process (karma), not an essence like the atman.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most important way the Buddha analyzed individual experience in the early texts was by way of the [[Skandha|five 'aggregates' or 'groups' (''khandha'')]] of physical and mental processes.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 135.</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 114.</ref> The [[Buddhist_philosophy#Anatta|Buddha's arguments against an unchanging self]] rely on these five aggregate schema, as can be seen in the Pali ''[[Anattalakkha\u1e47a Sutta]]'' (and its parallels in Gandhari and Chinese)''.''<ref>Hamilton (2000) pp. 19\u201320.</ref><ref>Andrew Glass, Mark Allon (2007).

Also, since they are all impermanent, one cannot regard any of the psycho-physical processes as an unchanging self.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 136-137.</ref><ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> Even mental processes such as [[Vij\u00f1\u0101na|consciousness]] and will ([[cetana|''cetana'']]) are seen as being dependently originated and impermanent and thus do not qualify as a self (''atman'').<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\nAs noted by Gombrich, in the early texts the Buddha teaches that all five aggregates, including consciousness (''[[Vij\u00f1\u0101na|vi\u00f1\u00f1ana]]'', which was held by Brahmins to be eternal), arise dependent on causes.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 119-120.</ref> That is, existence is based on processes that are subject to dependent origination. He compared samsaric existence to a fire, which is dynamic and requires fuel (the ''khandas'', literally: \"heaps\") in order to keep burning.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 124-125.</ref>\n\nAs [[Rupert Gethin]] explains, for the Buddha:\n\n<blockquote>I am a complex flow of physical and mental phenomena, but peel away these phenomena and look behind them and one just does not find a constant self that one can call one's own. My sense of self is both logically and emotionally just a label that I impose on these physical and mental phenomena in consequence of their connectedness.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 139.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Buddha saw the belief in a self as arising from our grasping at and identifying with the various changing phenomena, as well as from ignorance about how things really are.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 146-147.</ref> Furthermore, the Buddha held that we experience suffering because we hold on to erroneous self views.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 148.</ref><ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 27.</ref>\n\n====Worldly happiness====\nAs noted by [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the Buddha as depicted in the Pali suttas does not exclusively teach a world transcending goal, but also teaches laypersons how to achieve worldly [[happiness]] (''sukha'').<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 107\u2013109.</ref> \n\nAccording to Bodhi, the \"most comprehensive\" of the suttas that focus on how to live as a layperson is the ''[[Sig\u0101lov\u0101da Sutta]]'' (DN 31). This sutta outlines how a layperson behaves towards six basic social relationships: \"parents and children, teacher and pupils, husband and wife, friend and friend, employer and workers, lay follower and religious guides.\" <ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 109.</ref> This Pali text also has parallels in Chinese and in Sanskrit fragments.<ref>Pannasiri, Bhadanta (1950). \"Sig\u0101lov\u0101da-Sutta\", Visva-Bharati Annals, 3:\n150\u2013228. </ref><ref>Martini, Giuliana (2013). \"Bodhisattva Texts, Ideologies and Rituals in Khotan in the Fifth and Sixth Centuries\", in Buddhism among the Iranian Peoples\nof Central Asia, M.

First, there is the happiness visible in this very life. The Buddha states that four things lead to this happiness: \"The accomplishment of persistent effort, the accomplishment of protection, good friendship, and balanced living.\"<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 124</ref> Similarly, in several other suttas, the Buddha teaches on how to improve family relationships, particularly on the importance of filial love and gratitude as well as marital well-being.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 110</ref>\n\nRegarding the happiness of the next life, the Buddha (in the ''[[D\u012bghaj\u0101\u1e47u Sutta]]'') states that the virtues which lead to a good rebirth are: [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] (in the Buddha and the teachings), moral discipline, especially keeping the [[five precepts]], generosity, and wisdom (knowledge of the arising and passing of things).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 111, 125.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Buddha of the suttas then, achieving a good rebirth is based on cultivating wholesome or skillful (''kusala'') karma, which leads to a good result, and avoiding unwholesome (''akusala'') karma. A common list of good karmas taught by the Buddha is the list of ten courses of action (''[[kammapatha]]'') as outlined in MN 41 ''Saleyyaka Sutta'' (and its Chinese parallel in S\u0100 1042).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 146\u2013148, 156.</ref><ref>Analayo (2011). \"A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nik\u0101ya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),\" p. 263.</ref>\n\nGood karma is also termed [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit (''pu\u00f1\u00f1a'')]], and the Buddha outlines three bases of meritorious actions: giving, moral discipline and meditation (as seen in AN 8:36).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 151, 167.</ref>\n\n==== The Path to Liberation ====\n[[File:Seated_Buddha,_Pakistan_or_Afghanistan,_Ghandhara_region,_2nd_-_3rd_century,_gray_schist,_HAA.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Gandharan]] sculpture depicting the Buddha in the [[Lotus position|full lotus]] seated meditation posture, 2nd-3rd century CE]]\n[[File:20160124_Sri_Lanka_3769_Polonnaruwa_sRGB_(25144212713).jpg|thumb|200px|Buddha Statues from [[Gal Vihara]].

Various suttas discuss the different drawbacks of sensuality. In the ''Potaliya Sutta'' (MN 54) sensual pleasures are said by the Buddha to be a cause of conflict for all humans beings.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 195</ref> They are said to be unable to satisfy one's craving, like a clean meatless bone given to a dog.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 199</ref> Sensuality is also compared to a torch held against the wind, since it burns the person holding on to it.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 200</ref> According to the Buddha, there is \"a delight apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, which surpasses even divine bliss.\" The Buddha thus taught that one should take delight in the higher spiritual pleasures instead of sensual pleasure.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 204.</ref> This is explained with the simile the leper, who cauterizes his skin with fire to get relief from the pain of leprosy, but after he is cured, avoids the same flames he used to enjoy before (see MN 75, ''Magandiya Sutta'').<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 205.</ref>\n\nNumerous scholars such as Vetter have written on the centrality of the practice of [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|''dhy\u0101na'']] to the teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn|Vetter|1988a|pp=xxx, xxxv\u2013xxxvi, 4\u20135}} It is the training of the mind, commonly translated as [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], to withdraw the mind from the automatic responses to sense-impressions, and leading to a \"state of perfect [[Upekkha|equanimity]] and awareness (''upekkh\u0101-sati-parisuddhi'').\"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5}} Dhyana is preceded and supported by various aspects of the path such as seclusion and sense restraint.<ref>Analayo (2017). \"Early Buddhist meditation studies,\" pp. 80, 128, 135.</ref>\n\nAnother important mental training in the early texts is the practice of [[mindfulness]] (''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]''), which was mainly taught using the schemas of the \"Four Ways of Mindfulness\" (''[[Satipatthana]]'', as taught in the Pali ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' and its various parallel texts) and the sixteen elements of \"Mindfulness of Breath\" (''[[Anapanasati]]'', as taught in the ''[[Anapanasati Sutta]]'' and its various parallels).<ref>For a comparative survey of Satipatthana in the Pali, Tibetan and Chinese sources, see: ''Analayo (2014), \"Perspectives on Satipatthana.\"'' For a comparative survey of Anapanasati, see: ''Dhammajoti KL (2008), \"Sixteen-mode Mindfulness of Breathing\", JCBSSL v. VI.''</ref>\n\nBecause getting others to practice the path was the central goal of the Buddha's message, the early texts depict the Buddha as refusing to answer [[The unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]] which his contemporaries were preoccupied with, (such as \"is the world eternal?\"). This is because he did not see these questions as being useful on the path and as not being \"connected to the goal\".<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 66.</ref>\n\n====Monasticism====\nThe early Buddhist texts depict the Buddha as promoting the life of a homeless and [[Celibacy|celibate]] \"''sramana''\", or mendicant, as the ideal way of life for the practice of the path.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 85, 88.</ref> He taught that mendicants or \"beggars\" ([[Bhikkhu|''bhikkhus'']]) were supposed to give up all possessions and to own just a begging bowl and three robes. <ref>Kalupahana (1992) p. 28.</ref> As part of the Buddha's monastic discipline, they were also supposed to rely on the wider lay community for the basic necessities (mainly food, clothing, and lodging).<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 85</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's teachings on monastic discipline were preserved in the various [[Vinaya]] collections of the different early schools.<ref>Kalupahana (1992) p. 28.</ref>\n\nBuddhist monastics, which included both monks and nuns, were supposed to beg for their food, were not allowed to store up food or eat after noon and they were not allowed to use gold, silver or any valuables.<ref>Heirman, Ann (2019). \"Vinaya rules for monks and nuns.\"</ref><ref>Gethin (1998), p. 87</ref>\n\n====Socio-political teachings====\nThe early texts depict the Buddha as giving a deflationary account of the importance of politics to human life. Politics is inevitable and is probably even necessary and helpful, but it is also a tremendous waste of time and effort, as well as being a prime temptation to allow ego to run rampant. Buddhist political theory denies that people have a moral duty to engage in politics except to a very minimal degree (pay the taxes, obey the laws, maybe vote in the elections), and it actively portrays engagement in politics and the pursuit of enlightenment as being conflicting paths in life.<ref>Matthew J. Moore, ''Buddhism and Political Theory'', Oxford University Press, 2016  {{ISBN|9780190465513}} p.2</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Agga\u00f1\u00f1a Sutta]]'', the Buddha teaches a history of how monarchy arose which according to Matthew J. Moore is \"closely analogous to a social contract.\" The ''Agga\u00f1\u00f1a Sutta'' also provides a social explanation of how different classes arose, in contrast to the Vedic views on social caste.<ref name=\":7\">Moore, Matthew J.

This ideal leader is one who promotes Dharma through his governance. He can only achieve his status through moral purity and must promote morality and Dharma to maintain his position. According to the ''Cakkavatti-S\u012bhan\u0101da Sutta'', the key duties of a Cakkavatti are: \"establish guard, ward, and protection according to Dhamma for your own household, your troops, your nobles, and vassals, for Brahmins and householders, town and country folk, ascetics and Brahmins, for beasts and birds. let no crime prevail in your kingdom, and to those who are in need, give property.\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> The sutta explains the injunction to give to the needy by telling how a line of wheel-turning monarchs falls because they fail to give to the needy, and thus the kingdom falls into infighting as poverty increases, which then leads to stealing and violence.{{refn|group=note|\"thus, from the not giving of property to the needy, poverty became rife, from the growth of poverty, the taking of what was not given increased, from the increase of theft, the use of weapons increased, from the increased use of weapons, the taking of life increased \u2014 and from the increase in the taking of life, people\u2019s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and [as] a result of this decrease of life-span and beauty, the children of those whose life-span had been eighty-thousand years lived for only forty thousand.\"<ref>Moore, Matthew J. ''\"Political theory in Canonical Buddhism.\"'' Philosophy East & West Volume 65, Number 1 January 2015 36\u201364</ref>}}\n\nIn the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta,'' the Buddha outlines several principles that he promoted among the Vajjian tribal federation, which had a quasi-republican form of government. He taught them to \u201chold regular and frequent assemblies\u201d, live in harmony and maintain their traditions. The Buddha then goes on to promote a similar kind of republican style of government among the Buddhist Sangha, where all monks had equal rights to attend open meetings and there would be no single leader, since The Buddha also chose not to appoint one.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some scholars have argued that this fact signals that the Buddha preferred a [[Republicanism|republican]] form of government, while others disagree with this position.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Scholarly views on the earliest teachings ===\n{{Main|Presectarian Buddhism}}\n[[File:Kanishka Buddha detail.jpg|thumb|150px|The Buddha on a coin of [[Kanishka I]], {{circa|130}} CE.]]\n\nNumerous scholars of early Buddhism argue that most of the teachings found in the Early Buddhist texts date back to the Buddha himself. One of these is [[Richard Gombrich]], who argues that since the content of the earliest texts \u201cpresents such originality, intelligence, grandeur and\u2014most relevantly\u2014coherence...it is hard to see it as a composite work.\" Thus he concludes they are \"the work of one genius.\"<ref>Gombrich, Richard (2006).

''\"An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices,\"'' p. 3. Introduction to Religion. Cambridge University Press.</ref> Likewise, [[A.\u200aK.

Motilal Banarsidass.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Alexander Wynne argues that \"the internal evidence of the early Buddhist literature proves its historical authenticity.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wynne | first1 = Alexander | year = 2005 | title = The Historical Authenticity of Early Buddhist Literature | url = | journal = Vienna Journal of South Asian Studies | volume = XLIX | issue = | pages = 35\u201370 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, other scholars of Buddhist studies have disagreed with the mostly positive view that the early Buddhist texts reflect the teachings of the historical Buddha. For example, [[Edward Conze]] argued that the attempts of European scholars to reconstruct the original teachings of the Buddha were \u201call mere guesswork.\u201d<ref>Conze, Edward (2000). \"Buddhism: A Short History.\" From Buddhism to Sufism Series. Oneworld.</ref>\n\nOther scholars argue that some teachings contained in the early texts are the authentic teachings of the Buddha, but not others. For example, according to Tilmann Vetter, the earliest core of the Buddhist teachings is the meditative practice of ''dhy\u0101na''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988b|p=xxx, xxxv\u2013xxxvi, 4\u20135}}{{refn|group=note|Vetter: \"However, if we look at the last, and in my opinion the most important, component of this list [the noble eightfold path], we are still dealing with what according to me is the real content of the middle way, dhyana-meditation, at least the stages two to four, which are said to be free of contemplation and reflection. Everything preceding the eighth part, i.e. right samadhi, apparently has the function of preparing for the right samadhi.\"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}}}} Vetter argues that \"liberating insight\" became an essential feature of the Buddhist tradition at a later date. He posits that the Fourth Noble Truths, the Eightfold path and Dependent Origination, which are commonly seen as essential to Buddhism, are later formulations which form part of the explanatory framework of this \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiv\u2013xxxvii}}  \n\n[[Lambert Schmithausen]] similarly argues that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting \"liberating insight\", which is attained after mastering the four ''dhy\u0101nas'', is a later addition.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}} Also, according to [[Johannes Bronkhorst]], the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}}\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n{{Main |Physical characteristics of the Buddha}}\n=== In early sources ===\n[[File:Mahapragya exiled 1926 wk.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monks from Nepal.

Various discourses describe how he \"cut off his hair and beard\" when renouncing the world. Likewise, Digha Nikaya 3 has a Brahmin describe the Buddha as a shaved or bald (''mundaka'') man.<ref>Olivelle, Patrick (1974), ''\"The Origin and the Early Development of Buddhist Monachism\"'', p. 19.</ref> Digha Nikaya 2 also describes how king Ajatasattu is unable to tell which of the monks is the Buddha when approaching the sangha and must ask his minister to point him out. Likewise, in MN 140, a mendicant who sees himself as a follower of the Buddha meets the Buddha in person but is unable to recognize him.<ref>Mazard, Eisel (2010). [https://www.newmandala.org/the-buddha-was-bald/ \"The Buddha was bald,\"] New Mandala.</ref> \n\nThe Buddha is also described as being handsome and with a clear complexion (Digha I:115; Anguttara I:181), at least in his youth. In old age, however, he is described as having a stooped body, with slack and wrinkled limbs.<ref>S. Dhammika, \"The Buddha and his disciples.\" pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\n=== The 32 Signs ===\nVarious Buddhist texts attribute to the Buddha a series of extraordinary physical characteristics, known as \"the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#32 Signs of a Great Man|32 Signs of the Great Man]]\" (Skt. ''mah\u0101puru\u1e63a lak\u1e63a\u1e47a''). \n\nAccording to Analayo, when they first appear in the Buddhist texts, these physical marks were initially held to be imperceptible to the ordinary person, and required special training to detect. Later though, they are depicted as being visible by regular people and as inspiring faith in the Buddha.<ref>Analayo (2017), \"Buddhapada and the Bodhisattva Path\", pp. 137\u2013138.</ref>\n\nThese characteristics are described in the [[Digha Nikaya]]'s ''{{IAST |Lakkha\u1e47a Sutta}}'' (D, I:142).{{sfn|Walshe|1995|pp = 441\u201360}}\n\n== Gautama Buddha in other religions ==\n[[File:Avatarbuddha.jpg|right|thumb|Buddha depicted as the 9th [[avatar]] of god [[Vishnu]] in a traditional Hindu representation]]\n[[File:Buddha_statue_at_Dwaraka_Tirumala_Temple_02.jpg|thumb|Buddha as an avatar at [[Dwaraka Tirumala]] temple, [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]\n{{Main|Gautama Buddha in world religions}}\n\nSome [[Hindus]] [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|regard Gautama]] as the 9th [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]].<ref group=note name=\"google260\" />{{sfn |Gopal| 1990|p=73}}{{sfn|Doniger|1993|p=243}} However, Buddha's teachings deny the authority of the [[Vedas]] and the concepts of [[Brahman]]-[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]].<ref name=\"sep\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Buddha |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buddha/ |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref><ref>Sushil Mittal & Gene Thursby (2004), ''The Hindu World'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-77227-3}}, pp. 729\u201330</ref><ref>C.

According to the works on Buddhism by [[Al-Biruni]] (973\u2013after 1050), views regarding the exact identity of Buddha was diverse. Accordingly, some regarded him as the divine incarnate, others as an apostle of the angels or as an [[Ifrit]] and others as an apostle of God sent to human race. By the 12th century, [[al-Shahrastani]] even compared Buddha to [[Khidr]], described as an ideal human. [[Ibn Nadim]], who was also familiar with [[Manichaeism|Manichean teachings]], even identifies Buddha as a prophet, who taught a religion to \"banish [[Satan]]\", although not mention it explicitly.

''\"The Art of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its History & Meaning\"'', Shambhala Publications, p. 19.</ref> \n\nOther styles of Indian Buddhist art depict the Buddha in human form, either standing, sitting crossed legged (often in the [[Lotus position|Lotus Pose]]) or laying down on one side. Iconic representations of the Buddha became particularly popular and widespread after the first century CE.<ref>Leidy, Denise Patty (2008). ''\"The Art of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its History & Meaning\"'', Shambhala Publications, p. 31.</ref> Some of these depictions of the Buddha, particularly those of [[Gandharan Buddhism]] and [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asian Buddhism]], were influenced by [[Hellenistic art]], a style known as [[Greco-Buddhist art]].<ref>Sir John Hubert Marshall (1960). \"The Buddhist art of Gandh\u0101ra: the story of the early school, its birth, growth and decline\"</ref>  \n\nThese various Indian and Central Asian styles would then go on to influence the art of [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian Buddhist]] Buddha images, as well as those of Southeast Asian Theravada Buddhism. \n\n=== Gallery showing different Buddha styles===\n<br /><gallery>\nFile:A Royal Couple Visits the Buddha, from railing of the Bharhut Stupa, Shunga dynasty, early 2nd century BC, Bharhut, Madhya Pradesh, India, sandstone - Freer Gallery of Art - DSC05134.JPG|A Royal Couple Visits the Buddha, from railing of the Bharhut Stupa, Shunga dynasty, early 2nd century BC.\nFile:Adoration of the Diamond Throne and the Bodhi Tree Bharhut relief.jpg|Adoration of the Diamond Throne and the Bodhi Tree, Bharhut.\nFile:Descent of the Buddha from the Trayastrimsa Heaven Sanchi Stupa 1 Northern Gateway.jpg|Descent of the Buddha from the Trayastrimsa Heaven, Sanchi Stupa No. 1.\nFile:Miracle at Kapilavastu Suddhodana praying as his son the Buddha rises in the air with only path visible Sanchi Stupa 1 Northern Gateway.jpg|The Buddha's Miracle at Kapilavastu, Sanchi Stupa 1.\nFile:Bamboo garden (Venuvana) at Rajagriha, the visit of Bimbisara.jpg|Bimbisara visiting the Buddha (represented as empty throne) at the Bamboo garden in Rajagriha\nFile:Andhra pradesh, la grande dipartita, da regione di amaravati, II sec.JPG|The great departure with riderless horse, Amaravati, 2nd century CE.\nFile:MaraAssault.jpg|The Assault of Mara, Amaravati, 2nd century CE.\nFile:Buddha Preaching in Tushita Heaven.

In the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supramundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such \"in conformity with the world\"; omniscience, and the ability to \"suppress karma\".{{sfn|Jones|1956|p=}} As noted by Andrew Skilton, the Buddha was often described as being superhuman, including descriptions of him having the 32 major and 80 minor marks of a \"great man,\" and the idea that the Buddha could live for as long as an aeon if he wished (see DN 16).{{sfn|Skilton|2004|pp=64\u201365}} \n\nThe ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the [[Jain Agamas (\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara)|Jain scriptures]], and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in [[History of India|Indian history]] for which significant accounts exist.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=15}} British author [[Karen Armstrong]] writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure.{{sfn|Armstrong|2000|p=xii}} Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of \"birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death\" must be true.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=}}\n\n== Previous lives ==\n[[File:Ascetic Sumedha and Dipankara Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|The legendary Jataka collections depict the Buddha-to-be in a previous life prostrating before the past Buddha [[Dipankara]], making a resolve to be a Buddha, and receiving a prediction of future Buddhahood.]]\nLegendary biographies like the Pali ''[[Buddhava\u1e43sa]]'' and the Sanskrit ''J\u0101takam\u0101l\u0101'' depict the Buddha's (referred to as \"[[bodhisattva]]\" before his awakening) career as spanning hundreds of lifetimes before his last birth as Gautama.

He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed, and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is \"subtle, deep and hard to grasp.\" However, the god [[Brahma (Buddhism)#Brahm\u0101 Sahampati|Brahm\u0101 Sahampati]] convinced him, arguing that at least some \"with little dust in their eyes\" will understand it. The Buddha relented and agreed to teach. According to Analayo, the Chinese parallel to MN 26, M\u0100 204, does not contain this story, but this event does appear in other parallel texts, such as in an ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottarika-\u0101gama]]'' discourse, in the ''Catusparisat-s\u016btra'', and in the ''Lalitavistara''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAccording to MN 26 and M\u0100 204, after deciding to teach, the Buddha initially intended to visit his former teachers, [[Alara Kalama]] and [[Udaka Ramaputta]], to teach them his insights, but they had already died, so he decided to visit his five former companions.<ref>Analayo (2011).

This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the [[Vassa]] rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason was that it was more difficult to do so without causing harm to flora and animal life.<ref>[[John S.

According to the Pali texts, shortly after the formation of the sangha, the Buddha traveled to [[Rajgir|Rajagaha]], capital of [[Magadha]], and met with King [[Bimbisara]], who gifted a bamboo grove park to the sangha.<ref>[[\u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 68.</ref> \n\nThe Buddha's sangha continued to grow during his initial travels in north India.

He is said to have gifted [[Jetavana|Jeta's grove]] (''Jetavana'') to the sangha at great expense (the Theravada Vinaya speaks of thousands of gold coins).<ref>[[\u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 91.</ref><ref>[[John S.

As noted by Analayo's comparative study of this topic, there are various versions of this event depicted in the different early Buddhist texts.<ref>Analayo (2016), pp. 40\u201341. Analayo draws from seven early sources: \"the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in Four Parts, preserved in Chinese; \u2013 a *Vinayam\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101 preserved in Chinese translation, which some scholars suggest represents the Haimavata tradition; the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika-Lokottarav\u0101da Vinaya, preserved in Sanskrit; \u2013 the Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya in Five Parts, preserved in Chinese; \u2013 the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Vinaya, where the episode is extant in Chinese and Tibetan translation, with considerable parts also preserved in Sanskrit fragments; \u2013 a discourse in the Madhyama-\u0101gama, preserved in Chinese, probably representing the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da tradition; a P\u0101li discourse found among the Eights of the A\u1e45guttara-nik\u0101ya; the same account is also found in the Therav\u0101da Vinaya preserved in P\u0101li.\"  </ref>\n\nAccording to all the major versions surveyed by Analayo, [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b Gautam\u012b]], Buddha's step-mother, is initially turned down by the Buddha after requesting ordination for her and some other women. Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b and her followers then shave their hair, don robes and begin following the Buddha on his travels. The Buddha is eventually convinced by \u0100nanda to grant ordination to Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b on her acceptance of [[Eight Garudhammas|eight conditions called gurudharmas]] which focus on the relationship between the new order of nuns and the monks.<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 43. </ref>\n\nAccording to Analayo, the only argument common to all the versions that Ananda uses to convince the Buddha is that women have the same ability to reach all stages of awakening.<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 79.</ref> Analayo also notes that some modern scholars have questioned the authenticity of the eight gurudharmas in their present form due to various inconsistencies. He holds that the historicity of the current lists of eight is doubtful, but that they may have been based on earlier injunctions by the Buddha.<ref>[[Bhikkhu Analayo|Analayo, Bhikkhu]] (2013). \"The Gurudharmaon Bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b Ordination in the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Tradition\" (PDF).

Due to this, the gurudharma injunctions may have been a way to place \"the newly founded order of nuns in a relationship to its male counterparts that resembles as much as possible the protection a laywoman could expect from her male relatives.\"<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 127.</ref>\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Procession of Prasenajit of Kosala leaving Sravasti to meet the Buddha.jpg|thumb|Procession of King [[Prasenajit]] of [[Kosala]] leaving [[Sravasti]] to meet the Buddha.

Strong, after the first 20 years of his teaching career, the Buddha seems to have slowly settled in Sravasti, the capital of the Kingdom of Kosala, spending most of his later years in this city.<ref>[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 136.</ref>\n\nAs the sangha grew in size, the need for a standardized set of monastic rules arose and the Buddha seems to have developed a set of regulations for the sangha. These are preserved in various texts called \"[[Pratimok\u1e63a|Pratimoksa]]\" which were recited by the community every fortnight. The Pratimoksa includes general ethical precepts, as well as rules regarding the essentials of monastic life, such as bowls and robes.<ref>[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 134.</ref>\n\nIn his later years, the Buddha's fame grew and he was invited to important royal events, such as the inauguration of the new council hall of the Shakyans (as seen in MN 53) and the inauguration of a new palace by Prince Bodhi (as depicted in MN 85).<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], pp. 232\u201333.</ref> The early texts also speak of how during the Buddha's old age, the kingdom of Magadha was usurped by a new king, [[Ajatashatru|Ajatasattu]], who overthrew his father [[Bimbisara]]. According to the ''Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta,'' the new king spoke with different ascetic teachers and eventually took refuge in the Buddha.<ref>Jain, Kailash Chand (1991), ''Lord Mah\u0101v\u012bra and His Times'', p. 79, [[Motilal Banarsidass]], {{ISBN|978-81-208-0805-8}}</ref> However, Jain sources also claim his allegiance, and it is likely he supported various religious groups, not just the Buddha's sangha exclusively.<ref>Mahajan V.D. (2016), ''\"Ancient India\"'', S. Chand Publishing, p. 190.</ref>  \n\nAs the Buddha continued to travel and teach, he also came into contact with [[\u015arama\u1e47a#Pre-Buddhist \u015br\u0101mana schools in Buddhist texts|members of other \u015br\u0101mana sects.]] There is evidence from the early texts that the Buddha encountered some of these figures and critiqued their doctrines. The ''Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta'' identifies six such sects.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 215.</ref>\n\nThe early texts also depict the elderly Buddha as suffering from back pain. Several texts depict him delegating teachings to his chief disciples since his body now needed more rest.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 232.</ref> However, the Buddha continued teaching well into his old age.  \n\nOne of the most troubling events during the Buddha's old age was [[Devadatta|Devadatta's]] schism. Early sources speak of how the Buddha's cousin, Devadatta, attempted to take over leadership of the order and then left the sangha with several Buddhist monks and formed a rival sect. This sect is said to have also been supported by King Ajatasattu.<ref>Analayo (2011).

The [[Sthavira nik\u0101ya|Sthavira]] texts generally focus on \"five points\" which are seen as excessive ascetic practices, while the [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika|Mah\u0101sa\u1e45ghika]] Vinaya speaks of a more comprehensive disagreement, which has Devadatta alter the discourses as well as monastic discipline.<ref>Bhikkhu Sujato (2012), ''[http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/WhyDevadattaWasNoSaint.pdf \"Why Devadatta Was No Saint, A critique of Reginald Ray\u2019s thesis of the \u2018condemned saint\u2019\"]'' </ref>\n\nAt around the same time of Devadatta's schism, there was also war between Ajatasattu's Kingdom of Magadha, and Kosala, led by an elderly king Pasenadi.<ref>[[\u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 280.</ref> Ajatasattu seems to have been victorious, a turn of events the Buddha is reported to have regretted.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 239.</ref>\n\n=== Last days and ''parinirvana''  ===\n[[File:040 Ananda worships Buddha (25595318747).jpg|thumb|This East Javanese relief depicts the Buddha in his final days, and [[\u0100nanda]], his chief attendant. |alt=Metal relief |upright=1.3]]\n\nThe main narrative of the Buddha's last days, death and the events following his death is contained in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]'' (DN 16) and its various parallels in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan.<ref>[[John S.

The Buddha says that the Sangha will prosper as long as they \"hold regular and frequent assemblies, meet in harmony, do not change the rules of training, honor their superiors who were ordained before them, do not fall prey to worldly desires, remain devoted to forest hermitages, and preserve their personal mindfulness.\" He then gives further lists of important virtues to be upheld by the Sangha. <ref>[[John S.

It also depicts him as stating that he cannot promote anyone to be his successor. When \u0100nanda requested this, the ''Mahaparinibbana'' records his response as follows:<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 246.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Ananda, why does the Order of monks expect this of me? I have taught the Dhamma, making no distinction of \u201cinner\u201d and \u201c outer\u201d: the Tathagata has no \u201cteacher\u2019s fist\u201d (in which certain truths are held back). If there is anyone who thinks: \u201cI shall take charge of the Order\u201d, or \u201cthe Order is under my leadership\u201d, such a person would have to make arrangements about the Order. The Tathagata does not think in such terms. Why should the Tathagata make arrangements for the Order? I am now old, worn out . . . I have reached the term of life, I am turning eighty years of age.

A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving.\"<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 39.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's teaching of karma differed to that of the Jains and Brahmins, in that on his view, karma is primarily mental intention (as opposed to mainly physical action or ritual acts).<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> The Buddha is reported to have said \"By karma I mean intention.\"<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 49.</ref> Richard Gombrich summarizes the Buddha's view of karma as follows: \"all thoughts, words, and deeds derive their moral value, positive or negative, from the intention behind them.\"<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 13.</ref>\n\nFor the Buddha, our karmic acts also affected the rebirth process in a positive or negative way. This was seen as an impersonal natural law similar to how certain seeds produce certain plants and fruits (in fact, the result of a karmic act was called its \"fruit\" by the Buddha).<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 19.</ref> However, it is important to note that the Buddha did not hold that everything that happens is the result of karma alone. In fact when the Buddha was asked to state the causes of pain and pleasure he listed various physical and environmental causes alongside karma.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 20.</ref>\n\n====Dependent Origination====\n[[File:Buddha teaching Dharma, on lion throne.jpg|thumb|150px|Schist Buddha statue with the famed [[Ye Dharma Hetu]] [[dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b]] around the head, which was used as a common summary of Dependent Origination. It states: \"Of those experiences that arise from a cause, The Tath\u0101gata has said: 'this is their cause, And this is their cessation': This is what the Great \u015arama\u1e47a teaches.\"]]\nIn the early texts, the process of the arising of dukkha is most thoroughly explained by the Buddha through the teaching of [[Dependent Origination]].<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> At its most basic level, Dependent Origination is an empirical teaching on the nature of phenomena which says that nothing is experienced independently of its conditions.<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 22.</ref>\n\nThe most basic formulation of Dependent Origination is given in the early texts as: 'It being thus, this comes about' (Pali: ''evam sati idam hoti'').<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref> This can be taken to mean that certain phenomena only arise when there are other phenomena present (example: when there is craving, suffering arises), and so, one can say that their arising is \"dependent\" on other phenomena. In other words, nothing in experience exists without a cause.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn numerous early texts, this basic principle is expanded with a list of phenomena that are said to be conditionally dependent.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 141\u2013142.</ref>{{refn|group=note|One common basic list of twelve elements in the Early Buddhist Texts goes as follows: \"Conditioned by (1) ignorance are (2) formations, conditioned by formations is (3) consciousness, conditioned by consciousness is (4) mind-and-body, conditioned by mind-and-body are (5) the six senses, conditioned by the six senses is (6) sense-contact, conditioned by sense-contact is (7) feeling, conditioned by feeling is (8) craving, conditioned by craving is (9) grasping, conditioned by grasping is (10) becoming, conditioned by becoming is (11) birth, conditioned by birth is (12) old-age and death-grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair come into being. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.\"<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 141\u2013142.</ref>}} These phenomena are supposed to provide an analysis of the cycle of dukkha as experienced by sentient beings. The philosopher Mark Siderits has outlined the basic idea of the Buddha's teaching of Dependent Origination of dukkha as follows: \n\n<blockquote>given the existence of a fully functioning assemblage of psycho-physical elements (the parts that make up a sentient being), ignorance concerning the three characteristics of sentient existence\u2014suffering, impermanence and non-self\u2014will lead, in the course of normal interactions with the environment, to appropriation (the identification of certain elements as \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018mine\u2019). This leads in turn to the formation of attachments, in the form of desire and aversion, and the strengthening of ignorance concerning the true nature of sentient existence. These ensure future rebirth, and thus future instances of old age, disease and death, in a potentially unending cycle.<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Buddha saw his analysis of Dependent Origination as a \"Middle Way\" between \"eternalism\" (''sassatavada'', the idea that some essence exists eternally) and \"annihilationism\" (''ucchedavada'', the idea that we go completely out of existence at death).<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref> This middle way is basically the view that, conventionally speaking, persons are just a causal series of impermanent psycho-physical elements.<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\n==== Metaphysics and personal identity ====\nClosely connected to the idea that experience is dependently originated is the Buddha's teaching that there is no independent or permanent self (Sanskrit: [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|''atman'']], Pali: ''atta'').<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 22.</ref>\n\nDue to this view which (termed [[anatta|''anatta'']]), the Buddha's teaching was opposed to all soul theories of his time, including the Jain theory of a ''\"[[jiva]]\"'' (\"life monad\") and the Brahmanical theories of atman and [[purusha]]. All of these theories held that there was an eternal unchanging [[essence]] to a person which transmigrated from life to life.<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 20.</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 62\u201364.</ref><ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\nWhile Brahminical teachers affirmed atman theories in an attempt to answer the question of what really exists ultimately, the Buddha saw this question as not being useful, as illustrated in [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow|the parable of the poisoned arrow]].<ref>Hamilton (2000) pp. 23\u201325.</ref>\n\nFor the Buddha's contemporaries, the atman was also seen to be the unchanging constant which was separate from all changing experiences and the inner controller in a person.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref> The Buddha instead held that all things in the world of our experience are transient and that there is no unchanging part to a person.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 9, 67.</ref> According to Richard Gombrich, the Buddha's position is simply that \"everything is process\".<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 10.</ref> However, this [[Anti-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] view still includes an understanding of continuity through rebirth, it is just the rebirth of a process (karma), not an essence like the atman.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most important way the Buddha analyzed individual experience in the early texts was by way of the [[Skandha|five 'aggregates' or 'groups' (''khandha'')]] of physical and mental processes.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 135.</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 114.</ref> The [[Buddhist_philosophy#Anatta|Buddha's arguments against an unchanging self]] rely on these five aggregate schema, as can be seen in the Pali ''[[Anattalakkha\u1e47a Sutta]]'' (and its parallels in Gandhari and Chinese)''.''<ref>Hamilton (2000) pp. 19\u201320.</ref><ref>Andrew Glass, Mark Allon (2007).

Also, since they are all impermanent, one cannot regard any of the psycho-physical processes as an unchanging self.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 136-137.</ref><ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> Even mental processes such as [[Vij\u00f1\u0101na|consciousness]] and will ([[cetana|''cetana'']]) are seen as being dependently originated and impermanent and thus do not qualify as a self (''atman'').<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\nAs noted by Gombrich, in the early texts the Buddha teaches that all five aggregates, including consciousness (''[[Vij\u00f1\u0101na|vi\u00f1\u00f1ana]]'', which was held by Brahmins to be eternal), arise dependent on causes.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 119-120.</ref> That is, existence is based on processes that are subject to dependent origination. He compared samsaric existence to a fire, which is dynamic and requires fuel (the ''khandas'', literally: \"heaps\") in order to keep burning.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 124-125.</ref>\n\nAs [[Rupert Gethin]] explains, for the Buddha:\n\n<blockquote>I am a complex flow of physical and mental phenomena, but peel away these phenomena and look behind them and one just does not find a constant self that one can call one's own. My sense of self is both logically and emotionally just a label that I impose on these physical and mental phenomena in consequence of their connectedness.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 139.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Buddha saw the belief in a self as arising from our grasping at and identifying with the various changing phenomena, as well as from ignorance about how things really are.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 146-147.</ref> Furthermore, the Buddha held that we experience suffering because we hold on to erroneous self views.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 148.</ref><ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 27.</ref>\n\n====Worldly happiness====\nAs noted by [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the Buddha as depicted in the Pali suttas does not exclusively teach a world transcending goal, but also teaches laypersons how to achieve worldly [[happiness]] (''sukha'').<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 107\u2013109.</ref> \n\nAccording to Bodhi, the \"most comprehensive\" of the suttas that focus on how to live as a layperson is the ''[[Sig\u0101lov\u0101da Sutta]]'' (DN 31). This sutta outlines how a layperson behaves towards six basic social relationships: \"parents and children, teacher and pupils, husband and wife, friend and friend, employer and workers, lay follower and religious guides.\" <ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 109.</ref> This Pali text also has parallels in Chinese and in Sanskrit fragments.<ref>Pannasiri, Bhadanta (1950). \"Sig\u0101lov\u0101da-Sutta\", Visva-Bharati Annals, 3:\n150\u2013228. </ref><ref>Martini, Giuliana (2013). \"Bodhisattva Texts, Ideologies and Rituals in Khotan in the Fifth and Sixth Centuries\", in Buddhism among the Iranian Peoples\nof Central Asia, M.

First, there is the happiness visible in this very life. The Buddha states that four things lead to this happiness: \"The accomplishment of persistent effort, the accomplishment of protection, good friendship, and balanced living.\"<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 124</ref> Similarly, in several other suttas, the Buddha teaches on how to improve family relationships, particularly on the importance of filial love and gratitude as well as marital well-being.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 110</ref>\n\nRegarding the happiness of the next life, the Buddha (in the ''[[D\u012bghaj\u0101\u1e47u Sutta]]'') states that the virtues which lead to a good rebirth are: [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] (in the Buddha and the teachings), moral discipline, especially keeping the [[five precepts]], generosity, and wisdom (knowledge of the arising and passing of things).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 111, 125.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Buddha of the suttas then, achieving a good rebirth is based on cultivating wholesome or skillful (''kusala'') karma, which leads to a good result, and avoiding unwholesome (''akusala'') karma. A common list of good karmas taught by the Buddha is the list of ten courses of action (''[[kammapatha]]'') as outlined in MN 41 ''Saleyyaka Sutta'' (and its Chinese parallel in S\u0100 1042).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 146\u2013148, 156.</ref><ref>Analayo (2011). \"A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nik\u0101ya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),\" p. 263.</ref>\n\nGood karma is also termed [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit (''pu\u00f1\u00f1a'')]], and the Buddha outlines three bases of meritorious actions: giving, moral discipline and meditation (as seen in AN 8:36).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 151, 167.</ref>\n\n==== The Path to Liberation ====\n[[File:Seated_Buddha,_Pakistan_or_Afghanistan,_Ghandhara_region,_2nd_-_3rd_century,_gray_schist,_HAA.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Gandharan]] sculpture depicting the Buddha in the [[Lotus position|full lotus]] seated meditation posture, 2nd-3rd century CE]]\n[[File:20160124_Sri_Lanka_3769_Polonnaruwa_sRGB_(25144212713).jpg|thumb|200px|Buddha Statues from [[Gal Vihara]].

Various suttas discuss the different drawbacks of sensuality. In the ''Potaliya Sutta'' (MN 54) sensual pleasures are said by the Buddha to be a cause of conflict for all humans beings.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 195</ref> They are said to be unable to satisfy one's craving, like a clean meatless bone given to a dog.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 199</ref> Sensuality is also compared to a torch held against the wind, since it burns the person holding on to it.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 200</ref> According to the Buddha, there is \"a delight apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, which surpasses even divine bliss.\" The Buddha thus taught that one should take delight in the higher spiritual pleasures instead of sensual pleasure.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 204.</ref> This is explained with the simile the leper, who cauterizes his skin with fire to get relief from the pain of leprosy, but after he is cured, avoids the same flames he used to enjoy before (see MN 75, ''Magandiya Sutta'').<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 205.</ref>\n\nNumerous scholars such as Vetter have written on the centrality of the practice of [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|''dhy\u0101na'']] to the teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn|Vetter|1988a|pp=xxx, xxxv\u2013xxxvi, 4\u20135}} It is the training of the mind, commonly translated as [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], to withdraw the mind from the automatic responses to sense-impressions, and leading to a \"state of perfect [[Upekkha|equanimity]] and awareness (''upekkh\u0101-sati-parisuddhi'').\"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5}} Dhyana is preceded and supported by various aspects of the path such as seclusion and sense restraint.<ref>Analayo (2017). \"Early Buddhist meditation studies,\" pp. 80, 128, 135.</ref>\n\nAnother important mental training in the early texts is the practice of [[mindfulness]] (''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]''), which was mainly taught using the schemas of the \"Four Ways of Mindfulness\" (''[[Satipatthana]]'', as taught in the Pali ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' and its various parallel texts) and the sixteen elements of \"Mindfulness of Breath\" (''[[Anapanasati]]'', as taught in the ''[[Anapanasati Sutta]]'' and its various parallels).<ref>For a comparative survey of Satipatthana in the Pali, Tibetan and Chinese sources, see: ''Analayo (2014), \"Perspectives on Satipatthana.\"'' For a comparative survey of Anapanasati, see: ''Dhammajoti KL (2008), \"Sixteen-mode Mindfulness of Breathing\", JCBSSL v. VI.''</ref>\n\nBecause getting others to practice the path was the central goal of the Buddha's message, the early texts depict the Buddha as refusing to answer [[The unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]] which his contemporaries were preoccupied with, (such as \"is the world eternal?\"). This is because he did not see these questions as being useful on the path and as not being \"connected to the goal\".<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 66.</ref>\n\n====Monasticism====\nThe early Buddhist texts depict the Buddha as promoting the life of a homeless and [[Celibacy|celibate]] \"''sramana''\", or mendicant, as the ideal way of life for the practice of the path.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 85, 88.</ref> He taught that mendicants or \"beggars\" ([[Bhikkhu|''bhikkhus'']]) were supposed to give up all possessions and to own just a begging bowl and three robes. <ref>Kalupahana (1992) p. 28.</ref> As part of the Buddha's monastic discipline, they were also supposed to rely on the wider lay community for the basic necessities (mainly food, clothing, and lodging).<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 85</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's teachings on monastic discipline were preserved in the various [[Vinaya]] collections of the different early schools.<ref>Kalupahana (1992) p. 28.</ref>\n\nBuddhist monastics, which included both monks and nuns, were supposed to beg for their food, were not allowed to store up food or eat after noon and they were not allowed to use gold, silver or any valuables.<ref>Heirman, Ann (2019). \"Vinaya rules for monks and nuns.\"</ref><ref>Gethin (1998), p. 87</ref>\n\n====Socio-political teachings====\nThe early texts depict the Buddha as giving a deflationary account of the importance of politics to human life. Politics is inevitable and is probably even necessary and helpful, but it is also a tremendous waste of time and effort, as well as being a prime temptation to allow ego to run rampant. Buddhist political theory denies that people have a moral duty to engage in politics except to a very minimal degree (pay the taxes, obey the laws, maybe vote in the elections), and it actively portrays engagement in politics and the pursuit of enlightenment as being conflicting paths in life.<ref>Matthew J. Moore, ''Buddhism and Political Theory'', Oxford University Press, 2016  {{ISBN|9780190465513}} p.2</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Agga\u00f1\u00f1a Sutta]]'', the Buddha teaches a history of how monarchy arose which according to Matthew J. Moore is \"closely analogous to a social contract.\" The ''Agga\u00f1\u00f1a Sutta'' also provides a social explanation of how different classes arose, in contrast to the Vedic views on social caste.<ref name=\":7\">Moore, Matthew J.

This ideal leader is one who promotes Dharma through his governance. He can only achieve his status through moral purity and must promote morality and Dharma to maintain his position. According to the ''Cakkavatti-S\u012bhan\u0101da Sutta'', the key duties of a Cakkavatti are: \"establish guard, ward, and protection according to Dhamma for your own household, your troops, your nobles, and vassals, for Brahmins and householders, town and country folk, ascetics and Brahmins, for beasts and birds. let no crime prevail in your kingdom, and to those who are in need, give property.\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> The sutta explains the injunction to give to the needy by telling how a line of wheel-turning monarchs falls because they fail to give to the needy, and thus the kingdom falls into infighting as poverty increases, which then leads to stealing and violence.{{refn|group=note|\"thus, from the not giving of property to the needy, poverty became rife, from the growth of poverty, the taking of what was not given increased, from the increase of theft, the use of weapons increased, from the increased use of weapons, the taking of life increased \u2014 and from the increase in the taking of life, people\u2019s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and [as] a result of this decrease of life-span and beauty, the children of those whose life-span had been eighty-thousand years lived for only forty thousand.\"<ref>Moore, Matthew J.

He taught them to \u201chold regular and frequent assemblies\u201d, live in harmony and maintain their traditions. The Buddha then goes on to promote a similar kind of republican style of government among the Buddhist Sangha, where all monks had equal rights to attend open meetings and there would be no single leader, since The Buddha also chose not to appoint one.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some scholars have argued that this fact signals that the Buddha preferred a [[Republicanism|republican]] form of government, while others disagree with this position.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Scholarly views on the earliest teachings ===\n{{Main|Presectarian Buddhism}}\n[[File:Kanishka Buddha detail.jpg|thumb|150px|The Buddha on a coin of [[Kanishka I]], {{circa|130}} CE.]]\n\nNumerous scholars of early Buddhism argue that most of the teachings found in the Early Buddhist texts date back to the Buddha himself. One of these is [[Richard Gombrich]], who argues that since the content of the earliest texts \u201cpresents such originality, intelligence, grandeur and\u2014most relevantly\u2014coherence...it is hard to see it as a composite work.\" Thus he concludes they are \"the work of one genius.\"<ref>Gombrich, Richard (2006). ''\"Therav\u0101da Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo,\"'' p. 21. The Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices Series. Routledge & Kegan Paul.</ref> \n\n[[Peter Harvey]] also agrees that \u201cmuch\u201d of the Pali Canon \u201cmust derive from his [the Buddha\u2019s] teachings.\u201d<ref>Harvey, Peter (1990). ''\"An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices,\"'' p. 3. Introduction to Religion. Cambridge University Press.</ref> Likewise, [[A.\u200aK. Warder]] has written that \u201cthere is no evidence to suggest that it [the shared teaching of the early schools] was formulated by anyone other than the Buddha and his immediate followers.\u201d<ref>Warder, A.K (2000). \"''Indian Buddhism,\"'' inside flap''.'' Buddhism Series. Motilal Banarsidass.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Alexander Wynne argues that \"the internal evidence of the early Buddhist literature proves its historical authenticity.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wynne | first1 = Alexander | year = 2005 | title = The Historical Authenticity of Early Buddhist Literature | url = | journal = Vienna Journal of South Asian Studies | volume = XLIX | issue = | pages = 35\u201370 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, other scholars of Buddhist studies have disagreed with the mostly positive view that the early Buddhist texts reflect the teachings of the historical Buddha. For example, [[Edward Conze]] argued that the attempts of European scholars to reconstruct the original teachings of the Buddha were \u201call mere guesswork.\u201d<ref>Conze, Edward (2000). \"Buddhism: A Short History.\" From Buddhism to Sufism Series. Oneworld.</ref>\n\nOther scholars argue that some teachings contained in the early texts are the authentic teachings of the Buddha, but not others. For example, according to Tilmann Vetter, the earliest core of the Buddhist teachings is the meditative practice of ''dhy\u0101na''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988b|p=xxx, xxxv\u2013xxxvi, 4\u20135}}{{refn|group=note|Vetter: \"However, if we look at the last, and in my opinion the most important, component of this list [the noble eightfold path], we are still dealing with what according to me is the real content of the middle way, dhyana-meditation, at least the stages two to four, which are said to be free of contemplation and reflection. Everything preceding the eighth part, i.e. right samadhi, apparently has the function of preparing for the right samadhi.\"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}}}} Vetter argues that \"liberating insight\" became an essential feature of the Buddhist tradition at a later date. He posits that the Fourth Noble Truths, the Eightfold path and Dependent Origination, which are commonly seen as essential to Buddhism, are later formulations which form part of the explanatory framework of this \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiv\u2013xxxvii}}  \n\n[[Lambert Schmithausen]] similarly argues that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting \"liberating insight\", which is attained after mastering the four ''dhy\u0101nas'', is a later addition.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}} Also, according to [[Johannes Bronkhorst]], the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}}\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n{{Main |Physical characteristics of the Buddha}}\n=== In early sources ===\n[[File:Mahapragya exiled 1926 wk.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monks from Nepal. According to the earliest sources, the Buddha looked like a typical shaved man from northeast India.]]\n\nEarly sources depict the Buddha's as similar to other Buddhist monks. Various discourses describe how he \"cut off his hair and beard\" when renouncing the world. Likewise, Digha Nikaya 3 has a Brahmin describe the Buddha as a shaved or bald (''mundaka'') man.<ref>Olivelle, Patrick (1974), ''\"The Origin and the Early Development of Buddhist Monachism\"'', p. 19.</ref> Digha Nikaya 2 also describes how king Ajatasattu is unable to tell which of the monks is the Buddha when approaching the sangha and must ask his minister to point him out. Likewise, in MN 140, a mendicant who sees himself as a follower of the Buddha meets the Buddha in person but is unable to recognize him.<ref>Mazard, Eisel (2010). [https://www.newmandala.org/the-buddha-was-bald/ \"The Buddha was bald,\"] New Mandala.</ref> \n\nThe Buddha is also described as being handsome and with a clear complexion (Digha I:115; Anguttara I:181), at least in his youth. In old age, however, he is described as having a stooped body, with slack and wrinkled limbs.<ref>S. Dhammika, \"The Buddha and his disciples.\" pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\n=== The 32 Signs ===\nVarious Buddhist texts attribute to the Buddha a series of extraordinary physical characteristics, known as \"the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#32 Signs of a Great Man|32 Signs of the Great Man]]\" (Skt. ''mah\u0101puru\u1e63a lak\u1e63a\u1e47a''). \n\nAccording to Analayo, when they first appear in the Buddhist texts, these physical marks were initially held to be imperceptible to the ordinary person, and required special training to detect. Later though, they are depicted as being visible by regular people and as inspiring faith in the Buddha.<ref>Analayo (2017), \"Buddhapada and the Bodhisattva Path\", pp. 137\u2013138.</ref>\n\nThese characteristics are described in the [[Digha Nikaya]]'s ''{{IAST |Lakkha\u1e47a Sutta}}'' (D, I:142).{{sfn|Walshe|1995|pp = 441\u201360}}\n\n== Gautama Buddha in other religions ==\n[[File:Avatarbuddha.jpg|right|thumb|Buddha depicted as the 9th [[avatar]] of god [[Vishnu]] in a traditional Hindu representation]]\n[[File:Buddha_statue_at_Dwaraka_Tirumala_Temple_02.jpg|thumb|Buddha as an avatar at [[Dwaraka Tirumala]] temple, [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]\n{{Main|Gautama Buddha in world religions}}\n\nSome [[Hindus]] [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|regard Gautama]] as the 9th [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]].<ref group=note name=\"google260\" />{{sfn |Gopal| 1990|p=73}}{{sfn|Doniger|1993|p=243}} However, Buddha's teachings deny the authority of the [[Vedas]] and the concepts of [[Brahman]]-[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]].<ref name=\"sep\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Buddha |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buddha/ |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref><ref>Sushil Mittal & Gene Thursby (2004), ''The Hindu World'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-77227-3}}, pp. 729\u201330</ref><ref>C.

Such idols had been sold in Buddhist temples next to a mosque in [[Bukhara]], but he does not further discuss the role of Buddha. According to the works on Buddhism by [[Al-Biruni]] (973\u2013after 1050), views regarding the exact identity of Buddha was diverse. Accordingly, some regarded him as the divine incarnate, others as an apostle of the angels or as an [[Ifrit]] and others as an apostle of God sent to human race. By the 12th century, [[al-Shahrastani]] even compared Buddha to [[Khidr]], described as an ideal human. [[Ibn Nadim]], who was also familiar with [[Manichaeism|Manichean teachings]], even identifies Buddha as a prophet, who taught a religion to \"banish [[Satan]]\", although not mention it explicitly.
