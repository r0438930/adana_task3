Ballads receiving the Jones treatment were punctuated with gunshots, whistles, cowbells and outlandish and comedic vocals. Jones and his band recorded under the title '''Spike Jones and his City Slickers''' from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s, and toured the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as ''The Musical Depreciation Revue''.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Spike Jones HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|Jones as a senior in high school, 1929]]\nJones' father was a [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad agent.

In the 1930s he joined the [[Victor Young]] orchestra and got many offers to appear on radio shows, including [[Al Jolson]]'s ''Lifebuoy Program'', ''[[Burns and Allen]]'', and [[Bing Crosby]]'s ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]''.<ref name=Jones/>\n\nJones became bored playing the same music each night with the orchestras. He found other like-minded musicians and they began playing parodies of standard songs for their own entertainment. The musicians wanted their wives to share their enjoyment, so they recorded their weekly performances. One of the recordings made its way into the hands of an [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] executive, who offered the musicians a recording contract. One of the City Slickers' early recordings for the label was a [[Del Porter]] arrangement of  \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\".<ref name=Jones/> The record's success inspired Jones to become the band's leader. He initially thought the popularity the record brought them would fade. However, audiences kept asking for more, so Jones started working on more comic arrangements.<ref name=Jones/>\n\nFrom 1937 to 1942, Jones was the percussionist for [[the John Scott Trotter Orchestra]], which played on Bing Crosby's first recording of \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/trotter.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724001618/http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/trotter.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 July 2006 |title=Error 404 \u2013 Page Not Found |website=Community.mcckc.edu |accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> He was part of a backing band for songwriter [[Cindy Walker]] during her early recording career with [[Decca Records]] and Standard Transcriptions.

They recorded extensively for the company until 1955. They also starred in various radio programs (1945\u20131949) and in their own [[NBC]] and [[CBS]] [[The Spike Jones Show (series)|television shows]] from 1954 to 1961.\n\nDuring the 1940s, prominent band members included:\n\n[[File:Spike Dyke Dick Tracy.jpg|right|thumb|300px|September 14, 1949 appearance of Spike Dyke, modeled on Spike Jones, in [[Chester Gould]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy]]'']]\n*[[George Rock]] (trumpet, and vocals from 1944 to 1960)\n*[[Mickey Katz]] (clarinet, vocals)\n*[[Doodles Weaver]] (vocals&nbsp;\u2014 specialized in playing sports commentators and absentminded singers who persistently scrambled their lyrics into [[malapropism]]s and digressed into [[stand-up comedy]])\n*[[Red Ingle]] (sax, vocals)\n*[[Frank Rehak]] (trombone)\n*[[Del Porter]] (clarinet, vocals)\n*Carl Grayson (violin, vocals)\n*Perry Botkin (banjo)\n*Country Washburne (tuba)\n*Luther \"Red\" Roundtree (banjo)\n*Earl Bennett, AKA Sir Frederick Gas (vocals)\n*Joe Siracusa (drums)\n*Joe Colvin (trombone)\n*Roger Donley (tuba)\n*Dick Gardner (sax, violin)\n*Paul Leu (piano)\n*Jack Golly (trumpet, clarinet)\n*John Stanley (trombone)\n*Don Anderson (trumpet)\n*Charlotte Tinsley (harp)\n*Eddie Metcalfe (saxophone)\n*Dick Morgan (banjo)\n*George Lescher (piano)\n*[[Freddy Morgan (musician)|Freddy Morgan]] (banjo, vocals)\n*[[Purv Pullen|A.

James joined Healy for a two-year run in the Shubert revue ''A Night in Spain'' (1927\u20131928) where he worked alongside [[Shemp Howard]] and [[Larry Fine]]. Mousie joined with Healy from 1931 \u2013 1932  after [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]] and [[Shemp Howard]] had their first split with Ted, and with fellow Healy \"stooges\" Dick Hakins and Jack Wolfe, appeared in the Broadway shows ''The Gang's All Here'' and ''Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt''. Mousie, with Hakins and Sammy Glasser (aka Sammy Wolfe) rejoined Healy in 1937 for radio and personal appearances, until Healy's death in December 1937.\n\nSpike Jones's second wife, singer [[Helen Grayco]], performed in his stage and television shows. Jones had four children: Linda (by his first wife, Patricia), [[Spike Jones, Jr.|Spike Jr.]], Leslie Ann and Gina. Spike Jr. is a producer of live events and television broadcasts. [[Leslie Ann Jones|Leslie Ann]] is the Director of Music and Film Scoring at [[George Lucas]]' [[Skywalker Ranch]] in [[Marin County]].{{citation needed|date= June 2012}}\n\n==Record hits==\n\n===\"Der Fuehrer's Face\"===\nIn 1942, a strike by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] prevented Jones from making commercial recordings for over two years. He could, however, make records for radio broadcasts. These were released on the Standard Transcriptions label (1941\u20131946) and have been reissued on a CD compilation called ''(Not) Your Standard Spike Jones Collection''.\n\nRecorded just days before the recording ban, Jones scored a huge broadcast hit late in 1942 with \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\", a song ridiculing [[Adolf Hitler]], which followed every use of the word \"Heil\" with a derisive [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]] sound, as in the repeated phrase \"&nbsp;Heil, (raspberry), Heil (raspberry), right in Der Fuehrer's face!\".\n\n===More satirical songs===\n{{Listen\n  | filename = SpikeJones.CocktailsForTwo.excerpt.ogg\n  | title = Spike Jones and His City Slickers: Cocktails for Two\n  | description = 16-second sample, as the musical [[wikt:mayhem|mayhem]] begins\n  | format = [[ogg]]\n}}\nThe romantic ballad \"[[Cocktails for Two]]\", originally written to evoke an intimate romantic rendezvous, was re-recorded by Spike Jones in 1944 as a raucous, horn-honking, voice-gurgling, hiccuping hymn to the cocktail hour. The Jones version was a huge hit.\n\nOther Jones satires followed: \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\", \"[[Chlo-e (Song of the Swamp)|Chloe]]\", \"[[Holiday for Strings (song)|Holiday for Strings]]\", \"[[You Always Hurt the One You Love]]\",<ref name=pc1b>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|B}}</ref> \"My Old Flame\", referring to [[Peter Lorre]]'s voice (impersonated on the recording by [[Paul Frees]]) and eerie scenes in contemporary movies, and many more.\n\n===\"Ghost Riders\"===\nSpike's parody of [[Vaughn Monroe]]'s rendition of \"[[Ghost Riders in the Sky]]\" was performed as if sung by a drunkard and ridiculed Monroe by name in its final stanza:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222124210/http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/spike3.htm |title=Spike Jones Can't Stop Murdering |date=February 22, 2016 |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>''Cocktails For Two'', Pro-Arte PCD 516,1990, Side 2, Track 5.</ref> <blockquote>\nCHORUS: 'Cause all we hear is \"Ghost Riders\" sung by Vaughn Monroe.<br />\nI.W.

(A few pressings containing the first ending were mistakenly released on the West Coast and are a prized rarity today.)\n\n===\"All I Want for Christmas\"===\nJones' recording, \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth]]\", with a piping vocal by [[George Rock]], was a number-one hit in 1948. ([[Dora Bryan]] recorded a 1963 variation, \"All I Want For Christmas is a [[The Beatles|Beatle]]\".)\n\n===Murdering the Classics===\n[[File:Spike Jones 1948.jpg|thumb|Jones with some of his musical instruments \u2013 empty tin cans \u2013 in the background]]\nAmong the series of recordings in the 1940s were humorous takes on the classics such as the adaptation of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s ''[[Liebestr\u00e4ume|Liebestraum No. 3]]'', played at a breakneck pace on unusual instruments. Others followed: [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''William Tell Overture'' was rendered on kitchen implements using a [[horse race]] as a backdrop, with one of the \"horses\" in the \"race\" likely to have inspired the nickname of the lone [[chrome yellow]]-painted [[AT-6 Texan|SNJ]] aircraft flown by the U.S. Navy's [[Blue Angels#1940s|Blue Angels]] aerobatic team's shows in the late 1940s, \"Beetle Bomb\". In live shows Spike would acknowledge the applause with complete solemnity, saying \"Thank you, music lovers.\" An [[LP record|LP]] collection of twelve of these \"homicides\" was released by RCA (on its prestigious [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] label) in 1971 as ''Spike Jones Is Murdering the Classics.'' They include such ''tours de force'' as Pal-Yat-Chee (''[[Pagliacci]]''), sung by the Hillbilly humorists [[Homer and Jethro]], Ponchielli's ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'', Tchaikovsky's ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (Tchaikovsky)|None but the Lonely Heart]]'', and Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]''.\n\nIn 1944 RCA Victor released his \"Spike Jones presents for the Kiddies\" version of Tchaikovsky's ''Nutcracker Suite'', in three 10 inch 78 rpm records, P-143, arrangement credited to Joe \"Country\" Washburne with lyrics by Foster Carling. It was released as a three 7 inch 45 rpm vinyl set in 1949 as WP-143 and as a one 45rpm extended play EPA-143 in 1952. An abridged and re-sequenced version is also included in the aforementioned 'classics' album, with the complete original version available on the CD collection ''Spiked: The Music of Spike Jones''.\n\n==Radio==\nAfter appearing as the house band on ''[[The Bob Burns Show]],'' Spike got his own radio show on [[NBC]], ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour|The Chase and Sanborn Program]]'', as [[Edgar Bergen]]'s summer replacement in 1945. [[Frances Langford]] was co-host and [[Groucho Marx]] was among the guests. The guest list for Jones's 1947\u201349 CBS program for [[Coca-Cola]] (originally ''The Spotlight Revue'', retitled ''The Spike Jones Show'' for its final season) included [[Frankie Laine]], [[Mel Torme]], Peter Lorre, [[Don Ameche]] and [[Burl Ives]]. [[Frank Sinatra]] appeared on the show in October 1948, and [[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]] in May 1949. Jones's resident \"girlsinger\" during this period was [[Dorothy Shay]], \"The Park Avenue Hillbillie.\" One of the announcers on Jones's CBS show was the young [[Mike Wallace]]. Writers included Eddie Maxwell, Eddie Brandt and [[Jay Sommers]]. The final program in the series was broadcast in June 1949.\n\n==Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra==\nWhile Jones enjoyed the fame and prosperity, he was annoyed that nobody seemed to see beyond the craziness. Determined to show the world that he was capable of producing legitimate \"pretty\" music, he formed a second group in 1946. Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra played lush arrangements of dance hits. This alternate group played nightclub engagements and was an artistic success, but the paying public preferred the City Slickers and stayed away. Jones wound up paying some of the band's expenses out of his own pocket. Some of the City Slickers band members appeared and recorded with the Other Orchestra, but most of the Other Orchestra personnel consisted of \"serious,\" accomplished studio musicians from the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe one outstanding recording by the Other Orchestra is \"Laura\", which features a serious first half (played exquisitely by the Other Orchestra) and a manic second half (played hilariously by the City Slickers).\n\nJones' son, Spike Jones Jr., called attention to the precision of his father's most outlandish musical arrangements: \"One of the things that people don't realize about Dad's kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-05-08-bk-55045-story.html |title=Brevity's Raincheck |date=May 8, 1994 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Movies==\nIn 1940, Jones had an uncredited bandleading part in the [[Dead End Kids]] film ''Give Us Wings'', appearing on camera for about four seconds.\n\nAs the band's fame grew, Hollywood producers hired the Slickers as a specialty act for feature films, including ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943 film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' (1943), ''[[Meet the People]]'' (1944), ''[[Bring on the Girls (film)|Bring on the Girls]]'' (1945), ''[[Breakfast in Hollywood]]'' (1946) and ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947). Jones was set to team with [[Abbott and Costello]] for a [[1954 in film|1954]] [[Universal Pictures]] comedy, but when Lou Costello withdrew for medical reasons, Universal replaced the comedy team with look-alikes [[Hugh O'Brian]] and [[Buddy Hackett]], and promoted Jones to the leading role. The finished film, ''[[Fireman Save My Child (1954 film)|Fireman Save My Child]]'', turned out to be Spike Jones's only top-billed theatrical movie.\n\n==Soundies==\nIn 1942, the Jones gang worked on numerous [[Soundies]], musical shorts similar to later [[music video]]s which were shown on coin-operated projectors in arcades, malt shops, and taverns. The band appeared on camera under their own name in four of the Soundies (\"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\", \"Pass the Biscuits, Mirandy\", \"The Sheik of Araby\", and \"Blacksmith Song\"), and, according to musicologist Mark Cantor, provided background music for at least thirteen others. [[Mel Blanc]], the voice of [[Bugs Bunny]] and other [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon characters, performed a drunken, hiccuping verse for 1942's \"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\" (reissued in 1949 as \"The Clink! Clink! Polka\").\n\n==Television==\n[[File:Spike Jones Bill Dana Helen Grayco Spike Jones Show 1960.JPG|thumb|180px|Jones and his wife, [[Helen Grayco]], with [[Bill Dana (comedian)|Bill Dana]] in 1960. Dana wrote and produced the summer replacement show, as well as performed on it.]]\nJones saw the potential of television and filmed two half-hour pilot films, ''Foreign Legion'' and ''Wild Bill Hiccup'', in the summer of 1950. Veteran comedy director [[Edward F. Cline|Eddie Cline]] worked on both, but neither was successful. The band fared much better on live television, where their spontaneous antics and crazy visual gags guaranteed the viewers a good time. Spike usually dressed in a suit with an enormous check pattern and was seen leaping around playing a washboard, cowbells, a suite of klaxons and foghorns, then xylophone, then shooting a pistol. The band starred in variety shows, such as ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' (1951, 1955)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009220817/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications.

Jones and his City Slickers also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'' in the episode which aired on November 15, 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |title=The Ford Show Guest Guide |publisher=ernieford.com |accessdate=November 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128190749/http://ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |archivedate=November 28, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1990, [[BBC Two|BBC2]] screened six compilation shows from these broadcasts; they were subsequently aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations.\n\n==Later years==\nThe decline of big bands and the rise of [[rock and roll]] in the early 1950s hurt Spike Jones' repertoire. Early rock songs were ''already'' novelties, and Jones could not satirise them the same way he had lampooned \"Cocktails for Two\", \"Chloe\" or \"Laura\". He played rock music for laughs when he presented \"for the first time on television, the bottom half of [[Elvis Presley]]!\" This was the cue for a pair of pants\u2014inhabited by dwarf actor [[Billy Barty]]\u2014to scamper across the stage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Young |first=Jordan R. |year=2005 |title=Spike Jones Off the Record: The Man Who Murdered Music |edition=3rd |location=Albany |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=1-59393-012-7}}</ref>\n\nJones was always prepared to adapt to changing tastes. In 1950, when America was nostalgically looking back at the 1920s, Jones recorded a straight album of Charleston arrangements. In 1953, he responded to the growing market for children's records, with tunes aimed directly at kids (like \"Socko, the Smallest Snowball\"). Jones had become increasingly unhappy at RCA Victor due to management interfering with his choice of repertoire and other matters, and he left the label in 1955. His later recordings were issued by [[Verve Records|Verve]], [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] and [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] In 1956, Jones supervised an album of Christmas songs, many of which were performed seriously. In 1957, noting the television success of [[Lawrence Welk]] and his dance band, he revamped his own act for television. Gone was the old City Slickers mayhem, replaced by a more straightforward big-band sound, with tongue-in-cheek comic moments. The new band was known as Spike Jones and the Band that Plays for Fun. The last City Slickers record was the LP ''[[Dinner Music for People Who Aren't Very Hungry]]''. The whole field of comedy records changed from musical satires to spoken-word comedy ([[Bob Newhart]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Stan Freberg]]). Spike Jones adapted to this, too; most of his later albums are spoken-word comedy, including the horror-genre sendup ''[[Spike Jones in Stereo]]'' (1959) and the send-up of television programs of the period in ''Omnibust'' (1960). Jones remained topical to the last: his final group, Spike Jones's New Band, recorded four LPs of brassy renditions of pop-folk tunes of the 1960s (including \"Washington Square\" and \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\"). One of his New Band tracks in 1964 was a cover of \"[[Dominique]]\", a hit by [[The Singing Nun]], in which he not only plays part of the melody on a [[banjo]] but melds the melody successfully with \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]!\"\n\nJones was a lifelong heavy smoker, reportedly 4-5 packs a day, and eventually he developed [[emphysema]]. Never a very healthy person, his health would deteriorate to the point where he had to use an oxygen tank both offstage and onstage, and he was confined to a seat behind his drum set. In spite of his illness, he continued smoking for the rest of his life and he died in May 1965 at the age of 53. He is buried in [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California]].\n\n==Influence==\nThere is a clear line of influence from [[Harry Reser]]'s 1920s hot-comic \"Six Jumping Jacks\" band (whose drummer and vocalist was the distinctive [[Tom Stacks]], \"The Voice With a Smile\"), the [[Hoosier Hot Shots]], [[Freddie Fisher (musician)|Freddie Fisher]] and his [[Schnickelfritz Band|Schnickelfritzers]], and the [[Marx Brothers]] to Spike Jones&nbsp;\u2014 and to [[Stan Freberg]], [[Gerard Hoffnung]], [[Peter Schickele]]'s [[P.D.Q. Bach]], [[The Goons]], [[Joe Raposo]], [[Mr. Bungle]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]], [[Oingo Boingo|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]], and [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]. [[Billy Barty]] appeared in Yankovic's film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and a video based on the movie. According to David Wild's review in Rolling Stone Magazine, [[Elvis Costello]]'s 1989 Album \"[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]\" was named partly in tribute to Jones.\n\nSyndicated radio personality [[Dr. Demento]] regularly features Jones' music on his program of comedy and novelty tracks. Jones is mentioned in [[The Band]]'s song, \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\". (The song's protagonist's paramour states of Jones: \"I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk.\") Novelist [[Thomas Pynchon]] is an admirer and wrote the liner notes for a 1994 reissue, ''Spiked!'' (BMG Catalyst). A scene in the romantic comedy ''[[I.Q.

Ballads receiving the Jones treatment were punctuated with gunshots, whistles, cowbells and outlandish and comedic vocals. Jones and his band recorded under the title '''Spike Jones and his City Slickers''' from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s, and toured the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as ''The Musical Depreciation Revue''.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Spike Jones HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|Jones as a senior in high school, 1929]]\nJones' father was a [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad agent.

He found other like-minded musicians and they began playing parodies of standard songs for their own entertainment. The musicians wanted their wives to share their enjoyment, so they recorded their weekly performances. One of the recordings made its way into the hands of an [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] executive, who offered the musicians a recording contract. One of the City Slickers' early recordings for the label was a [[Del Porter]] arrangement of  \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\".<ref name=Jones/> The record's success inspired Jones to become the band's leader. He initially thought the popularity the record brought them would fade. However, audiences kept asking for more, so Jones started working on more comic arrangements.<ref name=Jones/>\n\nFrom 1937 to 1942, Jones was the percussionist for [[the John Scott Trotter Orchestra]], which played on Bing Crosby's first recording of \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/trotter.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724001618/http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/trotter.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 July 2006 |title=Error 404 \u2013 Page Not Found |website=Community.mcckc.edu |accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> He was part of a backing band for songwriter [[Cindy Walker]] during her early recording career with [[Decca Records]] and Standard Transcriptions.

Mousie joined with Healy from 1931 \u2013 1932  after [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]] and [[Shemp Howard]] had their first split with Ted, and with fellow Healy \"stooges\" Dick Hakins and Jack Wolfe, appeared in the Broadway shows ''The Gang's All Here'' and ''Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt''. Mousie, with Hakins and Sammy Glasser (aka Sammy Wolfe) rejoined Healy in 1937 for radio and personal appearances, until Healy's death in December 1937.\n\nSpike Jones's second wife, singer [[Helen Grayco]], performed in his stage and television shows. Jones had four children: Linda (by his first wife, Patricia), [[Spike Jones, Jr.|Spike Jr.]], Leslie Ann and Gina. Spike Jr. is a producer of live events and television broadcasts. [[Leslie Ann Jones|Leslie Ann]] is the Director of Music and Film Scoring at [[George Lucas]]' [[Skywalker Ranch]] in [[Marin County]].{{citation needed|date= June 2012}}\n\n==Record hits==\n\n===\"Der Fuehrer's Face\"===\nIn 1942, a strike by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] prevented Jones from making commercial recordings for over two years. He could, however, make records for radio broadcasts. These were released on the Standard Transcriptions label (1941\u20131946) and have been reissued on a CD compilation called ''(Not) Your Standard Spike Jones Collection''.\n\nRecorded just days before the recording ban, Jones scored a huge broadcast hit late in 1942 with \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\", a song ridiculing [[Adolf Hitler]], which followed every use of the word \"Heil\" with a derisive [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]] sound, as in the repeated phrase \"&nbsp;Heil, (raspberry), Heil (raspberry), right in Der Fuehrer's face!\".\n\n===More satirical songs===\n{{Listen\n  | filename = SpikeJones.CocktailsForTwo.excerpt.ogg\n  | title = Spike Jones and His City Slickers: Cocktails for Two\n  | description = 16-second sample, as the musical [[wikt:mayhem|mayhem]] begins\n  | format = [[ogg]]\n}}\nThe romantic ballad \"[[Cocktails for Two]]\", originally written to evoke an intimate romantic rendezvous, was re-recorded by Spike Jones in 1944 as a raucous, horn-honking, voice-gurgling, hiccuping hymn to the cocktail hour. The Jones version was a huge hit.\n\nOther Jones satires followed: \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\", \"[[Chlo-e (Song of the Swamp)|Chloe]]\", \"[[Holiday for Strings (song)|Holiday for Strings]]\", \"[[You Always Hurt the One You Love]]\",<ref name=pc1b>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|B}}</ref> \"My Old Flame\", referring to [[Peter Lorre]]'s voice (impersonated on the recording by [[Paul Frees]]) and eerie scenes in contemporary movies, and many more.\n\n===\"Ghost Riders\"===\nSpike's parody of [[Vaughn Monroe]]'s rendition of \"[[Ghost Riders in the Sky]]\" was performed as if sung by a drunkard and ridiculed Monroe by name in its final stanza:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222124210/http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/spike3.htm |title=Spike Jones Can't Stop Murdering |date=February 22, 2016 |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>''Cocktails For Two'', Pro-Arte PCD 516,1990, Side 2, Track 5.</ref> <blockquote>\nCHORUS: 'Cause all we hear is \"Ghost Riders\" sung by Vaughn Monroe.<br />\nI.W.

(A few pressings containing the first ending were mistakenly released on the West Coast and are a prized rarity today.)\n\n===\"All I Want for Christmas\"===\nJones' recording, \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth]]\", with a piping vocal by [[George Rock]], was a number-one hit in 1948. ([[Dora Bryan]] recorded a 1963 variation, \"All I Want For Christmas is a [[The Beatles|Beatle]]\".)\n\n===Murdering the Classics===\n[[File:Spike Jones 1948.jpg|thumb|Jones with some of his musical instruments \u2013 empty tin cans \u2013 in the background]]\nAmong the series of recordings in the 1940s were humorous takes on the classics such as the adaptation of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s ''[[Liebestr\u00e4ume|Liebestraum No. 3]]'', played at a breakneck pace on unusual instruments. Others followed: [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''William Tell Overture'' was rendered on kitchen implements using a [[horse race]] as a backdrop, with one of the \"horses\" in the \"race\" likely to have inspired the nickname of the lone [[chrome yellow]]-painted [[AT-6 Texan|SNJ]] aircraft flown by the U.S. Navy's [[Blue Angels#1940s|Blue Angels]] aerobatic team's shows in the late 1940s, \"Beetle Bomb\". In live shows Spike would acknowledge the applause with complete solemnity, saying \"Thank you, music lovers.\" An [[LP record|LP]] collection of twelve of these \"homicides\" was released by RCA (on its prestigious [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] label) in 1971 as ''Spike Jones Is Murdering the Classics.'' They include such ''tours de force'' as Pal-Yat-Chee (''[[Pagliacci]]''), sung by the Hillbilly humorists [[Homer and Jethro]], Ponchielli's ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'', Tchaikovsky's ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (Tchaikovsky)|None but the Lonely Heart]]'', and Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]''.\n\nIn 1944 RCA Victor released his \"Spike Jones presents for the Kiddies\" version of Tchaikovsky's ''Nutcracker Suite'', in three 10 inch 78 rpm records, P-143, arrangement credited to Joe \"Country\" Washburne with lyrics by Foster Carling. It was released as a three 7 inch 45 rpm vinyl set in 1949 as WP-143 and as a one 45rpm extended play EPA-143 in 1952. An abridged and re-sequenced version is also included in the aforementioned 'classics' album, with the complete original version available on the CD collection ''Spiked: The Music of Spike Jones''.\n\n==Radio==\nAfter appearing as the house band on ''[[The Bob Burns Show]],'' Spike got his own radio show on [[NBC]], ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour|The Chase and Sanborn Program]]'', as [[Edgar Bergen]]'s summer replacement in 1945. [[Frances Langford]] was co-host and [[Groucho Marx]] was among the guests. The guest list for Jones's 1947\u201349 CBS program for [[Coca-Cola]] (originally ''The Spotlight Revue'', retitled ''The Spike Jones Show'' for its final season) included [[Frankie Laine]], [[Mel Torme]], Peter Lorre, [[Don Ameche]] and [[Burl Ives]]. [[Frank Sinatra]] appeared on the show in October 1948, and [[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]] in May 1949. Jones's resident \"girlsinger\" during this period was [[Dorothy Shay]], \"The Park Avenue Hillbillie.\" One of the announcers on Jones's CBS show was the young [[Mike Wallace]]. Writers included Eddie Maxwell, Eddie Brandt and [[Jay Sommers]]. The final program in the series was broadcast in June 1949.\n\n==Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra==\nWhile Jones enjoyed the fame and prosperity, he was annoyed that nobody seemed to see beyond the craziness. Determined to show the world that he was capable of producing legitimate \"pretty\" music, he formed a second group in 1946. Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra played lush arrangements of dance hits. This alternate group played nightclub engagements and was an artistic success, but the paying public preferred the City Slickers and stayed away. Jones wound up paying some of the band's expenses out of his own pocket. Some of the City Slickers band members appeared and recorded with the Other Orchestra, but most of the Other Orchestra personnel consisted of \"serious,\" accomplished studio musicians from the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe one outstanding recording by the Other Orchestra is \"Laura\", which features a serious first half (played exquisitely by the Other Orchestra) and a manic second half (played hilariously by the City Slickers).\n\nJones' son, Spike Jones Jr., called attention to the precision of his father's most outlandish musical arrangements: \"One of the things that people don't realize about Dad's kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-05-08-bk-55045-story.html |title=Brevity's Raincheck |date=May 8, 1994 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Movies==\nIn 1940, Jones had an uncredited bandleading part in the [[Dead End Kids]] film ''Give Us Wings'', appearing on camera for about four seconds.\n\nAs the band's fame grew, Hollywood producers hired the Slickers as a specialty act for feature films, including ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943 film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' (1943), ''[[Meet the People]]'' (1944), ''[[Bring on the Girls (film)|Bring on the Girls]]'' (1945), ''[[Breakfast in Hollywood]]'' (1946) and ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947). Jones was set to team with [[Abbott and Costello]] for a [[1954 in film|1954]] [[Universal Pictures]] comedy, but when Lou Costello withdrew for medical reasons, Universal replaced the comedy team with look-alikes [[Hugh O'Brian]] and [[Buddy Hackett]], and promoted Jones to the leading role. The finished film, ''[[Fireman Save My Child (1954 film)|Fireman Save My Child]]'', turned out to be Spike Jones's only top-billed theatrical movie.\n\n==Soundies==\nIn 1942, the Jones gang worked on numerous [[Soundies]], musical shorts similar to later [[music video]]s which were shown on coin-operated projectors in arcades, malt shops, and taverns. The band appeared on camera under their own name in four of the Soundies (\"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\", \"Pass the Biscuits, Mirandy\", \"The Sheik of Araby\", and \"Blacksmith Song\"), and, according to musicologist Mark Cantor, provided background music for at least thirteen others. [[Mel Blanc]], the voice of [[Bugs Bunny]] and other [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon characters, performed a drunken, hiccuping verse for 1942's \"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\" (reissued in 1949 as \"The Clink! Clink! Polka\").\n\n==Television==\n[[File:Spike Jones Bill Dana Helen Grayco Spike Jones Show 1960.JPG|thumb|180px|Jones and his wife, [[Helen Grayco]], with [[Bill Dana (comedian)|Bill Dana]] in 1960. Dana wrote and produced the summer replacement show, as well as performed on it.]]\nJones saw the potential of television and filmed two half-hour pilot films, ''Foreign Legion'' and ''Wild Bill Hiccup'', in the summer of 1950. Veteran comedy director [[Edward F. Cline|Eddie Cline]] worked on both, but neither was successful. The band fared much better on live television, where their spontaneous antics and crazy visual gags guaranteed the viewers a good time. Spike usually dressed in a suit with an enormous check pattern and was seen leaping around playing a washboard, cowbells, a suite of klaxons and foghorns, then xylophone, then shooting a pistol. The band starred in variety shows, such as ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' (1951, 1955)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009220817/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications.

Jones and his City Slickers also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'' in the episode which aired on November 15, 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |title=The Ford Show Guest Guide |publisher=ernieford.com |accessdate=November 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128190749/http://ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |archivedate=November 28, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1990, [[BBC Two|BBC2]] screened six compilation shows from these broadcasts; they were subsequently aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations.\n\n==Later years==\nThe decline of big bands and the rise of [[rock and roll]] in the early 1950s hurt Spike Jones' repertoire. Early rock songs were ''already'' novelties, and Jones could not satirise them the same way he had lampooned \"Cocktails for Two\", \"Chloe\" or \"Laura\". He played rock music for laughs when he presented \"for the first time on television, the bottom half of [[Elvis Presley]]!\" This was the cue for a pair of pants\u2014inhabited by dwarf actor [[Billy Barty]]\u2014to scamper across the stage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Young |first=Jordan R. |year=2005 |title=Spike Jones Off the Record: The Man Who Murdered Music |edition=3rd |location=Albany |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=1-59393-012-7}}</ref>\n\nJones was always prepared to adapt to changing tastes. In 1950, when America was nostalgically looking back at the 1920s, Jones recorded a straight album of Charleston arrangements. In 1953, he responded to the growing market for children's records, with tunes aimed directly at kids (like \"Socko, the Smallest Snowball\"). Jones had become increasingly unhappy at RCA Victor due to management interfering with his choice of repertoire and other matters, and he left the label in 1955. His later recordings were issued by [[Verve Records|Verve]], [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] and [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] In 1956, Jones supervised an album of Christmas songs, many of which were performed seriously. In 1957, noting the television success of [[Lawrence Welk]] and his dance band, he revamped his own act for television. Gone was the old City Slickers mayhem, replaced by a more straightforward big-band sound, with tongue-in-cheek comic moments. The new band was known as Spike Jones and the Band that Plays for Fun. The last City Slickers record was the LP ''[[Dinner Music for People Who Aren't Very Hungry]]''. The whole field of comedy records changed from musical satires to spoken-word comedy ([[Bob Newhart]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Stan Freberg]]). Spike Jones adapted to this, too; most of his later albums are spoken-word comedy, including the horror-genre sendup ''[[Spike Jones in Stereo]]'' (1959) and the send-up of television programs of the period in ''Omnibust'' (1960). Jones remained topical to the last: his final group, Spike Jones's New Band, recorded four LPs of brassy renditions of pop-folk tunes of the 1960s (including \"Washington Square\" and \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\"). One of his New Band tracks in 1964 was a cover of \"[[Dominique]]\", a hit by [[The Singing Nun]], in which he not only plays part of the melody on a [[banjo]] but melds the melody successfully with \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]!\"\n\nJones was a lifelong heavy smoker, reportedly 4-5 packs a day, and eventually he developed [[emphysema]]. Never a very healthy person, his health would deteriorate to the point where he had to use an oxygen tank both offstage and onstage, and he was confined to a seat behind his drum set. In spite of his illness, he continued smoking for the rest of his life and he died in May 1965 at the age of 53. He is buried in [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California]].\n\n==Influence==\nThere is a clear line of influence from [[Harry Reser]]'s 1920s hot-comic \"Six Jumping Jacks\" band (whose drummer and vocalist was the distinctive [[Tom Stacks]], \"The Voice With a Smile\"), the [[Hoosier Hot Shots]], [[Freddie Fisher (musician)|Freddie Fisher]] and his [[Schnickelfritz Band|Schnickelfritzers]], and the [[Marx Brothers]] to Spike Jones&nbsp;\u2014 and to [[Stan Freberg]], [[Gerard Hoffnung]], [[Peter Schickele]]'s [[P.D.Q. Bach]], [[The Goons]], [[Joe Raposo]], [[Mr. Bungle]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]], [[Oingo Boingo|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]], and [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]. [[Billy Barty]] appeared in Yankovic's film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and a video based on the movie. According to David Wild's review in Rolling Stone Magazine, [[Elvis Costello]]'s 1989 Album \"[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]\" was named partly in tribute to Jones.\n\nSyndicated radio personality [[Dr. Demento]] regularly features Jones' music on his program of comedy and novelty tracks. Jones is mentioned in [[The Band]]'s song, \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\". (The song's protagonist's paramour states of Jones: \"I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk.\") Novelist [[Thomas Pynchon]] is an admirer and wrote the liner notes for a 1994 reissue, ''Spiked!'' (BMG Catalyst). A scene in the romantic comedy ''[[I.Q. (film)|I.Q.]]'' shows a man demonstrating the sound of his new stereo to [[Meg Ryan]]'s character by playing a record of Jones' music.\n\nIn 1974, Tony Levin (future bass player for King Crimson), recording under the name, The Clams, released a Spike Jones tribute of him giving the songs, \"Close To You\", by The Carpenters, and, \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\", by Roberta Flack, the Jones treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/thb404f|title=The Clams - Close To You|website=45cat.com|accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[synthpop]] group [[Telex (band)|Telex]] paid homage to Spike Jones in their album ''Looney Tunes'', with a song named after him. The intro of that song is a part of the intro from ''Camptown Races''.\n\nIn 1997, singers [[Artie Schroeck]] and [[Linda November]] directed a production in [[Atlantic City]] entitled \"The New City Slickers Present a Tribute to Spike Jones\", with a band that attempted to re-create the style and humor of Jones' music.<ref name=musician>{{cite news|title=He's a serious musician in search of funny sounds|url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-09-26/entertainment/25552440_1_spike-jones-music-big-bands|date=September 26, 1997|author=Lloyd, Jack|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=June 17, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527140520/http://articles.philly.com/1997-09-26/entertainment/25552440_1_spike-jones-music-big-bands |archivedate=May 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Celebrating Spike Jones at Harrah's|date=September 21, 1997|author=Alexander, Randy|work=[[The Times (New Jersey)|The Times]]}}</ref>\n\nBoth [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Spike Jonze]] were named in reference to Jones.\n\n==Discography==\n* ''Spike Jones Plays the Charleston'' (1950)\n* ''Bottoms Up, Polka'' (1952)\n* ''Spike Jones Murders Carmen and Kids the Classics'' (1953)\n* ''[[Dinner Music For People Who Aren't Very Hungry]]'' (1956)\n* ''Spike Jones Presents a Xmas Spectacular'' (1956) (reissued as ''It's a Spike Jones Christmas'' and ''Let's Sing a Song of Christmas'')\n* ''Hi Fi Polka Party'' (1957)\n* ''[[Spike Jones in Stereo]]'' (1959) (reissued as ''Spike Jones in Hi Fi'')\n* ''Omnibust'' (1960)\n* ''60 Years of \"Music America Hates Best\"'' (1960)\n* ''Thank You Music Lovers!''
