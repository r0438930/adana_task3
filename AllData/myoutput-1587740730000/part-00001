This episode aired in the United States on [[HBO]] on September 4, 2005 and in the United Kingdom on 2 & 9 November 2005 on [[BBC]].\n\nWith growing political tensions at home, [[Gaius Julius Caesar (Rome character)|Caesar]] needs a voice within the Senate, and [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Mark Antony]] is not above accepting the gift of a bought office. Escorting the new \"Tribune of the People\" to Rome, [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Vorenus]] and [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Pullo]] return to their homes for the first time in years: Vorenus to his family, and Pullo to his vices. [[Atia of the Julii|Atia]] rewards those who return her lost son to her. In the back rooms of Rome powerful men strike bargains to strip Caesar of his growing power, and in growing political tensions of Rome the actions of the basest of men will shake the foundations of the city.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThis second episode is based on events that took place in 50 BC and 49 BC. [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[proconsul]]ship in [[Gaul]] is about to expire, which would mean a loss of the office's immunity against prosecution by his political enemies. He had faced the same situation five years prior, but at that time his command had been extended with the help of his allies [[Pompey]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Marcus Crassus]]. This time Caesar cannot count on his former allies, as Pompey has openly turned against him, and Crassus was killed in 53 BC at the [[battle of Carrhae]]. Caesar instead has to rely on [[Mark Antony]] for his political maneuvering: newly elected to the office of [[Tribune of the Plebs|Tribune of the People]] (''tribunus plebis''), Mark Antony has [[veto]] power in the [[Roman Senate]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[Lucius Vorenus]], now a [[Primus Pilus|first file centurion]] (''centurio primi pili''), and [[Titus Pullo]] return to Rome. After dropping off [[Augustus|Gaius Octavian]] and having lunch with [[Atia of the Julii]], Vorenus returns to his wife, whom he hasn't seen in eight years since he left for Gaul, only to find her holding a fairly new baby in her arms. When Vorenus asks her whose child it is, she tells him it is his grandson by his eldest daughter who has just newly turned 14. Meanwhile, Pullo returns to soliciting prostitutes and gambling. He's already lost most of his money in a gambling den full of Pompey's supporters when he discovers that he is being cheated by one of his opponents. He stabs the man through the throat, but is injured in the fight that breaks out. Pullo manages to drag himself to Vorenus's home, where he receives [[trepanation]] (courtesy of Vorenus) from a Greek doctor.\n\nCaesar's political enemies, led by Pompey, plan to pass a motion in the Senate that would set an ultimatum for Caesar to surrender his command, or be declared a public enemy. Pompey enlists the help of [[Cato the Younger]], [[Metellus Scipio]] (Pompey's new father-in-law), and of the reluctant [[Cicero]]. Pompey wants the motion to pass by a large majority, so that Caesar will see that he is isolated and has no political supporters. However, Pompey also wants the motion to be immediately vetoed by Caesar's ally Mark Antony so that the blame for any subsequent escalation would rest with Caesar. The motion is passed but a brawl erupts on the Senate floor and Mark Antony's veto is not recorded, nor is the session formally adjourned. Pompey is taken by surprise, and arranges for the Senate session to be continued the next day so that the tribune's veto can be recorded. He also gives orders to his minions that Mark Antony must not be harmed in any way.\n\nUnaware of Pompey's orders and feeling threatened because of his association with Caesar, Mark Antony calls on the soldiers from Caesar's [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion]] (''Legio XIII''), including Vorenus and Pullo, for protection. With Vorenus and Pullo walking beside him, Mark Antony makes his way to the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] in order to properly record his veto in the Senate.  Just as they are marching through a throng of Pompey's supporters, a friend of the man Pullo killed in the gambling den fight lunges from the crowd with a knife and attacks Pullo. Though the assailant is swiftly cut down, both sides believe that Mark Antony was the intended victim and a bloody fight erupts between the two mobs, just as Pompey emerges from the Senate House. Vorenus and Pullo escape with Antony, though the former is wounded and barely survives the return to Caesar's 13th Legion in [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (northern Italy).\n\nHaving been declared an enemy of Rome by the Senate, Caesar marches his army south toward Rome, marking the beginning of the civil war. Caesar crosses the [[Rubicon]] River with the remainder of his army in January, 49 BC.  As the news is cried throughout the city, Niobe [[breast feeding|breast feeds]] the baby, indicating that it is really hers.\n\n==Historical and cultural background==\n*[[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[proconsul]]ship in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] was about to expire, which would mean a loss of immunity against prosecution by his political enemies. He had faced the same situation five years prior, but at that time his command had been extended with the help of his allies [[Pompey|Pompey Magnus]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Marcus Crassus]]. This time, however, Pompey was against him, and [[Battle of Carrhae|Crassus had been killed]] in 53 BC. Caesar instead has to rely on [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Mark Antony]] for his political maneuvering: newly elected to the office of [[Tribune#Plebeian tribune|Tribune of the Plebs]] (''tribunus plebis'').\n* As part of his investiture as ''[[Tribune of the Plebs|tribunus plebis]]'', [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Antony]] sits a (very impatient) [[vigil]] in the temple of [[Jupiter Optimus Maximus]]. Given that this was the God of Laws, Social Order, and Rome itself, it seems an appropriate god to appeal for favor to when one is becoming a high government official.\n* During the fight in the Senate, Mark Antony appears to have been unharmed. This was because, as [[Tribune]], any attempt to harm Antony would have been considered a capital offense. Thus, when Antony and the Thirteenth are driven from Rome and Caesar recounts the events to his army, he says of the attack on Antony, \"Can you imagine a more terrible sacrilege?!\"\n* As Antony is about to wash his face before going out in public, Caesar stops him, telling him he looks like \"Leonidas at Thermopylae\". He is referring to the [[Sparta]]n king [[Leonidas I]], who fought the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] in 480 BC\n*This was the year that Caesar finally moved openly against Rome, crossing the [[Rubicon]] in January of 49 BC, at the head of the [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion (''Legio XIII Gemina'')]]. It is here he is said to have made the comment \"[[alea iacta est]]\" (\"The die is cast\"). There are some variations on what he actually said. [[Suetonius]] wrote that the comment was \"Iacta alea est\"<ref>Suetonius, ''Life of Caesar''</ref> and [[Plutarch]] wrote<ref>Plutarch, ''The Parallel Lives''</ref> that he said in Greek, \"anerriphtho kubos\" (\"The die must be cast\" \u2013 Latin trans. \"iacta alea esto\"), a quote from a play by [[Menander]].<ref>Liddell & Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', s.v.

It is extremely difficult to estimate the exact value of the [[Denarius]], as it changed with the times (as do most currencies), and was part of an economy totally alien to us; however, the \"classical rule of thumb\" is that a [[Denarius]] was the daily wage of a skilled worker{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. This would mean that about 350 [[Denarius|Denarii]] would be a \"middle class\" working wage.  Lucius Vorenus has brought home approximately 25 years' wages of someone living at their standard of living. <!--THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIA In modern American terms, this is roughly equivalent to a [[blue collar worker]] suddenly bringing home a lump sum of [[United States Dollar|USD]] $1 million. -->\n* Regarding the monetary units frequently mentioned in the series, one [[Denarius]] (a silver coin) was equal to four [[Sestertius|sesterces]] (a bronze coin).
