The '''Buxton lime industry''' has been important for the development of the town of [[Buxton]] in [[Derbyshire]], England, and it has shaped the landscape around the town.

== Geology ==
The [[White Peak]] area of the [[Peak District]] is named after the limestone plateau landscape of the 'Derbyshire Dome'. This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Viséan|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref>

== History ==
Limestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.

Lime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />

=== Grin Low ===
[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]
Grin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th–19th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commissioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

Grin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole’s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

Lime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.

=== Brunner Mond ===
[[File:Miller's Dale - Monsal Trail view of Lime Kilns - geograph.org.uk - 945731.jpg|thumb|Victorian lime kilns on the Midland line to Buxton]]
In 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone. Soda ash (or washing soda) was used for producing soaps, for dying textiles and for making glass.

The [[Brunner Mond]] company was formed in 1873 by [[Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet|John Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]]. In 1874 they started using the Solvay process to make soda ash at [[Winnington]] works in [[Northwich]], from the large local salt deposits and with limestone from Derbyshire. The soda ash was needed for the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry and for glass manufacture in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brunner,_Mond_and_Co|title=Brunner, Mond and Co – Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgthome.co.uk/SGTNews/2004/SGTN04_15-18.pdf|title=ALKALIS FOR THE ST HELENS GLASSMAKER THROUGH THE AGES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Society of Glass Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

The arrival of the main railway lines from [[Manchester]] and [[London]] to Buxton in the 1860s prompted the opening of many further quarries: Victory in 1863, Ashwood Dale in 1864, Great Rocks in 1869, Peak Dale in 1877, Oldham Lime in 1878, East Buxton in 1880, Hindlow in 1882 and Buxton Central in 1885.<ref name=\":2\" />

Buxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 competing quarry owners in 1891. BLF controlled the price of stone and lime from its 17 initial quarries. BLF owned over 1500 acres of land with about 100 lime kilns and 3 collieries. It produced 360,000 tons of limestone and 280,000 tons of lime per year. Larger, more advanced kilns were now in use and firebricks were introduced into kilns from 1907. By 1915 BLF had developed or acquired an additional 9 quarries including the opening of: Small Dale in 1891, Dowlow in 1898, Buxton South in 1900, Topley Pike in 1907, Brierlow in 1907, Cowdale in 1908. BLF supplied increasing quantities of lime to Brunner Mond until Brunner Mond acquired BLF in 1919, when Beelow quarry was also opened.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.derbyshireheritage.co.uk/Menu/Archaeology/Limekilns/Buxton-Lime-Firms.php|title=BLF Buxton Lime Firms|website=www.derbyshireheritage.co.uk|access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.buxtonwarmemorials.co.uk/b_l_i.html|title=British Lime Industries (formerly I.C.I.

The '''Buxton lime industry''' has been important for the development of the town of [[Buxton]] in [[Derbyshire]], England, and it has shaped the landscape around the town.

== Geology ==
The [[White Peak]] area of the [[Peak District]] is named after the limestone plateau landscape of the 'Derbyshire Dome'. This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Viséan|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref>

== History ==
Limestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.

Lime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />

=== Grin Low ===
[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]
Grin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th–19th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commisioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

Grin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole’s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

Lime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.

=== Brunner Mond ===
[[File:Miller's Dale - Monsal Trail view of Lime Kilns - geograph.org.uk - 945731.jpg|thumb|Victorian lime kilns on the Midland line to Buxton]]
In 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone. Soda ash (or washing soda) was used for producing soaps, for dying textiles and for making glass.

The [[Brunner Mond]] company was formed in 1873 by [[Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet|John Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]]. In 1874 they started using the Solvay process to make soda ash at [[Winnington]] works in [[Northwich]], from the large local salt deposits and with limestone from Derbyshire. The soda ash was needed for the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry and for glass manufacture in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brunner,_Mond_and_Co|title=Brunner, Mond and Co – Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgthome.co.uk/SGTNews/2004/SGTN04_15-18.pdf|title=ALKALIS FOR THE ST HELENS GLASSMAKER THROUGH THE AGES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Society of Glass Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

The arrival of the main railway lines from [[Manchester]] and [[London]] to Buxton in the 1860s prompted the opening of many further quarries: Victory in 1863, Ashwood Dale in 1864, Great Rocks in 1869, Peak Dale in 1877, Oldham Lime in 1878, East Buxton in 1880, Hindlow in 1882 and Buxton Central in 1885.<ref name=\":2\" />

Buxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 competing quarry owners in 1891. BLF controlled the price of stone and lime from its 17 initial quarries. BLF owned over 1500 acres of land with about 100 lime kilns and 3 collieries. It produced 360,000 tons of limestone and 280,000 tons of lime per year. Larger, more advanced kilns were now in use and firebricks were introduced into kilns from 1907. By 1915 BLF had developed or acquired an additional 9 quarries including the opening of: Small Dale in 1891, Dowlow in 1898, Buxton South in 1900, Topley Pike in 1907, Brierlow in 1907, Cowdale in 1908. BLF supplied increasing quantities of lime to Brunner Mond until Brunner Mond acquired BLF in 1919, when Beelow quarry was also opened.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.derbyshireheritage.co.uk/Menu/Archaeology/Limekilns/Buxton-Lime-Firms.php|title=BLF Buxton Lime Firms|website=www.derbyshireheritage.co.uk|access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.buxtonwarmemorials.co.uk/b_l_i.html|title=British Lime Industries (formerly I.C.I.

'''César David Izturis'''  ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|s|ˈ|t|ʊər|ɪ|s}};<!--assuming this is the English pronunciation--> born February 10, 1980) is a [[Venezuela]]n former professional [[baseball]] [[shortstop]]. He is the half-brother of shortstop [[Maicer Izturis]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060629&content_id=1529841&vkey=news_ana&fext=.jsp&c_id=ana|title = Izturis brothers feel no rivalry|accessdate = May 4, 2010|last = Wagner|first = Greg|date = June 29, 2006|publisher = MLB.com|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120225050514/http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060629&content_id=1529841&vkey=news_ana&fext=.jsp&c_id=ana|archive-date = February 25, 2012|url-status = dead}}</ref>

==Career==

===Toronto Blue Jays===
Signed by the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] as an amateur [[free agent]] in [[1996 in baseball|1996]], Izturis made his debut with Toronto in [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]] and was traded to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at the end of the season.

Coming from a long tradition of Venezuelan shortstops, which includes [[Chico Carrasquel]], [[Luis Aparicio]], [[Dave Concepción]], [[Ozzie Guillén]], [[Omar Vizquel]], [[Álex González (infielder, born 1977)|Álex González]] and [[Carlos Guillén]], Izturis has the defensive skills to rank in such distinguished company. After showing some hitting potential with a .269 [[batting average (baseball)|average]] in his rookie season with Toronto, the Dodgers were enthusiastic to trade for him.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Izturis was designated as the everyday starting shortstop from Opening Day of the [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002 season]], and he quickly established himself in the Dodgers' infield. But he showed no patience at the plate, resulting in a decline in average and very few [[Base on balls|walks]]. After two years of barely adequate hitting (though compensated by his stellar glovework), he improved markedly in 2004, when he hit .288 with 62 [[Run batted in|RBI]] and 25 [[stolen base]]s in 159 games. At the end of the season, he earned his first [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]], the first by a Dodger shortstop since [[Maury Wills]]' back-to-back honors in [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961]] and [[1962 Major League Baseball season|1962]].

In [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], Izturis hit .348 through June 1 and led the entire majors in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He was selected for the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|National League All-Star]] team, but his batting average later dipped all the way down into the .250 range. Curiously, his defense also seemed to suffer. After two trips to the [[disabled list]], Izturis underwent [[Tommy John surgery]] in his right elbow, and returned in mid-June, 2006.

With the uncertainty around Izturis, the Dodgers acquired shortstop [[Rafael Furcal]] in the off-season. That move seemed to have put Izturis' future with the Dodgers in doubt. With a $13 million annual salary, Furcal did not seem a likely candidate to be benched.

===Chicago Cubs/Pittsburgh Pirates/St. Louis Cardinals===
At the 2006 trade deadline, Izturis was traded to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[Greg Maddux]] and cash considerations.

On July 19, 2007, Izturis and cash were traded to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for a player to be named later.

On November 16, 2007, the Pirates declined an option on Izturis, and he became a free agent. Shortly thereafter on November 30, 2007, Izturis signed a one-year, $2.85 million deal with the St. Louis Cardinals.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/EAC9E2342BE58705862573A400164658?OpenDocument|title = Izturis deal nudges out Eckstein|accessdate = December 1, 2007|last = Strauss|first = Joe|date = December 1, 2007|publisher = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071202040229/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/EAC9E2342BE58705862573A400164658?OpenDocument|archivedate = December 2, 2007}}</ref>

===Baltimore Orioles===
On December 16, 2008, Izturis signed a two-year deal with the [[Baltimore Orioles]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20081216&content_id=3718637&vkey=pr_bal&fext=.jsp&c_id=bal|title=Orioles sign shortstop Izturis|publisher=}}</ref>

In [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]], he led all starting shortstops in [[range factor]], at 4.89.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding/_/position/ss/sort/rangeFactor/order/true \"MLB Player Fielding Stats – As ss – 2009\"] ''ESPN'', accessed October 6, 2009</ref>

On December 10, 2010, Izturis re-signed with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to a 1-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121005051.html|title=Orioles, SS Izturis agree to $1.5M, 1-year deal|last=Ginsburg|first=David|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=10 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11}}</ref>

===Milwaukee Brewers===
On December 21, 2011 he signed a minor league contract with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. He also received an invitation to spring training. On March 29, 2012, Izturis was added to the Major League 25-man roster by the Brewers.

===Washington Nationals===
On August 6, 2012, the [[Washington Nationals]] claimed Izturis off waivers from the Brewers. He was [[designated for assignment]] by the [[Washington Nationals]] on August 17, only 11 days after arriving in Washington. On August 20, 2012, he was granted free agency.

===Cincinnati Reds===
On January 14, 2013, the [[Cincinnati Reds]] announced that they had signed Izturis to a minor league contract with an invitation to major league spring training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/01/14/reds-sign-cesar-izturis-to-minor-league-deal/|title=Reds sign Cesar Izturis to minor league deal|last=Gleeman|first=Aaron|date=January 14, 2013|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref> The Reds selected the contract of Izturis on March 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thescore.com/mlb/articles/671105-cesar-izturis-news-the-reds-purchased-izturis-contract-from-triple-a-louisville-on-sunday-mlb-com-reports|title=Cesar Izturis News: The Reds purchased Izturis' contract from Triple-A Louisville on Sunday, MLB.com reports|date=March 31, 2013|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}</ref>

'''César David Izturis'''  ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|s|ˈ|t|ʊər|ɪ|s}};<!--assuming this is the English pronunciation--> born February 10, 1980) is a [[Venezuela]]n former professional [[baseball]] [[shortstop]]. He is the half-brother of shortstop [[Maicer Izturis]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060629&content_id=1529841&vkey=news_ana&fext=.jsp&c_id=ana|title = Izturis brothers feel no rivalry|accessdate = May 4, 2010|last = Wagner|first = Greg|date = June 29, 2006|publisher = MLB.com|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120225050514/http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060629&content_id=1529841&vkey=news_ana&fext=.jsp&c_id=ana|archive-date = February 25, 2012|url-status = dead}}</ref>

==Career==

===Toronto Blue Jays===
Signed by the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] as an amateur [[free agent]] in [[1996 in baseball|1996]], Izturis made his debut with Toronto in [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]] and was traded to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at the end of the season.

Coming from a long tradition of Venezuelan shortstops, which includes [[Chico Carrasquel]], [[Luis Aparicio]], [[Dave Concepción]], [[Ozzie Guillén]], [[Omar Vizquel]], [[Álex González (infielder, born 1977)|Álex González]] and [[Carlos Guillén]], Izturis has the defensive skills to rank in such distinguished company. After showing some hitting potential with a .269 [[batting average (baseball)|average]] in his rookie season with Toronto, the Dodgers were enthusiastic to trade for him.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Izturis was designated as the everyday starting shortstop from Opening Day of the [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002 season]], and he quickly established himself in the Dodgers' infield. But he showed no patience at the plate, resulting in a decline in average and very few [[Base on balls|walks]]. After two years of barely adequate hitting (though compensated by his stellar glovework), he improved markedly in 2004, when he hit .288 with 62 [[Run batted in|RBI]] and 25 [[stolen base]]s in 159 games. At the end of the season, he earned his first [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]], the first by a Dodger shortstop since [[Maury Wills]]' back-to-back honors in [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961]] and [[1962 Major League Baseball season|1962]].

In [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], Izturis hit .348 through June 1 and led the entire majors in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He was selected for the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|National League All-Star]] team, but his batting average later dipped all the way down into the .250 range. Curiously, his defense also seemed to suffer. After two trips to the [[disabled list]], Izturis underwent [[Tommy John surgery]] in his right elbow, and returned in mid-June, 2006.

With the uncertainty around Izturis, the Dodgers acquired shortstop [[Rafael Furcal]] in the off-season. That move seemed to have put Izturis' future with the Dodgers in doubt. With a $13 million annual salary, Furcal did not seem a likely candidate to be benched.

===Chicago Cubs/Pittsburgh Pirates/St. Louis Cardinals===
At the 2006 trade deadline, Izturis was traded to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[Greg Maddux]] and cash considerations.

On July 19, 2007, Izturis and cash were traded to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for a player to be named later.

On November 16, 2007, the Pirates declined an option on Izturis, and he became a free agent. Shortly thereafter on November 30, 2007, Izturis signed a one-year, $2.85 million deal with the St. Louis Cardinals.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/EAC9E2342BE58705862573A400164658?OpenDocument|title = Izturis deal nudges out Eckstein|accessdate = December 1, 2007|last = Strauss|first = Joe|date = December 1, 2007|publisher = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071202040229/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/EAC9E2342BE58705862573A400164658?OpenDocument|archivedate = December 2, 2007}}</ref>

===Baltimore Orioles===
On December 16, 2008, Izturis signed a two-year deal with the [[Baltimore Orioles]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20081216&content_id=3718637&vkey=pr_bal&fext=.jsp&c_id=bal|title=Orioles sign shortstop Izturis|publisher=}}</ref>

In [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]], he led all starting shortstops in [[range factor]], at 4.89.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding/_/position/ss/sort/rangeFactor/order/true \"MLB Player Fielding Stats – As ss – 2009\"] ''ESPN'', accessed October 6, 2009</ref>

On December 10, 2010, Izturis re-signed with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to a 1-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121005051.html|title=Orioles, SS Izturis agree to $1.5M, 1-year deal|last=Ginsburg|first=David|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=10 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11}}</ref>

===Milwaukee Brewers===
On December 21, 2011 he signed a minor league contract with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. He also received an invitation to spring training. On March 29, 2012, Izturis was added to the Major League 25-man roster by the Brewers.

===Washington Nationals===
On August 6, 2012, the [[Washington Nationals]] claimed Izturis off waivers from the Brewers. He was [[designated for assignment]] by the [[Washington Nationals]] on August 17, only 11 days after arriving in Washington. On August 20, 2012, he was granted free agency.

===Cincinnati Reds===
On January 14, 2013, the [[Cincinnati Reds]] announced that they had signed Izturis to a minor league contract with an invitation to major league spring training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/01/14/reds-sign-cesar-izturis-to-minor-league-deal/|title=Reds sign Cesar Izturis to minor league deal|last=Gleeman|first=Aaron|date=January 14, 2013|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref> The Reds selected the contract of Izturis on March 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thescore.com/mlb/articles/671105-cesar-izturis-news-the-reds-purchased-izturis-contract-from-triple-a-louisville-on-sunday-mlb-com-reports|title=Cesar Izturis News: The Reds purchased Izturis' contract from Triple-A Louisville on Sunday, MLB.com reports|date=March 31, 2013|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}</ref>

'''Epos 257''' (1980s, [[Prague]]...<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trafogallery.cz/umelci/epos-257/|title=Epos 257 – Trafo Gallery Praha|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>) is a Czech fine art creator who works with the urban environment and iconography of the city (Prague). His interventions frequently focus on contemporary social topics and regularly addresses issues surrounding [[public space]]. His identity has remained unknown to date.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.info.cz/magazin/byvaly-graffitak-epos-257-pro-info-cz-mesto-se-musi-menit-neda-se-nad-tim-brecet-9422.html|title=\"Bývalý\" graffiťák EPOS 257 pro INFO.CZ: Město se musí měnit.

== Life ==
Born in the 1980s in Prague, Epos 257 started his career as a writer (a person who creates graffiti - street art sub-culture jargon). Some principle characteristics of [[graffiti]] can still be traced in the artist's work. Above all, it is the invasive nature of the work, the insider's awareness of the urban landscape and the conscious movement on the edge of the law or beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world atlas of street art and graffiti|last=Schacter, Rafael|others=Fekner, John|isbn=978-0300199420|location=New Haven|oclc=855740908|date = 2013-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=EPOS 257 : about a tree|last=Wohlmuth, Radek, 1967-|date=2009|publisher=Agarde|isbn=9788025452271|location=Praha|oclc=649799098}}</ref> Epos 257 is a graduate of the [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague|Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design]]<ref name=\"auto\"/> and a member of the interdisciplinary group [[Ztohoven]]<ref name=\"auto\"/>

== Work ==
Epos 257's art is characterised by examination of public space, especially the way it is used and the limits of what is and is not public.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He repeatedly challenges the creation in public with its institutional conception.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite interview|interviewer=Adam Pešek|date=21 October 2012|url=https://magazin.aktualne.cz/kultura/umeni/snazim-se-propojit-galerii-s-ulici-rika-epos-257/r~i:article:760491/|title=Snažím se propojit galerii s ulicí, říká Epos 257 {{!}} Aktuálně.cz|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte, co se právě děje|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=I'm trying to connect the gallery to the street, says Epos 257}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phatbeatz.cz/epos-257-who-cares|title=EPOS 257 - Who Cares… {{!}} PhatBeatz|website=www.phatbeatz.cz|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> He has five solo and several collective exhibitions at home and abroad to his name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cs.isabart.org/person/102898/exhibitor?fbclid=IwAR2RkFBBBFVpd2kLWTL8k7B-B3O5DDbnuv5MocGJjoZ81LImlW6_1CYbvIM |title=Epos 257 |website=cs.isabart.org}}</ref>

=== ''Hay'' ===
In 2009, Epos 257 anonymously placed more than thirty bales of [[hay]] around the centre of Prague, as it is done after harvesting in the countryside. However, his actions were subsequently interpreted (especially by the tabloid media) as a public threat and even associated with [[terrorism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-seno-umeni-a-zakon-5269815|title=Epos 257: Seno, umění a zákon|date=February 9, 2012|website=Radio Wave}}</ref> After some time, he repeated this undertaking as part of the implementation for the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theater]] on the Piazzetta of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theater]] (renamed to [[Václav Havel]] Square), albeit this time intentionally obtaining all the required official permissions<ref name=\"auto1\"/>

=== ''50 Square Meters of Public Space'' ===
A year later, Epos continued dealing with the boundaries of public space, even in the context of legislation. At that time, he put up a fence around space on [[Palackého náměstí (Praha)|Palackeho Square]] (on which there is an exemption to the law prohibiting public gatherings without notice, and which is therefore referred to as the Czech “[[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]”), around an area of 50 square meters. Inside the delimited space, nothing was happening or placed other than what was outside of it. The absurd enclosure lasted 54 days on the square. After such a long time, the artist himself contacted city officials. This work was connected to the pointing out the indifference to the use of public space and the unjustifiableness of certain restrictions associated with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-v-bourani-graffiti-je-indikator-opustenosti-mista-ale-i-svobody-5183544|title=Epos 257 v Bourání: Graffiti je indikátor opuštěnosti místa, ale i svobody|date=2017-02-13|website=Radio Wave|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=Epic 257 in Demolition: Graffiti is an indicator of the abandonment of place, but also of freedom}}</ref>

=== ''Portrait'' ===
Epos 257 has also repeatedly devoted himself to [[billboard]]s. For example, In the Portrait project, which was realised before the Czech presidential elections in 2013, he cut out the giant faces of both the final candidates, smiling at people from their gigantic posters, and then framed them. While he left the remains of the promotional posters lacking the faces of politicians in the original place. Epos installed the framed and glazed representations opposite each other. Shortly after his election, Epos went on to place a gigantic portrait of the winner of the elections [[Miloš Zeman]] in the [[Czech National Library of Technology|National Technical Library]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/epos-257-umelec-ktery-prodal-zaramovanou-loupez-fl3-/recenze.aspx?c=A140406_103720_pozice_139702|title=Epos 257: Umělec, který prodal zarámovanou loupež {{!}} Recenze|date=2014-04-18|website=Lidovky.cz|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
It was mainly for his “billboard” projects that Epos 257 was repeatedly associated with breaking the law. His actions before the presidential and municipal elections also revived the debate on the ethical boundaries of artistic creation. The artist did, however, fully compensate the billboard owners for the financial damages he caused in 2013 by cutting out the heads of the presidential candidates<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/10117034229-168-hodin/214411058251102/obsah/361186-epos-257|title=Epos 257—168 hodin|last=televize|first=Česká|website=Česká televize|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>

'''Epos 257''' (198?, [[Prague]]...<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trafogallery.cz/umelci/epos-257/|title=Epos 257 – Trafo Gallery Praha|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>) is a Czech fine art creator who works with the urban environment and iconography of the city. His interventions frequently focus on contemporary social topics and regularly addresses issues surrounding [[public space]]. His identity has remained unknown to date.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.info.cz/magazin/byvaly-graffitak-epos-257-pro-info-cz-mesto-se-musi-menit-neda-se-nad-tim-brecet-9422.html|title=\"Bývalý\" graffiťák EPOS 257 pro INFO.CZ: Město se musí měnit.

== Life ==
Born in the 1980s in Prague, Epos 257 started his career as a writer (a person who creates graffiti - street art sub-culture jargon). Some principle characteristics of [[graffiti]] can still be traced in the artist's work. Above all, it is the invasive nature of the work, the insider's awareness of the urban landscape and the conscious movement on the edge of the law or beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world atlas of street art and graffiti|last=Schacter, Rafael|others=Fekner, John|isbn=978-0300199420|location=New Haven|oclc=855740908|date = 2013-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=EPOS 257 : about a tree|last=Wohlmuth, Radek, 1967-|date=2009|publisher=Agarde|isbn=9788025452271|location=Praha|oclc=649799098}}</ref> Epos 257 is a graduate of the [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague|Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design]]<ref name=\"auto\"/> and a member of the interdisciplinary group [[Ztohoven]]<ref name=\"auto\"/>

== Work ==
Epos 257's art is characterised by examination of public space, especially the way it is used and the limits of what is and is not public.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He repeatedly challenges the creation in public with its institutional conception.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite interview|interviewer=Adam Pešek|date=21 October 2012|url=https://magazin.aktualne.cz/kultura/umeni/snazim-se-propojit-galerii-s-ulici-rika-epos-257/r~i:article:760491/|title=Snažím se propojit galerii s ulicí, říká Epos 257 {{!}} Aktuálně.cz|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte, co se právě děje|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=I'm trying to connect the gallery to the street, says Epos 257}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phatbeatz.cz/epos-257-who-cares|title=EPOS 257 - Who Cares… {{!}} PhatBeatz|website=www.phatbeatz.cz|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> He has five solo and several collective exhibitions at home and abroad to his name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cs.isabart.org/person/102898/exhibitor?fbclid=IwAR2RkFBBBFVpd2kLWTL8k7B-B3O5DDbnuv5MocGJjoZ81LImlW6_1CYbvIM |title=Epos 257 |website=cs.isabart.org}}</ref>

=== ''Hay'' ===
In 2009, Epos 257 anonymously placed more than thirty bales of [[hay]] around the centre of Prague, as it is done after harvesting in the countryside. However, his actions were subsequently interpreted (especially by the tabloid media) as a public threat and even associated with [[terrorism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-seno-umeni-a-zakon-5269815|title=Epos 257: Seno, umění a zákon|date=February 9, 2012|website=Radio Wave}}</ref> After some time, he repeated this undertaking as part of the implementation for the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theater]] on the Piazzetta of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theater]] (renamed to [[Václav Havel]] Square), albeit this time intentionally obtaining all the required official permissions<ref name=\"auto1\"/>

=== ''50 Square Meters of Public Space'' ===
A year later, Epos continued dealing with the boundaries of public space, even in the context of legislation. At that time, he put up a fence around space on [[Palackého náměstí (Praha)|Palackeho Square]] (on which there is an exemption to the law prohibiting public gatherings without notice, and which is therefore referred to as the Czech “[[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]”), around an area of 50 square meters. Inside the delimited space, nothing was happening or placed other than what was outside of it. The absurd enclosure lasted 54 days on the square. After such a long time, the artist himself contacted city officials. This work was connected to the pointing out the indifference to the use of public space and the unjustifiableness of certain restrictions associated with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-v-bourani-graffiti-je-indikator-opustenosti-mista-ale-i-svobody-5183544|title=Epos 257 v Bourání: Graffiti je indikátor opuštěnosti místa, ale i svobody|date=2017-02-13|website=Radio Wave|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=Epic 257 in Demolition: Graffiti is an indicator of the abandonment of place, but also of freedom}}</ref>

=== ''Portrait'' ===
Epos 257 has also repeatedly devoted himself to [[billboard]]s. For example, In the Portrait project, which was realised before the Czech presidential elections in 2013, he cut out the giant faces of both the final candidates, smiling at people from their gigantic posters, and then framed them. While he left the remains of the promotional posters lacking the faces of politicians in the original place. Epos installed the framed and glazed representations opposite each other. Shortly after his election, Epos went on to place a gigantic portrait of the winner of the elections [[Miloš Zeman]] in the [[Czech National Library of Technology|National Technical Library]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/epos-257-umelec-ktery-prodal-zaramovanou-loupez-fl3-/recenze.aspx?c=A140406_103720_pozice_139702|title=Epos 257: Umělec, který prodal zarámovanou loupež {{!}} Recenze|date=2014-04-18|website=Lidovky.cz|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
It was mainly for his “billboard” projects that Epos 257 was repeatedly associated with breaking the law. His actions before the presidential and municipal elections also revived the debate on the ethical boundaries of artistic creation. The artist did, however, fully compensate the billboard owners for the financial damages he caused in 2013 by cutting out the heads of the presidential candidates<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/10117034229-168-hodin/214411058251102/obsah/361186-epos-257|title=Epos 257—168 hodin|last=televize|first=Česká|website=Česká televize|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>

'''''Mussaurus''''' (meaning \"[[mouse]] [[lizard]]\") is a [[genus]] of [[herbivorous]] [[sauropodomorph]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in southern [[Argentina]] during the [[Late Triassic]], about 215 [[million years ago]]. It receives its name from the small size of the skeletons of juvenile and infant individuals, which were once the only known specimens of the genus. However, since ''Mussaurus'' is now known from adult specimens,<ref name=OP13>{{Cite journal | last1 = Otero | first1 = A. | last2 = Pol | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1080/02724634.2013.769444 | title = Postcranial anatomy and phylogenetic relationships of ''Mussaurus patagonicus'' (Dinosauria, Sauropodomorpha) | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 1138 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> the name is something of a misnomer; adults possibly reached {{convert|6|m|ft}} in length and weighed more than {{convert|1000|kg|lb}}.<ref name=\"Otero Cuff Allen Sumner-Rooney 2019-5-20\">{{cite journal |last=Otero |first=Alejandro |last2=Cuff |first2=Andrew R. |last3=Allen |first3=Vivian |last4=Sumner-Rooney |first4=Lauren |last5=Pol |first5=Diego |last6=Hutchinson |first6=John R. |title=Ontogenetic changes in the body plan of the sauropodomorph dinosaur Mussaurus patagonicus reveal shifts of locomotor stance during growth |journal=Scientific Reports |publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=2019-05-20 |issn=2045-2322 |doi=10.1038/s41598-019-44037-1 |page= 7614|pmid=31110190 |pmc=6527699}}</ref> ''Mussaurus'' possesses anatomical features suggesting a close, possibly transitional evolutionary relationship with true sauropods.<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursmussaurus\"/>

==Discovery==
[[File:Mussaurus patagonicus life restoration.png|thumb|Life restoration of adult ''Mussaurus'']]
Infant and juvenile fossils of ''Mussaurup
'' were first discovered by an expedition led by [[Jose Bonaparte]] during the 1970s to the [[El Tranquilo Formation]].<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursmussaurus\">\"Mussaurus.\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. ''The Age of Dinosaurs''. Publications International, LTD. p. 40. {{ISBN|0-7853-0443-6}}.</ref> There the team found fossilized eggs and hatchlings, which added insight into the reproductive strategies of ''Mussaurus'' and other sauropodomorph dinosaurs.<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursmussaurus\"/> The first adult specimens of ''Mussaurus'' were described in 2013. Some of these specimens had first been described in 1980 and were originally attributed to the genus ''[[Plateosaurus]]''.<ref name=OP13/>

==Phylogeny==
Previous to the discovery of adult specimens of ''Mussaurus'', the [[phylogenetic]] position of this taxon was difficult to establish. Infant and juvenile fossils are known to show more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] traits than adult specimens of the same taxon. Furthermore, the recently discovered one subadult and three adult specimens assigned to ''Mussaurus'' are more complete than other material assigned to it. Therefore, a cladistic analysis of basal sauropodomorphs performed by Otero and Pol (2013) to test the phylogenetic relationships of ''Mussaurus'', included information only from adult specimens. The following [[cladogram]] is simplified after their analysis (relationships outside Plateosauria are not shown).<ref name=OP13/>

[[File:Mussaurus patagonicus.jpg|thumb|Life restoration of an infant eating a ''[[Dicroidium]]'' fern]]
===Reproduction===
Mussaurus specimens have been found in association with nests that are believed to contain multiple eggs apiece. The skeletons of ''Mussaurus'' infants were small, only six inches long excluding the tail, but a total of {{convert|20|to|37|cm|in}} long. This is about the size of a small lizard. Juveniles differed from adults in proportion in addition to size and mass. As is common for dinosaurs, juvenile ''Mussaurus'' had tall skulls with short snouts and large eyes.<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursmussaurus\"/>

These proportions are common in many infant vertebrates and are often associated with species that provide parental care during the vulnerable early stages of life. Adults are expected to have longer snouts and necks, as typical in early [[sauropodomorph]]s.

===Locomotion===
A study published in May 2019 shows that while ''M. patagonicus'' probably walked on all four limbs (was [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]]) during the first year of its life, changes in the relative proportions of its body during growth ([[ontogeny]]) caused its [[centre of mass]] to move backwards towards its [[pelvis]], resulting in the animal adopting a two-legged ([[bipedalism|bipedal]]) stance later in life.<ref name=\"Otero Cuff Allen Sumner-Rooney 2019-5-20\"/><ref name=\"Geggel 2019\">{{cite web |last=Geggel |first=Laura |title=No, That Baby Dinosaur Didn't Crawl.

'''''Mussaurus''''' (meaning \"[[mouse]] [[lizard]]\") is a [[genus]] of [[herbivorous]] [[sauropodomorph]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in southern [[Argentina]] during the [[Late Triassic]], about 215 [[million years ago]]. It receives its name from the small size of the skeletons of juvenile and infant individuals, which were once the only known specimens of the genus. However, since ''Mussaurus'' is now known from adult specimens,<ref name=OP13>{{Cite journal | last1 = Otero | first1 = A. | last2 = Pol | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1080/02724634.2013.769444 | title = Postcranial anatomy and phylogenetic relationships of ''Mussaurus patagonicus'' (Dinosauria, Sauropodomorpha) | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 1138 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> the name is something of a misnomer; adults possibly reached {{convert|6|m|ft}} in length and weighed more than {{convert|1000|kg|lb}}.<ref name=\"Otero Cuff Allen Sumner-Rooney 2019-5-20\">{{cite journal |last=Otero |first=Alejandro |last2=Cuff |first2=Andrew R. |last3=Allen |first3=Vivian |last4=Sumner-Rooney |first4=Lauren |last5=Pol |first5=Diego |last6=Hutchinson |first6=John R. |title=Ontogenetic changes in the body plan of the sauropodomorph dinosaur Mussaurus patagonicus reveal shifts of locomotor stance during growth |journal=Scientific Reports |publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=2019-05-20 |issn=2045-2322 |doi=10.1038/s41598-019-44037-1 |page= 7614|pmid=31110190 |pmc=6527699}}</ref> ''Mussaurus'' possesses anatomical features suggesting a close, possibly transitional evolutionary relationship with true sauropods.<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursmussaurus\"/>

==Discovery==
[[File:Mussaurus patagonicus life restoration.png|thumb|Life restoration of adult ''Mussaurus'']]
Infant and juvenile fossils of ''Mussaurus'' were first discovered by an expedition led by [[Jose Bonaparte]] during the 1970s to the [[El Tranquilo Formation]].<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursmussaurus\">\"Mussaurus.\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. ''The Age of Dinosaurs''. Publications International, LTD. p. 40. {{ISBN|0-7853-0443-6}}.</ref> There the team found fossilized eggs and hatchlings, which added insight into the reproductive strategies of ''Mussaurus'' and other sauropodomorph dinosaurs.<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursmussaurus\"/> The first adult specimens of ''Mussaurus'' were described in 2013. Some of these specimens had first been described in 1980 and were originally attributed to the genus ''[[Plateosaurus]]''.<ref name=OP13/>

==Phylogeny==
Previous to the discovery of adult specimens of ''Mussaurus'', the [[phylogenetic]] position of this taxon was difficult to establish. Infant and juvenile fossils are known to show more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] traits than adult specimens of the same taxon. Furthermore, the recently discovered one subadult and three adult specimens assigned to ''Mussaurus'' are more complete than other material assigned to it. Therefore, a cladistic analysis of basal sauropodomorphs performed by Otero and Pol (2013) to test the phylogenetic relationships of ''Mussaurus'', included information only from adult specimens. The following [[cladogram]] is simplified after their analysis (relationships outside Plateosauria are not shown).<ref name=OP13/>

\"'''Death Bed'''\", released in later versions as \"'''Death Bed (Coffee for Your Head)'''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/track/7eJMfftS33KTjuF7lTsMCx|title=\"death bed (coffee for your head) (feat. beabadoobee)\" on Spotify}}</ref> (stylized in [[Letter case#All lowercase|all lowercase]]) is a song by Canadian rapper [[Powfu]], featuring Filipino-British singer-songwriter [[Beabadoobee]]. The song was initially uploaded to [[SoundCloud]] in 2019; following Powfu signing to [[Columbia Records]], the song was released on streaming services on February 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/powfu-breaks-down-the-meaning-of-death-bed|title=Powfu Breaks Down The Meaning Of \"Death Bed\"|website=[[Genius (website)|Genius]]|last=Reneau|first=Steven|date=March 6, 2020|accessdate=March 18, 2020}}</ref> The song samples the 2017 song \"Coffee\" by Beabadoobee, who is credited as a feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://headlineplanet.com/home/2020/03/08/powfu-beabadoobees-death-bed-picks-up-pop-radio-airplay-reaches-50-million-spotify-streams/|title=Powfu & Beabadoobee's \"Death Bed\" Picks Up Pop Radio Airplay, Reaches 50 Million Spotify Streams|website=Headline Planet|last=Cantor|first=Brian|date=March 8, 2020|accessdate=March 18, 2020}}</ref>

The song went viral on the video sharing app [[TikTok]] in early 2020.<ref name=\"Genius BG\">{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/powfu-s-death-bed-samples-beabadoobee-s-coffee|title=Powfu's Viral Hit \"Death Bed\" Arrives On Streaming Services After Lengthy Sample Clearance Delay|website=Genius|last=Fu|first=Eddie|date=February 13, 2020|accessdate=March 18, 2020}}</ref>

==Background==
The song's commercial release was delayed by a year due to the clearance of the [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of Beabadoobee's 2017 song \"Coffee\". Powfu said on [[Twitter]] in April 2019 that he had not put it on [[Spotify]] because he was \"scared [he'd] get in trouble from the sample [he] use[s] in it\", but said he \"would upload it anyway\" and told his followers to give him \"a week and a half\". It was finally released to streaming and download services in February 2020.<ref name=\"Genius BG\"/>

==Composition==
Columbia's British subsidiary [[Sony Music UK]] described it as a \"lo-fi hip hop single\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressparty.com/pg/newsdesk/sonymusicuk/view/205330/|title=Powfu – New Single 'Death Bed' Feat Beabadoobee Out Now|publisher=[[Sony Music UK]]|via=[[Pressparty]]|date=March 2, 2020|accessdate=March 18, 2020}}</ref>

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>. Juvenile ornate butterflyfish are solitary and can be found singly, living in the arms of branching corals, but form pairs during breeding <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\" />.  

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quraters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.  


Another adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>.

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>. Juvenile ornate butterflyfish are solitary and can be found singly, living in the arms of branching corals, but form pairs during breeding <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\" />.  

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quraters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.  


Another adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities’ limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />.

'''Antoni Ramallets Simón''' (1 July 1924 – 30 July 2013) was a Spanish [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], and also a manager.

He spent most of his career at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], winning the [[Ricardo Zamora Trophy|Zamora Trophy]] as the best goalkeeper in [[La Liga]] on five occasions and 18 total honours.<ref>[http://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/noticias/20090713/53743727820/las-85-vidas-del-gato-con-alas.html Las 85 vidas del 'Gato con Alas' azulgrana (The 85 lives of the blaugrana 'Winged Cat')]; [[La Vanguardia]], 13 July 2009 {{in lang|es}}</ref> He represented [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]].

Ramallets managed several teams in his country in the 60s, notably winning two major trophies with [[Real Zaragoza|Zaragoza]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], Ramallets signed for [[FC Barcelona]] in 1947 at the age of 23 from [[Real Valladolid]], where he also spent his first season after being purchased, on loan. He returned to the club to play second-fiddle to [[Juan Zambudio Velasco|Juan Velasco]], making his [[La Liga]] debut in a 2–1 victory over [[Sevilla FC]] on 28 November 1948. Although this was his only appearance during [[1948–49 La Liga|the season]] he eventually became the starter, being an essential defensive unit as his team – then named Club de Fútbol Barcelona – went on to win six leagues and five [[Copa del Rey|domestic cups]]; in [[1951–52 La Liga|1951–52]], as ''Barça'' won five major trophies, he contributed with 28 league games, being awarded his first [[Ricardo Zamora Trophy]].

During the 1950s, Ramallets was a prominent member of the successful Barcelona team that also included [[Joan Segarra]], [[Marià Gonzalvo]], [[László Kubala]], [[Sándor Kocsis]], [[Evaristo de Macedo|Evaristo]], [[Luis Suárez (footballer, born 1935)|Luis Suárez]] and [[Zoltán Czibor]].<ref>[https://www.fcbarcelona.es/es/ficha/643900/1950-61-kubala-y-su-tiempo# 1950–61.

Kubala and his time)]; FC Barcelona, 13 March 2018 {{in lang|es}}</ref> During his spell with the club he made 538 appearances, including 288 in the domestic league; on 6 March 1962 the ''Blaugrana'' played a [[Testimonial match|testimonial]] in his honour against [[Hamburger SV]], winning 5–1.<ref>[https://www.rtve.es/deportes/20130730/fallece-ramallets-mitico-portero-del-barcelona-89-anos/727721.shtml Fútbol {{!}} Obituarios – Fallece Ramallets, mítico portero del Barcelona, a los 89 años (Football {{!}} Deaths – Death of Ramallets, legendary Barcelona goalkeeper, at the age of 89)]; [[RTVE]], 30 July 2013 {{in lang|es}}</ref><ref>[https://elpais.com/deportes/2013/07/30/actualidad/1375199929_294426.html Antoni Ramallets, el portero sin guantes que saltaba como un gato (Antoni Ramallets, the goalkeeper without gloves who jumped like a cat)]; [[El País]], 30 July 2013 {{in lang|es}}</ref>

Ramallets coached several clubs during the following decade, including old acquaintance Valladolid. In the [[1963–64 La Liga|1963–64 campaign]] he led [[Real Zaragoza]] to the fourth place in the league, the [[1963–64 Copa del Generalísimo|Spanish Cup]] and the [[1963–64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] – a competition he had won twice as a player with Barcelona – defeating fellow league team [[Valencia CF]] in the latter.<ref>[https://www.elperiodicodearagon.com/noticias/deportes/fallece-ramallets-entrenador-real-zaragoza-epoca-magnificos_872762.html Fallece Ramallets, entrenador del Real Zaragoza en la época de los Magníficos (Death of Ramallets, manager of Real Zaragoza during the age of the Magnificent)]; [[El Periódico de Aragón]], 31 July 2013 {{in lang|es}}</ref>

==International career==
Ramallets played 35 games for [[Spain national football team|Spain]] during 11 years, making his debut against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] on 29 June 1950, during the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/ramallets-intl.html Antonio Ramallets Simón – International Appearances] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708012557/http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/ramallets-intl.html|date=8 July 2007}}; at [[RSSSF]]</ref> During the tournament he earned the nickname ''The Cat of [[Estádio do Maracanã|Maracaná]]'', helping the nation to the second group stage.<ref>[https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/mundial-futbol/gato-maracana-3294730 Ramallets, el gato de Maracaná (Ramallets, the cat of Maracaná)]; [[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]], 10 June 2014 {{in lang|es}}</ref>

Ramallets also played seven games for the unofficial [[Catalonia national football team|Catalan national side]].

'''Mapo District''' ({{Lang-ko|마포구|Mapo-gu}}) is one of the 25 [[List of districts of Seoul|district]]s of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].

Mapo has a population of 381,330 (2015) and has a geographic area of 23.87 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (9.22 [[sq mi]]), and is divided into 24 ''[[Dong (administrative division)|dong]]'' (administrative neighborhoods). Mapo is located in western Seoul on the northern bank of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], bordering the [[Gyeonggi Province]] city of [[Goyang]] to the northwest, and the Seoul city districts of [[Gangseo District, Seoul|Gangseo]] to the west, [[Yeongdeungpo District|Yeongdeungpo]] to the south, [[Yongsan District|Yongsan]] to the southeast, [[Jung District, Seoul|Jung]] to the east, and [[Seodaemun District|Seodaemun]] and [[Eunpyeong District|Eunpyeong]] to the north.

Mapo is home to several universities and government buildings, and is well known for the [[Hongdae area|Hongdae]] club district around [[Hongik University]].  Mapo is connected to the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]]'s [[Seoul Subway Line 2|Line 2]], [[Seoul Subway Line 5|Line 5]], and [[Seoul Subway Line 6|Line 6]], the [[AREX|Airport Railroad]], and the [[Korail]] [[Gyeongui-Jungang Line]] all pass through this district. The [[Seoul World Cup Stadium]], a famous landmark in Seoul, is located in [[Sangam-dong|Sangam]] in northwest Mapo.

==Mapo District Office==
===Location===
Mapo District Office is located in Seongsan-2 precinct, near World Cup Stadium (5 minutes on foot). Seoul Metropolitan Subway Line 6 passes near the office, and it has a station name \"Mapo-gu Office\" {{convert|150|m}} east of the office.

===Organization===
The district office has 5 Bureaus, 1 Community Health Center, 36 Divisions, 1 Room, 1 Task Force Team, 16 Community Service Centers. Mapo District Office employs about 1,300 personnels. The entire office is headed by Administrator. Current Administrator is Hong-seop Park (2017).

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:01-14-mapo-en.svg|thumb|400px|Administrative divisions]]
Mapo District was formed in 1944 from portions of [[Seodaemun District|Seodaemun]] and [[Yongsan District]]s.  The ''dong'' structure was revised in 1985 and 2008. Roughly 53% of Mapo District's area is taken up by residences, many of which are high-rise apartment buildings.  Much of the remaining area (43%) is greenspace, including the World Cup Park and additional parkland along the Han River.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapo.go.kr/|script-title=ko:구정여건|accessdate=2006-06-21|language=ko}}</ref>

Mapo District recently revamped its precincts (2008). The revision aimed to merge some precincts into one big precincts. This effectively reduces number of administrative office for precincts. As a result, the number of precinct offices decreased to 16 from 24. However, the administrative revamp did not change the address system. 

These are the revamped '''administrative''' precincts:

==Origin of the name==
The name \"Mapo\" comes from the name of an old ferry across the Han River, and can roughly be translated as \"hemp ferry.\"

==Education==
Four college or university institutions, including [[Sogang University]] and [[Hongik University]], are located within Mapo District. The area around Hongik University, also known as [[Hongdae, Seoul|Hongdae]], is well known as one of the cultural centers of Seoul, and was named one of the coolest neighborhoods in the world in 2016.<ref>{{cite|url= http://www.howitravel.co/the-15-coolest-neighborhoods-in-the-world-in-2016/ |title=The 15 Coolest Neighborhoods in the World in 2016 |accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref> There are eight high schools, including [[Seoul Girls' High School]], along with 12 middle schools and 20 elementary schools serving the community. There are three special schools for handicapped or industrial educations. Due to the presence of university students in the district, Mapo District offers a large variety of shopping and dining options. The area around [[Ewha Women's University]] is known for its affordable yet trendy merchandise, while neighboring Shinchon has an enormous number of take out and sit down restaurants.

'''Mapo District''' ({{Lang-ko|마포구|Mapo-gu}}) is one of the 25 [[List of districts of Seoul|district]]s of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].

Mapo has a population of 381,330 (2015) and has a geographic area of 23.87 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (9.22 [[sq mi]]), and is divided into 24 ''[[Dong (administrative division)|dong]]'' (administrative neighborhoods). Mapo is located in western Seoul on the northern bank of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], bordering the [[Gyeonggi Province]] city of [[Goyang]] to the northwest, and the Seoul city districts of [[Gangseo District, Seoul|Gangseo]] to the west, [[Yeongdeungpo District|Yeongdeungpo]] to the south, [[Yongsan District|Yongsan]] to the southeast, [[Jung District, Seoul|Jung]] to the east, and [[Seodaemun District|Seodaemun]] and [[Eunpyeong District|Eunpyeong]] to the north.

Mapo is home to several universities and government buildings, and is well known for the [[Hongdae area|Hongdae]] club district around [[Hongik University]].  Mapo is connected to the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]]'s [[Seoul Subway Line 2|Line 2]], [[Seoul Subway Line 5|Line 5]], and [[Seoul Subway Line 6|Line 6]], the [[AREX|The Airport Railroad]], and the [[Korail]] [[Gyeongui-Jungang Line]] all pass through this district. The [[Seoul World Cup Stadium]], a famous landmark in Seoul, is located in [[Sangam-dong|Sangam]] in northwest Mapo.

==Mapo District Office==
===Location===
Mapo District Office is located in Seongsan-2 precinct, near World Cup Stadium (5 minutes on foot). Seoul Metropolitan Subway Line 6 passes near the office, and it has a station name \"Mapo-gu Office\" {{convert|150|m}} east of the office.

===Organization===
The district office has 5 Bureaus, 1 Community Health Center, 36 Divisions, 1 Room, 1 Task Force Team, 16 Community Service Centers. Mapo District Office employs about 1,300 personnels. The entire office is headed by Administrator. Current Administrator is Hong-seop Park (2017).

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:01-14-mapo-en.svg|thumb|400px|Administrative divisions]]
Mapo District was formed in 1944 from portions of [[Seodaemun District|Seodaemun]] and [[Yongsan District]]s.  The ''dong'' structure was revised in 1985 and 2008. Roughly 53% of Mapo District's area is taken up by residences, many of which are high-rise apartment buildings.  Much of the remaining area (43%) is greenspace, including the World Cup Park and additional parkland along the Han River.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapo.go.kr/|script-title=ko:구정여건|accessdate=2006-06-21|language=ko}}</ref>

Mapo District recently revamped its precincts (2008). The revision aimed to merge some precincts into one big precincts. This effectively reduces number of administrative office for precincts. As a result, the number of precinct offices decreased to 16 from 24. However, the administrative revamp did not change the address system. 

These are the revamped '''administrative''' precincts:

==Origin of the name==
The name \"Mapo\" comes from the name of an old ferry across the Han River, and can roughly be translated as \"hemp ferry.\"

==Education==
Four college or university institutions, including [[Sogang University]] and [[Hongik University]], are located within Mapo District. The area around Hongik University, also known as [[Hongdae, Seoul|Hongdae]], is well known as one of the cultural centers of Seoul, and was named one of the coolest neighborhoods in the world in 2016.<ref>{{cite|url= http://www.howitravel.co/the-15-coolest-neighborhoods-in-the-world-in-2016/ |title=The 15 Coolest Neighborhoods in the World in 2016 |accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref> There are eight high schools, including [[Seoul Girls' High School]], along with 12 middle schools and 20 elementary schools serving the community. There are three special schools for handicapped or industrial educations. Due to the presence of university students in the district, Mapo District offers a large variety of shopping and dining options. The area around [[Ewha Women's University]] is known for its affordable yet trendy merchandise, while neighboring Shinchon has an enormous number of take out and sit down restaurants.

'''Epos 257''' (198?, [[Prague]]...<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trafogallery.cz/umelci/epos-257/|title=Epos 257 – Trafo Gallery Praha|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>) is a Czech fine art creator who works with the urban environment and iconography of the city. His interventions frequently focus on contemporary social topics and regularly addresses issues surrounding [[public space]]. His identity has remained unknown to date.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.info.cz/magazin/byvaly-graffitak-epos-257-pro-info-cz-mesto-se-musi-menit-neda-se-nad-tim-brecet-9422.html|title=\"Bývalý\" graffiťák EPOS 257 pro INFO.CZ: Město se musí měnit.

== Life ==
Born in the 1980s in Prague, Epos 257 started his career as a writer (a person who creates graffiti - street art sub-culture jargon). Some principle characteristics of [[graffiti]] can still be traced in the artist's work. Above all, it is the invasive nature of the work, the insider's awareness of the urban landscape and the conscious movement on the edge of the law or beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world atlas of street art and graffiti|last=Schacter, Rafael|others=Fekner, John|isbn=978-0300199420|location=New Haven|oclc=855740908|date = 2013-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=EPOS 257 : about a tree|last=Wohlmuth, Radek, 1967-|date=2009|publisher=Agarde|isbn=9788025452271|location=Praha|oclc=649799098}}</ref> Epos 257 is a graduate of the [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague|Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design]]<ref name=\"auto\"/> and a member of the interdisciplinary group [[Ztohoven]]<ref name=\"auto\"/>

== Work ==
Epos 257's art is characterised by examination of public space, especially the way it is used and the limits of what is and is not public.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He repeatedly challenges the creation in public with its institutional conception.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite interview|interviewer=Adam Pešek|date=21 October 2012|url=https://magazin.aktualne.cz/kultura/umeni/snazim-se-propojit-galerii-s-ulici-rika-epos-257/r~i:article:760491/|title=Snažím se propojit galerii s ulicí, říká Epos 257 {{!}} Aktuálně.cz|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte, co se právě děje|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=I'm trying to connect the gallery to the street, says Epos 257}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phatbeatz.cz/epos-257-who-cares|title=EPOS 257 - Who Cares… {{!}} PhatBeatz|website=www.phatbeatz.cz|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> He has five solo and several collective exhibitions at home and abroad to his name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cs.isabart.org/person/102898/exhibitor?fbclid=IwAR2RkFBBBFVpd2kLWTL8k7B-B3O5DDbnuv5MocGJjoZ81LImlW6_1CYbvIM |title=Epos 257 |website=cs.isabart.org}}</ref>

=== ''Hay'' ===
In 2009, Epos 257 anonymously placed more than thirty bales of [[hay]] around the centre of Prague, as it is done after harvesting in the countryside. However, his actions were subsequently interpreted (especially by the tabloid media) as a public threat and even associated with [[terrorism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-seno-umeni-a-zakon-5269815|title=Epos 257: Seno, umění a zákon|date=February 9, 2012|website=Radio Wave}}</ref> After some time, he repeated this undertaking as part of the implementation for the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theater]] on the Piazzetta of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theater]] (renamed to [[Václav Havel]] Square), albeit this time intentionally obtaining all the required official permissions<ref name=\"auto1\"/>

=== ''50 Square Meters of Public Space'' ===
A year later, Epos continued dealing with the boundaries of public space, even in the context of legislation. At that time, he put up a fence around space on [[Palackého náměstí (Praha)|Palackeho Square]] (on which there is an exemption to the law prohibiting public gatherings without notice, and which is therefore referred to as the Czech “[[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]”), around an area of 50 square meters. Inside the delimited space, nothing was happening or placed other than what was outside of it. The absurd enclosure lasted 54 days on the square. After such a long time, the artist himself contacted city officials. This work was connected to the pointing out the indifference to the use of public space and the unjustifiableness of certain restrictions associated with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-v-bourani-graffiti-je-indikator-opustenosti-mista-ale-i-svobody-5183544|title=Epos 257 v Bourání: Graffiti je indikátor opuštěnosti místa, ale i svobody|date=2017-02-13|website=Radio Wave|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=Epic 257 in Demolition: Graffiti is an indicator of the abandonment of place, but also of freedom}}</ref>

=== ''Portrait'' ===
Epos 257 has also repeatedly devoted himself to [[billboard]]s. For example, In the Portrait project, which was realised before the Czech presidential elections in 2013, he cut out the giant faces of both the final candidates, smiling at people from their gigantic posters, and then framed them. While he left the remains of the promotional posters lacking the faces of politicians in the original place. Epos installed the framed and glazed representations opposite each other. Shortly after his election, Epos went on to place a gigantic portrait of the winner of the elections [[Miloš Zeman]] in the [[Czech National Library of Technology|National Technical Library]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/epos-257-umelec-ktery-prodal-zaramovanou-loupez-fl3-/recenze.aspx?c=A140406_103720_pozice_139702|title=Epos 257: Umělec, který prodal zarámovanou loupež {{!}} Recenze|date=2014-04-18|website=Lidovky.cz|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
It was mainly for his “billboard” projects that Epos 257 was repeatedly associated with breaking the law. His actions before the presidential and municipal elections also revived the debate on the ethical boundaries of artistic creation. The artist did, however, fully compensate the billboard owners for the financial damages he caused in 2013 by cutting out the heads of the presidential candidates<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/10117034229-168-hodin/214411058251102/obsah/361186-epos-257|title=Epos 257—168 hodin|last=televize|first=Česká|website=Česká televize|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.            

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>. Juvenile ornate butterflyfish are solitary and can be found singly, living in the arms of branching corals, but form pairs during breeding <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\" />.  

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quraters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 


These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.  

Another adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities’ limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2). Awesome Fish Spotlight: The Ornate Butterflyfish: Reef Builders: The Reef and Saltwater Aquarium Blog. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other obligate corallivores (coral-eating) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.

Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.

== Composition ==
Juan Pablo Villamil, one of the four members, said that they wanted to \"do some experimentation\" in this album. He described this album as \"more of a solid album\", saying that it is very different due to their recording experience in one trip to Los Angeles. He believed that in this album \"there's more like one sound and it sounds more like an album\", unlike the first album, which he thought \"the songs sound very different one from another\" as \"it was recorded song by song throughout many years\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-morat-talks-first-u-s-tour-how-the-folk-pop-band-fits-in-tod-137638|title=Interview: Morat talks first U.S. tour & how the folk-pop band fits in today's Latin music scene|last=Villa|first=Lucas|publisher=AXS|date=29 March 2019}}</ref>

In regards to \"No se va\", one of the singles in this album, Juan Pablo Villamil admitted that this song is \"quite different from the others\", describing it as \"more of a dancing type of song\". He said that they wanted to \"do something more upbeat\" in this song.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-morat-talks-first-u-s-tour-how-the-folk-pop-band-fits-in-tod-137638|title=Interview: Morat talks first U.S. tour & how the folk-pop band fits in today's Latin music scene|last=Villa|first=Lucas|publisher=AXS|date=29 March 2019}}</ref>

'''Carl Sanford Joslyn \"Sandy\" Petersen''' (born September 16, 1955) is an American [[game designer]].

==Biography==
Petersen was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and attended [[University of California, Berkeley]], majoring in [[zoology]].

He is a well-known fan of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], whose work he first encountered in a [[World War II]] [[Armed Services Edition]] of ''[[The Dunwich Horror and other Weird Tales]]'' found in his father's library. In 1974, ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' brought his interest to [[role-playing game]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} He became a full-time staff member at [[Chaosium]].<ref name=\"designers\">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|pages=86}}</ref> His interest for role-playing games and H. P. Lovecraft were fused when he became principal author of Chaosium's game ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', published 1981,<ref name=\"Dragon197\">{{cite journal|title=Eye of the Monitor|author=Petersen, Sandy|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|issue=197|date=September 1993|pages=57–62}}</ref> and many scenarios and background pieces thereafter.<ref name=\"HG\">{{Cite book | contribution=[[Up Front (game)|Up Front]] | title=[[Hobby Games: The 100 Best]] | last=Petersen | first=Sandy | authorlink= | editor-last=Lowder | editor-first=James | editor-link=James Lowder | publisher=[[Green Ronin Publishing]] | year=2007 | pages=341–344 | isbn=978-1-932442-96-0}}</ref> While working for Chaosium he co-authored the third edition of ''[[RuneQuest]]'', for which he also co-wrote the critically acclaimed ''[[Trollpak]]'' and a number of other [[Glorantha]]n supplements.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

He authored several critically acclaimed ''RuneQuest'' supplements for [[Avalon Hill]] and [[Games Workshop]].<ref name=\"HG\"/> Petersen served as co-designer for [[West End Games]]'s ''[[Ghostbusters (role-playing game)|Ghostbusters]]'' roleplaying game.<ref name=\"HG\"/> He still plays and runs role-playing games, and is a frequent guest at conventions where he usually runs a [[Freeform role-playing game|freeform game]] of his own devising, and/or helps to run someone else's game.

He worked some time for [[MicroProse]], where he is credited for work on ''[[Sid Meier's Pirates!]]'' and ''[[Sword of the Samurai (computer game)|Sword of the Samurai]]''.<ref name=\"HG\"/> Between 1989 and 1992 he also worked on the [[video game]]s ''[[Darklands (computer game)|Darklands]]'', ''[[Hyperspeed (computer game)|Hyperspeed]]'', and ''[[Lightspeed (video game)|Lightspeed]]''. He also made some contributions to ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]''{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Primarily interested by the [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', Petersen joined [[id Software]] about 10 weeks before the December 1993 release of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and in that time created 19 [[Level (computer and video games)|level]]s for it (of which 8 were based to some extent on early drafts by [[Tom Hall]]). He later created 17 of the levels for ''[[Doom II]]'', and 7 levels for ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''. His Lovecraftian influences also resulted in some changes to the monster designs for these games.

He left id Software for [[Ensemble Studios]] in June 1997.<ref>{{cite web|last=Feldman|first=Curt|url=http://headline.gamespot.com/news/97_07/09_id/index.html|title=Ensemble's Second Title Picks Up Speed|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|date=July 9, 1997|accessdate=November 28, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203063509/http://headline.gamespot.com/news/97_07/09_id/index.html|archivedate=December 3, 1998}}</ref> There, he has worked as a game designer on several of their ''[[Age of Empires]]'' titles, including ''[[Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome Expansion|Rise of Rome]]'', ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings|Age of Kings]]'', and ''[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors Expansion|The Conquerors]]''.<ref name=\"HG\"/> During this time, he was a frequent poster on the HeavenGames forums under the username ES_Sandyman. He ran an extremely popular series of threads, \"Ask Sandyman\", where forum members could ask him about anything they wanted.

Petersen was the Executive Producer for the 2011 movie [[The Whisperer in Darkness (film)|The Whisperer in Darkness]] which was nominated for awards at the [[Chicago International Film Festival|Chicago]] and [[Warsaw International Film Festival]]s.

Over [[United States dollar|US]]$1,400,000 was raised achieving over 3,500% of the initial target.  This success allowed the creation of more figures (60), map expansions and additional scenario options. In most, if not all, previous Cthulhu games \"you strive to avert the impending catastrophe.

Petersen is a practising member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], but sees no conflict between his faith and his design of games involving Satanic elements.

'''Carl Sanford Joslyn \"Sandy\" Petersen''' (born September 16, 1955) is an American [[game designer]].

==Biography==
Petersen was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and attended [[University of California, Berkeley]], majoring in [[zoology]].

He is a well-known fan of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], whose work he first encountered in a [[World War II]] [[Armed Services Edition]] of ''[[The Dunwich Horror and other Weird Tales]]'' found in his father's library. In 1974, ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' brought his interest to [[role-playing game]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} He became a full-time staff member at [[Chaosium]].<ref name=\"designers\">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|pages=86}}</ref> His interest for role-playing games and H. P. Lovecraft were fused when he became principal author of Chaosium's game ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', published 1981,<ref name=\"Dragon197\">{{cite journal|title=Eye of the Monitor|author=Petersen, Sandy|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|issue=197|date=September 1993|pages=57–62}}</ref> and many scenarios and background pieces thereafter.<ref name=\"HG\">{{Cite book | contribution=[[Up Front (game)|Up Front]] | title=[[Hobby Games: The 100 Best]] | last=Petersen | first=Sandy | authorlink= | editor-last=Lowder | editor-first=James | editor-link=James Lowder | publisher=[[Green Ronin Publishing]] | year=2007 | pages=341–344 | isbn=978-1-932442-96-0}}</ref> While working for Chaosium he co-authored the third edition of ''[[RuneQuest]]'', for which he also co-wrote the critically acclaimed ''[[Trollpak]]'' and a number of other [[Glorantha]]n supplements.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

He authored several critically acclaimed ''RuneQuest'' supplements for [[Avalon Hill]] and [[Games Workshop]].<ref name=\"HG\"/> Petersen served as co-designer for [[West End Games]]'s ''[[Ghostbusters (role-playing game)|Ghostbusters]]'' roleplaying game.<ref name=\"HG\"/> He still plays and runs role-playing games, and is a frequent guest at conventions where he usually runs a [[Freeform role-playing game|freeform game]] of his own devising, and/or helps to run someone else's game.

He worked some time for [[MicroProse]], where he is credited for work on ''[[Sid Meier's Pirates!]]'' and ''[[Sword of the Samurai (computer game)|Sword of the Samurai]]''.<ref name=\"HG\"/> Between 1989 and 1992 he also worked on the [[video game]]s ''[[Darklands (computer game)|Darklands]]'', ''[[Hyperspeed (computer game)|Hyperspeed]]'', and ''[[Lightspeed (video game)|Lightspeed]]''. He also made some contributions to ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]''{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Primarily interested by the [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', Petersen joined [[id Software]] about 10 weeks before the December 1993 release of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and in that time created 19 [[Level (computer and video games)|level]]s for it (of which 8 were based to some extent on early drafts by [[Tom Hall]]). He later created 17 of the levels for ''[[Doom II]]'', and 7 levels for ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''. His Lovecraftian influences also resulted in some changes to the monster designs for these games.

He left id Software for [[Ensemble Studios]] in June 1997.<ref>{{cite web|last=Feldman|first=Curt|url=http://headline.gamespot.com/news/97_07/09_id/index.html|title=Ensemble's Second Title Picks Up Speed|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|date=July 9, 1997|accessdate=November 28, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203063509/http://headline.gamespot.com/news/97_07/09_id/index.html|archivedate=December 3, 1998}}</ref> There, he has worked as a game designer on several of their ''[[Age of Empires]]'' titles, including ''[[Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome Expansion|Rise of Rome]]'', ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings|Age of Kings]]'', and ''[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors Expansion|The Conquerors]]''.<ref name=\"HG\"/> During this time, he was a frequent poster on the HeavenGames forums under the username ES_Sandyman. He ran an extremely popular series of threads, \"Ask Sandyman\", where forum members could ask him about anything they wanted.

Petersen was the Executive Producer for the 2011 movie [[The Whisperer in Darkness (film)|The Whisperer in Darkness]] which was nominated for awards at the [[Chicago International Film Festival|Chicago]] and [[Warsaw International Film Festival]]s. It was produced by H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society Motion Pictures in the style of a 1930s black and white [[horror movie]].

He currently{{when|date=December 2013}} serves as the publisher of horror magazine ''Arcane: Penny Dreadfuls for the 21st Century''.<ref name=\"Arcane Webpage\">[http://www.arcanemagazine.com/ Arcane: Penny Dreadfuls for the 21st Century].</ref>

'''''The Ring Two''''' (stylized as '''''the ring twO''''') is a 2005 American [[supernatural]] [[psychological horror]] film and a [[sequel]] to the 2002 film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', which was a [[remake]] of the 1998 Japanese film ''[[Ring (film)|Ringu]]''. [[Hideo Nakata]], director of the original Japanese film ''Ringu'', on which the American versions are based, directed this film in place of [[Gore Verbinski]].

The film was shot in [[Astoria, Oregon]] and [[Los Angeles, California]]. It was released on March 18, 2005, and although it was met by generally negative critical reception, it opened in the United States with a strong [[US dollar|US$]]35 million its first weekend, more than doubling the opening weekend of ''The Ring''. Its final $76 million domestic gross was less than the original's $129 million, but it took $85 million internationally, for a total gross of $161 million.

It is the second installment in [[The Ring (franchise)|''The Ring'' film series]] and was followed by ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'' (2017).

==Plot==
Six months<!-- The short film ''Rings'' (2005) takes place in 2003 and this film is set in the same year, do not remove it --> after the events of the [[The Ring (2002 film)|first film]] and immediately following the events of the short film ''[[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]]'', [[Samara Morgan]]’s cursed videotape has been circulating through teenagers in [[Astoria, Oregon]]. Jake Pierce is on his seventh day as per the tape's rules, and asks his friend Emily to watch the tape. He briefly steps into his kitchen while Emily supposedly watches the tape. Jake receives a phone call and initially thinks it is Samara but is relieved to realize it is only his friend with whom he had planned to trick Emily into watching the tape. Suddenly, Jake notices dark liquid pouring from under the kitchen door and runs outside to the living room, only to discover Emily closed her eyes while watching the tape. Jake is then promptly murdered by Samara.

[[Rachel Keller]] and her son, Aidan, have moved to Astoria from [[Seattle]] after sending the tape off into the ether. Rachel works at ''[[The Daily Astorian]]'' for editor Max Rourke. Rachel learns of Jake's death, inspecting his body, only for Samara to appear, declaring that she has been looking for her. Rachel breaks into Jake's house, obtains the videotape and burns it. Aidan experiences a [[nightmare]] where Samara drags him into a television. He soon starts developing [[hypothermia]] and bruises on his arms. At a [[county fair]], Aidan wanders into a restroom and takes photographs of his reflection, where Samara appears. Rachel takes him home but they are attacked by multiple wild deer on the way. Rachel realizes Aidan may be possessed by Samara.

Max takes them in. While Rachel is attempting to give Aidan a bath, he develops an irrational [[Aquaphobia|fear of water]]. Samara causes the water to recede from the bath, replacing Aidan with herself, and terrorizing Rachel so that she tries to drown Samara. Max enters, seeing her drowning Aidan instead, and forces her to take her son to the hospital. Based on Aidan's bruises, psychiatrist Emma Temple suspects [[child abuse]] on the part of Rachel, who admits she had [[postpartum depression]], and she sends Rachel away. Looking for answers, Rachel returns to the Morgan ranch on Moesko Island, finding evidence of Samara's biological mother Evelyn, who tried to drown her as an infant. Rachel visits Evelyn in a [[psychiatric hospital]], who advises her to \"listen to her baby\".

In the hospital, Samara takes control of Aidan's body and [[Mind control in popular culture|telepathically forces]] Dr. Temple to commit suicide before returning to Max's house. Max arrives, suspects foul play, and tries to secretly take photos of Aidan. Rachel arrives, discovering an affectionate Aidan waiting for her, but acting suspiciously out-of-character. She steps out, finding Max's corpse in his pickup truck. Rachel falls asleep, dreaming of Aidan, who tells her that she will have to [[exorcism|exorcise]] Samara. Upon awakening, Rachel drugs Samara with sleeping pills and places her in the bath to temporarily drown Aidan in order to exorcise her. Samara is removed but appears in the television. Rachel allows herself to be dragged into Samara's monochromatic world.

Finding herself in the bottom of the [[water well|well]] Samara died in, Rachel discovers the lid is partially open. She scales the well's walls, pursued by Samara, but escapes by climbing out and pushing the lid shut on Samara, locking her out of her and Aidan's lives.

Wandering through the woods, she comes to the cliff where Samara's adoptive mother Anna committed suicide. Hearing Aidan's voice, Rachel falls off the cliff and falls into the water, returning to the real world and reuniting with Aidan.

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 20%, based on 189 reviews, with an average rating of 4.44/10. The site's critical consensus states: \"''Ring Two'' serves up horror cliches, and not even Hideo Nakata, the director of the movies from which this one is based, can save the movie from a dull screenplay full of absurdities.\"<ref name=\"rotten\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ring_two/|title=The Ring Two|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean|weighted average]] score, gave the film a 44 out of 100 based on 37 reviews from critics.<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ring-two|title=The Ring Two Reviews, Ratings, Credits|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]], however, considered it better than the first film, giving it 2½ stars and writing \"The charm of ''The Ring Two'', while limited, is real enough; it is based on the film's ability to make absolutely no sense, while nevertheless generating a real enough feeling of tension a good deal of the time.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050317/REVIEWS/50309004 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=The Ring Two Movie Review & Film Summary (2005) | date=2005-03-17}}</ref>

Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

==Home media==
In the [[Motion picture rating system|Unrated Edition]] [[DVD]] release, a few extra scenes were included that were not in the theatrical release. These scenes included conversations with Rachel's new neighbor (and neighborhood gossip), numerous additions in which Max shows a romantic interest in Rachel, more scenes with Samara prior to her possession of Aidan (including one in which she is shown to enter him in the restroom at the local fair), and the short film ''[[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]]'' (2005) (which was also included on a special edition of ''The Ring'' released just before ''The Ring Two'' arrived in theaters). A scene in the theatrical cut in which Aidan first encounters a deer while wandering the local fair (prior to the deer attack) has also been removed from this version. Also, some musical cues were changed such as when Samara leaps out of the well in the opening scene. The opening scene was also longer. The scene when the power went out was changed with a scene of the lights in Aidan's room going on and off, as well as the oven downstairs catching fire.

'''''The Ring Two''''' (stylized as '''''the ring twO''''') is a 2005 American [[supernatural]] [[psychological horror]] film and a [[sequel]] to the 2002 film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', which was a [[remake]] of the 1998 Japanese film ''[[Ring (film)|Ringu]]''. [[Hideo Nakata]], director of the original Japanese film ''Ringu'', on which the American versions are based, directed this film in place of [[Gore Verbinski]].

The film was shot in [[Astoria, Oregon]] and [[Los Angeles, California]]. It was released on March 18, 2005, and although it was met by generally negative critical reception, it opened in the United States with a strong [[US dollar|US$]]35 million its first weekend, more than doubling the opening weekend of ''The Ring''. Its final $76 million domestic gross was less than the original's $129 million, but it took $85 million internationally, for a total gross of $161 million.

It is the second installment in [[The Ring (franchise)|''The Ring'' film series]] and was followed by ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'' (2017).

==Plot==
Six months<!-- The short film ''Rings'' (2005) takes place in 2003 and this film is set in the same year, do not remove it --> after the events of the [[The Ring (2002 film)|first film]] and following the events of the short film ''[[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]]'', [[Samara Morgan]]’s cursed videotape has been circulating through teenagers in [[Astoria, Oregon]]. Jake Pierce is on his seventh day as per the tape's rules, and asks his friend Emily to watch the tape. He briefly steps into his kitchen while Emily supposedly watches the tape. Jake receives a phone call and initially thinks it is Samara but is relieved to realize it is only his friend with whom he had planned to trick Emily into watching the tape. Suddenly, Jake notices dark liquid pouring from under the kitchen door and runs outside to the living room, only to discover Emily closed her eyes while watching the tape. Jake is then promptly murdered by Samara.

[[Rachel Keller]] and her son, Aidan, have moved to Astoria from [[Seattle]] after sending the tape off into the ether. Rachel works at ''[[The Daily Astorian]]'' for editor Max Rourke. Rachel learns of Jake's death, inspecting his body, only for Samara to appear, declaring that she has been looking for her. Rachel breaks into Jake's house, obtains the videotape and burns it. Aidan experiences a [[nightmare]] where Samara drags him into a television. He soon starts developing [[hypothermia]] and bruises on his arms. At a [[county fair]], Aidan wanders into a restroom and takes photographs of his reflection, where Samara appears. Rachel takes him home but they are attacked by multiple wild deer on the way. Rachel realizes Aidan may be possessed by Samara.

Max takes them in. While Rachel is attempting to give Aidan a bath, he develops an irrational [[Aquaphobia|fear of water]]. Samara causes the water to recede from the bath, replacing Aidan with herself, and terrorizing Rachel so that she tries to drown Samara. Max enters, seeing her drowning Aidan instead, and forces her to take her son to the hospital. Based on Aidan's bruises, psychiatrist Emma Temple suspects [[child abuse]] on the part of Rachel, who admits she had [[postpartum depression]], and she sends Rachel away. Looking for answers, Rachel returns to the Morgan ranch on Moesko Island, finding evidence of Samara's biological mother Evelyn, who tried to drown her as an infant. Rachel visits Evelyn in a [[psychiatric hospital]], who advises her to \"listen to her baby\".

In the hospital, Samara takes control of Aidan's body and [[Mind control in popular culture|telepathically forces]] Dr. Temple to commit suicide before returning to Max's house. Max arrives, suspects foul play, and tries to secretly take photos of Aidan. Rachel arrives, discovering an affectionate Aidan waiting for her, but acting suspiciously out-of-character. She steps out, finding Max's corpse in his pickup truck. Rachel falls asleep, dreaming of Aidan, who tells her that she will have to [[exorcism|exorcise]] Samara. Upon awakening, Rachel drugs Samara with sleeping pills and places her in the bath to temporarily drown Aidan in order to exorcise her. Samara is removed but appears in the television. Rachel allows herself to be dragged into Samara's monochromatic world.

Finding herself in the bottom of the [[water well|well]] Samara died in, Rachel discovers the lid is partially open. She scales the well's walls, pursued by Samara, but escapes by climbing out and pushing the lid shut on Samara, locking her out of her and Aidan's lives.

Wandering through the woods, she comes to the cliff where Samara's adoptive mother Anna committed suicide. Hearing Aidan's voice, Rachel falls off the cliff and falls into the water, returning to the real world and reuniting with Aidan.

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 20%, based on 189 reviews, with an average rating of 4.44/10. The site's critical consensus states: \"''Ring Two'' serves up horror cliches, and not even Hideo Nakata, the director of the movies from which this one is based, can save the movie from a dull screenplay full of absurdities.\"<ref name=\"rotten\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ring_two/|title=The Ring Two|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean|weighted average]] score, gave the film a 44 out of 100 based on 37 reviews from critics.<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ring-two|title=The Ring Two Reviews, Ratings, Credits|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]], however, considered it better than the first film, giving it 2½ stars and writing \"The charm of ''The Ring Two'', while limited, is real enough; it is based on the film's ability to make absolutely no sense, while nevertheless generating a real enough feeling of tension a good deal of the time.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050317/REVIEWS/50309004 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=The Ring Two Movie Review & Film Summary (2005) | date=2005-03-17}}</ref>

Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

==Home media==
In the [[Motion picture rating system|Unrated Edition]] [[DVD]] release, a few extra scenes were included that were not in the theatrical release. These scenes included conversations with Rachel's new neighbor (and neighborhood gossip), numerous additions in which Max shows a romantic interest in Rachel, more scenes with Samara prior to her possession of Aidan (including one in which she is shown to enter him in the restroom at the local fair), and the short film ''[[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]]'' (2005) (which was also included on a special edition of ''The Ring'' released just before ''The Ring Two'' arrived in theaters). A scene in the theatrical cut in which Aidan first encounters a deer while wandering the local fair (prior to the deer attack) has also been removed from this version. Also, some musical cues were changed such as when Samara leaps out of the well in the opening scene. The opening scene was also longer. The scene when the power went out was changed with a scene of the lights in Aidan's room going on and off, as well as the oven downstairs catching fire.

Mainly known for his UK journalism work with [[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']], a UK weekly motorcycle magazine-turned-newspaper, then from 1981 as Editor of a new monthly magazine [[The Classic MotorCycle|''The Classic Motor Cycle'']], he retired in early 1988 suffering from an ongoing illness, after a full-time writing career starting in 1955, and later died of [[heart failure]].<ref name=\"Tribute \"/>

Currie was described in 1967 by his editor as \"A prolific writer on all subjects\".<ref name=\"We're going bigger1\">[[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']] 3 August 1967, p.1050. ''Meet our team. \"A prolific writer on all subjects\"''. Accessed 30 March 2016</ref> Writing in Currie's obituary, one former-collaborator remembered that many described him as \"The Walking Encyclopaedia of Motor Cycling History\", whilst his former understudy and editor-designate John Pearson described his death as \"this country has lost its leading writer, historian and authority on veteran, vintage and classic British motorcycles\".<ref name=\"Tribute \">Bob Currie Tribute by John Pearson, Editor, ''[[The Classic Motor Cycle]]'', September 1988, pp.8, 10-13. Accessed 30 March 2016</ref>

==Early life==
With his younger brother, Ken, Currie spent his first few years with their father, an officer in the [[Royal Scots Greys]], at various postings. Soon after leaving the army in 1924 and settling at [[Martley]], [[Worcestershire]], their sister Daphne was born and Captain Currie died. Life for his widow with three children was difficult, and young Bob was sent to live with an aunt in [[Dundee]], later returning for his education at [[Worcester Royal Grammar School]] followed by work as a trainee engineer at [[Heenan & Froude]] in [[Worcester]] when he first started to ride motorcycles. He joined the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], before [[conscription#United Kingdom|conscription]] to the armed forces for the duration of [[World War II]], in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps|RAOC]] (later known as [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|REME]]) where he maintained and repaired [[tank]]s and acted as a [[despatch rider]], progressing to the rank of [[Staff sergeant#United Kingdom|Staff Sergeant]].<ref name=\"Tribute\"/>

==Post-war work and journalism==
After the end of hostilities, Currie returned to work for Heenan & Froude, also becoming involved with the [[The Automobile Association|AA]] magazine, an occasional, [[newsletter]]-type publication mailed to members of the UK [[Subscription business model|subscription]]-based motoring [[Roadside assistance|breakdown organisation]], and as a contributor to the ''TT Special'',<ref name=\"We're going bigger2\">[[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']] 3 August 1967, p.1050. ''Meet our team. \"Before joining Motor Cycle was an assistant editor of the TT Special\"''. Accessed 30 March 2016</ref><ref>[[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']] 28 October 1965, p.620. Accessed 30 March 2016</ref> a seasonal newspaper published by former TT rider Geoff Davison in June for the [[Isle of Man TT]] races, with occasional associated books.

As a motorcycle enthusiast and seasonal reporter he travelled to the [[Isle of Man]]. When staying in the same [[Sefton Internment Camp|Sefton Hotel]] as the [[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']] staff he suggested a collaboration, to enable mutually-better reported coverage of the racing events.<ref name=\"Tribute \"/> Currie had previously submitted occasional articles to ''Motor Cycle'' magazine, and in 1955 a vacancy occurred when a regular staff-writer moved to a four-wheel magazine. Currie was offered the vacancy, initially at head office in London, progressing in 1956 to Midland Editor based at Birmingham, the area where his family resided, in a city central to a region where many British motorcycle manufacturers, metal-industries and component-producers were located.<ref name=\"Tribute\"/> When writing his serialised memoirs of 1969, former [[Motor Cycling (magazine)|''Motor Cycling'']] journalist Bruce Main-Smith stated he was offered the position of Midland Editor with then-rival publication ''[[The Motor Cycle]]'', but did not want to leave the London area and return to Birmingham where he was born, despite a generous offer of salary from then-Editor Harry Louis, a decision Main-Smith later regretted, and the job went to Currie.<ref>''Motorcycle Sport'', June 1969, pp.231-233. ''Motorcycling Moments, Part three: The Staff Job'', Accessed 30 March 2016</ref>

Specialising in the traditional history of motorcycle manufacturing,  road-testing and technical articles, Currie established a strong rapport with the various manufacturers, often enjoying their trust in new developments which he kept confidential until the companies issued press releases.<ref name=\"Tribute\"/><ref name=\"We're going bigger4\">[[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']] 3 August 1967, p.1050. ''Meet our team. \"Keeps up with the news from the factories\"''. Accessed 30 March 2016</ref> In 1965 Currie moved to an office suite at Lynton House, [[Birmingham]], where his desk was part of the parent-publisher's suite in a modern office tower block,<ref>[[The Motor Cycle|Motor Cycle]], 25 November 1965. ''On the Four Winds by 'Nitor'.'' p.759. [image] \"''Bob Currie, our Midland Editor, is now comfortably ensconced in this new office block, Lynton House, Walsall Road, Birmingham. It houses all the staff of the International Publishing Corporation who work in the area.''\" Accessed 30 March 2016</ref> Currie was the last journalist on the staff of ''Motor Cycle'' to have a company motorcycle – he chose a [[Triumph Bonneville]].<ref name=\"Tribute \"/>

==Magazine editing and books==
[[File:Past Times with Bob Currie Logo.JPG|frameless|right]]
In the 1970s, after a 10-year demise of British motorcycle manufacturing, Currie showed an increasing interest in the vintage and classic era, establishing a regular feature in ''Motor Cycle Weekly'' (as ''Motor Cycle'' was then known) named 'Past Times'. Motor Cycle had merged with Motor Cycling in 1967, so their combined archives were available to Currie.<ref name=\"Tribute \"/>

Publisher IPC decided the time was right to establish in 1981 a completely new magazine, ''[[The Classic Motor Cycle]]'', reminiscent of their early historic publication named ''[[The Motor Cycle]]'', to address the increasing public interest and popularity of classic motorcycles. Complete operational control was given to Currie in Birmingham, although overall responsibility remained at head-office in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], [[Surrey]], with former ''Motor Cycle Weekly'' editor Mick Woollett as Editor-in-Chief. In 1983, IPC sold ''The Classic Motor Cycle'' to [[EMAP]] along with the ''Motor Cycle'' and ''Motor Cycling'' archives, with Currie retained as editor based in Birmingham but with an assistant editor now at the Peterborough base of EMAP.<ref name=\"Tribute \"/>

A bachelor, Currie played the [[banjolele]], harmonica and sang. He was an experienced [[Observed trials|trials rider]] and also a keen local motorcycle-club enthusiast who gave slide shows and talks.<ref name=\"We're going bigger3\">[[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']] 3 August 1967, p.1050. ''Meet our team. \"Trials rider for some years then became Midland Centre rally champion\"''. Accessed 30 March 2016</ref> As Vice-President of the [[Vintage Motor Cycle Club]] he judged [[concours d'elegance]] restorations, held Question-and-Answer sessions at classic bike shows and never tired of riding the many machines features in the magazine. Although most of his life was dedicated to motorcycles, he was also interested in [[steam power]] and [[traction engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tribute \"/>

During the middle and later parts of his career Currie converted his vast experience of British manufacturers and period motorcycles into authorship of books, mostly in his own right but occasionally in collaboration with others.

==Finale==
Before his retirement planned for early 1988, he suffered from an illness involving incapacitation due to kidney problems. No longer able to type or write, he continued to edit using dictation – sometimes from his hospital bed – with assistance from his sister Daphne. Assistant-editor John Pearson continued to produce the magazine in close-collaboration. Later in the same year Currie died of [[heart failure]].<ref name=\"Tribute \"/>

In the 1970s, after a 10-year demise of British motorcycle manufacturing, Currie showed an increasing interest in the vintage and classic era, establishing a regular feature in ''Motor Cycle Weekly'' (as ''Motor Cycle'' was then known) named 'Past Times'. Motor Cycle had merged with Motor Cycling in 1967, so their combined archives were available to Currie.<ref name=\"Tribute \"/>

Publisher IPC decided the time was right to establish in 1981 a completely new magazine, ''[[The Classic Motor Cycle]]'', reminiscent of their early historic publication named ''[[The Motor Cycle]]'', to address the increasing public interest and popularity of classic motorcycles. Complete operational control was given to Currie in Birmingham, although overall responsibility remained at head-office in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], [[Surrey]], with former ''Motor Cycle Weekly'' editor Mick Woollett as Editor-in-Chief. In 1983, IPC sold ''The Classic Motor Cycle'' to [[EMAP]] along with the ''Motor Cycle'' and ''Motor Cycling'' archives, with Currie retained as editor based in Birmingham but with an assistant editor now at the Peterborough base of EMAP.<ref name=\"Tribute \"/>

A bachelor, Currie played the [[banjolele]], harmonica and sang. He was an experienced [[Observed trials|trials rider]] and also a keen local motorcycle-club enthusiast who gave slide shows and talks.<ref name=\"We're going bigger3\">[[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']] 3 August 1967, p.1050. ''Meet our team. \"Trials rider for some years then became Midland Centre rally champion\"''. Accessed 30 March 2016</ref> As Vice-President of the [[Vintage Motor Cycle Club]] he judged [[concours d'elegance]] restorations, held Question-and-Answer sessions at classic bike shows and never tired of riding the many machines features in the magazine. Although most of his life was dedicated to motorcycles, he was also interested in [[steam power]] and [[traction engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tribute \"/>

During the middle and later parts of his career Currie converted his vast experience of British manufacturers and period motorcycles into authorship of books, mostly in his own right but occasionally in collaboration with others.

==Finale==
Before his retirement planned for early 1988, he suffered from an illness involving incapacitation due to kidney problems. No longer able to type or write, he continued to edit using dictation – sometimes from his hospital bed – with assistance from his sister Daphne. Assistant-editor John Pearson continued to produce the magazine in close-collaboration. Later in the same year Currie died of [[heart failure]].<ref name=\"Tribute \"/>

The '''Borough of Scarborough''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|ɑr|b|ər|ə}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/scarborough |title=Definition of Scarborough |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Scarborough?q=Scarborough+ |title=Definition for Scarborough - Oxford Dictionaries Online (World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref> is a [[non-metropolitan district]] and [[borough]] of [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]].  In addition to the town of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], it covers a large stretch of the coast of Yorkshire, including [[Whitby]] and [[Filey]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Scarborough-England|title=Scarborough {{!}} England, United Kingdom|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=15 September 2017}}</ref> It borders [[Redcar and Cleveland]] to the north, the [[Ryedale]] and [[Hambleton District|Hambleton]] districts to the west and the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] to the south.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]].  It was a merger of the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of Filey and part of the [[Bridlington Rural District]], from the historic [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], along with the [[municipal borough]] of Scarborough, [[Scalby, North Yorkshire|Scalby]] and Whitby [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s, and Scarborough Rural District and [[Whitby Rural District]], from the historic [[North Riding of Yorkshire|North Riding]].

In 2007, the borough was threatened with extinction.  In March of that year, [[North Yorkshire County Council]] was shortlisted by the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] to be a unitary authority.  If the bid had been successful then the Borough of Scarborough would have—along with all other districts and boroughs in the present county of [[North Yorkshire]]—been abolished. The bid, however, was unsuccessful and the districts remain as they were previously constituted.

The political composition of the council since the [[2003 Scarborough Council election|2003 election]] is as follows:

'''Customer service''' is the provision of [[Service (economics)|service]] to [[customer]]s before, during and after a purchase. The perception of success of such interactions is dependent on employees \"who can adjust themselves to the personality of the guest\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110301/a-customer-service-makeover_pagen_2.html|title=A Customer Service Makeover |last=Buchanan |first=Leigh |date=1 March 2011|work=[[Inc.

Customer service concerns the priority an organization assigns to customer service relative to components such as product innovation and pricing. In this sense, an organization that values good customer service may spend more money in training employees than the average organization or may proactively interview customers for feedback.

From the point of view of an overall [[sales process engineering]] effort, customer service plays an important role in an organization's ability to generate income and [[revenue]].<ref name=\"Selden1998\">{{cite journal|author = Paul H. Selden|date= 1998|title=''Sales Process Engineering: An Emerging Quality Application''|journal=Quality Progress| pages = 59–63}}</ref> From that perspective, customer service should be included as part of an overall approach to systematic improvement.

==Customer support==
{{Main|Customer support}}
A customer support is a range of customer services to assist customers in making cost effective and correct use of a product.<ref name=businessdictionary>[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/customer-support.html businessdictionary.com > customer support] Retrieved March 2011</ref> It includes assistance in planning, installation, training, trouble shooting, maintenance, upgrading, and disposal of a product.<ref name=businessdictionary/> These services even may be done at customer's side where he/she uses the product or service. In this case it is called \"at home customer services\"'' or ''\"at home customer support.\"''

Regarding technology, products such as mobile phones, televisions, computers, software products or other electronic or mechanical goods, it is termed [[technical support]].

==Automated customer service==
Customer service may be provided by a person (e.g., [[sales representative|sales]] and service representative), or by automated means,{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} such as kiosks, [[Internet site]]s, and [[Application software|apps]]. An advantage with automated means is an increased ability to provide service 24-hours a day, which can, at least, be a complement to customer service by persons.<ref name=Kongthon/>

An increasingly popular type of automated customer service is conducted through [[artificial intelligence]] (\"AI\"). The customer benefit of AI is the feel for chatting with a live agent through improved speech technologies while giving customers the self-service benefit.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goebel |first1=Tobias |title=Google Duplex’s Conversational AI Shows a Path to Better Customer Service |url=https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/google-duplexs-conversational-ai-shows-a-path-to-better-customer-service/ |website=CMSWire.com |publisher=Simpler Media Group |accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>  Another example of automated customer service is by [[push-button telephone|touch-tone phone]], which usually involves IVR (Interactive Voice Response) a main menu and the use of the keypad as options (e.g., \"Press 1 for English, Press 2 for Spanish\", etc.){{cn|date=March 2019}}

However, in the [[Internet era]], a challenge has been to maintain and/or enhance the personal experience while making use of the efficiencies of [[online commerce]]. \"Online customers are literally invisible to you (and you to them), so it's easy to shortchange them emotionally. But this lack of visual and tactile presence makes it even more crucial to create a sense of personal, human-to-human connection in the online arena.\"<ref name=\"fast_comp_2010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1570793/seven-keys-building-customer-loyalty-and-company-profits|title=Seven Keys to Building Customer Loyalty--and Company Profits |last=Solomon|first=Micah|date=4 March 2010|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|accessdate=29 Oct 2012}}</ref>

==Metrics and measuring customer service results==
The two main ways of gathering feedback are: customer surveys and [[Net Promoter|Net Promoter Score]] measurement, used for calculating the loyalty that exists between a provider and a consumer.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Customer service metrics that are followed by companies depend on the tool used for customer service. Most popular metrics include: 
*first response time, 
*average response time, 
*average handle time <ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.verint.com/engagement/resources/guide-to-handle-time/|title=The Comprehensive Guide to Reducing Average Handle Time |last=Joglekar|first=Avanti|date=2020-03-12|website=Verint|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>,
*[[customer satisfaction]] score (CSAT).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Instant feedback==
Many organizations have implemented feedback loops that allow them to capture feedback at the point of experience. For example, [[National Express]] in the UK has invited passengers to send text messages while  riding the bus. This has been shown to be useful, as it allows companies to improve their customer service before the customer defects, thus making it far more likely that the customer will return next time.<ref>{{cite news | title=Lunch Lesson Four - Customer service |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/working_lunch/3161800.stm | accessdate= October 27, 2008  | date=October 3, 2003}}</ref> Technology has made it increasingly easier for companies to obtain feedback from their customers. Community blogs and forums give customers the ability to give detailed explanations of both negative as well as positive experiences with a company/organization.

== Standardization ==
There are few standards on this topic. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[The International Customer Service Institute]] (TICSI) have published the following ones:
* [[ISO 9004]]:2000, on performance improvement
* [[ISO 10001]]:2007, on customer service conduct
* [[ISO 10002]]:2004, on quality management in handling customer complaints
* [[ISO 10003]]:2007, on dispute resolution
* ISO 10004:2012, on monitoring and measuring
* The International Customer Service Standard ([[TICSS]])
* CCQA Customer Care Standard (Care Quality Alliance) www.CCQA.org.uk

There is also an [[Information Technology]] service management standard: [[ISO/IEC 20000 | ISO/IEC 20000:2005]]. Its first part concerns specifications and its second part the code of practice.

== Criticism ==
Some have argued <ref>{{Cite book | last = Dall | first = Michael | last2 = Bailine | first2 = Adam  | title = Service this: Winning the war against customer disservice | publisher = Last Chapter First | year = 2004 | edition = 1st | isbn = 0-9753719-0-8 | postscript = .}}</ref> that the quality and level of customer service has decreased in recent years, and that this can be attributed to a lack of support or understanding at the executive and middle management levels of a corporation and/or a customer service policy. To address this argument, many organizations have employed a variety of methods to improve their customer satisfaction levels, and other [http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/cx-metrics-kpi-dictionary-1966465.pdf key performance indicators (KPIs)].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMM_87.htm|title=Performance Management and KPIsLinking Activities to Vision and Strategy|access-date=2018-08-31|website=mindtools.com|language=en}}</ref>

'''''The Origin of Capitalism''''' is a 1999 book on [[history]] and [[political economy]], specifically the [[history of capitalism]], by scholar [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]], written from the perspective of [[Political Marxism]]. It was reviewed as an \"Outstanding Academic Book\" by [[Michael Perelman (economist)|Michael Perelman]].<ref name=\"Perelman\"/>

==Summary==

The book is divided into three sections. The following summary is based on the second edition (though some references are to the first).

Wood's [[Marxist]] approach originates from [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of [[political economy]] in his works ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and ''[[Grundrisse]]''.<ref>1999, p. 35.</ref> In the capitalist form of society, human [[labor power]] is for sale in the market as one of many commodities.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\">1999, p. 2.</ref> Goods and services, including those regarding the most basic necessities of life, are produced for profitable exchange.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\"/> All the actors in a such system are driven by [[competition]] and [[profit (economics)|profit]]-maximization.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\"/> However, the study presents capitalists' appropriation of \"workers' surplus labor without coercion\"<ref name=\"1999, p. 70\">1999, p. 70.</ref> by using the market to set rates of compensation both for wages and for appropriation<ref name=\"1999, p. 70\"/> as the most distinctive and historically important feature of capitalism. Thus it argues that the origin of capitalism lies fundamentally in social property relations rather than in trade and commerce.

Wood argues that past historians have tended to see capitalism as a natural and even inevitable human behaviour, which came into being when barriers to trade and commerce were removed: essentially, in their understanding, people were waiting for the ''opportunity'' to become capitalists. Wood argues rather that capitalism did not come about until a set of unique historical circumstances ''compelled'' people to.

===Part I, 'Histories of the Transition'===

In Part I, Wood surveys past work on the transition to capitalism. She sketches how [[Adam Smith]], [[Max Weber]], [[Fernand Braudel]], and [[Henri Pirenne]] assumed that capitalism naturally arises from trade, commerce, and urbanisation once city-dwellers have accumulated enough [[primitive capital]] to be able to reinvest it in production. However, she also finds that even commentators who were critical of this account tend to argue that the transition to capitalism entailed farmers seizing new opportunities to switch from subsistence to commodity production as the constraints of [[feudalism]] were loosened. Examples include [[Karl Marx]] himself, [[Karl Polanyi]], [[Paul Sweezy]], [[Maurice Dobb]], [[Rodney Hilton]], and [[Perry Anderson]]. This suggests that capitalism is a natural and inevitable behaviour, waiting for its opportunity, rather than historically unusual and specific. Building particularly on the arguments made in the [[Brenner Debate]] and on the work of [[E. P. Thompson]], Wood argues that 'we need a form of history that brings this specificity into sharp relief'.<ref>2002, p. 69.</ref>

===Part II, 'The Origin of Capitalism'===

In Part II, Wood argues that capitalism emerged in the unique conditions of late medieval and early modern English agrarian society, basing her argument firmly on Robert Brenner's ‘Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe’.<ref>Brenner, Robert (1976). ‘Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe,’ ''Past & Present'', 70, February, pp. 30-75.</ref> She argues that commerce is not equivalent to capitalism and does not produce it because 'the dominant principle of trade everywhere was not surplus value derived from production but \"profit on alienation\", \"buying cheap and selling dear\" ':<ref>2002, p. 78.</ref> that is, although trade involves the seeking of profits, it does not in itself affect how goods are produced. Wood argues that polities which flourished from trade such as medieval [[Florence]] and the early-modern [[Dutch Republic]] that did not become capitalist are not examples of a 'failed transition', but rather examples of how trade and urbanisation has flourished widely in human history without capitalism developing. She likewise argues that various past societies, such as early modern France, had peasantries with ample opportunity to enter into commercial production, which, however, did not take this opportunity. Thus Wood concludes that capitalism must have arisen from changing ''imperatives'' in fundamental relations of ''production''.<ref name=\"Perelman\">Perelman, Oct. 1999</ref>

Wood sees these unique circumstances arising in [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages|late medieval]] and early-modern England (particularly the south-east). In the wake of the [[Norman Conquest]], the English state was unusually centralised. This gave aristocrats relatively limited powers to extract wealth directly from their feudal underlings through political means (not least the threat of violence). England's centralisation also meant that an unusual number of English farmers were not peasants (with their own land and thus direct access to subsistence) but [[Tenant farmer|tenants]] (renting their land). These circumstances produced a market in leases. Landlords, lacking other ways to extract wealth, were incentivised to rent to those tenants who could pay the most, while tenants, lacking security of tenure, were incentivised to farm as productively as possible to be able to win leases in a competitive market. This led to a cascade of effects whereby successful tenant farmers became agrarian capitalists; unsuccessful ones became wage-labourers, required to sell their labour in order to live; and landlords promoted the privatisation and renting out of common land, not least through the [[enclosures]].<ref name=obit>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/ellen-meiksins-wood-obituary  David McNally, \"Ellen Meiksins Wood obituary\" ''The Guardian''].</ref> 'It was not merchants or manufacturers who drove the process that propelled the early development of capitalism. The transformation of social property relations was firmly rooted in the countryside, and the transformation of England's trade and industry was result more than cause of England's transition to capitalism'.<ref>2002, p. 129.</ref>

===Part III, 'Agrarian Capitalism and Beyond'===

In Part III, Wood sketches how industrial capitalism developed from its agrarian English origins. She argues that the end of subsistence farming produced a large population which needed both to sell its labour and to buy basic necessities of life, creating a mass consumer market quite different from the markets for luxury goods that characterised non-capitalist commerce. This mass market underpinned the development of mass production.

Wood argues that England's rising productivity slowly but inevitably forced competing economies to enter capitalist modes of production: although the development of capitalism was a chance event, it set in motion a transition that would become global. She argues that English capitalism did not cause England's imperialism, noting that neighbouring non-capitalist economies like Spain and France also built overseas empires. She does find, however, that English capitalism produced a distinctive kind of imperialism. Rather than ruling purely through 'extra-economic' methods of exerting power (such as force), England exported its model of social property relations to its colonies, providing powerful economic imperatives for people to adopt capitalism. English imperialism also drew on the nascent capitalist ideology of thinkers such as [[Thomas More]], [[Sir John Davies]], [[John Locke]], and [[William Petty]] to justify taking the land of peoples who were thought not to be making sufficiently productive use of it.

Wood sketches the reliance of capitalism on the political structures of the [[nation-state]] (particularly its protection of private property), and emphasises that the humane and universalist ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] emerged in the still non-capitalist France of the eighteenth century, setting Enlightenment ideas in contrast to capitalist ideologies. Finally, she emphasises that if capitalism is a historically specific and unusual development, it is not inevitable or the only way that humans might organise themselves.

'''''The Origin of Capitalism''''' is a 1999 book on [[history]] and [[political economy]], specifically the [[history of capitalism]], by scholar [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]], written from the perspective of [[Political Marxism]]. It was reviewed as an \"Outstanding Academic Book\" by [[Michael Perelman (economist)|Michael Perelman]].<ref name=\"Perelman\"/>

==Summary==

The book is divided into three sections. The following summary is based on the second edition (though some references are to the first).

Wood's [[Marxist]] approach originates from [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of [[political economy]] in his works ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and ''[[Grundrisse]]''.<ref>1999, p. 35.</ref> In the capitalist form of society, human [[labor power]] is for sale in the market as one of many commodities.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\">1999, p. 2.</ref> Goods and services, including those regarding the most basic necessities of life, are produced for profitable exchange.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\"/> All the actors in a such system are driven by [[competition]] and [[profit (economics)|profit]]-maximization.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\"/> However, the study presents capitalists' appropriation of \"workers' surplus labor without coercion\"<ref name=\"1999, p. 70\">1999, p. 70.</ref> by using the market to set rates of compensation both for wages and for appropriation<ref name=\"1999, p. 70\"/> as the most distinctive and historically important feature of capitalism. Thus it argues that the origin of capitalism lies fundamentally in social property relations rather than in trade and commerce.

Wood argues that past historians have tended to see capitalism as a natural and even inevitable human behaviour, which came into being when barriers to trade and commerce were removed: essentially, in their understanding, people were waiting for the ''opportunity'' to become capitalists. Wood argues rather that capitalism did not come about until a set of unique historical circumstances ''compelled'' people to.

===Part I, 'Histories of the Transition'===

In Part I, Wood surveys past work on the transition to capitalism. She sketches how [[Adam Smith]], [[Max Weber]], [[Fernand Braudel]], and [[Henri Pirenne]] assumed that capitalism naturally arises from trade, commerce, and urbanisation once city-dwellers have accumulated enough [[primitive capital]] to be able to reinvest it in production. However, she also finds that even commentators who were critical of this account tend to argue that the transition to capitalism entailed farmers seizing new opportunities to switch from subsistence to commodity production as the constraints of [[feudalism]] were loosened. Examples include [[Karl Marx]] himself, [[Karl Polanyi]], [[Paul Sweezy]], [[Maurice Dobb]], [[Rodney Hilton]], and [[Perry Anderson]]. This suggests that capitalism is a natural and inevitable behaviour, waiting for its opportunity, rather than historically unusual and specific. Building particularly on the arguments made in the [[Brenner Debate]] and on the work of [[E. P. Thompson]], Wood argues that 'we need a form of history that brings this specificity into sharp relief'.<ref>2002, p. 69.</ref>

===Part II, 'The Origin of Capitalism'===

In Part II, Wood argues that capitalism emerged in the unique conditions of late medieval and early modern English agrarian society, basing her argument firmly on Robert Brenner's ‘Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe’.<ref>Brenner, Robert (1976). ‘Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe,’ ''Past & Present'', 70, February, pp. 30-75.</ref> She argues that commerce is not equivalent to capitalism and does not produce it because 'the dominant principle of trade everywhere was not surplus value derived from production but \"profit on alienation\", \"buying cheap and selling dear\" ':<ref>2002, p. 78.</ref> that is, although trade involves the seeking of profits, it does not in itself affect how goods are produced. Wood argues that polities which flourished from trade such as medieval [[Florence]] and the early-modern [[Dutch Republic]] that did not become capitalist are not examples of a 'failed transition', but rather examples of how trade and urbanisation has flourished widely in human history without capitalism developing. She likewise argues that various past societies, such as early modern France, had peasantries with ample opportunity to enter into commercial production, which, however, did not take this opportunity. Thus Wood concludes that capitalism must have arisen from changing ''imperatives'' in fundamental relations of ''production''.<ref name=\"Perelman\">Perelman, Oct. 1999</ref>

Wood sees these unique circumstances arising in [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages|late medieval]] and early-modern England (particularly the south-east). In the wake of the [[Norman Conquest]], the English state was unusually centralised. This gave aristocrats relatively limited powers to extract wealth directly from their feudal underlings through political means (not least the threat of violence). England's centralisation also meant that an unusual number of English farmers were not peasants (with their own land and thus direct access to subsistence) but [[Tenant farmer|tenants]] (renting their land). These circumstances produced a market in leases. Landlords, lacking other ways to extract wealth, were incentivised to rent to those tenants who could pay the most, while tenants, lacking security of tenure, were incentivised to farm as productively as possible to be able to win leases in a competitive market. This led to a cascade of effects whereby successful tenant farmers became agrarian capitalists; unsuccessful ones became wage-labourers, required to sell their labour in order to live; and landlords promoted the privatisation and renting out of common land, not least through the [[enclosures]].<ref name=obit>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/ellen-meiksins-wood-obituary  David McNally, \"Ellen Meiksins Wood obituary\" ''The Guardian''].</ref> 'It was not merchants or manufacturers who drove the process that propelled the early development of capitalism. The transformation of social property relations was firmly rooted in the countryside, and the transformation of England's trade and industry was result more than cause of England's transition to capitalism'.<ref>2002, p. 129.</ref>
