The northern part of the city is located on [[Trinity Bay (Queensland)|Trinity Bay]] and the city centre is located on [[Trinity Inlet]]. To the south of the Trinity Inlet lies the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah. Some of the city's suburbs are located on flood plains. The [[Mulgrave River]] and [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]] flow within the greater Cairns area but not through the CBD. The city's centre foreshore is located on a mud flat.\n\n===Urban layout===\n[[File:Esplanade, Cairns, 2015 (01).JPG|thumb|left|City centre of Cairns]]\n\nCairns is a provincial city, with a linear urban layout that runs from the south at Edmonton to the north at [[Ellis Beach]]. The city is approximately {{convert|52|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from north to south; it has experienced a recent [[urban sprawl]], with suburbs occupying land once used for sugar cane farming.\n\nThe ''Northern Beaches'' consist of a number of beach communities extending north along the coast. In general, each beach suburb is at the end of a spur road extending from the [[Captain Cook Highway]]. From south to north, these are [[Machans Beach, Queensland|Machans Beach]], [[Holloways Beach, Queensland|Holloways Beach]], [[Yorkeys Knob, Queensland|Yorkeys Knob]], Trinity Park, [[Trinity Beach, Queensland|Trinity Beach]], [[Kewarra Beach, Queensland|Kewarra Beach]], [[Clifton Beach, Queensland|Clifton Beach]], [[Palm Cove, Queensland|Palm Cove]], and Ellis Beach.\n\nThe suburb of [[Smithfield, Queensland|Smithfield]] is inland against the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, between Yorkeys Knob and Trinity Park. It serves as the main hub for the Northern Beaches, with a modern shopping arcade, called Smithfield Shopping Centre.\n\nSouth of Smithfield and inland from the Northern Beaches along the edge of the Barron River [[flood plain]] are the suburbs of [[Caravonica, Queensland|Caravonica]], [[Kamerunga, Queensland|Kamerunga]], [[Freshwater, Queensland|Freshwater]], and [[Stratford, Queensland|Stratford]]. This area is sometimes referred to as Freshwater Valley, though it is actually the lower part of Redlynch Valley; further up the valley are the suburbs of Redlynch, on the western side of Redlynch Valley, and [[Brinsmead, Queensland|Brinsmead]] on the eastern side. Stratford, Freshwater, and Brinsmead are separated from Cairns city by Mount Whitfield (elevation {{convert|365|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) and Whitfield Range. [[Crystal Cascades]] and [[Copperlode Falls Dam]] are also behind this range. ([[Kuranda, Queensland|Kuranda]], a town on the Barron River on the western side of the Macalister Range, forms part of the Cairns economic catchment but is in the [[Tablelands Region|Tablelands local government]] area and is not part of the Cairns urban area.)\n\nThe city centre of Cairns is adjacent to the suburbs of [[Cairns North]], and Parramatta Park, [[Bungalow, Queensland|Bungalow]], Portsmith, and close to [[Westcourt, Queensland|Westcourt]], Manunda, [[Manoora, Queensland|Manoora]], Edge Hill, Whitfield, [[Kanimbla, Queensland|Kanimbla]], [[Mooroobool, Queensland|Mooroobool]], Earlville, [[Woree, Queensland|Woree]] and [[Bayview Heights, Queensland|Bayview Heights]].

The Council consists of a directly elected mayor and 10 councillors, elected from 10 single-member divisions (or wards) using an optional [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system. Elections are held every four years.\n\nThe Cairns Region consists of three former local government areas. The first was the original [[City of Cairns]], consisting of the Cairns City region as listed above. The second, which was amalgamated in 1995, was the [[Shire of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Shire of Mulgrave]] (comprising the other areas, namely the Northern Beaches, Redlynch Valley and Southside). The town of Gordonvale was once called Nelson. The third area is the [[Shire of Douglas]], which amalgamated in 2008 during major statewide local government reforms.\n\nAt the time of the 1995 amalgamation, Cairns City had a population of approximately 40,000 and Mulgrave Shire had a population of approximately 60,000. Both local government authorities had chambers in the Cairns [[Central business district|CBD]]. The old Cairns City Council chambers has been converted into a new city library. In a controversial decision,<ref>{{cite news|work=The Cairns Post|title=Land Row|page=1|agency=News Limited|date=19 July 2001}}</ref> new Council chambers were constructed on previously contaminated land in the mainly industrial suburb of Portsmith.\n\nCairns has three representatives in the [[Queensland Parliament]], from the electoral districts of [[Electoral district of Barron River|Barron River]], [[Electoral district of Cairns|Cairns]] and [[Electoral district of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Mulgrave]].

A Special Forces training base was established at the old \"[[Fairview, Cairns|Fairview]]\" homestead on Munro's Hill, [[Mooroobool, Queensland|Mooroobool]]. This base was officially known as the [[Z Experimental Station]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The Heroes |last=McKie |first=Ronald |year=1960 |publisher=Angus & Robertson Ltd |location=Sydney|isbn=0-207-12133-8 |page=9}}</ref> but referred to informally as \"The House on the Hill\".\n\nAfter World War II, Cairns gradually developed into a centre for tourism. The opening of the [[Cairns Airport|Cairns International Airport]] in 1984 helped establish the city as a desirable destination for international tourism.\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 census]] of Population, there were 144,787 people in Cairns (Significant Urban Area).\n* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 8.9% of the population.\n* 67.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.0%, New Zealand 3.1%, Papua New Guinea 1.5%, Philippines 1.2% and Japan 1.1%.\n* 76.9% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Japanese 1.6%, Mandarin 0.8%, Italian 0.7%, Korean 0.7% and German 0.6%.\n* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 32.1%, Catholic 22.4% and Anglican 13.2%.<ref name=\"ABSSUACensus16\">{{Census 2016 AUS|id=3003|name=Cairns (Significant Urban Area)|accessdate=4 October 2018|quick=on}}[[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Glass floor wide shot 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Skyrail Rainforest Cableway]] goes over the rainforest and is one of the city's main tourist attractions.]]\n[[File:Goldsbrough.jpg|thumb|The Mulgrave River running through the Goldsbrough Valley to the south of Gordonvale.]]\n[[File:Fruit bats, Cairns.JPG|thumb|Fruit bats hanging from a mango tree, central Cairns]]\n\nCairns is located on the east coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]] on a coastal strip between the [[Coral Sea]] and the [[Great Dividing Range]]. The northern part of the city is located on [[Trinity Bay (Queensland)|Trinity Bay]] and the city centre is located on [[Trinity Inlet]]. To the south of the Trinity Inlet lies the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah. Some of the city's suburbs are located on flood plains. The [[Mulgrave River]] and [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]] flow within the greater Cairns area but not through the CBD. The city's centre foreshore is located on a mud flat.\n\n===Urban layout===\n[[File:Esplanade, Cairns, 2015 (01).JPG|thumb|left|City centre of Cairns]]\n\nCairns is a provincial city, with a linear urban layout that runs from the south at Edmonton to the north at [[Ellis Beach]]. The city is approximately {{convert|52|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from north to south; it has experienced a recent [[urban sprawl]], with suburbs occupying land once used for sugar cane farming.\n\nThe ''Northern Beaches'' consist of a number of beach communities extending north along the coast. In general, each beach suburb is at the end of a spur road extending from the [[Captain Cook Highway]]. From south to north, these are [[Machans Beach, Queensland|Machans Beach]], [[Holloways Beach, Queensland|Holloways Beach]], [[Yorkeys Knob, Queensland|Yorkeys Knob]], Trinity Park, [[Trinity Beach, Queensland|Trinity Beach]], [[Kewarra Beach, Queensland|Kewarra Beach]], [[Clifton Beach, Queensland|Clifton Beach]], [[Palm Cove, Queensland|Palm Cove]], and Ellis Beach.\n\nThe suburb of [[Smithfield, Queensland|Smithfield]] is inland against the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, between Yorkeys Knob and Trinity Park. It serves as the main hub for the Northern Beaches, with a modern shopping arcade, called Smithfield Shopping Centre.\n\nSouth of Smithfield and inland from the Northern Beaches along the edge of the Barron River [[flood plain]] are the suburbs of [[Caravonica, Queensland|Caravonica]], [[Kamerunga, Queensland|Kamerunga]], [[Freshwater, Queensland|Freshwater]], and [[Stratford, Queensland|Stratford]]. This area is sometimes referred to as Freshwater Valley, though it is actually the lower part of Redlynch Valley; further up the valley are the suburbs of Redlynch, on the western side of Redlynch Valley, and [[Brinsmead, Queensland|Brinsmead]] on the eastern side. Stratford, Freshwater, and Brinsmead are separated from Cairns city by Mount Whitfield (elevation {{convert|365|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) and Whitfield Range. [[Crystal Cascades]] and [[Copperlode Falls Dam]] are also behind this range. ([[Kuranda, Queensland|Kuranda]], a town on the Barron River on the western side of the Macalister Range, forms part of the Cairns economic catchment but is in the [[Tablelands Region|Tablelands local government]] area and is not part of the Cairns urban area.)\n\nThe city centre of Cairns is adjacent to the suburbs of [[Cairns North]], and Parramatta Park, [[Bungalow, Queensland|Bungalow]], Portsmith, and close to [[Westcourt, Queensland|Westcourt]], Manunda, [[Manoora, Queensland|Manoora]], Edge Hill, Whitfield, [[Kanimbla, Queensland|Kanimbla]], [[Mooroobool, Queensland|Mooroobool]], Earlville, [[Woree, Queensland|Woree]] and [[Bayview Heights, Queensland|Bayview Heights]]. The small suburb of [[Aeroglen, Queensland|Aeroglen]] is pressed between Mount Whitfield and the airport, on the Captain Cook Highway between Cairns North and Stratford.\n\n''Southside Cairns'', situated in a narrow area between Trinity Inlet to the east and Lamb Range to the west, includes the suburbs of White Rock, Mount Sheridan, [[Bentley Park, Queensland|Bentley Park]] and [[Edmonton, Queensland|Edmonton]]. The townships of Goldsborough, Little Mulgrave, and Aloomba are near [[Gordonvale, Queensland|Gordonvale]], on the Mulgrave River. This area is serviced by the [[Bruce Highway]]. Several other small towns and communities within Cairns' jurisdiction are sparsely located along the Bruce highway, the furthest being [[Mirriwinni, Queensland|Mirriwinni]], {{Convert|66|km|abbr=on}} south of Cairns city; the largest of these townships is [[Babinda]], about {{Convert|60|km|abbr=on}} from the city.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Children on tropical beach.jpg|thumb|Tropical beach in Cairns]]\nCairns experiences a tropical [[climate]], specifically a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Am) under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Linacre | first = Edward |author2=Geerts, Bart | title = Climates and Weather Explained | publisher=Routledge | location = London | year = 1997 | page = 379 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mkZa1KLHCAQC&lpg=PA379&pg=PA379#v=onepage&q= | isbn = 0-415-12519-7}}</ref> A [[wet season]] with heavy monsoonal downpours runs from November to May, with a relatively [[dry season]] from June to October, though light showers can occur during this period.<ref name=CoC>{{cite web|title=Climate of Cairns|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/cairns/climate.shtml|work=Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=13 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320220732/http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/cairns/climate.shtml|archivedate=20 March 2011}}</ref> Cairns' mean annual rainfall is just under {{convert|2000|mm|in}}, although monthly totals in the wet season (Dec\u2013Mar) can exceed {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with the highest rainfall being recorded in any month in January 1981, where over {{convert|1417.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell.<ref name=ave>{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_031011_All.shtml |title=Climate statistics for Cairns Aero AWS |accessdate=23 October 2011 |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111032613/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_031011_All.shtml |archivedate=11 January 2012  }}</ref> [[Babinda, Queensland|Babinda]], a town to the south of the city, is Australia's wettest town, recording an annual rainfall of over {{convert|4200|mm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nCairns has hot, humid summers and warm winters.<ref name=CoC/> Mean maximum temperatures vary from {{convert|26.2|C|F}} in July to {{convert|31.7|C|F}} in January.

boardwalk from the ocean on the right, at low tide]]\n\nCairns is part of the [[Cairns Region]] [[local government areas of Queensland|local government area]] which is governed by a Regional Council. The Council consists of a directly elected mayor and 10 councillors, elected from 10 single-member divisions (or wards) using an optional [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system. Elections are held every four years.\n\nThe Cairns Region consists of three former local government areas. The first was the original [[City of Cairns]], consisting of the Cairns City region as listed above. The second, which was amalgamated in 1995, was the [[Shire of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Shire of Mulgrave]] (comprising the other areas, namely the Northern Beaches, Redlynch Valley and Southside). The town of Gordonvale was once called Nelson. The third area is the [[Shire of Douglas]], which amalgamated in 2008 during major statewide local government reforms.\n\nAt the time of the 1995 amalgamation, Cairns City had a population of approximately 40,000 and Mulgrave Shire had a population of approximately 60,000.

It runs private trains on the rail network owned by the Queensland State Government and managed by QR's Network Division.\n\nThe [[Kuranda Scenic Railway]] operates from Cairns. The tourist railway ascends the Macalister Range and is not used for commuter services. It passes through the suburbs of Stratford, Freshwater (stopping at Freshwater Station) and Redlynch before reaching Kuranda.\n\nFreight services to [[Forsayth, Queensland|Forsayth]] were discontinued in the mid-1990s. These were mixed freight and passenger services that served the semi-remote towns west of the Great Dividing Range. There is now a weekly passenger-only service, ''The [[Savannahlander]]'', that leaves Cairns on Wednesday mornings. The Savannahlander is run by a private company, Cairns Kuranda Steam Trains.\n\nCairns is served by a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] cane railway (or cane train) network that hauls harvested sugar cane to the [[Mulgrave Sugar Mill]] located in Gordonvale.
