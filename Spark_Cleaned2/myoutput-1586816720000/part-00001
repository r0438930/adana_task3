Photo taken in 1907]]\n\n'''Anti-Qing sentiment''' refers to a sentiment principally held by [[Han_Chinese|Han Chinese]] against the [[Manchu]] ruling class during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1636\u20131912), which was accused by a number of opponents of being barbarian. The Qing was accused of destroying traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] culture by forcing Han to wear their hair in a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] in the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] style. It was blamed for suppressing Chinese science, [[Qing conquest theory|causing China to be transformed]] from the world's premiere power to a poor, extremely backwards nation teared apart by a club of faraway imperialist powers. The people of the [[Eight Banners]] lived off [[Social welfare in China|government pensions]] unlike the general Han civilian population.\n\nThe rallying slogan of anti-Qing activists was (\"F\u01cen Q\u012bng f\u00f9 M\u00edng\" \"Oppose Qing and restore [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]\"), related to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] slogan \"Revive the Qing and destroy the foreigners\".\n\nIn the broadest sense, an anti-Qing activist was anyone who engaged in anti-Manchu [[direct action]]. This included people from many mainstream political movements and uprisings, such as the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], [[White Lotus Rebellion]], [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Panthay Rebellion]], [[Nian_Rebellion|Nian Rebellion]], [[Xinhai Revolution]], [[Revive China Society]], [[Tongmenghui]], and others.\n\n== Ming loyalism in the early Qing ==\n[[File:Zheng Chenggong.JPG|thumb|Statue of Zheng Chenggong on [[Gulangyu Island]] in [[Xiamen]], one of many in mainland China and Taiwan.]]\n\n=== Muslim Ming loyalists ===\n[[Hui people|Hui Muslim]] Ming loyalists under Mi Layin and Ding Guodong fought against the Qing to restore a Ming prince to the throne from 1646\u20131650.

This put Joseon in a dilemma when both [[Nurhaci]] and the Ming requested support. [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon]] tried to maintain neutrality, but most of his officials opposed him for not supporting the Ming, a longstanding ally.\n\nIn 1623 King Gwanghaegun was deposed and replaced by [[Injo of Joseon|King Injo]] (r. 1623\u20131649), who banished Gwanghaejun's supporters. Reversing his predecessor's foreign policy, the new king decided to support the Ming openly, but a rebellion led by military commander [[Yi Gwal]] erupted in 1624 and wrecked Joseon's military defenses in the north. Even after the rebellion had been suppressed, King Injo had to devote military forces to ensure the stability of the capital, leaving fewer soldiers to defend the northern borders.<ref name=\"Ebrey 349\">{{harvnb|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=349}}</ref>\n\nThe Manchus invaded Korea twice, in 1627 and 1636, eventually forcing Joseon to sever its ties with the Ming and instead to become a tributary of the Manchus. However, popular opposition to the Manchus remained in Korea. Joseon continued to use the Ming calendar rather than the Qing calendar, and Koreans continued to wear Ming-style clothing and hairstyles, rather than the Manchu [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]]. After the fall of the Ming dynasty, Joseon Koreans saw themselves as continuing the traditions of [[Neo-Confucianism]].<ref name=\"Holcombe\">{{harvnb|Holcombe|2011|p=176}}</ref>\n\n== Anti-Qing rebellions ==\n\n=== Mongol Rebellions ===\nThe [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Mongols under Qing rule]] were divided into three primary groups- the Inner Mongols, the Outer [[Khalkha Mongols]], and the [[Oirats|Eastern Oirat Mongols]].\n\nThe Inner Mongolian [[Chahar Mongols|Chahar]] Khan [[Ligdan Khan]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son [[Ejei Khan]] surrendered to the Qing in 1636 and was given the title of Prince (Qin Wang, \u89aa\u738b), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrested in 1669 in [[Shenyang]] and the [[Kangxi Emperor]] gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.\n\nThe Khalkha Mongols were more reluctant to come under Qing rule, only submitting to the [[Kangxi Emperor]] after they came under an invasion from the Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar Khanate]] under its leader [[Galdan]].\n\nThe Oirat [[Khoshut]] [[Upper Mongols]] in [[Qinghai]] rebelled against the Qing during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] but were crushed and defeated.\n\n[[File:Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue.JPG|thumb|Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue in Ulan-Bator]]\n\nThe Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] in the [[Dzungar Khanate]] offered outright resistance and war against the Qing for decades until they Qing annihilated the Dzungars in the [[Dzungar genocide]]. Khalkha Mongol rebels under Prince [[Ching\u00fcnjav]] had plotted with the Dzungar leader [[Amursana]] and led a rebellion against the Qing at the same time as the Dzungars. The Qing crushed the rebellion and executed Ching\u00fcnjav and his entire family.\n\nDuring the Xinhai Revolution, the Outer Khalkha Mongols staged an uprising against the Qing and expelled the Manchu [[Amban]]s.\n\n=== Taiping Rebellion ===\n{{Main|Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Heavenly Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Hong Xiuquan.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Hong Xiuquan as the \"Heavenly King\" (ca. 1860)]]\n\n[[Hong Xiuquan]] was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] Chinese who was the leader of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850\u20131864) against the Qing dynasty. He proclaimed himself to be the [[Heavenly King]], established the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] and called [[Jesus Christ]] his brother.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==== Genocide and extermination of Manchus ====\nDriven by their fierce hatred of Manchus, the Taiping launched a [[genocide]] campaign against the Manchus to exterminate their entire race. The past history was revived like the [[Transition_from_Ming_to_Qing|transition from Ming to Qing]] and [[Jin\u2013Song Wars]] to boost hatred for the Manchus.\n\nIn every area they captured during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], the Taiping immediately rushed into the Manchu fort in order to kill all the Manchus. One Qing loyalist observed in the province of [[Hunan]] of the genocidal massacres committed by Taiping forces against the Manchus and wrote of the \"pitiful Manchus\", the Manchu men, women and children who were exterminated by the Taiping with their swords. Once [[Hefei]] capitulated, the Taiping forces rushed into the Manchu quarter shouting \"Kill the demons (Manchus)!\" while exterminating all the Manchus living there. [[Ningbo]]'s entire Manchu population was also annihilated.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wm4CuSvIYiEC&pg=PA139&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false| title=The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom: Rebellion and the Blasphemy of Empire | author=Thomas H.

The Qing was accused of destroying traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] culture by forcing Han to wear their hair in a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] in the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] style. It was blamed for suppressing Chinese science, [[Qing conquest theory|causing China to be transformed]] from the world's premiere power to a poor, backwards nation. The people of the [[Eight Banners]] lived off [[Social welfare in China|government pensions]] unlike the general Han civilian population.\n\nThe rallying slogan of anti-Qing activists was \"F\u01cen Q\u012bng f\u00f9 M\u00edng\" (simplified Chinese: \u53cd\u6e05\u590d\u660e; traditional Chinese: \u53cd\u6e05\u5fa9\u660e; literally: \"Oppose Qing and restore [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]\"), related to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] slogan \"Revive the Qing and destroy the foreigners\" (\"\u6276\u6e05\u6ec5\u6d0b f\u00fa Q\u012bng mi\u00e8 y\u00e1ng\").\n\nIn the broadest sense, an anti-Qing activist was anyone who engaged in anti-Manchu [[direct action]].

This put Joseon in a dilemma when both [[Nurhaci]] and the Ming requested support. [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon]] tried to maintain neutrality, but most of his officials opposed him for not supporting the Ming, a longstanding ally.\n\nIn 1623 King Gwanghaegun was deposed and replaced by [[Injo of Joseon|King Injo]] (r. 1623\u20131649), who banished Gwanghaejun's supporters. Reversing his predecessor's foreign policy, the new king decided to support the Ming openly, but a rebellion led by military commander [[Yi Gwal]] erupted in 1624 and wrecked Joseon's military defenses in the north. Even after the rebellion had been suppressed, King Injo had to devote military forces to ensure the stability of the capital, leaving fewer soldiers to defend the northern borders.<ref name=\"Ebrey 349\">{{harvnb|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=349}}</ref>\n\nThe Manchus invaded Korea twice, in 1627 and 1636, eventually forcing Joseon to sever its ties with the Ming and instead to become a tributary of the Manchus. However, popular opposition to the Manchus remained in Korea. Joseon continued to use the Ming calendar rather than the Qing calendar, and Koreans continued to wear Ming-style clothing and hairstyles, rather than the Manchu [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]]. After the fall of the Ming dynasty, Joseon Koreans saw themselves as continuing the traditions of [[Neo-Confucianism]].<ref name=\"Holcombe\">{{harvnb|Holcombe|2011|p=176}}</ref>\n\n== Anti-Qing rebellions ==\n\n=== Mongol Rebellions ===\nThe [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Mongols under Qing rule]] were divided into three primary groups- the Inner Mongols, the Outer [[Khalkha Mongols]], and the [[Oirats|Eastern Oirat Mongols]].\n\nThe Inner Mongolian [[Chahar Mongols|Chahar]] Khan [[Ligdan Khan]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son [[Ejei Khan]] surrendered to the Qing in 1636 and was given the title of Prince (Qin Wang, \u89aa\u738b), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrested in 1669 in [[Shenyang]] and the [[Kangxi Emperor]] gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.\n\nThe Khalkha Mongols were more reluctant to come under Qing rule, only submitting to the [[Kangxi Emperor]] after they came under an invasion from the Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar Khanate]] under its leader [[Galdan]].\n\nThe Oirat [[Khoshut]] [[Upper Mongols]] in [[Qinghai]] rebelled against the Qing during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] but were crushed and defeated.\n\n[[File:Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue.JPG|thumb|Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue in Ulan-Bator]]\n\nThe Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] in the [[Dzungar Khanate]] offered outright resistance and war against the Qing for decades until they Qing annihilated the Dzungars in the [[Dzungar genocide]]. Khalkha Mongol rebels under Prince [[Ching\u00fcnjav]] had plotted with the Dzungar leader [[Amursana]] and led a rebellion against the Qing at the same time as the Dzungars. The Qing crushed the rebellion and executed Ching\u00fcnjav and his entire family.\n\nDuring the Xinhai Revolution, the Outer Khalkha Mongols staged an uprising against the Qing and expelled the Manchu [[Amban]]s.\n\n=== Taiping Rebellion ===\n{{Main|Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Heavenly Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Hong Xiuquan.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Hong Xiuquan as the \"Heavenly King\" (ca. 1860)]]\n\n[[Hong Xiuquan]] (\u6d2a\u79c0\u5168, H\u00f3ng Xi\u00f9qu\u00e1n) was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] Chinese who was the leader of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850\u20131864) against the Qing dynasty.

One Qing loyalist observed in the province of [[Hunan]] of the genocidal massacres committed by Taiping forces against the Manchus and wrote of the \"pitiful Manchus\", the Manchu men, women and children who were exterminated by the Taiping with their swords. Once [[Hefei]] capitulated, the Taiping forces rushed into the Manchu quarter shouting \"Kill the demons (Manchus)!\" while exterminating all the Manchus living there.

He gradually became interested in Western ideas and went to Japan to study in 1901, where he was exposed to radical revolutionary and anti-Manchu ideas.\n\nHere are some quotations of Zou Rong:\n\n\"Sweep away millennia of despotism in all its forms, throw off millennia of slavishness, annihilate the five million and more of the furry and horned Manchu race, cleanse ourselves of 260 years of harsh and unremitting pain\"<br />\n\"I do not begrudge repeating over and over again that internally we are slaves of the Manchus and suffering from their tyranny, externally we are being harassed by the Powers, and we are doubly enslaved.\"<br />\n\"Kill the emperor set up by the Manchus as a warning to the myriad generations that despotic government is not to be revived.\"<br />\n\"Settle the name of the country as the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chss.iup.edu/baumler/zourong.html |title=Zou Rong The Revolutionary Army |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926224557/http://www.chss.iup.edu/baumler/zourong.html |archivedate=2008-09-26 }}</ref>\n\n== Overthrow of the Qing ==\n{{Main|Xinhai Revolution}}\n[[File:Xinhai Revolution in Shanghai.jpg|right|thumb|450px| Celebrations in Nanjing Road, Shanghai during the Xinhai Revolution, 1911]]\n\nThe [[Xinhai Revolution]] ({{zh |c = \u8f9b\u4ea5\u9769\u547d |p = X\u012bnh\u00e0i g\u00e9m\u00ecng}}) of 1911 was catalysed by the triumph of the [[Wuchang Uprising]], when the victorious Wuchang revolutionaries telegraphed the other provinces asking them to declare their independence, and 15 provinces in [[Southern China]] and [[Central China]] did so.<ref>Liu, Haiming.
