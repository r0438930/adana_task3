Founded in 1907 as the Arkansas State [[Normal school|Normal School]], the university is one of the oldest in the U.S. state of [[Arkansas]].<ref name=\"history\" /> As the state's only normal school at the time, UCA has historically been the primary source of teachers in Arkansas.<ref name=\"history\" /> UCA is noted for programs in nursing, education, physical therapy, business, performing arts, and psychology.\n\nThe university comprises six colleges: the College of Fine Arts and Communication, the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, the College of Business, the College of Health and Behavioral Sciences, the College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Education.<ref name=\"academics\">{{cite web |url=http://uca.edu/academics/ |title= Academics |website=University of Central Arkansas |access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref> In addition to this UCA is home to five [[residential college]]s and one commuter college, those being the HPaW Residential College, EDGE Residential College, The Stars Residential College, STEM Residential College, EPIC Residential College, and the Minton Commuter College.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uca.edu/residential/ |title= Residential Colleges |website=University of Central Arkansas |access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nUCA has about 12,000 graduate and undergraduate students, making it one of the largest universities in the state.<ref name=\"enrollment\" /> The university maintains a student-to-faculty ratio of approximately 17 to 1.<ref name=\"quick facts\" /> Over 150 undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs are offered at the university.<ref name=\"quick facts\" /> UCA occupies over 120 buildings within its {{convert|356|acre|km2}}.<ref name=\"quick facts\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:CenPlaza.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Harding Plaza in front of Irby Hall.]]\nThe Arkansas State Legislature created the '''Arkansas State Normal School''',<ref name=\"history\" /> now known as the University of Central Arkansas, in 1907 by passage of Act 317 on May 14. The purpose of The Arkansas State Normal School was to properly train students to become professional teachers and centralize teacher training. Classes began September 21, 1908 with nine academic departments, one building on {{convert|80|acre|m2}}, 107 students and seven faculty members. Two faculty members taught in two departments and President Doyne taught pedagogy and Latin.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nIn 1925, Arkansas State Normal School became '''Arkansas State Teachers College'''.<ref name=\"history\" /> The name change more accurately reflected the primary focus of instruction and mission of the institution.\n[[Image:GardensUCA.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Flowers looking towards the south, central part of campus.]]\nBy 1967, the mission of Arkansas State Teachers College had changed. Though teacher training was still an important part of the school's mission, other fields began to expand in liberal arts studies and in the emerging field of health care. To recognize the institution's existing academic diversity another name change was in order. In January 1967, Arkansas State Teachers College became the '''State College of Arkansas'''.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nPresident Silas Snow, who championed the name change in 1967, organized State College of Arkansas along university lines in preparation for still yet another name change. State College of Arkansas grew rapidly and offered an ever-widening range of degree programs. By January 1975, Snow\u2019s efforts were realized as the State Department of Higher Education recommended State College of Arkansas be known as The University of Central Arkansas, or UCA.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Presidents===\n[[File:TorrLib.jpg|thumb|Torreyson Library, named after Burr Walter Torreyson.]]\n\n* John James Doyne (1908\u20131917)<ref name=\"history\" />\n* Burr Walter Torreyson (1917\u20131930)<ref name=\"history\" />\n* Heber L.

President Doyne assigned the task of developing school colors to W.O. Wilson and Ida Waldran in 1908. Wilson was wearing a gray sweater and Waldran was wearing a purple scarf. They chose the colors based upon the color of the clothing they were wearing that day. Both Wilson and Waldran thought that purple and gray complemented each other. Today the official colors for all UCA sports teams are purple and gray.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Mascot===\nIt wasn't until 1920 that the UCA athletic teams had a mascot. According to Dr. Ted Worley, author of A History of The Arkansas State Teachers College, the UCA teams from 1908 to 1919 were referred to by many names, including: Tutors, Teachers, Pedagogues, Pea-Pickers, and Normalites. In 1920 the Bears became the mascot for the teams. However, it wasn\u2019t until April 7, 1921, that the teams were called the \"Bears\" in print. Dr. Worley also quoted sources as saying the Bear was an appropriate symbol for the school because Arkansas\u2019 nickname was the \"Bear State\". The women's teams were known as the Bearettes for several years. The name of Sugar Bear came later. Victor E. Bear came about in 1999 and Victoria E. Bear came soon after. Bruce D. Bear became the newest addition to the UCA family in 2006.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Main Hall===\nUCA's Main Hall is the oldest building on campus. This building was completed in 1919 and was built by George Donaghey, the man for whom Donaghey Avenue is named and a former governor of the State of Arkansas. After the building was built it served a dual role as the administration building and as a classroom building. It continued to serve as the administration building until the 1960s. On February 11, 2011, the building was named on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20110204.htm |title=WEEKLY LIST OF ACTIONS TAKEN ON PROPERTIES |date=February 4, 2011 |website=National Park Service |access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===World War II Marker===\nUCA's World War II Memorial was dedicated in October 2003.

The purpose of The Arkansas State Normal School was to properly train students to become professional teachers and centralize teacher training. Classes began September 21, 1908 with nine academic departments, one building on {{convert|80|acre|m2}}, 107 students and seven faculty members. Two faculty members taught in two departments and President Doyne taught pedagogy and Latin.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nIn 1925, Arkansas State Normal School became '''Arkansas State Teachers College'''.<ref name=\"history\" /> The name change more accurately reflected the primary focus of instruction and mission of the institution.\n[[Image:GardensUCA.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Flowers looking towards the south, central part of campus.]]\nBy 1967, the mission of Arkansas State Teachers College had changed. Though teacher training was still an important part of the school's mission, other fields began to expand in liberal arts studies and in the emerging field of health care. To recognize the institution's existing academic diversity another name change was in order. In January 1967, Arkansas State Teachers College became the '''State College of Arkansas'''.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nPresident Silas Snow, who championed the name change in 1967, organized State College of Arkansas along university lines in preparation for still yet another name change. State College of Arkansas grew rapidly and offered an ever-widening range of degree programs. By January 1975, Snow\u2019s efforts were realized as the State Department of Higher Education recommended State College of Arkansas be known as The University of Central Arkansas, or UCA.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Presidents===\n[[File:TorrLib.jpg|thumb|Torreyson Library, named after Burr Walter Torreyson.]]\n\n* John James Doyne (1908\u20131917)<ref name=\"history\" />\n* Burr Walter Torreyson (1917\u20131930)<ref name=\"history\" />\n* Heber L.

President Doyne assigned the task of developing school colors to W.O. Wilson and Ida Waldran in 1908. Wilson was wearing a gray sweater and Waldran was wearing a purple scarf. They chose the colors based upon the color of the clothing they were wearing that day. Both Wilson and Waldran thought that purple and gray complemented each other. Today the official colors for all UCA sports teams are purple and gray.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Mascot===\nIt wasn't until 1920 that the UCA athletic teams had a mascot. According to Dr. Ted Worley, author of A History of The Arkansas State Teachers College, the UCA teams from 1908 to 1919 were referred to by many names, including: Tutors, Teachers, Pedagogues, Pea-Pickers, and Normalites. In 1920 the Bears became the mascot for the teams. However, it wasn\u2019t until April 7, 1921, that the teams were called the \"Bears\" in print. Dr. Worley also quoted sources as saying the Bear was an appropriate symbol for the school because Arkansas\u2019 nickname was the \"Bear State\". The women's teams were known as the Bearettes for several years. The name of Sugar Bear came later. Victor E. Bear came about in 1999 and Victoria E. Bear came soon after. Bruce D. Bear became the newest addition to the UCA family in 2006.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Main Hall===\nUCA's Main Hall is the oldest building on campus. This building was completed in 1919 and was built by George Donaghey, the man for whom Donaghey Avenue is named and a former governor of the State of Arkansas. After the building was built it served a dual role as the administration building and as a classroom building. It continued to serve as the administration building until the 1960s. On February 11, 2011, the building was named on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20110204.htm |title=WEEKLY LIST OF ACTIONS TAKEN ON PROPERTIES |date=February 4, 2011 |website=National Park Service |access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===World War II Marker===\nUCA's World War II Memorial was dedicated in October 2003.
