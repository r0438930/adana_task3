Gregory was captain of the [[clipper ship]] ''[[Tejuca]]'' from her 1854 completion to her foundering and sinking in an 1856 hurricane; Gregory and most of his crew were only rescued at the last moment by the courageous intervention of a passing ship. Gregory was later commander of the [[barque|bark]] ''Albers'', and in 1857 is said to have put down a riot on his ship virtually singlehanded. \n\nWith the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in April 1861, Gregory took a temporary commission in the [[United States Navy]] and was given command of the [[brig]] {{USS|Bohio}}. ''Bohio'' under Gregory's command took a number of prizes, the most remarkable example of which involved a ruse to disguise his vessel as a steamship in order to deceive the enemy into surrendering. \n\nAfter resigning from the Navy, Gregory struggled to find a new command due to the exigencies of war. His last voyage as a mariner was reportedly made in 1866.\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nWilliam Doliber Gregory was born on December 31, 1825 in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]],<ref name=coddington2016_pp51-52>Coddington 2016. pp. 51\u201352.</ref><ref name=lindsey1915_p68/> to John H.

According to the article, Gregory had been obliged to hire a new crew at the port of [[Macau]] during his 1857 voyage. On the advice of the American [[Consul (representative)|consul]], he paid the crew in advance, but he later heard that his new crew included a number of men known for jumping ship with their wages.<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900>{{cite news |last= Roads |first= Samuel Jr |date= 1900-01-21 |title= Mutinies on New England Ships |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49278477/w-d-gregory-puts-down-riot-on-bark/ |work= The Boston Globe |page= 33 }}</ref>\n\nWhile sharing a meal with the new owner of ''Albers'' at the latter's residence, Gregory received word that the crew were running wild aboard ship. Hurrying back to the vessel, Gregory caught one crew member attempting to swim ashore, and dragged him back aboard.<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900/> Arriving on deck, he found other crew members \"running about brandishing knives\",<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900/> while the mate and a loyal shipmate were at a loss to stop them. The ''Globe'' describes what occurred next:<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900/> \n\n<blockquote>Capt. Gregory was armed with a stout cane, and as he stepped on the deck began knocking the rioters down, right and left. Then he went at them with his fists, fighting so effectually that order was soon restored. The ship was taken down the stream, and the voyage to [[Manila]], thence to [[Hong Kong]], was made without further trouble.<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900/></blockquote> \n\nNot long after Gregory's return to the United States, his employers, Bush & Wilder, purchased a new ship for him to take on another voyage to China. Before he could do so however, the United States Navy requisitioned the vessel for service in the [[American Civil War]] which had recently broken out, thus depriving him of his new command.<ref name=lindsey1915_p69/>\n\n=== Naval service (1861&ndash;1862) ===  \n[[ File:E.

To address the critical shortage of personnel, the Navy created temporary commissions, enabling volunteers from the [[merchant marine]] to become naval officers with little or no additional training.<ref name=schultz1990_pp89-90/> In the autumn of 1861, William Gregory and his brothers Michael and Samuel all volunteered for, and received, such commissions.<ref name=schultz1990_pp89-90/><ref name=roads1880_pp304-305>Roads 1880. pp. [https://hdl.handle.net/2027/loc.ark:/13960/t9668m935?urlappend=%3Bseq=346 304\u2013305].</ref>  \n\n==== Dismissal and reinstatement, 1861 ====   \n\nWilliam Gregory was quickly given command of the steam [[gunboat]] {{USS|E.

Here, Gregory received intelligence that a \"suspicious-looking\" schooner flying the British flag had been recently hailed in the vicinity by a US Navy ship, but allowed to proceed because her papers seemed to be in order. Gregory requested and received permission to pursue the vessel, and at 11 pm set sail on an interception course.<ref name=roads1880_pp306-307>Roads 1880. pp. [https://hdl.handle.net/2027/loc.ark:/13960/t9668m935?urlappend=%3Bseq=348 306\u2013307].</ref> \n\nAt 5 am the next morning, ''Bohio'' sighted the vessel, but the latter immediately set all sails to evade her pursuer, and a chase ensued. Finding after some hours that he was unable to gain on the other ship, Gregory devised a ruse by which he hoped to deceive her captain. He had his crew erect a 12-foot length of [[stovepipe]], fastened to some barrels on deck, to resemble a [[smokestack]]. Sand was placed in the bottom barrel to protect the deck, and a fire was then started in the stovepipe \"with bits of rope, old junk, tar and other materials\"<ref name=roads1880_pp306-307/> to create smoke. Simultaneously, he had the crew constantly wet the sails to increase ''Bohio''{{'}}s speed.

Gregory was captain of the [[clipper ship]] ''[[Tejuca]]'' from her 1854 completion to her foundering and sinking in an 1856 hurricane; Gregory and most of his crew were only rescued at the last moment by the courageous intervention of a passing ship. Gregory was later commander of the [[barque|bark]] ''Albers'', and in 1857 is said to have put down a riot on his ship virtually singlehanded. \n\nWith the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in April 1861, Gregory took a temporary commission in the [[United States Navy]] and was given command of the [[brig]] {{USS|Bohio}}. ''Bohio'' under Gregory's command took a number of prizes, the most remarkable example of which involved a ruse to disguise his vessel as a steamship in order to deceive the enemy into surrendering. \n\nAfter resigning from the Navy, Gregory struggled to find a new command due to the exigencies of war. His last voyage as a mariner was reportedly made in 1866.\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nWilliam Doliber Gregory was born on December 31, 1825 in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]],<ref name=coddington2016_pp51-52>Coddington 2016. pp. 51\u201352.</ref><ref name=lindsey1915_p68/> to John H.

According to the article, Gregory had been obliged to hire a new crew at the port of [[Macau]] during his 1857 voyage. On the advice of the American [[Consul (representative)|consul]], he paid the crew in advance, but he later heard that his new crew included a number of men known for jumping ship with their wages.<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900>{{cite news |last= Roads |first= Samuel Jr |date= 1900-01-21 |title= Mutinies on New England Ships |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49278477/w-d-gregory-puts-down-riot-on-bark/ |work= The Boston Globe |page= 33 }}</ref>\n\nWhile sharing a meal with the new owner of ''Albers'' at the latter's residence, Gregory received word that the crew were running wild aboard ship. Hurrying back to the vessel, Gregory caught one crew member attempting to swim ashore, and dragged him back aboard.<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900/> Arriving on deck, he found other crew members \"running about brandishing knives\",<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900/> while the mate and a loyal shipmate were at a loss to stop them.

Gregory was armed with a stout cane, and as he stepped on the deck began knocking the rioters down, right and left. Then he went at them with his fists, fighting so effectually that order was soon restored.

Before he could do so however, the United States Navy requisitioned the vessel for service in the [[American Civil War]] which had recently broken out, thus depriving him of his new command.<ref name=lindsey1915_p69/>\n\n=== Naval service (1861&ndash;1862) ===  \n[[ File:E.
