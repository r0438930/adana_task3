While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], while in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall.

Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]].\n\nWest of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\nThe [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{convert|891.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\n\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadtr\u00e4te'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung'').

While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], while in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture in Berlin}}\n{{Further|List of sights in Berlin|List of tallest buildings in Berlin}}\n[[File:20190113 Berlin 0510.jpg|thumb|View of [[Gendarmenmarkt]], with the [[Konzerthaus Berlin]] to the right and the [[Neue Kirche, Berlin|German Church]] in the back]]\n[[File:Berliner Dom seen from James Simon Park.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Cathedral]] at [[Museum Island]]]]\nThe [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]].\n\nWest of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\nThe [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{convert|891.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\n\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadtr\u00e4te'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung'').
