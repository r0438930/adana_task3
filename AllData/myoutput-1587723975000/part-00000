In a 2009 interview with [[Charlie Rose]], he described his upbringing as excessively \"morbid,\" saying, \"I mercifully lapsed as a Catholic ... but as [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]] used to say, 'I'm an atheist, thank God.'\" Though insisting that he is spiritually \"not with Bu\u00f1uel\" and that \"once a Catholic, always a Catholic, in a way.\" He concluded, \"I believe in Man. I believe in mankind, as the worst and the best that has happened to this world.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10441 |title=A conversation with Guillermo del Toro |publisher=Charlie Rose |date=2009-07-02 |accessdate=2010-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313022024/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10441 |archivedate=2010-03-13 |df=}}</ref> He has also responded to the observation that he views his art as his religion by saying, \"It is. To me, art and storytelling serve primal, spiritual functions in my daily life. Whether I'm telling a bedtime story to my kids or trying to mount a movie or write a short story or a novel, I take it very seriously.\"<ref name=\"Time\"/> Nevertheless, he became a \"raging [[Atheism|atheist]]\" after seeing a pile of human fetuses while volunteering at a Mexican hospital.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/07/show-the-monster|title=Show the Monster|last=Zalewski|first=Daniel|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate=September 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930083944/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/07/show-the-monster#|archive-date=2017-09-30|url-status=live}}</ref> He has claimed to be horrified by the way the Catholic Church complied with [[Francoist Spain]], down to having a character in his film quote what actual priests would say to [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] members in concentration camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenanarchy.com/2006/12/pans-labyrinthinterview-with-guillermo-del-toro.html|title=PAN'S LABYRINTH\u2014Interview With Guillermo Del Toro|date=17 December 2006|website=Screenanarchy.com|accessdate=30 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029121309/http://screenanarchy.com/2006/12/pans-labyrinthinterview-with-guillermo-del-toro.html#|archive-date=2017-10-29|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Upon discovering the religious beliefs of [[C.S.

While discussing ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', Del Toro discussed the Catholic influence on the film, stating, \"A very Catholic notion is the humble force, or the force of humility, that gets revealed as a god-like figure toward the end. It's also used in fairy tales. In fairy tales, in fact, there is an entire strand of tales that would be encompassed by the title 'The Magical Fish.' And [it's] not exactly a secret that a fish is a Christian symbol.\" In the same interview, he still maintained that he does not believe in an [[afterlife]], stating \"I don't think there is life beyond death, I don't. But I do believe that we get this clarity in the last minute of our life. The titles we achieved, the honors we managed, they all vanish. You are left alone with you and your deeds and the things you didn't do. And that moment of clarity gives you either peace or the most tremendous fear, because you finally have no cover, and you finally realize exactly who you are.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/567265511/guillermo-del-toro-says-shape-of-water-is-an-antidote-for-today-s-cynicism|title=Guillermo Del Toro Says 'Shape Of Water' Is An Antidote For Today's Cynicism|author=|date=|website=npr.org|access-date=2018-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024154640/https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/567265511/guillermo-del-toro-says-shape-of-water-is-an-antidote-for-today-s-cynicism#|archive-date=2018-10-24|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\n=== Personal tastes ===\n[[File:Guillermo Del Toro Cannes 2015.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Del Toro at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\nIn 2010, del Toro revealed that he was a fan of video games, describing them as \"the comic books of our time\" and \"a medium that gains no respect among the intelligentsia\".

In a 2009 interview with [[Charlie Rose]], he described his upbringing as excessively \"morbid,\" saying, \"I mercifully lapsed as a Catholic ... but as [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]] used to say, 'I'm an atheist, thank God.'\" Though insisting that he is spiritually \"not with Bu\u00f1uel\" and that \"once a Catholic, always a Catholic, in a way.\" He concluded, \"I believe in Man.

To me, art and storytelling serve primal, spiritual functions in my daily life. Whether I'm telling a bedtime story to my kids or trying to mount a movie or write a short story or a novel, I take it very seriously.\"<ref name=\"Time\"/> Nevertheless, he became a \"raging [[Atheism|atheist]]\" after seeing a pile of human fetuses while volunteering at a Mexican hospital.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/07/show-the-monster|title=Show the Monster|last=Zalewski|first=Daniel|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate=September 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930083944/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/07/show-the-monster#|archive-date=2017-09-30|url-status=live}}</ref> He has claimed to be horrified by the way the Catholic Church complied with [[Francoist Spain]], down to having a character in his film quote what actual priests would say to [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] members in concentration camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenanarchy.com/2006/12/pans-labyrinthinterview-with-guillermo-del-toro.html|title=PAN'S LABYRINTH\u2014Interview With Guillermo Del Toro|date=17 December 2006|website=Screenanarchy.com|accessdate=30 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029121309/http://screenanarchy.com/2006/12/pans-labyrinthinterview-with-guillermo-del-toro.html#|archive-date=2017-10-29|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Upon discovering the religious beliefs of [[C.S.

While discussing ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', Del Toro discussed the Catholic influence on the film, stating, \"A very Catholic notion is the humble force, or the force of humility, that gets revealed as a god-like figure toward the end. It's also used in fairy tales. In fairy tales, in fact, there is an entire strand of tales that would be encompassed by the title 'The Magical Fish.' And [it's] not exactly a secret that a fish is a Christian symbol.\" In the same interview, he still maintained that he does not believe in an [[afterlife]], stating \"I don't think there is life beyond death, I don't. But I do believe that we get this clarity in the last minute of our life. The titles we achieved, the honors we managed, they all vanish. You are left alone with you and your deeds and the things you didn't do. And that moment of clarity gives you either peace or the most tremendous fear, because you finally have no cover, and you finally realize exactly who you are.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/567265511/guillermo-del-toro-says-shape-of-water-is-an-antidote-for-today-s-cynicism|title=Guillermo Del Toro Says 'Shape Of Water' Is An Antidote For Today's Cynicism|author=|date=|website=npr.org|access-date=2018-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024154640/https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/567265511/guillermo-del-toro-says-shape-of-water-is-an-antidote-for-today-s-cynicism#|archive-date=2018-10-24|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\n=== Personal tastes ===\n[[File:Guillermo Del Toro Cannes 2015.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Del Toro at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\nIn 2010, del Toro revealed that he was a fan of video games, describing them as \"the comic books of our time\" and \"a medium that gains no respect among the intelligentsia\".
