The original plan was that the first column, commanded by Wenceslao Robles, would seize Corrientes while a second column of 12,000 men, commanded by Antonio de la Cruz Estigarribia, would then advance to the east of Corrientes and capture Brazilian possessions on the Uruguay River. The primary focus of this invasion plan was the capture of Brazilian possessions, as this would prevent Brazilian expansion, a great concern of President Lopez. The other column would then capture Corrientes, distracting Argentine forces and creating a lifeline between Paraguay and the Atlantic Ocean. This plan was later revised so that two-thirds of the assault force would attack Corrientes and later divert southeast and invade Uruguay.\n\nIn response, a military [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|alliance]] was signed on 1 May among Argentina, Uruguay and the Empire of Brazil.\n\nFollowing the successful capture of Corrientes, Argentine Gen. [[Wenceslao Paunero]] launched a daring attack&nbsp;\u2013 on 25 May&nbsp;\u2013 that recaptured the city. However, given the enormous numerical superiority of the enemy, he chose to evacuate the city and its civilians two days later and head to the southwest of the province. Only after having evacuated Corrientes did Paunero learn that the Paraguayans were making progress on the Uruguay River.<ref name=Hooker/>{{rp|31}}\n\nArgentine President [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] put Gen. [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza|Urquiza]], governor of the [[province of Entre R\u00edos]], in charge of facing the Paraguayan column. Urquiza called on his aid Paunero, who had retreated to [[Esquina (Corrientes)|Esquina]]. These forces were joined by a battalion of volunteers from Corrientes, led by Col. [[Desiderio Sosa]], who had participated in the reconquest of Corrientes. Many future heroes of the [[History of Corrientes Province]] such as [[Santiago Baibiene]] and [[Pl\u00e1cido Mart\u00ednez]], were in that battalion.<ref>Castello, Antonio Emilio, ''Historia de Corrientes'', Ed.

Duarte took the city of [[Santo Tom\u00e9 (Corrientes)|Santo Tome]] Estigarribia's forces followed up and met him there four days latter. The army then crossed the Uruguay River and entered the province of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], Empire of Brazil. They left behind them the column of Duarte, with more than 3,000 soldiers to defend Uruguay.\n\n[[File:GUERRE DE L'AM\u00c9RIQUE DU SUD. - COMBAT DE SAM-BORJA (10 juin 1865); le 1\u00ba bataillon de volontaires br\u00e9siliens def\u00e9ndants son drapeau contre les Paraguayens. - D'apr\u00e8s un croquis de M.

On June 4 the troops of Urquiza, who refused to fight the Paraguayans on the grounds of being considered allies against Brazil (which Argentina had frayed relations with), were disbanded.\n\nUruguayan President Gen. [[Venancio Flores]], fresh from his triumph over the [[National Party (Uruguay)|white party]] or \"blancos\", marched to join Urquiza with 2,750 men. In addition, the Brazilian forces, commanded by Lt. Col. [[Joaquim Rodrigues Coelho Nelly]], totaling 1,200 men, were heading their way. They met on July 13. At the first meeting Flores was given the Line Cavalry Regiment \"San Mart\u00edn\", with 450 men, plus the artillery squadron East with 140 men. In total, Flores had 4,540 troops\u2014not nearly enough to confront the Paraguayan columns.\n\nFlores, Duarte and Estigarribia marched slowly to meet and engage in battle, while Paunero's 3,600 men began a march through swamps and rivers, swiftly crossing the southern province of Entre Rios to join Flores. In addition, 1,400 of Correntina cavalry under Gen. [[Juan Madariaga]] joined their forces. Finally, Col. [[Simeon Paiva]], with 1,200 men, followed closely by the column of Duarte.\n\nEstigarribia had a chance to destroy all his enemies one by one, but missed. He also disobeyed orders from Lopez, who ordered him to continue on his way to [[Alegrete]]:<ref>Rosa, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, ''La guerra del Paraguay y las montoneras argentinas'', Ed.

[[David Canabarro]], too few to attack the column of 5,000 men of Estigarribia, were limited to camp near the city without being attacked by the Paraguayans.\n\nOn August 2 Duarte occupied the village of San Jos\u00e9 de Restoration, now the town of [[Paso de los Libres]]. A week later he advanced and was defeated, suffering 20 casualties in the Battle of Chap Kish. Given the news that all enemy forces were in pursuit, Duarte sought help from his superior, Gen.

Duarte moved away from Paso de los Libres and took positions on the banks of the [[stream Yatay]], near the village.\n\nThere was a brief encounter on the afternoon of August 16, and at dusk the two armies were facing each other from a half-mile off.\n\n== Battle ==\n\n[[File:Batalha do Yatay a 17 de agosto de 1865 dada na planura do Yatay.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the Battle of Yatay.]]\n\nBoth the Yatay and Uruguay rivers had recently flooded, leaving much of the battlefield underwater. Most Paraguayan infantry forces were entrenched among trees and ditches in the area of the nearby village estates and protected by mud that covered the frontal approach, but the stream behind them made it impossible to retreat in case of a defeat, which was considered very likely by Duarte.<ref>Zenequelli, Lilia, op. cit.</ref>\n\nDuarte's forces consisted of 1,980 infantry and 1,020 cavalry,<ref>Zenequelli, op. cit., afirma que contaba en total con 3.200 hombres.</ref> with no artillery. The Allies had a total of 5,550 infantry, 5,000 cavalry and 32 pieces of artillery.

Duarte seized the opportunity and countered with almost all his cavalry, causing hundreds of casualties and forcing them to retreat. Faced with an increasingly bad situation, the cavalry division of Segovia attacked the Paraguayan cavalry, supported by Castro's eastern and Suarez. For two hours the battle was fought exclusively with cavalry.\n\nDuarte ordered a withdrawal maneuver, which finally enabled the allied infantry to go into action, and although their (the allies) numerical superiority was overwhelming, the Paraguayans fought with tenacity. When the battle was almost lost, Duarte tried a desperate cavalry charge, and in the fight his horse was killed. Paunero himself demanded that Duarte surrender, which he finally agreed to do.\n\nA final Paraguayan force of infantry under Lt. Zorrilla crossed the Yatay stream and was attacked by a cavalry unit of Suarez and Madariaga, who attacked from the rear. A few hundred Paraguayan soldiers swam the Uruguay River, while the rest were killed or taken prisoner. In total they suffered 1.500 dead<ref>Rosa, en ''La Guerra del Paraguay...'', basado en fuentes brasile\u00f1as, asegura que tuvieron 1.700 muertos; tal vez sumase los 200 uruguayos y argentinos tomados prisioneros, y de los que buena parte fueron fusilados a posteriori por Flores, pero dif\u00edcilmente lo hayan sido en su totalidad.</ref> and 1,600 prisoners, including 300 wounded.\n\n== Consequences ==\n\n[[File:C\u00e1ndido L\u00f3pez - Soldados paraguayos heridos prisioneros de la batalla de Yatay.jpg|thumb|300px|Paraguayan soldiers, wounded prisoners of the Battle of Yatai.]]\n\nAmong the prisoners, Flores found several dozen soldiers from the Uruguayan Blanco Party, supporters who had taken refuge in Paraguay who tried to wrest power in Uruguay from the hands of Flores' forces. He ordered their execution as traitors.<ref>Also ordered the execution of some soldiers [[Federales (Argentina)|federal]] Argentines, not recognized national authority Mitre, who had won three years ago by a rebellion against the [[Confederation Argentina]]. Gavier Diaz, op. cit., p. 38.</ref>\n\nOn September 18, after having assured the representatives of the Brazilian [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor]] that he would not surrender and would rather be buried under the rubble of Uruguay, Gen. Estigarribia surrendered with little resistance.\n\nSoon afterwards, the Paraguayan forces occupying the abandoned city of Corrientes retreated to the north, and soon moved on to Paraguay. Almost all of the war following was fought in Paraguayan territory until the country's complete defeat in 1870, which resulted in the loss of 70% of the country's adult male population.\n\nA street in the city of [[Buenos Aires]], in the district of [[Caballito (Buenos Aires)|Caballito]], is named after this battle.<ref>Canido Borges, Jorge Oscar,''Buenos Aires, the unknown; its streets, plazas and monuments,''Ed Corregidor, Buenos Aires, 2003. {{ISBN|978-950-05-1493-4}}</ref>\n\n== Sources ==\n\n=== Main Bibliography ===\n\n* Giorgio, Dante A., ''Yatay, la primera sangre'', Revista Todo es Historia, Nro. 445, Bs.
