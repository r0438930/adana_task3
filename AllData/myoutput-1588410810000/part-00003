In 1850, he was convicted of murder in the [[Parkman\u2013Webster murder case]] and hanged.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], Webster was from a well-connected family: his grandfather was a successful merchant; his mother, Hannah (White) Webster, was a Leverett;{{clarify|date=January 2020}} his wife's sister married into the Prescotts;{{who|date=January 2020}} he was friends with the Shaws;{{who|date=January 2020}}, and his [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] pastor was the Reverend Francis Parkman Sr. (brother of [[George Parkman|George]]). Webster, indulged as a child and pampered in youth, had a petulant and fussy disposition, but was known for his kindly nature.<ref>''DAB''</ref>\n\nHe graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1811. In 1814, he was among the founders of the [[Linnaean Society of New England]], and was appointed cabinet-keeper of the society's quickly growing collection of specimens in Joy's Buildings in Boston.<ref>Augustus Addison Gould.

At [[Guy's Hospital]], he was a surgeon\u2019s pupil, a physician\u2019s pupil, and a surgeon's dresser. He then went to [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island]] in the [[Azores]] (1817\u201318). There, he practiced medicine; published his first book; and met the daughter of the American vice-consul on the island, Harriet Fredrica Hickling, whom he married on May 16, 1818, with whom he fathered four daughters. After returning to Boston, he entered private medical practice, but a lack of success prompted him to change careers.

In Boston he lived on [[Tremont Street|Common Street]].<ref>Boston Directory. 1823</ref>\n\nWebster was a popular lecturer at Harvard Medical College. Webster was described by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.]] as \"pleasant in the lecture room, rather nervous and excitable.\"<ref>Cohen, I. Bernard, 1950, Some Early Tools of American Science. An Account of the Early Scientific Instruments and Mineralogical and Biological Collections in Harvard University, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, pp 201</ref> Many of Webster's class-room demonstrations involved some of the latest chemical discoveries. Cohen (1950) particularly noted Webster's demonstrating [[Michael Faraday]]'s liquefaction of the common gasses and Webster even made solid carbon dioxide among his demonstrations. [[Edward Everett Hale]] reminisced about the student-based Davy Club at Harvard: \"Dr. Webster... gave us the most good-natured and kindly assistance.\"<ref>Hale, Edward Everett, 1927, A New England Boyhood, new edition, Grosset and Dunlap, New York, pp. 208</ref> [[George Frisbie Hoar|George F. Hoar]] mentioned that Webster's lectures were \"tedious\", at least for a non-chemistry major, but that: \"[Webster] was known to the students by the sobriquet of Sky-rocket jack, owing to his great interest in having some fireworks at the illumination when President Everett, his former classmate, was inaugurated. There was no person less likely to commit such a bloody and cruel crime as that for which he was accused.\"<ref>Hoar, George, F., 1905, Autobiography of Seventy Years, v. 1, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, p. 101.</ref> Many anecdotes suggest his class-room demonstrations were livened by pyrotechnic drama, although on one occasion the President of Harvard warned that some of them were dangerous if an accident occurred.\n\nReports written after the trial criticized his teaching ability: for instance, ''The Boston Daily Bee'' described him as \"tolerated rather than respected, and has only retained his position on account of its comparative insignificance. As a lecturer he was dull and common-place and while the students took tickets to his lectures, they did not generally attend them.\"\n\nWebster had financial problems. The family had been forced to give up a mansion he had built in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], although they were leasing a respectable but not grand house in 1849. He was in debt to a number of friends, as his salary and meager lecture earnings could not cover his expenses.\n\n[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] attested to his macabre streak in an anecdote relating how at one dinner at the Webster home, the host amazed his guests by lowering the lights, fitting a noose around his own neck, and lolling his head forward, tongue protruding, over a bowl of blazing chemicals, to give a ghastly imitation of a man being hanged.<ref>Annie A. Fields, ''Memories of a Hostess'', 1922, p. 153</ref>\n\nHe wrote ''A Description of the Island of St. Michael'' (1821), was associate editor of the ''Boston Journal of Philosophy and the Arts'' (1824\u201326), compiled ''A Manual of Chemistry'' (1826), and brought out editions of Andrew Fyfe's ''Elements of Chemistry'' (1827) and [[Justus von Liebig]]'s ''Animal Chemistry or Organic Chemistry'' (1841).

After an investigation, Dr. John White Webster was accused of the murder on January 26, 1850. The murder trial was the 19th century equivalent of the \"Case of the Century\" and has been widely cited as one of the earliest uses of forensic evidence to identify a body.  As the remains had been partially cremated, dental evidence and bone fragments were used to verify that they were Dr. Parkman's.<ref>King, Vandall T., 2006, Mineralogy and Chemistry at Harvard 1800-1865: In Search of John White Webster - an Innocent Man, Journal of the Geoliterary Society, volume 21 (#2): pp. 5\u201324</ref> The case was widely publicized in newspapers, particularly as Webster was also a professor at Harvard University. Webster was known to be in debt to Parkman and there had been arguments when Parkman pressed Webster for money.\n\nAfter a lengthy trial, where, under current Massachusetts law, Webster could not testify in his own defense, the jury was instructed by the principal judge, a close relative of the victim, that they \"Must come back with a guilty verdict.\" <ref>Sullivan, Robert, 1971, ''The Disappearance of Dr. Parkman'', Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, pp. 241</ref> The judge also issued one of the first ever \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instructions to the jury, however. The most important factor about the case is that a great body of documentary testimony was either not used by Webster's lawyers or was denied admission into his defense. Helen Thomson  wrote utilizing mostly the extensively re-written court testimony and newspaper accounts.<ref>Thomson, Helen, 1971, ''Murder at Harvard'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, p. 318.</ref> Her book partially perpetuated the notion that Webster was guilty, although, she too had reservations about the testimony and verdict. Robert Sullivan, the chief criminal prosecutor for the State of Massachusetts, reviewed the entire documentary records of the Webster case and was convinced that Webster was innocent and that the murderer was actually Webster's accuser, Ephraim Littlefield: \"The verdict not only was unwarranted, but appears to have been unduly guided by the judge's charge to the jury.\"<ref>D.
