Demographic studies had tended to assert that the [[Arab]] population of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled Palestine, a 94% majority at the turn of the century, had dwindled toward parity due to massive [[Zionist]] immigration. Peters radically challenged this picture by arguing that a substantial part of the Palestinian people were descended from immigrants from other Arab countries from the early 19th century onward. It followed, for Peters and many of her readers, that the picture of a native Palestinian population overwhelmed by Jewish immigration was little more than propaganda, and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n''From Time Immemorial'' was praised by figures as varied as [[Barbara Tuchman]], [[Theodore H.

He misrepresents Chicago here, where \"the original\" means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is, in this instance, Peters.\n\nNow look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point ellipsis. As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage (\"To cite a source from a secondary source...\") occurs on page 727, which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the ellipsis, in a section titled \"Citations Taken from Secondary Sources.\" Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in bold: \"'Quoted in'. To cite a source from a secondary source (\"quoted in\") is generally to be discouraged, '''since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite. If an original source is unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must be listed.'''\"\n\nSo Chicago is clearly insisting that unless Dershowitz went to the originals, he was obliged to cite Peters.

You can't reach a broad public if you are agnostic on the question of Israel. The broad public wants to know, where do you stand? And if you claim not to have a stand, you lose them. The BDS movement, it always says, and I'm using their language, \"We are a rights-based organization. We are based in international law.\" I agree with that. That's where you have to go: rights-based international law. But the international law is clear. You read the last sentence of the 2004 International Court of Justice opinion on the wall that Israel has been building in the West Bank, and the last sentence says, \"We look forward to two states: a Palestinian state alongside Israel and at peace with its neighbors.\" That's the law.<br>And if you want to go past that law or ignore the Israel part, you'll never reach a broad public.

Peters's \"history and defense\" of Israel deals with the demographic history of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Demographic studies had tended to assert that the [[Arab]] population of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled Palestine, a 94% majority at the turn of the century, had dwindled toward parity due to massive [[Zionist]] immigration. Peters radically challenged this picture by arguing that a substantial part of the Palestinian people were descended from immigrants from other Arab countries from the early 19th century onward. It followed, for Peters and many of her readers, that the picture of a native Palestinian population overwhelmed by Jewish immigration was little more than propaganda, and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n''From Time Immemorial'' was praised by figures as varied as [[Barbara Tuchman]], [[Theodore H.

He misrepresents Chicago here, where \"the original\" means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is, in this instance, Peters.\n\nNow look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point ellipsis. As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage (\"To cite a source from a secondary source...\") occurs on page 727, which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the ellipsis, in a section titled \"Citations Taken from Secondary Sources.\" Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in bold: \"'Quoted in'. To cite a source from a secondary source (\"quoted in\") is generally to be discouraged, '''since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite. If an original source is unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must be listed.'''\"\n\nSo Chicago is clearly insisting that unless Dershowitz went to the originals, he was obliged to cite Peters. Finkelstein has conclusively demonstrated that he didn't go to the originals.

Who could not support Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions? Of course you should. And most of the human rights organizations, church organizations have moved in that direction. The problem is the goal . . . The official BDS movement, they claim to be agnostic, neutral\u2014whatever term you want to use\u2014on the question of Israel. You can't reach a broad public if you are agnostic on the question of Israel. The broad public wants to know, where do you stand? And if you claim not to have a stand, you lose them. The BDS movement, it always says, and I'm using their language, \"We are a rights-based organization. We are based in international law.\" I agree with that. That's where you have to go: rights-based international law. But the international law is clear. You read the last sentence of the 2004 International Court of Justice opinion on the wall that Israel has been building in the West Bank, and the last sentence says, \"We look forward to two states: a Palestinian state alongside Israel and at peace with its neighbors.\" That's the law.<br>And if you want to go past that law or ignore the Israel part, you'll never reach a broad public. And then it's a cult. Then it's pointless, in my opinion. We're wasting time. And it's only a wasting of time. It becomes\u2014and I know it's a strong word, and I hope I won't be faulted for it\u2014but it becomes historically criminal, because there was a time where whatever we said, it made no difference. Nobody was listening. You could shout whatever you want\u2014who cares? But now, actually, we can reach people. There is a possibility. I'm not saying a certainty. I'm not even saying a probability. But there is a possibility that we can reach a broad public. And so we have to be very careful about the words we use, and we have to be very careful about the political strategy we map out.
