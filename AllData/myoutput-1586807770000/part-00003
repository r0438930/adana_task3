Six [[U.S. Army]] soldiers who [[Great Locomotive Chase|hijacked]] a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[locomotive]] named [[The General (locomotive)|''The General'']] in 1862 were the first [[Medal of Honor recipients]];<ref name=\"MWxvii\">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xvii}}</ref> [[James J.

Many Medals of Honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with \"saving the flag\" (and country), not just for patriotic reasons, but because the [[U.S. flag]] was a primary means of battlefield communication at the time. Because no other military decoration was authorized during the Civil War, some seemingly less exceptional and notable actions were recognized by a Medal of Honor during that conflict.\n* 20th century: Early in the twentieth century, the Department of the Navy awarded many Medals of Honor for peacetime bravery. For instance, in 1901, [[John Henry Helms]] aboard {{USS|Chicago|CA-14|6}} was awarded the medal for saving the ship's cook from drowning. Seven sailors aboard {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|6}} were awarded the medal after the ship's boiler exploded on January 25, 1904.

Six [[U.S. Army]] soldiers who [[Great Locomotive Chase|hijacked]] a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[locomotive]] named [[The General (locomotive)|''The General'']] in 1862 were the first [[Medal of Honor recipients]];<ref name=\"MWxvii\">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xvii}}</ref> [[James J. Andrews]] led the raid. He was caught and hanged as a U.S. spy, but as a civilian, he was not eligible to receive the medal. Many Medals of Honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with \"saving the flag\" (and country), not just for patriotic reasons, but because the [[U.S. flag]] was a primary means of battlefield communication at the time. Because no other military decoration was authorized during the Civil War, some seemingly less exceptional and notable actions were recognized by a Medal of Honor during that conflict.\n* 20th century: Early in the twentieth century, the Department of the Navy awarded many Medals of Honor for peacetime bravery. For instance, in 1901, [[John Henry Helms]] aboard {{USS|Chicago|CA-14|6}} was awarded the medal for saving the ship's cook from drowning. Seven sailors aboard {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|6}} were awarded the medal after the ship's boiler exploded on January 25, 1904.

In an Act of Congress of July 9, 1918, the War Department version of the medal required that the recipient \"distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty\", and also required that the act of valor be performed \"in action involving actual conflict with an enemy\".<ref name=\"Act of July 9, 1918, 40 Stat. 870\">Act of July 9, 1918, 40 Stat. 870.</ref> This followed shortly after the results of the Army Medal of Honor Review Board, which struck 911 medals from the Medal of Honor list in February 1917 for lack of basic prerequisites.<ref name=\"Mears, The Medal of Honor, 53\"/> These included the members of the 27th Maine erroneously awarded the medal for reenlisting to guard the capital during the Civil War, 29 members of Abraham Lincoln's funeral detail, and six civilians, including [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] (restored along with four other scouts in 1989)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/09/us/buffalo-bill-s-medal-restored.html|title=Buffalo Bill's Medal Restored|date=9 July 1989|website=The New York Times|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> and [[Mary Edwards Walker]] (though the latter's was restored posthumously in 1977).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmohs.org/medal-history.php |title=History of the Medal of Honor |publisher=CMOHS.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref>\n* World War II: As a result of lawsuits, the Department of the Navy requested the Congress expressly authorize non-combat medals in the text of the authorizing statute, since the Navy Department had been awarding non-combat medals with questionable legal backing that had caused it much embarrassment.<ref>Mears, The Medal of Honor, 94</ref> The last non-combat Navy Medal of Honor was awarded in 1945, although the Department of the Navy attempted to award a non-combat Medal of Honor as late as the Korean War.<ref>Mears, The Medal of Honor, 97\u201398</ref> Official accounts vary, but generally, the Medal of Honor for combat was known as the \"Tiffany Cross\", after [[Tiffany & Co.|the company that designed the medal]].

The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with the men who had returned earlier. Since there seemed to be no official list of the 311 volunteers, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.<ref name=\"MWxix\">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xix}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916, a board of five Army generals on the retired list convened under act of law to review every Army Medal of Honor awarded.
