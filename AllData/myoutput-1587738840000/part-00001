Per [[WP:ENGVAR]] and agreement at [[WP:FAC]], this article will refer to the club in the singular and the team in plural--> is a professional [[association football]] club based in the town of [[Luton]], Bedfordshire, England, that competes in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], the second tier of the [[English football league system]]. Founded in 1885, it is nicknamed 'the Hatters' and affiliated to the [[Bedfordshire County Football Association]]. The team plays its home matches at [[Kenilworth Road]], where it has been based since 1905. The club's history includes major trophy wins, several financial crises, numerous [[Promotion and relegation|promotions and relegations]], and some spells of sustained success. It was perhaps most prominent between 1982 and 1992, when it was a member of English football's top division, at that time the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]; the team won its only major honour, the [[Football League Cup]], in 1988.\n\nThe club was the first in southern England to turn professional, making payments to players as early as 1890 and turning fully professional a year later. It joined [[English Football League|the Football League]] before the [[1897\u201398 Football League|1897\u201398 season]], left in 1900 because of financial problems, and rejoined in 1920. Luton reached the First Division in [[1955\u201356 in English football|1955\u201356]] and contested a major final for the first time when playing [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[1959 FA Cup Final]]. The team was then relegated from the top division in [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]], and demoted twice more in the following five years, playing in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] from the [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366 season]]. However, it was promoted back to the top level by [[1974\u201375 Luton Town F.C. season|1974\u201375]].\n\nLuton Town's most recent successful period began in [[1981\u201382 Football League|1981\u201382]], when the club won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], and thereby gained promotion to the First. Luton defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3\u20132 in the [[1988 Football League Cup Final]] and remained in the First Division until relegation at the end of the [[1991\u201392 Luton Town F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]]. Between 2007 and 2009, financial difficulties caused the club to fall from the second tier of English football to the fifth in successive seasons. The last of these relegations came during the [[2008\u201309 Luton Town F.C. season|2008\u201309 season]], when 30 points were docked from Luton's record for various financial irregularities. Luton thereafter spent five seasons in [[non-League football]] before winning the [[Conference Premier]] in [[2013\u201314 Luton Town F.C. season|2013\u201314]], securing promotion back into the Football League.\n\n==History==\n{{details|History of Luton Town F.C.

A Wanderers player, George Deacon, came up with the idea of a 'Town' club which would include all the best players in Luton. Wanderers secretary Herbert Spratley seized upon Deacon's idea and arranged a secret meeting on 13 January 1885 at the St Matthews school rooms in [[High Town, Luton|High Town]]. The Wanderers committee resolved to rename the club Luton Town\u2014which was not well received by the wider community. The local newspapers referred to the club as 'Luton Town (late Wanderers)'. When George Deacon and John Charles Lomax then arranged a public meeting with the purpose of forming a 'Luton Town Football Club', Spratley protested, saying there was already a Luton Town club; and the atmosphere was tense when the meeting convened in the town hall on 11 April 1885. The meeting, attended by most football lovers in the town, heard about Spratley's secret January meeting and voted down his objections. The motion to form a 'Luton Town Football Club', put forward by G&nbsp;H Small and seconded by E&nbsp;H Lomax, was carried. A club committee was elected by ballot and the team colours were agreed to be pink and dark blue shirts and caps.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter Six \u2013 11th April 1885 |url=http://thestrawplaiters.com/chapter-6-11th-april-1885/ |work=Straw Plaiters: Luton Town Football Club in the Victorian era |publisher=Brian Webb |accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nInitially based at Excelsior's [[Dallow Lane]] ground,<ref name=Hayes55/> Luton Town began making payments to certain individual players in 1890.

These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white at the start of the [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374 season]]. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984.

The club's first badge was a white eight-pointed star, which was emblazoned across the team's shirts (then a deep [[cochineal]] red) in 1892. Four years later a crest comprising the club's initials intertwined was briefly adopted. The shirts were thereafter plain until 1933, when Luton first adopted a badge depicting a straw boater, which appeared on Luton shirts. The letters \"LTFC\" were added in 1935, and this basic design remained until 1947. The club then played without a badge until 1970, when the club began to wear the town crest regularly, having first done so in the 1959 FA Cup Final.<ref name=papbadge>{{cite book |title=The Hatters: Passion and Pride since 1885 |chapter=The Badge |year=2011 |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |location=Luton |page=112}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, concurrently with the club's switch to the orange kit, a new badge was introduced featuring the new colours.

Per [[WP:ENGVAR]] and agreement at [[WP:FAC]], this article will refer to the club in the singular and the team in plural--> is a professional [[association football]] club based in the town of [[Luton]], Bedfordshire, England, that competes in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], the second tier of the [[English football league system]]. Founded in 1885, it is nicknamed 'the Hatters' and affiliated to the [[Bedfordshire County Football Association]]. The team plays its home matches at [[Kenilworth Road]], where it has been based since 1905. The club's history includes major trophy wins, several financial crises, numerous [[Promotion and relegation|promotions and relegations]], and some spells of sustained success. It was perhaps most prominent between 1982 and 1992, when it was a member of English football's top division, at that time the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]; the team won its only major honour, the [[Football League Cup]], in 1988.\n\nThe club was the first in southern England to turn professional, making payments to players as early as 1890 and turning fully professional a year later. It joined [[English Football League|the Football League]] before the [[1897\u201398 Football League|1897\u201398 season]], left in 1900 because of financial problems, and rejoined in 1920. Luton reached the First Division in [[1955\u201356 in English football|1955\u201356]] and contested a major final for the first time when playing [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[1959 FA Cup Final]]. The team was then relegated from the top division in [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]], and demoted twice more in the following five years, playing in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] from the [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366 season]]. However, it was promoted back to the top level by [[1974\u201375 Luton Town F.C. season|1974\u201375]].\n\nLuton Town's most recent successful period began in [[1981\u201382 Football League|1981\u201382]], when the club won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], and thereby gained promotion to the First. Luton defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3\u20132 in the [[1988 Football League Cup Final]] and remained in the First Division until relegation at the end of the [[1991\u201392 Luton Town F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]]. Between 2007 and 2009, financial difficulties caused the club to fall from the second tier of English football to the fifth in successive seasons. The last of these relegations came during the [[2008\u201309 Luton Town F.C. season|2008\u201309 season]], when 30 points were docked from Luton's record for various financial irregularities. Luton thereafter spent five seasons in [[non-League football]] before winning the [[Conference Premier]] in [[2013\u201314 Luton Town F.C. season|2013\u201314]], securing promotion back into the Football League.\n\n==History==\n{{details|History of Luton Town F.C.

A Wanderers player, George Deacon, came up with the idea of a 'Town' club which would include all the best players in Luton. Wanderers secretary Herbert Spratley seized upon Deacon's idea and arranged a secret meeting on 13 January 1885 at the St Matthews school rooms in [[High Town, Luton|High Town]]. The Wanderers committee resolved to rename the club Luton Town\u2014which was not well received by the wider community. The local newspapers referred to the club as 'Luton Town (late Wanderers)'. When George Deacon and John Charles Lomax then arranged a public meeting with the purpose of forming a 'Luton Town Football Club', Spratley protested, saying there was already a Luton Town club; and the atmosphere was tense when the meeting convened in the town hall on 11 April 1885. The meeting, attended by most football lovers in the town, heard about Spratley's secret January meeting and voted down his objections. The motion to form a 'Luton Town Football Club', put forward by G&nbsp;H Small and seconded by E&nbsp;H Lomax, was carried. A club committee was elected by ballot and the team colours were agreed to be pink and dark blue shirts and caps.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter Six \u2013 11th April 1885 |url=http://thestrawplaiters.com/chapter-6-11th-april-1885/ |work=Straw Plaiters: Luton Town Football Club in the Victorian era |publisher=Brian Webb |accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nInitially based at Excelsior's [[Dallow Lane]] ground,<ref name=Hayes55/> Luton Town began making payments to certain individual players in 1890.

The club's first badge was a white eight-pointed star, which was emblazoned across the team's shirts (then a deep [[cochineal]] red) in 1892. Four years later a crest comprising the club's initials intertwined was briefly adopted. The shirts were thereafter plain until 1933, when Luton first adopted a badge depicting a straw boater, which appeared on Luton shirts. The letters \"LTFC\" were added in 1935, and this basic design remained until 1947. The club then played without a badge until 1970, when the club began to wear the town crest regularly, having first done so in the 1959 FA Cup Final.<ref name=papbadge>{{cite book |title=The Hatters: Passion and Pride since 1885 |chapter=The Badge |year=2011 |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |location=Luton |page=112}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, concurrently with the club's switch to the orange kit, a new badge was introduced featuring the new colours. The new emblem depicted a stylised orange football, bearing the letters \"Lt\", surrounded by the club's name in navy blue text.<ref name=papbadge/> In 1987, the club switched back to a derivative of the town emblem, with the shield portion of the heraldic crest becoming the team's badge; the only similarity with the previous design was the inclusion of the club name around the shield in navy blue. The \"rainbow\" badge, introduced in 1994, featured the town crest below an orange and blue bow which curved around to meet two footballs, positioned on either side of the shield, with the club name underneath.<ref name=papbadge/> This badge was used until 2005, when a replacement very similar to the 1987 version was adopted, featuring black text rather than blue and a straw boater in place of the outstretched arm depicted in the older design.
