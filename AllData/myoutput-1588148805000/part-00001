With a growing popularity, they record in 1994, a first track \"Boul Faale\" (\"Don't worry\") in which they denounce the local corruption of the political system. This track became part of their first album, \"Salaam\" released in 1995 after a European tour and signed under the label, Island Records. During fourteen years, PBS had multiple international collaborations (KRS-One, Mc Solaar, Princess Erika, K-Mel, Kimani Marley, etc.) and toured worldwide while releasing K7 and CD in Senegal and internationally.
