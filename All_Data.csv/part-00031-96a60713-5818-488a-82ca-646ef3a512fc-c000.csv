[[File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg|thumb|Computer forensics analysis is not limited only to computer media]]

'''Computer forensics''' (also known as '''computer forensic science'''<ref name=\"noblett\"/>) is a branch of [[digital forensics|digital forensic science]] pertaining to evidence found in computers and digital [[storage media]]. The goal of computer forensics is to examine digital media in a forensically sound manner with the aim of identifying, preserving, recovering, analyzing and presenting facts and opinions about the digital information.

Although it is most often associated  with the investigation of a wide variety of [[computer crime]], computer forensics may also be used in civil proceedings. The discipline involves similar techniques and principles to [[data recovery]], but with additional guidelines and practices designed to create a legal [[audit trail]].

Evidence from computer forensics investigations is usually subjected to the same guidelines and practices of other digital evidence. It has been used in a number of high-profile cases and is becoming widely accepted as reliable within U.S. and European court systems.

==Overview==
In the early 1980s personal computers became more accessible to consumers, leading to their increased use in criminal activity (for example, to help commit [[fraud]]). At the same time, several new \"computer crimes\" were recognized (such as [[Software cracking|cracking]]). The discipline of computer forensics emerged during this time as a method to recover and investigate [[digital evidence]] for use in court. Since then computer crime and computer related crime has grown, and has jumped 67% between 2002 and 2003.<ref name=leigland />  Today it is used to investigate a wide variety of crime, including [[child pornography]], fraud, [[espionage]], [[cyberstalking]], murder and rape. The discipline also features in civil proceedings as a form of information gathering (for example, [[Electronic discovery]])

Forensic techniques and expert knowledge are used to explain the current state of a ''digital artifact'', such as a computer system, storage medium (e.g. [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] or [[CD-ROM]]), or an [[electronic document]] (e.g. an email message or JPEG image).<ref name=\"cf-education\"/> The scope of a forensic analysis can vary from simple [[information retrieval]] to reconstructing a series of events. In a 2002 book, ''Computer Forensics'', authors Kruse and Heiser define computer forensics as involving \"the preservation, identification, extraction, documentation and interpretation of computer data\".<ref name=\"kruse\" /> They go on to describe the discipline as \"more of an art than a science\", indicating that forensic methodology is backed by flexibility and extensive domain knowledge. However, while several methods can be used to extract evidence from a given computer the strategies used by law enforcement are fairly rigid and lack the flexibility found in the civilian world.<ref name=gunsch />

==Use as evidence==
In court, computer forensic evidence is subject to the usual requirements for [[digital evidence]]. This requires that information be authentic, reliably obtained, and admissible.<ref name=\"theadam\" /> Different countries have specific guidelines and practices for evidence recovery. In the [[United Kingdom]], examiners often follow [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] guidelines that help ensure the authenticity and integrity of evidence. While voluntary, the guidelines are widely accepted in British courts.

Computer forensics has been used as evidence in [[criminal law]] since the mid-1980s, some notable examples include:<ref name=\"casey\" />
* BTK Killer: [[Dennis Rader]] was convicted of a string of serial killings that occurred over a period of sixteen years. Towards the end of this period, Rader sent letters to the police on a floppy disk. [[Metadata]] within the documents implicated an author named \"Dennis\" at \"Christ Lutheran Church\"; this evidence helped lead to Rader's arrest.
* [[Joseph E. Duncan III]]: A spreadsheet recovered from Duncan's computer contained evidence that showed him planning his crimes. Prosecutors used this to show [[Premeditated murder|premeditation]] and secure the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].<ref name=\"handbook\" />
* [[Sharon Lopatka]]: Hundreds of emails on Lopatka's computer lead investigators to her killer, Robert Glass.<ref name=\"casey\" />
* [[Einstein and Boyd v 357 LLC and the Corcoran Group, et al.|Corcoran Group]]: This case confirmed parties' duties to preserve [[digital evidence]] when [[litigation]] has commenced or is reasonably anticipated. Hard drives were analyzed by a computer forensics expert who could not find relevant emails the Defendants should have had.  Though the expert found no evidence of deletion on the hard drives, evidence came out that the defendants were found to have intentionally destroyed emails, and misled and failed to disclose material facts to the plaintiffs and the court.
* [[Dr. Conrad Murray]]: Dr. Conrad Murray, the doctor of the deceased [[Michael Jackson]], was convicted partially by digital evidence on his computer.  This evidence included medical documentation showing lethal amounts of [[propofol]].

==Forensic process==
{{Main article|Digital forensic process}}
[[File:Portable forensic tableau.JPG|thumb|A portable Tableau write blocker attached to a [[Hard Drive]]]]

Computer forensic investigations usually follow the standard digital forensic process or phases which are acquisition, examination, analysis and reporting. Investigations are performed on static data (i.e. [[Disk imaging#Hard drive imaging|acquired images]]) rather than \"live\" systems. This is a change from early forensic practices where a lack of specialist tools led to investigators commonly working on live data.

===Techniques===
A number of techniques are used during computer forensics investigations and much has been written on the many techniques used by law enforcement in particular.

;Cross-drive analysis
: A forensic technique that correlates information found on multiple [[hard drive]]s. The process, still being researched, can be used to identify [[social networks]] and to perform [[anomaly detection]].<ref name=\"garfinkel\" /><ref name=\"nsf\" />

;Live analysis{{anchor|Live analysis}}
: The examination of computers from within the operating system using custom forensics or existing [[sysadmin tools]] to extract evidence. The practice is useful when dealing with [[Encrypting File System]]s, for example, where the encryption keys may be collected and, in some instances, the logical hard drive volume may be imaged (known as a live acquisition) before the computer is shut down.

;Deleted files
: A common technique used in computer forensics is the recovery of deleted files. Modern forensic software have their own tools for recovering or carving out deleted data.<ref name=\"exposed\" /> Most [[operating system]]s and [[file system]]s do not always erase physical file data, allowing investigators to reconstruct it from the physical [[disk sector]]s. [[File carving]] involves searching for known file headers within the disk image and reconstructing deleted materials.

;[[Stochastic forensics]]
:A method which uses [[stochastic]] properties of the computer system to investigate activities lacking digital artifacts. Its chief use is to investigate [[data theft]].

;[[Steganography]]
: One of the techniques used to hide data is via steganography, the process of hiding data inside of a picture or digital image. An example would be to hide [[child porn|pornographic images of children]] or other information that a given criminal does not want to have discovered. Computer forensics professionals can fight this by looking at the hash of the file and comparing it to the original image (if available.) While the image appears exactly the same, the hash changes as the data changes.<ref name=dunbar />

===Volatile data===
When seizing evidence, if the machine is still active, any information stored solely in [[Random access memory|RAM]] that is not recovered before powering down may be lost.<ref name=\"handbook\" /> One application of \"live analysis\" is to recover RAM data (for example, using Microsoft's [[COFEE]] tool, WinDD, [[WindowsSCOPE]]) prior to removing an exhibit.  CaptureGUARD Gateway bypasses Windows login for locked computers, allowing for the analysis and acquisition of physical memory on a locked computer.

RAM can be analyzed for prior content after power loss, because the electrical charge stored in the memory cells takes time to dissipate, an effect exploited by the [[cold boot attack]]. The length of time that data is recoverable is increased by low temperatures and higher cell voltages. Holding unpowered RAM below −60&nbsp;°C helps preserve residual data by an order of magnitude, improving the chances of successful recovery. However, it can be impractical to do this during a field examination.<ref name=\"ColdBoot\" />

Some of the tools needed to extract volatile data, however, require that a computer be in a forensic lab, both to maintain a legitimate chain of evidence, and to facilitate work on the machine. If necessary, law enforcement applies techniques to move a live, running desktop computer.  These include a [[mouse jiggler]], which moves the mouse rapidly in small movements and prevents the computer from going to sleep accidentally.  Usually, an [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) provides power during transit.

However, one of the easiest ways to capture data is by actually saving the RAM data to disk.  Various file systems that have journaling features such as [[NTFS]] and [[ReiserFS]] keep a large portion of the RAM data on the main storage media during operation, and these page files can be reassembled to reconstruct what was in RAM at that time.<ref name=geiger />

===Analysis tools===
{{see also|List of digital forensics tools}}

A number of open source and commercial tools exist for computer forensics investigation. Typical forensic analysis includes a manual review of material on the media, reviewing the Windows registry for suspect information, discovering and cracking passwords, keyword searches for topics related to the crime, and extracting e-mail and pictures for review.<ref name=\"casey\" />

==Certifications==
There are several computer forensics certifications available, such as the ISFCE Certified Computer Examiner, Digital Forensics Investigation Professional (DFIP) and IACRB Certified Computer Forensics Examiner.

The top ''vendor independent'' certification (especially within EU) is considered the ['''CCFP''' - Certified Cyber Forensics Professional [https://www.isc2.org/ccfp/default.aspx]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/ccfp.do |title=CCFP Salaries surveys |publisher=ITJobsWatch |date= |accessdate=2017-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119005256/http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/ccfp.do |archive-date=2017-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

'''Bad Homburg vor der Höhe''' is the district town of the [[Hochtaunuskreis]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], on the southern slope of the [[Taunus]] mountains. Bad Homburg is part of the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Regional Authority|Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area]]. The town's formal name is ''Bad Homburg vor der Höhe'' (translated as \"Bad Homburg before the Height\") to distinguish it from other places named Homburg. The name is abbreviated as ''Bad Homburg v. d. Höhe''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bad-homburg.de/vv/stadtrecht/10-1_Hauptsatzung-26-05-2011.pdf|title=Hauptsatzung der Stadt Bad Homburg v.d.

Presently, Bad Homburg is again one of the wealthiest towns in Germany (with the [[Hochtaunuskreis]] and the [[Starnberg (district)|Landkreis Starnberg]] regularly competing for the title of the wealthiest district in Germany).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gevestor.de/details/die-10-reichsten-staedte-und-landkreise-in-deutschland-799215.html|title=Die 10 reichsten Städte und Landkreise in Deutschland|trans-title=The 10 Richest Cities and Districts in Germany|website=gevestor.de|language=German|last=Gerginov|first=David|url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|2004}}, the town's marketing slogan is ''Champagnerluft und Tradition'' (Champagne air and tradition).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zeit.de/2017/29/bad-homburg-kurstadt-reichtum|title=Zwei Stunden in Bad Homburg|trans-title=Two Hours in Bad Homburg|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=2017-07-12|last=Hieronymi|first=Leonhard|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==

===Middle Ages origins===
Local tradition holds that Bad Homburg's documented history began with the mention of the ''Villa Tidenheim'' in the [[Lorsch codex]], associated with the year 782. This ''Villa Tidenheim'' was equated with the Old Town, named \"Dietigheim\". Local historian Rüdiger Kurth doubted this traditional story based on his study of written sources and local factors. During 2002 Kurth initiated [[Archaeology|archaeological]] excavations, by the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]], managed by Professor Joachim Henning. The excavations showed that there was not any evidence of settlement between the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and the 13th century. It seems that the historical record which mentions Wortwin (or Ortwin) von Hohenberch as Homburg's founder, as a documentary witness in Eberbach,<!--Is that the right way to translate \"in der Eberbacher Zeugenreihe\"? --> about 1180 is the first good evidence of the town's existence.
[[File:White Tower Bad Homburg Germany.JPG|thumb|left|White Tower, viewed from Loewengasse 7.]]

[[File:2007-09-16BadHomburgRussischeKapelle02.jpg|thumb|\"Russian Chapel\", or rather All Hallows' Church.]]

As early as 1962, in an excavation under the ''Hirschgangflügel'' (\"Hart-stalking-wing\") of Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' (stately home), two burnt layers were discovered, which the man conducting the dig, Günther Binding, accepted as evidence of two former [[castle]]s having been built on the site, one after the other, but each having burnt down later.

Further digs by the University of Frankfurt at Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' during April 2006, once again initiated by Kurth and managed by Professor Henning, resulted in the discovery that it was actually only one burnt layer, from a [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] building—- possibly a castle with towers—- which from [[ceramic]] finds could be dated to the 12th or 13th century. Most likely this building had an association with Wortwin's \"castle\". Quite possibly, though, a further cultural layer from an even earlier time lies underneath these remains. Investigations using methods from natural science ([[carbon-14 dating]] and [[wikt:micromorphological|micromorphological]] analysis) will show whether the dating can be made more precise.

Homberg acquired market rights about 1330, but the document granting these rights is said to have been lost.

The town's name, \"Homburg\", is from the ''Hohenberg'' Castle. The postfix \"vor der Höhe\" was probably first recorded in a document of 1399. The designation ''\"Bad\"'' was not conferred until 1912.

The Hessen-Homburg noble family of [[landgrave]]s was initiated by Friedrich I of Hessen-Homburg. Friedrich II (1680–1708) attained fame as Prince of Homburg. During 1866, as a result of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Homburg became [[Prussia]]n territory.

===Spa town and imperial residence===
With the beginning of the spa industry in the town during the mid-19th century, which profited greatly from its [[casino]], the town became an internationally famous spa town. Bad Homburg was favoured particularly by Russian nobility for its baths.

The spa industry began with the discovery of the ''Elisabethenbrunnen'' (''Brunnen'' is German for \"well\") during 1834. The first spa building and the first casino in Homburg were built during 1841–1842 by the brothers [[François Blanc|François]] (1806–1877) and Louis Blanc (1806–1852), who later owned the [[Monte Carlo Casino]]. During 1860, the town was connected with [[Frankfurt]] by a railway line, the ''[[Homburg Railway|Homburger Bahn]]''.

During 1888, Homburg became known throughout the [[German Empire]] because [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] declared Homburg's ''Schloss'' an Imperial summer residence, and later financed the building of the [[Church of the Redeemer, Bad Homburg|Church of the Redeemer (Erlöserkirche)]] nearby. His mother, too, lived there for several years. [[Edward VII]] of the UK was also often a guest. It was he who introduced the [[Homburg hat]] and permanent turn-up trousers. He also experienced fasting cures at Homburg 32 times.

The \"Bad Homburger Golf Club 1899 e. V.\" in the ''Röderweisen'' in Dornholzhausen—nowadays part of Bad Homburg—- is Germany's oldest [[Country club|golf club]]. It had its beginnings in the Bad Homburg Spa Park (''Kurpark''), where the old clubhouse and even playable parts of the old [[golf course]] may still be found.

Not far away stands the Russian Chapel—- more properly called All Hallows' Church—- an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] church the first stone of which was laid in the Russian Imperial couple's presence on 16 October 1896, although they did not attend when it was consecrated almost three years later<!---Yes, this contradicts the German article, but not the link in the German article.--->.

King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam (Thailand) sent a Thai garden pavilion in gratitude for a successful cure. It was erected during 1914.

[[Horex]] was a well known German motorcycle brand of the \"Horex—Fahrzeugbau AG\", founded during 1923 in Bad Homburg by Fritz Kleemann.

===Jewish history===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:Denkmal Samuel Agnon Bad Homburg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Memorial to [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] in Bad Homburg]]

During 1335, permission was given by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] to [[Lords of Eppstein|Gottfried von Eppstein]] to settle 10 Jews in each of the localities of [[Eppstein]], Homburg, and [[Steinheim (Hanau)|Steinheim]]; it is uncertain, however, whether any Jews settled in Homburg at that time. Evidence for the existence of a permanent Jewish settlement in Homburg is found only at the beginning of the 16th century. Until 1600 it consisted of 2 or 3 families, and by 1632 these had increased to 16. The first [[Jewish cemetery]] was purchased during the 17th century. The community continued to grow so rapidly that during 1703 the landgrave [[Frederick II of Hesse]] decided on the construction of a special [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Judengasse]] (Jewish quarter). A synagogue, built during 1731, was replaced by a new one during 1867. The Jewish community of Homburg was originally part of the jurisdiction of the rabbinate of [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] but began to appoint its own rabbis during the 19th century.

A [[Hebrew]] printing house was located in Homburg by Seligmann ben Hirz Reis during 1710 until 1713 when he relocated to [[Offenbach am Main]]. Among other items, he published [[Jacob ibn Ḥabib]]'s ''[[Ein Ya'akov]]'' (1712). Hebrew printing was resumed there during 1724 by Samson ben Salman Hanau but lack of capital limited his output. The press was acquired during 1736 by Aaron ben Ẓevi Dessau whose publications included the ''[[Shulhan Arukh]] ([[Choshen Mishpat|Ḥoshen Mishpat]])'' with commentary (1742). The press was sold during 1748 and transferred during 1749 to [[Roedelheim]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spa of Homburg became a meeting place of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] intellectuals. The Jewish population numbered 604 (7.14% of the total population) during 1865, declining to 379 in 1910 (2.64%), and 300 during 1933. Of the 74 Jews who remained on 17 May 1939, 42 were deported during 1942/1943.<ref>FJW, 215; ''[[Germania Judaica]]'', vol. 2 (1968), 369; PKG</ref>

===Modern age===
While the spa business experienced a long-term decrease after the two world wars, the town gained importance by becoming the site for headquarters of various authorities and administrative bodies. By autumn 1946, the military government had already ordered the founding of [[Bizone|bizonal]] authorities. Bad Homburg was chosen as the seat of the financial administrative centre. On 23 July 1947, the Bizone Economic Council instituted the \"Special Money and Credit Centre\" here in preparation for currency reform. The centre was managed by [[Ludwig Erhard]]. After the Federal Republic of Germany—- West Germany—- was founded with its capital in [[Bonn]], the Federal Debt Administration (''Bundesschuldenverwaltung''), the Office for Security Adjustment (''Amt für Wertpapierbereinigung'') and the Federal Equalization Office (''Bundesausgleichsamt'') stayed in Bad Homburg.

During the 20th century, Bad Homburg became a favourite residential area among the upper classes. On 30 November 1989, one of its members, [[Alfred Herrhausen]], the manager of the [[Deutsche Bank]], was killed and his driver was injured by a car bomb in Bad Homburg. It is alleged that this was an attack by the [[Red Army Faction]], though this has never been proven.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/herrhausen-mord-neue-theorie-ueber-die-herkunft-der-bombe-a-1005698.html|title=Herrhausen-Mord: Neue Theorie über die Herkunft der Bombe|trans-title=Herrhausen-Murder: New Theory Regarding Origin of the Bomb|publisher=Spiegel Online|language=German|date=2014-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Coat of arms==
Bad Homburg's civic coat of arms was granted during 1903 but is said to date from the 15th century on the basis of seals known from that time, although they show a [[saltire]] rather than the two [[adze]]s seen today (the saltire might be two unclear adzes). The reason for the adzes in the arms is not known; it is possibly dialectal [[Canting arms|canting]]. The colours, with silver adzes in a blue field, have been in use at least since 1621.<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/b/bad-homb.htm NGW.nl]</ref>

'''Bad Homburg vor der Höhe''' is the district town of the [[Hochtaunuskreis]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], on the southern slope of the [[Taunus]] mountains. Bad Homburg is part of the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Regional Authority|Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area]]. The town's formal name is ''Bad Homburg vor der Höhe'' (translated as \"Bad Homburg before the Height\") to distinguish it from other places named Homburg. The name is abbreviated as ''Bad Homburg v. d. Höhe''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bad-homburg.de/vv/stadtrecht/10-1_Hauptsatzung-26-05-2011.pdf|title=Hauptsatzung der Stadt Bad Homburg v.d.

Presently, Bad Homburg is again one of the wealthiest towns in Germany (with the [[Hochtaunuskreis]] and the [[Starnberg (district)|Landkreis Starnberg]] regularly competing for the title of the wealthiest district in Germany).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gevestor.de/details/die-10-reichsten-staedte-und-landkreise-in-deutschland-799215.html|title=Die 10 reichsten Städte und Landkreise in Deutschland|trans-title=The 10 Richest Cities and Districts in Germany|website=gevestor.de|language=German|last=Gerginov|first=David|url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|2004}}, the town's marketing slogan is ''Champagnerluft und Tradition'' (Champagne air and tradition).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zeit.de/2017/29/bad-homburg-kurstadt-reichtum|title=Zwei Stunden in Bad Homburg|trans-title=Two Hours in Bad Homburg|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=2017-07-12|last=Hieronymi|first=Leonhard|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==

===Middle Ages origins===
Local tradition holds that Bad Homburg's documented history began with the mention of the ''Villa Tidenheim'' in the [[Lorsch codex]], associated with the year 782. This ''Villa Tidenheim'' was equated with the Old Town, named \"Dietigheim\". Local historian Rüdiger Kurth doubted this traditional story based on his study of written sources and local factors. During 2002 Kurth initiated [[Archaeology|archaeological]] excavations, by the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]], managed by Professor Joachim Henning. The excavations showed that there was not any evidence of settlement between the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and the 13th century. It seems that the historical record which mentions Wortwin (or Ortwin) von Hohenberch as Homburg's founder, as a documentary witness in Eberbach,<!--Is that the right way to translate \"in der Eberbacher Zeugenreihe\"? --> about 1180 is the first good evidence of the town's existence.
[[File:White Tower Bad Homburg Germany.JPG|thumb|left|White Tower, viewed from Loewengasse 7.]]

[[File:2007-09-16BadHomburgRussischeKapelle02.jpg|thumb|\"Russian Chapel\", or rather All Hallows' Church.]]

As early as 1962, in an excavation under the ''Hirschgangflügel'' (\"Hart-stalking-wing\") of Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' (stately home), two burnt layers were discovered, which the man conducting the dig, Günther Binding, accepted as evidence of two former [[castle]]s having been built on the site, one after the other, but each having burnt down later.

Further digs by the University of Frankfurt at Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' during April 2006, once again initiated by Kurth and managed by Professor Henning, resulted in the discovery that it was actually only one burnt layer, from a [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] building—- possibly a castle with towers—- which from [[ceramic]] finds could be dated to the 12th or 13th century. Most likely this building had an association with Wortwin's \"castle\". Quite possibly, though, a further cultural layer from an even earlier time lies underneath these remains. Investigations using methods from natural science ([[carbon-14 dating]] and [[wikt:micromorphological|micromorphological]] analysis) will show whether the dating can be made more precise.

Homberg acquired market rights about 1330, but the document granting these rights is said to have been lost.

The town's name, \"Homburg\", is from the ''Hohenberg'' Castle. The postfix \"vor der Höhe\" was probably first recorded in a document of 1399. The designation ''\"Bad\"'' was not conferred until 1912.

The Hessen-Homburg noble family of [[landgrave]]s was initiated by Friedrich I of Hessen-Homburg. Friedrich II (1680–1708) attained fame as Prince of Homburg. During 1866, as a result of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Homburg became [[Prussia]]n territory.

===Spa town and imperial residence===
With the beginning of the spa industry in the town during the mid-19th century, which profited greatly from its [[casino]], the town became an internationally famous spa town. Bad Homburg was favoured particularly by Russian nobility for its baths.

The spa industry began with the discovery of the ''Elisabethenbrunnen'' (''Brunnen'' is German for \"well\") during 1834. The first spa building and the first casino in Homburg were built during 1841–1842 by the brothers [[François Blanc|François]] (1806–1877) and Louis Blanc (1806–1852), who later owned the [[Monte Carlo Casino]]. During 1860, the town was connected with [[Frankfurt]] by a railway line, the ''[[Homburg Railway|Homburger Bahn]]''.

During 1888, Homburg became known throughout the [[German Empire]] because [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] declared Homburg's ''Schloss'' an Imperial summer residence, and later financed the building of the [[Church of the Redeemer, Bad Homburg|Church of the Redeemer (Erlöserkirche)]] nearby. His mother, too, lived there for several years. [[Edward VII]] of the UK was also often a guest. It was he who introduced the [[Homburg hat]] and permanent turn-up trousers. He also experienced fasting cures at Homburg 32 times.

The \"Bad Homburger Golf Club 1899 e. V.\" in the ''Röderweisen'' in Dornholzhausen—nowadays part of Bad Homburg—- is Germany's oldest [[Country club|golf club]]. It had its beginnings in the Bad Homburg Spa Park (''Kurpark''), where the old clubhouse and even playable parts of the old [[golf course]] may still be found.

Not far away stands the Russian Chapel—- more properly called All Hallows' Church—- an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] church the first stone of which was laid in the Russian Imperial couple's presence on 16 October 1896, although they did not attend when it was consecrated almost three years later<!---Yes, this contradicts the German article, but not the link in the German article.--->.

King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam (Thailand) sent a Thai garden pavilion in gratitude for a successful cure. It was erected during 1914.

[[Horex]] was a well known German motorcycle brand of the \"Horex—Fahrzeugbau AG\", founded during 1923 in Bad Homburg by Fritz Kleemann.

===Jewish history===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:Denkmal Samuel Agnon Bad Homburg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Memorial to [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] in Bad Homburg]]

During 1335, permission was given by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] to [[Lords of Eppstein|Gottfried von Eppstein]] to settle 10 Jews in each of the localities of [[Eppstein]], Homburg, and [[Steinheim (Hanau)|Steinheim]]; it is uncertain, however, whether any Jews settled in Homburg at that time. Evidence for the existence of a permanent Jewish settlement in Homburg is found only at the beginning of the 16th century. Until 1600 it consisted of 2 or 3 families, and by 1632 these had increased to 16. The first [[Jewish cemetery]] was purchased during the 17th century. The community continued to grow so rapidly that during 1703 the landgrave [[Frederick II of Hesse]] decided on the construction of a special [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Judengasse]] (Jewish quarter). A synagogue, built during 1731, was replaced by a new one during 1867. The Jewish community of Homburg was originally part of the jurisdiction of the rabbinate of [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] but began to appoint its own rabbis during the 19th century.

A [[Hebrew]] printing house was located in Homburg by Seligmann ben Hirz Reis during 1710 until 1713 when he relocated to [[Offenbach am Main]]. Among other items, he published [[Jacob ibn Ḥabib]]'s ''[[Ein Ya'akov]]'' (1712). Hebrew printing was resumed there during 1724 by Samson ben Salman Hanau but lack of capital limited his output. The press was acquired during 1736 by Aaron ben Ẓevi Dessau whose publications included the ''[[Shulhan Arukh]] ([[Choshen Mishpat|Ḥoshen Mishpat]])'' with commentary (1742). The press was sold during 1748 and transferred during 1749 to [[Roedelheim]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spa of Homburg became a meeting place of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] intellectuals. The Jewish population numbered 604 (7.14% of the total population) during 1865, declining to 379 in 1910 (2.64%), and 300 during 1933. Of the 74 Jews who remained on 17 May 1939, 42 were deported during 1942/1943.<ref>FJW, 215; ''[[Germania Judaica]]'', vol. 2 (1968), 369; PKG</ref>

===Modern age===
While the spa business experienced a long-term decrease after the two world wars, the town gained importance by becoming the site for headquarters of various authorities and administrative bodies. By autumn 1946, the military government had already ordered the founding of [[Bizone|bizonal]] authorities. Bad Homburg was chosen as the seat of the financial administrative centre. On 23 July 1947, the Bizone Economic Council instituted the \"Special Money and Credit Centre\" here in preparation for currency reform. The centre was managed by [[Ludwig Erhard]]. After the Federal Republic of Germany—- West Germany—- was founded with its capital in [[Bonn]], the Federal Debt Administration (''Bundesschuldenverwaltung''), the Office for Security Adjustment (''Amt für Wertpapierbereinigung'') and the Federal Equalization Office (''Bundesausgleichsamt'') stayed in Bad Homburg.

During the 20th century, Bad Homburg became a favourite residential area among the upper classes. On 30 November 1989, one of its members, [[Alfred Herrhausen]], the manager of the [[Deutsche Bank]], was killed and his driver was injured by a car bomb in Bad Homburg. It is alleged that this was an attack by the [[Red Army Faction]], though this has never been proven.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/herrhausen-mord-neue-theorie-ueber-die-herkunft-der-bombe-a-1005698.html|title=Herrhausen-Mord: Neue Theorie über die Herkunft der Bombe|trans-title=Herrhausen-Murder: New Theory Regarding Origin of the Bomb|publisher=Spiegel Online|language=German|date=2014-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Coat of arms==
Bad Homburg's civic coat of arms was granted during 1903 but is said to date from the 15th century on the basis of seals known from that time, although they show a [[saltire]] rather than the two [[adze]]s seen today (the saltire might be two unclear adzes). The reason for the adzes in the arms is not known; it is possibly dialectal [[Canting arms|canting]]. The colours, with silver adzes in a blue field, have been in use at least since 1621.<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/b/bad-homb.htm NGW.nl]</ref>

=== Energy ===
En+ Group operates generating assets with 19.6 GW of installed electricity capacity. As of 31 December 2016, hydro power plants accounted for 76.6% (15.1 GW) of the Group's installed electricity capacity, which makes the Company the largest privately held hydro power generation company globally. As at 31 December 2016, the Group held an 8% share of the total installed electricity capacity in Russia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enplus.ru/upload/iblock/757/7573403591c1c609c50bd503983a940e.pdf|title=EN+ GROUP PLC ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO FLOAT ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE AND MOSCOW EXCHANGE}}</ref>

The Group's power assets are predominantly located in Siberia, where it has a 37.6% share of total installed electricity capacity in the region. The hydro power operations benefit from the abundant water resources of the [[Angara River|Angara]] and [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]] river cascades. These plants provide sustainable, [[Low-carbon power|low carbon]] and low-cost power for Russian industrial facilities, including Metals segment's core aluminium smelters. The Group believes that it benefits from lower operating costs compared to other hydro power generation companies in part due to the geographic location, scale and efficient management of the power generating assets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/638e1dc6-1bb2-11e7-bcac-6d03d067f81f|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref>

=== Energy ===
En+ Group operates generating assets with 19.6 GW of installed electricity capacity. As of 31 December 2016, hydro power plants accounted for 76.6% (15.1 GW) of the Group's installed electricity capacity, which makes the Company the largest privately held hydro power generation company globally. As at 31 December 2016, the Group held an 8% share of the total installed electricity capacity in Russia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enplus.ru/upload/iblock/757/7573403591c1c609c50bd503983a940e.pdf|title=EN+ GROUP PLC ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO FLOAT ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE AND MOSCOW EXCHANGE}}</ref>

The Group's power assets are predominantly located in Siberia, where it has a 37.6% share of total installed electricity capacity in the region. The hydro power operations benefit from the abundant water resources of the [[Angara River|Angara]] and [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]] river cascades. These plants provide sustainable, [[Low-carbon power|low carbon]] and low-cost power for Russian industrial facilities, including Metals segment's core aluminium smelters. The Group believes that it benefits from lower operating costs compared to other hydro power generation companies in part due to the geographic location, scale and efficient management of the power generating assets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/638e1dc6-1bb2-11e7-bcac-6d03d067f81f|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref>

In 2016, OneWeb planned for a launch cadence of 30-36 satellites a month <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/leo-constellation-operators-oneweb-iridium-announce-collaboration/|title=LEO constellation operators OneWeb, Iridium announce collaboration|date=2019-09-17|website=SpaceNews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-20|last=Henry|first=Caleb}}</ref> to create an initial constellation of 650 satellites. The satellites operate in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). OneWeb chose an altitude of 1200 km for its satellites because there is a minimum existing population of satellites and [[space debris|debris]] at that altitude.<ref name=\":2\"/>

Like existing LEO based communications satellite constellations, OneWeb's satellites are closer to Earth and will, therefore, provide much lower transmission delays than geostationary satellite broadband services<ref name=\":3\"/>. As late as January 2020, OneWeb was still planning to provide 10 times the bandwidth and one-tenth of the latency of existing geostationary satellites.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Norways-autonomous-ships-point-to-new-horizons|title=Norway's autonomous ships point to new horizons|website=ComputerWeekly.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02 |date=29 May 2019|last=Mathieson|first=SA}}</ref>

== Responsible space ==
In June 2019, OneWeb rolled out its initiative Responsible Space to outline the specific approaches it plans to take to promote sustainability and safe operations in space.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |url=https://spacenews.com/can-satellite-megaconstellations-be-responsible-users-of-space/|title=Can satellite megaconstellations be responsible users of space?|date=2019-09-03|website=SpaceNews.com |language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22|last=Foust|first=Jeff}}</ref> Responsible Space covers design and operational practices, including disposal of a satellite within 5 years of the end of its mission; developing an \"ecosystem\" within the space industry that supports sustainability; and collaboration with other space operators.<ref name=\":2\"/>&nbsp;As one example, OneWeb plans to include a grapple fixture on its satellites so that a third-party satellite could grab it and tug it out of orbit, should the satellite prove non-responsive.<ref name=\":2\"/>

The winners were [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and the runners-up were [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]].

The competition began on 5 November 1990 and ended with the final on 26 May 1991 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

In the first round, there were two sections split into eight groups: North and South. In the following rounds each section gradually eliminates teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists faced each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.

[[Category:EFL Trophy]]
[[Category:1990–91 Football League Third Division|Tro]]","The '''1990–91 Associate Members' Cup''', known as the '''1990–91 Leyland DAF Cup''', was the eighth staging of the [[Associate Members' Cup]], a knock-out competition for [[English football]] clubs in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. The winners were [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and the runners-up were [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]].

The competition began on 5 November 1990 and ended with the final on 26 May 1991 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

In the first round, there were two sections split into eight groups: North and South. In the following rounds each section gradually eliminates teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists faced each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.

'''Paul Albert Masvidal''' (born January 20, 1971) is a guitarist, singer, songwriter, artist, producer, and a founding member of the band [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]]. He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[Æon Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.

==Early life==

Paul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.

Masvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mettā Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].

== Career ==

Cynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.
[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|149x149px|Cynic - Focus]]
1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. ''Focus'' was listed in Rock Hard magazine's book as one of ''The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62273803|title=Best of Rock & Metal : die 500 stärksten Scheiben aller Zeiten|date=2005|publisher=Heel|others=Rensen, Michael., Heine, Uwe., Stratmann, Holger., Villalonga, Marc.|isbn=3-89880-517-4|location=Königswinter|oclc=62273803}}</ref>. ''[[Loudwire]]'' writer Graham Hartmann named Focus the ninth best debut metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/cynic-focus-best-debut-metal-albums/|title=No. 9: Cynic, 'Focus' – Best Debut Metal Albums|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. [[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. 

Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. '''Cynic took a 12 year hiatus''' in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] '''and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film.''' 
[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[Æon Spoke]]]]



During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[Æon Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' Æon Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''.  Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.

[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]]
Cynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus. In his review,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/arts/music/01choi.html|title=New CDs|date=2008-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> ''New York Times'' music critic Ben Ratliff wrote that Cynic \"should be understood not so much alongside any metal bands but along with the radical harmonic progressives in the last 45 years of pop and jazz: composers like Milton Nascimento, the Beach Boys or Pat Metheny.\" 
[[File:Carbon-based anatomy by cynic.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Carbon Based Anatomy]]
Since ''Traced In Air'', Cynic has released two conceptual records: ''[[Re-Traced]]'' (2010), featuring re-interpretations of several ''Traced in Air'' tracks, and ''[[Carbon-Based Anatomy]]'' (2011). ''Rolling Stone'' music critic Hank Shteamer raved in his review<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16034-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/|title=Cynic: Carbon-Based Anatomy EP|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> of ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'': \"The title track is a perfectly paced stunner...Cynic sounds fully liberated, not just from their metal past but from any aesthetic concern other than assembling a great song.\"

In 2013, Masvidal joined forces with other original members of the Death ''Human'' line up and toured worldwide in honor of [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s legacy with the group DTA (Death to All). 
[[File:KindlyBentToFreeUs.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Kindly Bent to Free Us]]


Cynic's third full-length album, ''[[Kindly Bent to Free Us]]'', released in 2014, was hailed by [[Malcolm Dome|Malcome Dome]] of ''[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]'' magazine as \"an album that transcends all the limitations of genre and era... There are few albums which can claim such a remarkable hold.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/cynic-kindly-bent-to-free-us|title=Cynic: Kindly Bent To Free Us|last=February 2014|first=Malcolm Dome 11|website=Prog Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> The album rose to No. 4 on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s Heatseekers chart in February 2014 and was No. 1 on CMJ's Loud Rock Chart the following month.

\"Kindly Bent to Free Us [is] an album that, while most definitely in the realm of prog rock, has the kind of open, unpretentious air that makes Rush such an easy-to-love band.\" - [[AllMusic.com|allmusic.com]]

\"The alchemy of front man Paul Masvidal (vocals, guitars & keyboards) combined with rhythmaniac Sean Reinert (drums) and the technically divine Sean Malone (bass), make Cynic one of the finest Prog Rock bands to have ever of landed on Planet Earth\" - [https://burningfist.co.uk burningfist.co.uk][[File:Onward with Love.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Onward with Love, 2015]]



In 2015, Masvidal ventured into the performing-arts world with masked duo Onward with Love (OwL), a musical collaboration with acclaimed singer-songwriter [[Amy Correia]]. The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''. The duo officially released the song [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/onwardwithlove/kali-in-my-arms digitally] in 2019 have plans to release a full-length record by 2021.

In 2016, Masvidal, along with collaborator [[Amy Correia]], composed the musical score for the award-winning feature film ''[[The Tiger Hunter]]'', featuring lead actor [[Danny Pudi]] 

Masvidal also writes and performs music for television and motion pictures. His credits include main title (composer credit) on an Emmy nominated NBC teen series show ''[[Operation Junkyard]]'', short films ''The Yellow Umbrella'', ''A Bride in Black'', assistant to [[Ben Vaughn]] and session musician for Carsey Warner network sitcoms ''[[That '70s Show]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''.

'''Paul Albert Masvidal''' (born January 20, 1971) is a guitarist, singer, songwriter, artist, producer, and a founding member of the band [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]]. He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[Æon Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.

==Early life==

Paul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.

Masvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mettā Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].

== Career ==

Cynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.

In addition, in 1991 Masvidal helped Chicago band [[Master (American band)|Master]] to record their album ''[[On the Seventh Day God Created... Master]]''. Masvidal handled all guitar duties on this album. 

1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. ''Focus'' was listed in Rock Hard magazine's book as one of ''The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62273803|title=Best of Rock & Metal : die 500 stärksten Scheiben aller Zeiten|date=2005|publisher=Heel|others=Rensen, Michael., Heine, Uwe., Stratmann, Holger., Villalonga, Marc.|isbn=3-89880-517-4|location=Königswinter|oclc=62273803}}</ref>. ''[[Loudwire]]'' writer Graham Hartmann named Focus the ninth best debut metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/cynic-focus-best-debut-metal-albums/|title=No. 9: Cynic, 'Focus' – Best Debut Metal Albums|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. [[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. 

Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a hiatus in 1995 after record ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]]. 
[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[Æon Spoke]]]]



During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[Æon Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' Æon Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''.  Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.

[[File:Carbon-based anatomy by cynic.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Carbon Based Anatomy]]
Since ''Traced In Air'', Cynic has released two conceptual records: ''[[Re-Traced]]'' (2010), featuring re-interpretations of several ''Traced in Air'' tracks, and ''[[Carbon-Based Anatomy]]'' (2011).

In 2013, Masvidal joined forces with other original members of the Death ''Human'' line up and toured worldwide in honor of [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s legacy with the group DTA (Death to All). 
[[File:KindlyBentToFreeUs.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Kindly Bent to Free Us]]

\"The alchemy of front man Paul Masvidal (vocals, guitars & keyboards) combined with rhythmaniac Sean Reinert (drums) and the technically divine Sean Malone (bass), make Cynic one of the finest Prog Rock bands to have ever of landed on Planet Earth\" - [https://burningfist.co.uk burningfist.co.uk][[File:Onward with Love.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Onward with Love, 2015]]

'''''The Danny Thomas Show''''' (titled '''''Make Room for Daddy''''' for its first four seasons) is an American [[sitcom]] that ran from 1953 to 1957 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and from 1957 to 1964 on [[CBS]]. Episodes regularly featured music by Danny Thomas, guest stars and occasionally other cast members as part of the plot.

In March 1953, [[Danny Thomas]] first signed the contract for the show with ABC and chose [[Desilu Productions|Desilu Studios]] to film it using its [[Multiple-camera setup|three-camera method]].<ref name=andrews>''The I Love Lucy Book'' by Bart Andrews (revised and updated Broadway Books trade paperback edition, 2001), {{ISBN|0-385-19033-6}}, p. 116</ref> Two proposed titles during preproduction were ''The Children's Hour''<ref>{{cite book |title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History |url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein |url-access=registration |last=Weiner |first=Ed |author2=Editors of TV Guide  |year=1992 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-096914-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein/page/173 173] }}</ref> and ''Here Comes Daddy''.<ref name=\"andrews\" />

==Synopsis==
[[File:Danny thomas sherry jackson.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Thomas with television daughter Terry ([[Sherry Jackson]])]]
Thomas played the role of Danny Williams, a successful comedian and nightclub entertainer at the Copa Club, based on the iconic New York City nightclub the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. [[Jean Hagen]] played his serious and loving wife Margaret. Their daughter Terry was played by Sherry Jackson, and their son Rusty by Rusty Hamer. The show's premise involved Danny rarely having time to spend with his family and Margaret having to deal with the children virtually on her own. She often felt neglected by Danny, and on several occasions felt like leaving him. Margaret was a society woman and strict with the children, but loved her family. 

[[Louise Beavers]] made several appearances during this era as the Williams' maid, Louise Evans, and often was at odds with Danny and sided with Margaret in most of the couple's arguments. [[Nana Bryant]] often appeared as Margaret's kind mother, of whom Danny and the children were fond, but Margaret, who had been raised by her aunt and uncle because of her mother often being away on stage tours, was not as warm to her mother. (Bryant died in late 1955, and rather than the character being recast, she simply disappeared. When Louise Beavers became ill in 1955, [[Amanda Randolph]] assumed the role of Louise.)

===Series changes===
For its first four years, ''Make Room For Daddy\"on ABC (retitled ''The Danny Thomas Show\"starting in the Fall of 1957 on CBS) garnered decent ratings, but failed to make the list of the top 30 programs. Shortly after the third season finished filming, Jean Hagen left the show over dissatisfaction with her role and frequent clashes with Danny Thomas. Thomas was upset with her for leaving, and felt the show would not last without her. However, he decided to push on. At the start of the fourth season, Both Thomas and producer [[Sheldon Leonard]] were faced with a serious dilemma—how to explain Hagen's absence. To have \"Danny\" and \"Margaret\" divorce in that era would have been unacceptable to television audiences, so it was explained that Margaret had died suddenly off-screen. It was a risky move because until this time, no character on a TV situation comedy had died.

Danny now was a widower juggling a performing career while raising two children on his own. He had Louise and his friends often looking after the children while he was touring. He decided to move them to a boarding school, but later relented and the family moved into a new apartment. During the fourth season, Danny dated a few other women and nearly got engaged to a widowed singer until he found out she did not like children. By season's end, the ratings had suffered and it was decided that a wife and mother was needed to complete the family unit.

In a four-part story arc that began airing in April 1957, son Rusty fell ill with the [[measles]] and Danny hired Kathy O'Hara ([[Marjorie Lord]]), a young Irish nurse, to look after him. Kathy was a widow with a little girl (played by Lelani Sorenson). Danny and Kathy became fast friends and, not surprisingly, Danny quickly fell in love with her, as did the kids. In the season finale, the two became engaged. In a curious twist, ABC at this point canceled the series, which proved to be fortunate. In the spring of 1957, ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', which had reigned as the top-rated show for almost all of its six-year run on CBS, was ending production. When CBS heard that ABC was cancelling the series, CBS picked it up as part of its 1957-58 schedule.

The show, now titled \"The Danny Thomas Show\" made its CBS debut on Monday, October 7, 1957 at 9:00 inheriting the time slot vacated by ''I Love Lucy''. The fifth-season premiere episode, \"Lose Me In Las Vegas,\" had Danny and Kathy already married and on their honeymoon. The Williams family moved into a larger brand-new apartment and, with the change of network, the producers also changed Kathy's daughter. Lelani Sorenson was dropped from the cast and replaced by [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda. Linda then was adopted by Danny, and the show's ratings dramatically increased.<ref>[http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm ClassicTVHits.com TV Ratings: 1957-1958]</ref> At the end of its fifth season, ''The Danny Thomas Show'' posted its highest rating, ranking at No. 2. During this season, Amanda Randolph was sick and rarely appeared as Louise, who was said to be recovering from the flu, with Kathy doing most of the housework.

In the early part of the sixth season, Sherry Jackson left the show and the character of Terry was said to have gone to a girls school in Paris. Jackson commented on her close friendship with Jean Hagen and why she left the series, saying, \"The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored her. We had a great time. She and I were best buddies; she was my only friend from the ''Make Room for Daddy'' cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that she didn't want to come back. When she left, I was devastated. I didn't want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn't let me leave, but gave me less to do; that's why I'm in fewer shows from ages 14–16.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}

In Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had her engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan ([[Pat Harrington, Jr.]]), a nightclub friend of Danny's. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.

In the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny's manager, Charlie Halper ([[Sid Melton]]) and his wife Bunny ([[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.

The show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long \"reunion\" special on [[NBC]], ''The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion'', considered the first TV reunion show, and ''Make More Room for Daddy'', which aired as an episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'' in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, ''Make Room for Granddaddy'', was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.

ABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised her role of oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of her husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry's husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left her son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so she could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by [[Stanley Myron Handelman]] and former [[American football|football]] player [[Rosey Grier|Roosevelt Grier]]. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were [[rural purge|purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers]] after the [[Prime Time Access Rule|loss of a half-hour of daily program time]] in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.<ref>Geoffrey Mark Fidelman,''The Lucy Book'', Renaissance Books, page 269.)</ref>

'''''The Danny Thomas Show''''' (titled '''''Make Room for Daddy''''' for its first three seasons) is an American [[sitcom]] that ran from 1953 to 1957 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and from 1957 to 1964 on [[CBS]]. Episodes regularly featured music by Danny Thomas, guest stars and occasionally other cast members as part of the plot.

In March 1953, [[Danny Thomas]] first signed the contract for the show with ABC and chose [[Desilu Productions|Desilu Studios]] to film it using its [[Multiple-camera setup|three-camera method]].<ref name=andrews>''The I Love Lucy Book'' by Bart Andrews (revised and updated Broadway Books trade paperback edition, 2001), {{ISBN|0-385-19033-6}}, p. 116</ref> Two proposed titles during preproduction were ''The Children's Hour''<ref>{{cite book |title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History |url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein |url-access=registration |last=Weiner |first=Ed |author2=Editors of TV Guide  |year=1992 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-096914-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein/page/173 173] }}</ref> and ''Here Comes Daddy''.<ref name=\"andrews\" />

==Synopsis==
[[File:Danny thomas sherry jackson.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Thomas with television daughter Terry ([[Sherry Jackson]])]]
Thomas played the role of Danny Williams, a successful comedian and nightclub entertainer at the Copa Club, based on the iconic New York City nightclub the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. [[Jean Hagen]] played his serious and loving wife Margaret. Their daughter Terry was played by Sherry Jackson, and their son Rusty by Rusty Hamer. The show's premise involved Danny rarely having time to spend with his family and Margaret having to deal with the children virtually on her own. She often felt neglected by Danny, and on several occasions felt like leaving him. Margaret was a society woman and strict with the children, but loved her family. 

[[Louise Beavers]] made several appearances during this era as the Williams' maid, Louise Evans, and often was at odds with Danny and sided with Margaret in most of the couple's arguments. [[Nana Bryant]] often appeared as Margaret's kind mother, of whom Danny and the children were fond, but Margaret, who had been raised by her aunt and uncle because of her mother often being away on stage tours, was not as warm to her mother. (Bryant died in late 1955, and rather than the character being recast, she simply disappeared. When Louise Beavers became ill in 1955, [[Amanda Randolph]] assumed the role of Louise.)

===Series changes===
For its first four years, ''Make Room For Daddy\"on ABC (retitled ''The Danny Thomas Show\"starting in the Fall of 1957 on CBS) garnered decent ratings, but failed to make the list of the top 30 programs. Shortly after the third season finished filming, Jean Hagen left the show over dissatisfaction with her role and frequent clashes with Danny Thomas. Thomas was upset with her for leaving, and felt the show would not last without her. However, he decided to push on. At the start of the fourth season, Both Thomas and producer [[Sheldon Leonard]] were faced with a serious dilemma—how to explain Hagen's absence. To have \"Danny\" and \"Margaret\" divorce in that era would have been unacceptable to television audiences, so it was explained that Margaret had died suddenly off-screen. It was a risky move because until this time, no character on a TV situation comedy had died.

Danny now was a widower juggling a performing career while raising two children on his own. He had Louise and his friends often looking after the children while he was touring. He decided to move them to a boarding school, but later relented and the family moved into a new apartment. During the fourth season, Danny dated a few other women and nearly got engaged to a widowed singer until he found out she did not like children. By season's end, the ratings had suffered and it was decided that a wife and mother was needed to complete the family unit.

In a four-part story arc that began airing in April 1957, son Rusty fell ill with the [[measles]] and Danny hired Kathy O'Hara ([[Marjorie Lord]]), a young Irish nurse, to look after him. Kathy was a widow with a little girl (played by Lelani Sorenson). Danny and Kathy became fast friends and, not surprisingly, Danny quickly fell in love with her, as did the kids. In the season finale, the two became engaged. In a curious twist, ABC at this point canceled the series, which proved to be fortunate. In the spring of 1957, ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', which had reigned as the top-rated show for almost all of its six-year run on CBS, was ending production. When CBS heard that ABC was cancelling the series, CBS picked it up as part of its 1957-58 schedule.

The show, now titled \"The Danny Thomas Show\" made its CBS debut on Monday, October 7, 1957 at 9:00 inheriting the time slot vacated by ''I Love Lucy''. The fifth-season premiere episode, \"Lose Me In Las Vegas,\" had Danny and Kathy already married and on their honeymoon. The Williams family moved into a larger brand-new apartment and, with the change of network, the producers also changed Kathy's daughter. Lelani Sorenson was dropped from the cast and replaced by [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda. Linda then was adopted by Danny, and the show's ratings dramatically increased.<ref>[http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm ClassicTVHits.com TV Ratings: 1957-1958]</ref> At the end of its fifth season, ''The Danny Thomas Show'' posted its highest rating, ranking at No. 2. During this season, Amanda Randolph was sick and rarely appeared as Louise, who was said to be recovering from the flu, with Kathy doing most of the housework.

In the early part of the sixth season, Sherry Jackson left the show and the character of Terry was said to have gone to a girls school in Paris. Jackson commented on her close friendship with Jean Hagen and why she left the series, saying, \"The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored her. We had a great time. She and I were best buddies; she was my only friend from the ''Make Room for Daddy'' cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that she didn't want to come back. When she left, I was devastated. I didn't want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn't let me leave, but gave me less to do; that's why I'm in fewer shows from ages 14–16.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}

In Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had her engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan ([[Pat Harrington, Jr.]]), a nightclub friend of Danny's. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.

In the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny's manager, Charlie Halper ([[Sid Melton]]) and his wife Bunny ([[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.

The show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long \"reunion\" special on [[NBC]], ''The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion'', considered the first TV reunion show, and ''Make More Room for Daddy'', which aired as an episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'' in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, ''Make Room for Granddaddy'', was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.

ABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised her role of oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of her husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry's husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left her son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so she could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by [[Stanley Myron Handelman]] and former [[American football|football]] player [[Rosey Grier|Roosevelt Grier]]. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were [[rural purge|purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers]] after the [[Prime Time Access Rule|loss of a half-hour of daily program time]] in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.<ref>Geoffrey Mark Fidelman,''The Lucy Book'', Renaissance Books, page 269.)</ref>

Jackson commented on her close friendship with Jean Hagen and why she left the series, saying, \"The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored her. We had a great time. She and I were best buddies; she was my only friend from the ''Make Room for Daddy'' cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that she didn't want to come back. When she left, I was devastated. I didn't want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn't let me leave, but gave me less to do; that's why I'm in fewer shows from ages 14–16.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}

In Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had her engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan ([[Pat Harrington, Jr.]]), a nightclub friend of Danny's. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.

In the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny's manager, Charlie Halper ([[Sid Melton]]) and his wife Bunny ([[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.

The show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long \"reunion\" special on [[NBC]], ''The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion'', considered the first TV reunion show, and ''Make More Room for Daddy'', which aired as an episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'' in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, ''Make Room for Granddaddy'', was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.

ABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised her role of oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of her husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry's husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left her son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so she could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by [[Stanley Myron Handelman]] and former [[American football|football]] player [[Rosey Grier|Roosevelt Grier]]. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were [[rural purge|purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers]] after the [[Prime Time Access Rule|loss of a half-hour of daily program time]] in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.<ref>Geoffrey Mark Fidelman,''The Lucy Book'', Renaissance Books, page 269.)</ref>

Episodes regularly featured music by Danny Thomas, guest stars and occasionally other cast members as part of the plot.

In March 1953, [[Danny Thomas]] first signed the contract for the show with ABC and chose [[Desilu Productions|Desilu Studios]] to film it using its [[Multiple-camera setup|three-camera method]].<ref name=andrews>''The I Love Lucy Book'' by Bart Andrews (revised and updated Broadway Books trade paperback edition, 2001), {{ISBN|0-385-19033-6}}, p. 116</ref> Two proposed titles during preproduction were ''The Children's Hour''<ref>{{cite book |title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History |url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein |url-access=registration |last=Weiner |first=Ed |author2=Editors of TV Guide  |year=1992 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-096914-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein/page/173 173] }}</ref> and ''Here Comes Daddy''.<ref name=\"andrews\" />

==Synopsis==
[[File:Danny thomas sherry jackson.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Thomas with television daughter Terry ([[Sherry Jackson]])]]
Thomas played the role of Danny Williams, a successful comedian and nightclub entertainer at the Copa Club, based on the iconic New York City nightclub the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. [[Jean Hagen]] played his serious and loving wife Margaret. Their daughter Terry was played by Sherry Jackson, and their son Rusty by Rusty Hamer. The show's premise involved Danny rarely having time to spend with his family and Margaret having to deal with the children virtually on her own. She often felt neglected by Danny, and on several occasions felt like leaving him. Margaret was a society woman and strict with the children, but loved her family. 

[[Louise Beavers]] made several appearances during this era as the Williams' maid, Louise Evans, and often was at odds with Danny and sided with Margaret in most of the couple's arguments. [[Nana Bryant]] often appeared as Margaret's kind mother, of whom Danny and the children were fond, but Margaret, who had been raised by her aunt and uncle because of her mother often being away on stage tours, was not as warm to her mother. (Bryant died in late 1955, and rather than the character being recast, she simply disappeared. When Louise Beavers became ill in 1955, [[Amanda Randolph]] assumed the role of Louise.)

===Series changes===
For its first four years, ''Make Room For Daddy\"on ABC (retitled ''The Danny Thomas Show\"starting in the Fall of 1957 on CBS) garnered decent ratings, but failed to make the list of the top 30 programs. Shortly after the third season finished filming, Jean Hagen left the show over dissatisfaction with her role and frequent clashes with Danny Thomas. Thomas was upset with her for leaving, and felt the show would not last without her. However, he decided to push on. At the start of the fourth season, Both Thomas and producer [[Sheldon Leonard]] were faced with a serious dilemma—how to explain Hagen's absence. To have \"Danny\" and \"Margaret\" divorce in that era would have been unacceptable to television audiences, so it was explained that Margaret had died suddenly off-screen. It was a risky move because until this time, no character on a TV situation comedy had died.

Danny now was a widower juggling a performing career while raising two children on his own. He had Louise and his friends often looking after the children while he was touring. He decided to move them to a boarding school, but later relented and the family moved into a new apartment. During the fourth season, Danny dated a few other women and nearly got engaged to a widowed singer until he found out she did not like children. By season's end, the ratings had suffered and it was decided that a wife and mother was needed to complete the family unit.

In a four-part story arc that began airing in April 1957, son Rusty fell ill with the [[measles]] and Danny hired Kathy O'Hara ([[Marjorie Lord]]), a young Irish nurse, to look after him. Kathy was a widow with a little girl (played by Lelani Sorenson). Danny and Kathy became fast friends and, not surprisingly, Danny quickly fell in love with her, as did the kids. In the season finale, the two became engaged. In a curious twist, ABC at this point canceled the series, which proved to be fortunate. In the spring of 1957, ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', which had reigned as the top-rated show for almost all of its six-year run on CBS, was ending production. When CBS heard that ABC was cancelling the series, CBS picked it up as part of its 1957-58 schedule.

The show, now titled \"The Danny Thomas Show\" made its CBS debut on Monday, October 7, 1957 at 9:00 inheriting the time slot vacated by ''I Love Lucy''. The fifth-season premiere episode, \"Lose Me In Las Vegas,\" had Danny and Kathy already married and on their honeymoon. The Williams family moved into a larger brand-new apartment and, with the change of network, the producers also changed Kathy's daughter. Lelani Sorenson was dropped from the cast and replaced by [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda. Linda then was adopted by Danny, and the show's ratings dramatically increased.<ref>[http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm ClassicTVHits.com TV Ratings: 1957-1958]</ref> At the end of its fifth season, ''The Danny Thomas Show'' posted its highest rating, ranking at No. 2. During this season, Amanda Randolph was sick and rarely appeared as Louise, who was said to be recovering from the flu, with Kathy doing most of the housework.

In the early part of the sixth season, Sherry Jackson left the show and the character of Terry was said to have gone to a girls school in Paris. Jackson commented on her close friendship with Jean Hagen and why she left the series, saying, \"The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored her. We had a great time. She and I were best buddies; she was my only friend from the ''Make Room for Daddy'' cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that she didn't want to come back. When she left, I was devastated. I didn't want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn't let me leave, but gave me less to do; that's why I'm in fewer shows from ages 14–16.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}

In Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had her engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan ([[Pat Harrington, Jr.]]), a nightclub friend of Danny's. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.

In the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny's manager, Charlie Halper ([[Sid Melton]]) and his wife Bunny ([[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.

The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were [[rural purge|purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers]] after the [[Prime Time Access Rule|loss of a half-hour of daily program time]] in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.<ref>Geoffrey Mark Fidelman,''The Lucy Book'', Renaissance Books, page 269.)</ref>

'''''The Ring''''' is a 2002 American [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Gore Verbinski]] and starring [[Naomi Watts]], [[Martin Henderson]], [[David Dorfman]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], and [[Daveigh Chase]]. It is a [[remake]] of the 1998 [[Japanese horror]] film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'', based on [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|the novel of the same name]] by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]]. Watts portrays a journalist who investigates a cursed videotape that seemingly kills the viewer seven days after watching it.

''The Ring'' was released theatrically on October 18, 2002, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the atmosphere and Watts's performance. The film grossed over $249 million worldwide on a $48 million production budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror remakes. It is the first installment of the [[The Ring (franchise)#American films|American ''Ring'' series]], and is followed by ''[[The Ring Two]]'' and ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'', which were released in 2005 and 2017, respectively.

''The Ring'' paved the way for English-language remakes of Asian horror films, such as ''[[The Grudge (2004 film)|The Grudge]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'', ''[[One Missed Call (2008 film)|One Missed Call]]'', ''[[The Eye (2008 film)|The Eye]]'', ''[[Shutter (2008 film)|Shutter]]'', ''[[Mirrors (2008 film)|Mirrors]]'', ''[[The Echo (2008 film)|The Echo]]'' and ''[[The Uninvited (2009 film)|The Uninvited]]''.

==Plot==
In [[Seattle]], teenagers Katie Embry and Becca Kotler discuss the legend of a cursed videotape; whoever watches it dies seven days later. Katie claims she watched the tape with three friends a week ago. Minutes later, Katie is killed by an unseen force, and Becca is institutionalized after witnessing it.

At Katie's funeral, her mother, Ruth, urges her sister Rachel Keller, a journalist, to investigate her daughter's death. Rachel lives with her young son Aidan, who possesses a degree of [[mediumship]]. Rachel learns Katie's friends all died on the same night, sporting disfigured appearances. Rachel travels to Shelter Mountain Inn where Katie stayed, discovering the rumoured cursed videotape. Renting the same cabin as Katie, Rachel watches the tape, which contains disturbing, gruesome imagery. Once the tape ends, Rachel receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers “seven days”.

Rachel recruits Noah Clay, her ex-boyfriend and Aidan's father, to study the tape, making a copy after he watches the original. Rachel begins to suffer supernatural symptoms as the week passes, haunted by a young girl with soaking wet hair. Investigation into the tape's imagery leads Rachel to Anna Morgan, a [[horse breeding|horse breeder]] from Moesko Island, who committed suicide after her prize-winning horses drowned themselves. Rachel catches Aidan watching the tape, and discovers Noah is suffering similar symptoms.

Leaving Aidan in Ruth's care, Rachel travels to Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard. On the ferry journey, a horse is spooked by Rachel's presence, leaping to its death. Noah goes to Eola Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. Both separately discover Anna had an adopted daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Samara]], who possessed an ability to [[thoughtography|psychically etch mental images]] onto surfaces and into minds, driving her parents mad. Rachel tries to speak with Richard about Samara, but he denies her existence.

Rachel speaks with Dr. Grasnik, the island's GP, who explains Samara was adopted due to Anna's [[infertility]], recommending them to admit her to Eola, assuming Samara is still there. Rachel sneaks into the Morgan farmhouse, watching a videotape of Samara in a psychotherapy session, who claims she has no control over her abilities. Rachel confronts Richard, who electrocutes himself in a bathtub with a [[bridle|horse bridle]] upon learning Samara's powers are still at large. Noah arrives, he and Rachel go to the barn, where Samara was isolated in the loft. They find a burnt image of a tree, Rachel recognizing it from Shelter Mountain.

They return to the cabin, locating a stone [[water well|well]] hidden under the floorboards; the final image on the tape. Rachel falls in the well, experiencing a vision of Anna suffocating Samara and throwing her down the well, sealing her in, where she drowned seven days later. Samara's corpse surfaces after Noah tells Rachel that the seven day deadline has passed.

The next day, Aidan tells Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara, revealing he is still cursed. In his apartment, Noah encounters the [[vengeful ghost]] of Samara emerge from his television, murdering him. Rachel, upon finding his disfigured corpse, returns home and destroys the original tape in a furious rage, asking why Noah was killed but she was not. She realizes that the difference is that she made a copy of the tape, which Aidan watched, thereby continuing the cycle that Samara wants to spread of duplicating the video and showing it to someone else to save oneself.

Rachel shows Aidan how to make his own copy. He remarks that the curse will never stop and asks what will happen to the person who watches the new tape, to which Rachel does not answer.

==Production==
===Development===
''The Ring'' went into production without a completed script.<ref name=iwgv>{{cite web|url=http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|title=Interview with Gore Verbinski|date=2002|publisher=curseofthering.com|accessdate=March 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113145/http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|archivedate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Ehren Kruger]] wrote three drafts of the screenplay before [[Scott Frank]] came on to do an uncredited rewrite. Verbinski was initially inspired to do a remake of ''Ringu'' after [[Walter F. Parkes]] sent him a VHS copy of the original Japanese film, which he describes as \"intriguing\", \"Pulp\" and \"avant-garde\".

Producer [[Neal Edelstein]] offered the remake to David Lynch to direct, but he turned it down. The original WGA-approved credits listed Hiroshi Takahashi (writer of the original 1998 screenplay for ''[[Ring (1998 film)|Ring]]'') but his name is absent from the final print.

The film also sought to retain the minimalism that was prevalent throughout ''Ringu'' and was decidedly set in [[Seattle]], due to its \"wet and isolated\" atmosphere. Verbinski also admitted to not wanting to cast \"big stars\" as he wanted his film to be \"discovered\" and describes the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as \"inevitable\" although he expressed desire for hardcore fans of the original to find the remake as equally compelling.<ref name=iwgv/>

==Soundtrack==
[[File:Theringtheme.ogg|thumb|right|The main theme of the film from the track ''The Well'', which is also known as \"Samara's Song\".]]
The film features an original score composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] (who would later collaborate on Gore Verbinski's other works). The soundtrack release did not coincide with the film's theatrical run. It was released in 2005, accompanying ''[[The Ring Two]]'' in an album that combined music from both ''The Ring'' and ''The Ring Two''. The soundtrack contains a few [[leitmotifs|themes]] associated with the characters, moods, and locations, including multiple uses of the [[Dies Irae]] theme.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The score makes use of [[string instrument]]s, [[piano]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

==Marketing==
In order to advertise ''The Ring'', many promotional websites were formed featuring the characters and places in the film. The video from the cursed videotape was played in late night programming over the summer of 2002 without any reference to the film.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film was financially successful, and the box office gross increased from its first weekend to its second. The initial success led DreamWorks to increase the film into 700 additional theaters.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/business ''The Ring'' Box Office and Business] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> ''The Ring'' made $8.3 million in its first two weeks in Japan, compared to ''Ring'''s $6.6 million total box-office gross.<ref name=remakeman>[[Tad Friend|Friend, Tad]]. \"[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/06/02/remake-man Remake Man].\" ''[[The New Yorker]]'', June 2, 2003.</ref> The success of ''The Ring'' opened the way for American remakes of several other Japanese horror films, including ''[[The Grudge (2004 film)|The Grudge]]'' and ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]''.<ref name=remakeman/>

===Critical reception===
''The Ring'' was met with generally positive reviews from film critics. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 71% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.61/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ring/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=The Ring|accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref> The site's consensus reads, \"With little gore and a lot of creepy visuals, ''The Ring'' gets under your skin, thanks to director Gore Verbinski's haunting sense of atmosphere and an impassioned performance from Naomi Watts.\" [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 57/100 (mixed or average) from 36 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[Metacritic]]|title=The Ring|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ring|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref> On ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Ebert & Roeper]]'', [[Richard Roeper]] gave the film \"Thumbs Up\" and said it was very gripping and scary despite some minor unanswered questions.

Despite the praise given to Verbinski's direction, critics described the characters as weak. The ''[[Chicago Reader]]''{{'}}s Jonathan Rosenbaum said that the film was \"an utter waste of Watts… perhaps because the script didn't bother to give her a character\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.filmspot.com/movie/279209/the-ring/reviews/critic.html?tag=scorecard;more|newspaper=The Chicago Reader|title=The Ring|accessdate=July 19, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234725/http://www.filmspot.com/movie/279209/the-ring/reviews/critic.html?tag=scorecard;more|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> whereas other critics such as William Arnold from ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' said the opposite: \"she projects intelligence, determination and resourcefulness that carry the movie nicely.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/The-Ring-is-plenty-scary-but-the-plot-is-a-bit-1098673.php|author=Arnold, William|title='The Ring' is plenty scary but the plot is a bit hairy|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 12, 2002|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref> Many critics regarded Dorfman's character as a \"creepy-child\" \"''[[The Sixth Sense|Sixth Sense]]'' cliché.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} A large sum of critics, like ''[[Miami Herald]]''{{'}}s Rene Rodriguez and ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Claudia Puig found themselves confused and thought that by the end of the movie \"[the plot] still doesn't make much sense\".{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

'''''The Ring''''' is a 2002 American [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Gore Verbinski]] and starring [[Naomi Watts]], [[Martin Henderson]], [[David Dorfman]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], and [[Daveigh Chase]]. It is a [[remake]] of the 1998 [[Japanese horror]] film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'', based on [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|the novel of the same name]] by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]]. Watts portrays a journalist who investigates a cursed videotape that seemingly kills the viewer seven days after watching it.

''The Ring'' was released theatrically on October 18, 2002, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the atmosphere and Watts's performance. The film grossed over $249 million worldwide on a $48 million production budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror remakes. It is the first installment of the [[The Ring (franchise)#American films|American ''Ring'' series]], and is followed by ''[[The Ring Two]]'' and ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'', which were released in 2005 and 2017, respectively.

''The Ring'' paved the way for English-language remakes of Asian horror films, such as ''[[The Grudge (2004 film)|The Grudge]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'', ''[[One Missed Call (2008 film)|One Missed Call]]'', ''[[The Eye (2008 film)|The Eye]]'', ''[[Shutter (2008 film)|Shutter]]'', ''[[Mirrors (2008 film)|Mirrors]]'', ''[[The Echo (2008 film)|The Echo]]'' and ''[[The Uninvited (2009 film)|The Uninvited]]''.

==Plot==
In [[Seattle]], teenagers Katie Embry and Becca Kotler discuss the legend of a cursed videotape; whoever watches it dies seven days later. Katie claims she watched the tape with three friends a week ago. Minutes later, Katie is killed by an unseen force, and Becca is institutionalized after witnessing it.

At Katie's funeral, her mother, Ruth, urges her sister Rachel Keller, a journalist, to investigate her daughter's death. Rachel lives with her young son Aidan, who possesses a degree of [[mediumship]]. Rachel learns Katie's friends all died on the same night, sporting disfigured appearances. Rachel travels to Shelter Mountain Inn where Katie stayed, discovering the rumoured cursed videotape. Renting the same cabin as Katie, Rachel watches the tape, which contains disturbing, gruesome imagery. Once the tape ends, Rachel receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers “seven days”.

Rachel recruits Noah Clay, her ex-boyfriend and Aidan's father, to study the tape, making a copy after he watches the original. Rachel begins to suffer supernatural symptoms as the week passes, haunted by a young girl with soaking wet hair. Investigation into the tape's imagery leads Rachel to Anna Morgan, a [[horse breeding|horse breeder]] from Moesko Island, who committed suicide after her prize-winning horses drowned themselves. Rachel catches Aidan watching the tape, and discovers Noah is suffering similar symptoms.

Leaving Aidan in Ruth's care, Rachel travels to Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard. On the ferry journey, a horse is spooked by Rachel's presence, leaping to its death. Noah goes to Eola Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. Both separately discover Anna had an adopted daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Samara]], who possessed an ability to [[thoughtography|psychically etch mental images]] onto surfaces and into minds, driving her parents mad. Rachel tries to speak with Richard about Samara, but he denies her existence.

Rachel speaks with Dr. Grasnik, the island's GP, who explains Samara was adopted due to Anna's [[infertility]], recommending them to admit her to Eola, assuming Samara is still there. Rachel sneaks into the Morgan farmhouse, watching a videotape of Samara in a psychotherapy session, who claims she has no control over her abilities. Rachel confronts Richard, who electrocutes himself in a bathtub with a [[bridle|horse bridle]] upon learning Samara's powers are still at large. Noah arrives, he and Rachel go to the barn, where Samara was isolated in the loft. They find a burnt image of a tree, Rachel recognizing it from Shelter Mountain.

They return to the cabin, locating a stone [[water well|well]] hidden under the floorboards; the final image on the tape. Rachel falls in the well, experiencing a vision of Anna suffocating Samara and throwing her down the well, sealing her in, where she drowned seven days later. Samara's corpse surfaces after Noah tells Rachel that the seven day deadline has passed.

The next day, Aidan tells Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara, revealing he is still cursed. In his apartment, Noah encounters the [[vengeful ghost]] of Samara emerge from his television, murdering him. Rachel, upon finding his disfigured corpse, returns home and destroys the original tape in a furious rage, asking why Noah was killed but she was not. She realizes that the difference is that she made a copy of the tape, which Aidan watched, thereby continuing the cycle that Samara wants to spread of duplicating the video and showing it to someone else to save oneself.

Rachel shows Aidan how to make his own copy. He remarks that the curse will never stop and asks what will happen to the person who watches the new tape, to which Rachel does not answer.

==Production==
===Development===
''The Ring'' went into production without a completed script.<ref name=iwgv>{{cite web|url=http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|title=Interview with Gore Verbinski|date=2002|publisher=curseofthering.com|accessdate=March 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113145/http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|archivedate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Ehren Kruger]] wrote three drafts of the screenplay before [[Scott Frank]] came on to do an uncredited rewrite. Verbinski was initially inspired to do a remake of ''Ringu'' after [[Walter F. Parkes]] sent him a VHS copy of the original Japanese film, which he describes as \"intriguing\", \"Pulp\" and \"avant-garde\".

Producer [[Neal Edelstein]] offered the remake to David Lynch to direct, but he turned it down. The original WGA-approved credits listed Hiroshi Takahashi (writer of the original 1998 screenplay for ''[[Ring (1998 film)|Ring]]'') but his name is absent from the final print.

The film also sought to retain the minimalism that was prevalent throughout ''Ringu'' and was decidedly set in [[Seattle]], due to its \"wet and isolated\" atmosphere. Verbinski also admitted to not wanting to cast \"big stars\" as he wanted his film to be \"discovered\" and describes the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as \"inevitable\" although he expressed desire for hardcore fans of the original to find the remake as equally compelling.<ref name=iwgv/>

==Soundtrack==
[[File:Theringtheme.ogg|thumb|right|The main theme of the film from the track ''The Well'', which is also known as \"Samara's Song\".]]
The film features an original score composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] (who would later collaborate on Gore Verbinski's other works). The soundtrack release did not coincide with the film's theatrical run. It was released in 2005, accompanying ''[[The Ring Two]]'' in an album that combined music from both ''The Ring'' and ''The Ring Two''. The soundtrack contains a few [[leitmotifs|themes]] associated with the characters, moods, and locations, including multiple uses of the [[Dies Irae]] theme.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The score makes use of [[string instrument]]s, [[piano]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

==Marketing==
In order to advertise ''The Ring'', many promotional websites were formed featuring the characters and places in the film. The video from the cursed videotape was played in late night programming over the summer of 2002 without any reference to the film.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==History of the community Nümbrecht==
1131 the place the first time was mentioned documentary namely in the \" papal possession confirmation for the inhabitant of Bonn Saint Cassiusstift \" (Documentary first namings of Oberbergischer places by Klaus Pampus).

Manner of writing of the first naming: '''Nuenbret'''

Regarding the development of Nümbrecht findings belay that since the stone time people in this zone have lived. Broken pieces of clay already refer to early trade relations. However the story of the community begins firstly in the early Middle Ages.

600–700 The first settlements begin in the area Oberberg.

Between 768 and 918 Probably Nümbrecht already exists as a settlement. (Nümbrecht means: measured district for a new settlement)

955 Probably the year of construction of the Evangelic Church Nümbrecht.

1131 First authentic mentions of the settlement Nümbrecht.

Between 900 and 1200 The settlement Marienberghausen arises.

1 December 1264 With the acceptance of the county of Sayn by [[Gottfried I]] begins the story of the domination by Homburg.

1268–76 Gottfried I builds the \"Castle Homburg\" as his residence.

1359 At that time the count of Sayn marries the daughter of the last count of Wittgenstein and expands its name to \"of Sayn count to Wittgenstein\".

1665 The chapel of Marienberghausen is completed to a church, that has retained its form until today.

1743 The Homburgische characteristic dynasty is gone out, the domination falls to the house Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg.

1792 Christian Heinrich, count of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg is raised in the sovereign state.

1806 Son Friedrich Albert loses the official power as a sovereign, because of the foundation of the Rhine alliance. After 530 years the Homburgian government is over.

1808 Both Marien Nümbrecht and Marienberghausen are established and are incorporated into the Napoleonic grand duchy Berg.

1813 The domination of the Frenchmen is concluded, and the Marien, renamed in mayor offices, stand under Prussian supremacy.

1845 The Rhine local code is released. On this base the first municipal council at Nümbrecht and also at Marienberghausen can be chosen.

1933 Government falls into the hands of members of the NSDAP, and anxiety and arbitrariness dominate Nümbrecht for 12 years.

1946 Democratic order is restored and a new municipal council is chosen.

1968 The administration of both municipalities Nümbrecht and Marienberghausen are joined.

1969 With the taking effect of the \"law about the reorganisation of the Oberbergischen Kreis\" the today's large community arises from Marienberghausen and Nümbrecht.

1973 Nümbrecht receives from the minister of work, health and social duties the national recognition as an air spa.

1987 the national recognition as a well-being climatic spa. The numerous cure and leisure time arrangements are developed further and supplemented.

==Sights==

===Watchtower===
The 30-metre high watchtower at the \"Lindchen\" in Nümbrecht has 154 steps; the top of the tower is 371 m above sea level. From the top, one can see the [[Rhine]], the [[Siebengebirge]] mountain range and even as far as the [[Rothaargebirge]] mountain range.

===Amiger tunnel===
This iron ore mining tunnel known as the Amiger tunnel is approximately 200 to 300 years old. The Amiger tunnel is situated in a forest area called \"In the Goldkaule\", below the \"Alfred Lang\" hut and the watchtower. The tunnel is approximately 20 meters long. However, according to local legends, the tunnel goes as far as the village [[Ödinghausen]]. Today the entry to the tunnel is shut off by a grating and only the bats know where the tunnel leads...

===Benroth===
The \"[[ecovillage]]\" Benroth is about five kilometers from Nümbrecht. The conversion of Benroth into an \"ecological village of the future\" required a few smaller and larger measures, such as the installation of a moist [[biotope]] and [[Dry-stone wall|drystone-wallings]]. The one-hour tour \"ecomile\" through the village allows an insight into the projects.

===Half timbering===
[[Image:Bruch-9k.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The eldest house in Bruch (1728)]]

There are a number of well-preserved half-timbering houses in the small village Bruch northeast of Nümbrecht. Most of them date back to the 19th century. Some of them were built on the foundation walls of the previous houses.

===Remarkable rocks===
Near Nümbrecht, small [[quartzite]] [[monadnock]]s from the [[Devonian]] period (approximately 360 million years ago) were exposed by erosion of softer sedimentary rock. [[Crinoid]]s (\"sea lily\") and [[brachiopod]] fossils have been discovered here (so they are neither erratic blocks from the [[ice age]] nor [[meteorite]]s, as was formerly believed).

===Witches' ponds===
[[File:Hexenweiher herbst08 -4.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Witches' ponds]]
Two ponds below the nearby village of Spreitgen are known as ''Hexenweiher'' (\"[[witch]]es' ponds\"). It is not known whether the name derives from actual [[witchcraft trial]]s by dunking during the [[Middle Ages]]. (In these trials the witches were thrown into a pond with their hands cuffed and their feet tied together. If they went under and drowned, they were considered to be innocent. If they survived they were proven to be a witch and often burnt.) [[#Castle Homburg|Castle Homburg]] is a historic site of witchcraft trials. In a trial on 14 September 1631, for example, six women were accused of being witches. Because they confessed, they were given mercy and beheaded instead of being burnt alive.

===Churches===
[[Image:Nümb-ki.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Ev. church Nümbrecht]]

The 1000-year-old church next to the castle in Nümbrecht is one of the most interesting sacral buildings of the area: the tower was built in [[romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]], the romanesque part of the interior features massive medieval pillars and reinforcing arches. The ribbed structure of the apses is typical of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Flat vaults were added at the end of the 17th century. The top construction of the tower and the altar reflects [[Baroque architecture]].

The church \"Bunte Kerke\" in Marienberghausen features medieval wall paintings. The building was changed and reconstructed several times and thus lost its original appearance of a typical fortified church. The west tower is all that is left from the original 12th-century building. The late Gothic paintings in the interior are preserved however. The paintings had been painted over during the
Protestant Reformation period and they surfaced when the organ was renovated in 1910. Only a couple of gothic wall paintings in the area are preserved to this day.

==History of the community Nümbrecht==
1131 the place the first time was mentioned documentary namely in the \" papal possession confirmation for the inhabitant of Bonn Saint Cassiusstift \" (Documentary first namings of Oberbergischer places by Klaus Pampus).

Manner of writing of the first naming: '''Nuenbret'''

Regarding the development of Nümbrecht findings belay that since the stone time people in this zone have lived. Broken pieces of clay already refer to early trade relations. However the story of the community begins firstly in the early Middle Ages.

600–700 The first settlements begin in the area Oberberg.

Between 768 and 918 Probably Nümbrecht already exists as a settlement. (Nümbrecht means: measured district for a new settlement)

955 Probably the year of construction of the Evangelic Church Nümbrecht.

1131 First authentic mentions of the settlement Nümbrecht.

Between 900 and 1200 The settlement Marienberghausen arises.

1 December 1264 With the acceptance of the county of Sayn by [[Gottfried I]] begins the story of the domination by Homburg.

1268–76 Gottfried I builds the \"Castle Homburg\" as his residence.

1359 At that time the count of Sayn marries the daughter of the last count of Wittgenstein and expands its name to \"of Sayn count to Wittgenstein\".

1665 The chapel of Marienberghausen is completed to a church, that has retained its form until today.

1743 The Homburgische characteristic dynasty is gone out, the domination falls to the house Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg.

1792 Christian Heinrich, count of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg is raised in the sovereign state.

1806 Son Friedrich Albert loses the official power as a sovereign, because of the foundation of the Rhine alliance. After 530 years the Homburgian government is over.

1808 Both Marien Nümbrecht and Marienberghausen are established and are incorporated into the Napoleonic grand duchy Berg.

1813 The domination of the Frenchmen is concluded, and the Marien, renamed in mayor offices, stand under Prussian supremacy.

1845 The Rhine local code is released. On this base the first municipal council at Nümbrecht and also at Marienberghausen can be chosen.

1933 Government falls into the hands of members of the NSDAP, and anxiety and arbitrariness dominate Nümbrecht for 12 years.

1946 Democratic order is restored and a new municipal council is chosen.

1968 The administration of both municipalities Nümbrecht and Marienberghausen are joined.

1969 With the taking effect of the \"law about the reorganisation of the Oberbergischen Kreis\" the today's large community arises from Marienberghausen and Nümbrecht.

1973 Nümbrecht receives from the minister of work, health and social duties the national recognition as an air spa.

1987 the national recognition as a well-being climatic spa. The numerous cure and leisure time arrangements are developed further and supplemented.

1992 The high school in Nümbrecht is founded.

1994 Founding of the Sophie Scholl school.

1995 Opening the Rhein-Sieg clinic - departments of Orthopedics and neurology - in Höhenstrasse in Nümbrecht.

2003 as the first local authority district in North Rhine-Westphalia Nümbrecht with the environmental roof brand Viabono (brand name for environment-friendly tourism) was distinguished. In addition, Nümbrecht was classed as a remedial-climatic health resort of the Premium Class.

==The coat of arms of Nümbrecht==
The arms were granted on 4 January 1936 and again in 1969.

The arms are identical to the arms of the Homburg Estate, a possession of the Counts of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. The castle is also used in the arms of the district. The Homburg is situated in the municipality. Above the left tower is the arms of the Counts themselves.

[[Image:Brunnen-kk.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Column well]]
The column well fountain in the health resort park was created by sculptor Michael Schwarze. It was built for the horticultural show (''Landesgartenschau'') held in Nürmbrecht in 1974. The figures of the well symbolize the age-old will of humans to free themselves from obligations of life.
The female figures are the symbols of beauty and fertility, the fists express force and assertiveness. The hand is an indication of understanding and work. The male leg stands for progress and conquest.

The winners were [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], who defeated [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] 2–0 in the final. This marked the only time two previous English champions have met in the final of this competition, and made Wolves the first former champions to have won the trophy, Portsmouth the only other having won the EFL trophy in 2019.

The competition began on 13 October 1987 and ended with the final on 29 May 1988.
The tournament begins with clubs divided into a Northern and a Southern section, and teams entering a preliminary group stage. Each section then gradually eliminates the qualifying teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists faced each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.

[[Category:1987–88 domestic association football cups]]","The '''1987–88 Associate Members' Cup''', known as the '''1987–88 Sherpa Van Trophy''' for sponsorship reasons, was the 5th staging of the [[Associate Members' Cup]], a knockout competition for [[English football]] clubs in the [[Football League Third Division|Third]] and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth]] Divisions (now known as [[Football League One|League One]] and [[Football League Two|Two]]).

The winners were [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], who defeated [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] 2–0 in the final. This marked the only time two previous English champions have met in the final of this competition, and made Wolves the first former champions to have won the trophy, Portsmouth the only other having won the EFL trophy in 2019.

The competition began on 13 October 1987 and ended with the final on 29 May 1988.
The tournament begins with clubs divided into a Northern and a Southern section, and teams entering a preliminary group stage. Each section then gradually eliminates the qualifying teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists faced each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.

'''Paul Albert Masvidal''' (born January 20, 1971) is a guitarist, singer, songwriter, artist, producer, and a founding member of the band [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]]. He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[Æon Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.

==Early life==

Paul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.

Masvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mettā Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].

== Career ==

Cynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.
[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|149x149px|Cynic - Focus]]
1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. ''Focus'' was listed in Rock Hard magazine's book as one of ''The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62273803|title=Best of Rock & Metal : die 500 stärksten Scheiben aller Zeiten|date=2005|publisher=Heel|others=Rensen, Michael., Heine, Uwe., Stratmann, Holger., Villalonga, Marc.|isbn=3-89880-517-4|location=Königswinter|oclc=62273803}}</ref>. ''[[Loudwire]]'' writer Graham Hartmann named Focus the ninth best debut metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/cynic-focus-best-debut-metal-albums/|title=No. 9: Cynic, 'Focus' – Best Debut Metal Albums|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. [[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. 

Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. 
[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[Æon Spoke]]]]



During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[Æon Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' Æon Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''.  Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.

[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]]
Cynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus. In his review,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/arts/music/01choi.html|title=New CDs|date=2008-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> ''New York Times'' music critic Ben Ratliff wrote that Cynic \"should be understood not so much alongside any metal bands but along with the radical harmonic progressives in the last 45 years of pop and jazz: composers like Milton Nascimento, the Beach Boys or Pat Metheny.\" 
[[File:Carbon-based anatomy by cynic.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Carbon Based Anatomy]]
Since ''Traced In Air'', Cynic has released two conceptual records: ''[[Re-Traced]]'' (2010), featuring re-interpretations of several ''Traced in Air'' tracks, and ''[[Carbon-Based Anatomy]]'' (2011). ''Rolling Stone'' music critic Hank Shteamer raved in his review<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16034-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/|title=Cynic: Carbon-Based Anatomy EP|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> of ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'': \"The title track is a perfectly paced stunner...Cynic sounds fully liberated, not just from their metal past but from any aesthetic concern other than assembling a great song.\"

In 2013, Masvidal joined forces with other original members of the Death ''Human'' line up and toured worldwide in honor of [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s legacy with the group DTA (Death to All). 
[[File:KindlyBentToFreeUs.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Kindly Bent to Free Us]]


Cynic's third full-length album, ''[[Kindly Bent to Free Us]]'', released in 2014, was hailed by [[Malcolm Dome|Malcome Dome]] of ''[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]'' magazine as \"an album that transcends all the limitations of genre and era... There are few albums which can claim such a remarkable hold.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/cynic-kindly-bent-to-free-us|title=Cynic: Kindly Bent To Free Us|last=February 2014|first=Malcolm Dome 11|website=Prog Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> The album rose to No. 4 on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s Heatseekers chart in February 2014 and was No. 1 on CMJ's Loud Rock Chart the following month.

\"Kindly Bent to Free Us [is] an album that, while most definitely in the realm of prog rock, has the kind of open, unpretentious air that makes Rush such an easy-to-love band.\" - [[AllMusic.com|allmusic.com]]

\"The alchemy of front man Paul Masvidal (vocals, guitars & keyboards) combined with rhythmaniac Sean Reinert (drums) and the technically divine Sean Malone (bass), make Cynic one of the finest Prog Rock bands to have ever of landed on Planet Earth\" - [https://burningfist.co.uk burningfist.co.uk][[File:Onward with Love.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Onward with Love, 2015]]



In 2015, Masvidal ventured into the performing-arts world with masked duo Onward with Love (OwL), a musical collaboration with acclaimed singer-songwriter [[Amy Correia]]. The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''. The duo officially released the song [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/onwardwithlove/kali-in-my-arms digitally] in 2019 have plans to release a full-length record by 2021.

In 2016, Masvidal, along with collaborator [[Amy Correia]], composed the musical score for the award-winning feature film ''[[The Tiger Hunter]]'', featuring lead actor [[Danny Pudi]] 

Masvidal also writes and performs music for television and motion pictures. His credits include main title (composer credit) on an Emmy nominated NBC teen series show ''[[Operation Junkyard]]'', short films ''The Yellow Umbrella'', ''A Bride in Black'', assistant to [[Ben Vaughn]] and session musician for Carsey Warner network sitcoms ''[[That '70s Show]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. Masvidal has a library songs regularly performed on network and cable television. Music writer Jeff Wagner, in ''[[Mean Deviation (book)|Mean Deviation]]'', stated that \"any viewer of ''3rd Rock from the Sun'', ''That '70s Show'', ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (2000 TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and any number of random television programs has probably stumbled across Cynic's core members without even knowing it.\" In 2015, Masvidal produced a children's album for actor [[Jim Carrey]] titled ''How Roland Rolls''.
[[File:Cynic Humanoid.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Humanoid (Single)]]


In January 2018, Cynic released a digital single, titled \"Humanoid\". The song marked the first new music from the progressive pioneers since the band's 2014 album ''Kindly Bent to Free Us''. The artwork for \"Humanoid\" features a detail from the painting \"Ayahuasca Dream\" by [[Robert Venosa]], Cynic's longtime collaborator and celebrated artist who passed away in 2011.






In 2019 and 2020 Masvidal ventured into releasing work as a solo artist under the name 'Masvidal' releasing three conceptual albums titled ''Mythical Human Vessel.'' The artwork for the three albums was designed by visual artists Igraine Grey and Jonatan Martinez aka [https://cargocollective.com/greymar/about Greymar]. <gallery mode=\"packed\">

In Masvidal's view, \"pain is not something to be feared but embraced as inevitable and, ultimately, a doorway.\" ''Billboard'' described the work ''Mythical Human Vessel'', finds Masvidal at his most vulnerable, often with just a guitar and vocals, while experimenting with brain entrainment, a series of pulsing sounds that are said to lead to enhanced neural perception and memory.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8513968/paul-masvidal-interview-brain-experiment|title=Paul Masvidal's Solo Project Doubles as a Brain Entrainment Experiment|date=2019-05-31|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

Ben Ratliff of the ''New York Times'' referred to Masvidal's \"philosophic lyrics\",<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/arts/music/02buried.html|title=From Jazz-Rock Fusion to Progressive Metal, With a Virtuosic Accompaniment|date=2010-02-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> stating that he is \"a musician who can expand his own sense of calm into an aggressive, extravagant art\".

==Personal life==

As an inventor, Masvidal filed a successful patent ([http://www.vidatak.com/index.html Vidatak] EZ Board US Patent No. 6,422,875) in 1999 (which was approved in 2002),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,422,875.PN.&OS=PN/6,422,875&RS=PN/6,422,875|title=United States Patent: 6422875 - Device for communicating with a voice-disabled patient}}</ref> involving a device to assist voice-disabled individuals. Masvidal's interest stems from his extensive volunteer work with AIDS patients, the terminally ill and the elderly in the Los Angeles area.

In May 2014, he publicly revealed his homosexuality along with fellow Cynic member [[Sean Reinert]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Brown | first= August | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-c1-gay-heavy-metal-20140508-story.html | title = Cynic's Paul Masvidal, Sean Reinert are out and ready to be loud | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = May 8, 2014 | accessdate = August 7, 2016 }}</ref>

'''Paul Albert Masvidal''' (born January 20, 1971) is a guitarist, singer, songwriter, artist, producer, and a founding member of the band [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]]. He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[Æon Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.

==Early life==

Paul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.

Masvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mettā Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].

== Career ==

Cynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.
[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|149x149px|Cynic - Focus]]
1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. ''Focus'' was listed in Rock Hard magazine's book as one of ''The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62273803|title=Best of Rock & Metal : die 500 stärksten Scheiben aller Zeiten|date=2005|publisher=Heel|others=Rensen, Michael., Heine, Uwe., Stratmann, Holger., Villalonga, Marc.|isbn=3-89880-517-4|location=Königswinter|oclc=62273803}}</ref>. ''[[Loudwire]]'' writer Graham Hartmann named Focus the ninth best debut metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/cynic-focus-best-debut-metal-albums/|title=No. 9: Cynic, 'Focus' – Best Debut Metal Albums|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. [[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. 

Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. '''Cynic took a 12 year hiatus''' in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] '''and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film.''' 
[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[Æon Spoke]]]]



During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[Æon Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' Æon Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''.  Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.

[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]]
Cynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus. In his review,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/arts/music/01choi.html|title=New CDs|date=2008-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> ''New York Times'' music critic Ben Ratliff wrote that Cynic \"should be understood not so much alongside any metal bands but along with the radical harmonic progressives in the last 45 years of pop and jazz: composers like Milton Nascimento, the Beach Boys or Pat Metheny.\" 
[[File:Carbon-based anatomy by cynic.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Carbon Based Anatomy]]
Since ''Traced In Air'', Cynic has released two conceptual records: ''[[Re-Traced]]'' (2010), featuring re-interpretations of several ''Traced in Air'' tracks, and ''[[Carbon-Based Anatomy]]'' (2011). ''Rolling Stone'' music critic Hank Shteamer raved in his review<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16034-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/|title=Cynic: Carbon-Based Anatomy EP|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> of ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'': \"The title track is a perfectly paced stunner...Cynic sounds fully liberated, not just from their metal past but from any aesthetic concern other than assembling a great song.\"

In 2013, Masvidal joined forces with other original members of the Death ''Human'' line up and toured worldwide in honor of [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s legacy with the group DTA (Death to All). 
[[File:KindlyBentToFreeUs.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Kindly Bent to Free Us]]


Cynic's third full-length album, ''[[Kindly Bent to Free Us]]'', released in 2014, was hailed by [[Malcolm Dome|Malcome Dome]] of ''[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]'' magazine as \"an album that transcends all the limitations of genre and era... There are few albums which can claim such a remarkable hold.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/cynic-kindly-bent-to-free-us|title=Cynic: Kindly Bent To Free Us|last=February 2014|first=Malcolm Dome 11|website=Prog Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> The album rose to No. 4 on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s Heatseekers chart in February 2014 and was No. 1 on CMJ's Loud Rock Chart the following month.

\"Kindly Bent to Free Us [is] an album that, while most definitely in the realm of prog rock, has the kind of open, unpretentious air that makes Rush such an easy-to-love band.\" - [[AllMusic.com|allmusic.com]]

\"The alchemy of front man Paul Masvidal (vocals, guitars & keyboards) combined with rhythmaniac Sean Reinert (drums) and the technically divine Sean Malone (bass), make Cynic one of the finest Prog Rock bands to have ever of landed on Planet Earth\" - [https://burningfist.co.uk burningfist.co.uk][[File:Onward with Love.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Onward with Love, 2015]]



In 2015, Masvidal ventured into the performing-arts world with masked duo Onward with Love (OwL), a musical collaboration with acclaimed singer-songwriter [[Amy Correia]]. The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''. The duo officially released the song [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/onwardwithlove/kali-in-my-arms digitally] in 2019 have plans to release a full-length record by 2021.

In 2016, Masvidal, along with collaborator [[Amy Correia]], composed the musical score for the award-winning feature film ''[[The Tiger Hunter]]'', featuring lead actor [[Danny Pudi]] 

Masvidal also writes and performs music for television and motion pictures. His credits include main title (composer credit) on an Emmy nominated NBC teen series show ''[[Operation Junkyard]]'', short films ''The Yellow Umbrella'', ''A Bride in Black'', assistant to [[Ben Vaughn]] and session musician for Carsey Warner network sitcoms ''[[That '70s Show]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. Masvidal has a library songs regularly performed on network and cable television. Music writer Jeff Wagner, in ''[[Mean Deviation (book)|Mean Deviation]]'', stated that \"any viewer of ''3rd Rock from the Sun'', ''That '70s Show'', ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (2000 TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and any number of random television programs has probably stumbled across Cynic's core members without even knowing it.\" In 2015, Masvidal produced a children's album for actor [[Jim Carrey]] titled ''How Roland Rolls''.
[[File:Cynic Humanoid.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Humanoid (Single)]]


In January 2018, Cynic released a digital single, titled \"Humanoid\". The song marked the first new music from the progressive pioneers since the band's 2014 album ''Kindly Bent to Free Us''. The artwork for \"Humanoid\" features a detail from the painting \"Ayahuasca Dream\" by [[Robert Venosa]], Cynic's longtime collaborator and celebrated artist who passed away in 2011.






In 2019 and 2020 Masvidal ventured into releasing work as a solo artist under the name 'Masvidal' releasing three conceptual albums titled ''Mythical Human Vessel.'' The artwork for the three albums was designed by visual artists Igraine Grey and Jonatan Martinez aka [https://cargocollective.com/greymar/about Greymar]. <gallery mode=\"packed\">

In Masvidal's view, \"pain is not something to be feared but embraced as inevitable and, ultimately, a doorway.\" ''Billboard'' described the work ''Mythical Human Vessel'', finds Masvidal at his most vulnerable, often with just a guitar and vocals, while experimenting with brain entrainment, a series of pulsing sounds that are said to lead to enhanced neural perception and memory.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8513968/paul-masvidal-interview-brain-experiment|title=Paul Masvidal's Solo Project Doubles as a Brain Entrainment Experiment|date=2019-05-31|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

Ben Ratliff of the ''New York Times'' referred to Masvidal's \"philosophic lyrics\",<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/arts/music/02buried.html|title=From Jazz-Rock Fusion to Progressive Metal, With a Virtuosic Accompaniment|date=2010-02-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> stating that he is \"a musician who can expand his own sense of calm into an aggressive, extravagant art\".

==Personal life==

As an inventor, Masvidal filed a successful patent ([http://www.vidatak.com/index.html Vidatak] EZ Board US Patent No. 6,422,875) in 1999 (which was approved in 2002),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,422,875.PN.&OS=PN/6,422,875&RS=PN/6,422,875|title=United States Patent: 6422875 - Device for communicating with a voice-disabled patient}}</ref> involving a device to assist voice-disabled individuals. Masvidal's interest stems from his extensive volunteer work with AIDS patients, the terminally ill and the elderly in the Los Angeles area.

In May 2014, he publicly revealed his homosexuality along with fellow Cynic member [[Sean Reinert]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Brown | first= August | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-c1-gay-heavy-metal-20140508-story.html | title = Cynic's Paul Masvidal, Sean Reinert are out and ready to be loud | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = May 8, 2014 | accessdate = August 7, 2016 }}</ref>

Miller began to encounter numerous legal problems in 2014. One of the dancers on ''Dance Moms'' sued Miller, charging assault.

The '''Bombay Army''' was the army of the [[Bombay Presidency]], one of the three presidencies of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] within the [[British Empire]].

The presidency armies, like the presidencies themselves, belonged to the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]] until the [[Government of India Act 1858]] (passed in the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]) transferred all three presidencies to the direct authority of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]].

In 1895 all three presidency armies were merged into the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]].

==History==
===18th century===
[[File:Sepoys of the 3rd Battalion at Bombay, 1773.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Sepoys of the 3rd Battalion of native infantry at Bombay, 1773]]
In the early stages of HEIC rule Bombay was rated as an unhealthy and unprofitable region. Accordingly, only a small garrison was maintained while emphasis was placed on creating a local navy (the \"Bombay Marine\") to control piracy. In 1742 the Bombay Army consisted of eight companies of European and Eurasian garrison troops, numbering 1,593 of all ranks.<ref name=Reid>{{cite book|first=Stuart|last=Reid|page=38|title=Armies of the East India Company 1750-1850|isbn=978-1-84603-460-2}}</ref> These had evolved from independent companies dating back as far as 1668 when the Company took over control of the city of Bombay.<ref name=raugh>Raugh, p. 55</ref><ref name=Mollo>{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Mollo|title=The Indian Army|isbn=0-7137-1074-8|year=1981}}</ref>{{rp|14}}

The [[Mahar]]s served in both Bombay Army and Marine battalions. Prior to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 they were heavily recruited and constituted between a fifth and a quarter of the entire Bombay Army.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102115844/http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic/sagar/spring.1994/richard.white.art.html|title=The Mahar Movement's Military Component|last=Richard B.|first=White|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

By 1783 the Bombay Army had grown to 15,000 men, a force that was still significantly smaller than the other two Presidency armies. Recruitment from the 1750s on had however been expanded to include a majority of indigenous sepoys, initially employed as irregulars for particular campaigns. The first two regular sepoy battalions were raised in 1768, a third in 1760 and a fourth ten years later.<ref name=\"Mollo\" />{{rp|16}} The non-Indian (mostly British but also including Swiss and German mercenaries) element was organized in a single Bombay European Regiment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/crownandcompany00unkngoog/page/n11|title=Crown and Company: the historical records of the 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers, formerly the 1st Bombay European Regiment|last1=Mainwaring|first1=Arthur Edward|last2=Wylly |first2=Harold Carmichael|publisher=A. L. Humphreys |year=1911}}</ref>

In 1796 the Bombay Native Infantry was reorganized into four regiments, each of two battalions. The Bombay Foot Artillery, which traced its history back nearly 50 years prior to this date, was brought up to six companies in strength in 1797.<ref>Carman, WY. (1969). \"Indian Army Uniforms - Artillery, Engineers and Infantry\". London: Morgan-Grampton. p. 34</ref>

The Bombay Army was heavily involved in the [[First Maratha War]] and the defeat of [[Tipu Sultan]] of Mysore in 1799.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishbattles.com/anglo-french-wars-in-india/storming-of-seringapatam/|title=Storming of Seringapatam|publisher=British Battles|accessdate=19 September 2019}}</ref>

[[File:P547b NATIVE OFFICERS OF THE BOMBAY ARMY. 1818.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Native Officers of the Bombay Army in dress uniform, 1818]]
Prior to the cessation of Company rule in 1861, the Bombay Army played a substantial role in campaigns against the [[Bani Bu Ali expedition|Bani Bu Ali in 1821]], in North-Western India, notably the 1st Afghan War of 1838–1842, the Sind War of 1843, the 2nd Sikh War of 1848-49 and the [[Persian War of 1856-57]]. The Bombay Army had acquired responsibility for garrisoning Aden, and The 1st Bombay European Regiment, The Bombay Marine Battalion and the 24th Bombay Native Infantry all saw service there in 1839.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mq.edu.au/macquarie-archive/seringapatam/regiments.html|title=British Military Forces at Seedaseer and Seringapatam in 1799|publisher=Macquarie University|accessdate=19 September 2019}}</ref>

The Bombay native infantry establishment continued to expand until it reached 26 regiments in 1845. Three Bombay Light Cavalry regiments were raised after 1817, plus a few troops of irregular horse. One brigade of Bombay Horse Artillery comprising both British and Indian personnel had been established by 1845, plus three battalions of foot artillery.<ref name=Reid />

The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] was almost entirely confined to the [[Bengal Army]]. Of the thirty-two Bombay infantry regiments in existence at the time only two mutinied.

===Post mutiny===
Following the transfer of HEIC rule to that of the British government in 1861 the Bombay Army underwent a series of changes. These included the disbandment of three regiments of Bombay Native Infantry and the recruitment of replacement units from the [[Baloch people|Beluchi]] population. Originally created as irregular units, the three \"Belooch\" regiments in their red trousers were to remain a conspicuous part of the Bombay Army for the remainder of its separate existence.<ref>Carman, WY. (1969). \"Indian Army Uniforms - Artillery, Engineers and Infantry\". London: Morgan-Grampton. pp. 182-3</ref>

By 1864 the Bombay Army had been reorganised as follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=The India office and Burma office list 1864 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b582714&view=1up&seq=490 |accessdate=19 September 2019}}</ref>

The '''Bombay Army''' was the army of the [[Bombay Presidency]], one of the three presidencies of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] within the [[British Empire]].

The presidency armies, like the presidencies themselves, belonged to the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]] until the [[Government of India Act 1858]] (passed in the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]) transferred all three presidencies to the direct authority of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]].

In 1895 all three presidency armies were merged into the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]].

==History==
===18th century===
[[File:Sepoys of the 3rd Battalion at Bombay, 1773.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Sepoys of the 3rd Battalion of native infantry at Bombay, 1773]]
In the early stages of HEIC rule Bombay was rated as an unhealthy and unprofitable region. Accordingly, only a small garrison was maintained while emphasis was placed on creating a local navy (the \"Bombay Marine\") to control piracy. In 1742 the Bombay Army consisted of eight companies of European and Eurasian garrison troops, numbering 1,593 of all ranks.<ref name=Reid>{{cite book|first=Stuart|last=Reid|page=38|title=Armies of the East India Company 1750-1850|isbn=978-1-84603-460-2}}</ref> These had evolved from independent companies dating back as far as 1668 when the Company took over control of the city of Bombay.<ref name=raugh>Raugh, p. 55</ref><ref name=Mollo>{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Mollo|title=The Indian Army|isbn=0-7137-1074-8|year=1981}}</ref>{{rp|14}}

The [[Mahar]]s served in both Bombay Army and Marine battalions. Prior to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 they were heavily recruited and constituted between a fifth and a quarter of the entire Bombay Army.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102115844/http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic/sagar/spring.1994/richard.white.art.html|title=The Mahar Movement's Military Component|last=Richard B.|first=White|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

By 1783 the Bombay Army had grown to 15,000 men, a force that was still significantly smaller than the other two Presidency armies. Recruitment from the 1750s on had however been expanded to include a majority of indigenous sepoys, initially employed as irregulars for particular campaigns. The first two regular sepoy battalions were raised in 1768, a third in 1760 and a fourth ten years later.<ref name=\"Mollo\" />{{rp|16}} The non-Indian (mostly British but also including Swiss and German mercenaries) element was organized in a single Bombay European Regiment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/crownandcompany00unkngoog/page/n11|title=Crown and Company: the historical records of the 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers, formerly the 1st Bombay European Regiment|last1=Mainwaring|first1=Arthur Edward|last2=Wylly |first2=Harold Carmichael|publisher=A. L. Humphreys |year=1911}}</ref>

In 1796 the Bombay Native Infantry was reorganized into four regiments, each of two battalions. The Bombay Foot Artillery, which traced its history back nearly 50 years prior to this date, was brought up to six companies in strength in 1797.<ref>Carman, WY. (1969). \"Indian Army Uniforms - Artillery, Engineers and Infantry\". London: Morgan-Grampton. p. 34</ref>

The Bombay Army was heavily involved in the [[First Maratha War]] and the defeat of [[Tipu Sultan]] of Mysore in 1799.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishbattles.com/anglo-french-wars-in-india/storming-of-seringapatam/|title=Storming of Seringapatam|publisher=British Battles|accessdate=19 September 2019}}</ref>

[[File:P547b NATIVE OFFICERS OF THE BOMBAY ARMY. 1818.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Native Officers of the Bombay Army in dress uniform, 1818]]
Prior to the cessation of Company rule in 1861, the Bombay Army played a substantial role in campaigns against the [[Bani Bu Ali expedition|Bani Bu Ali in 1821]], in North-Western India, notably the 1st Afghan War of 1838–1842, the Sind War of 1843, the 2nd Sikh War of 1848-49 and the [[Persian War of 1856-57]]. The Bombay Army had acquired responsibility for garrisoning Aden, and The 1st Bombay European Regiment, The Bombay Marine Battalion and the 24th Bombay Native Infantry all saw service there in 1839.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mq.edu.au/macquarie-archive/seringapatam/regiments.html|title=British Military Forces at Seedaseer and Seringapatam in 1799|publisher=Macquarie University|accessdate=19 September 2019}}</ref>

The Bombay native infantry establishment continued to expand until it reached 26 regiments in 1845. Three Bombay Light Cavalry regiments were raised after 1817, plus a few troops of irregular horse. One brigade of Bombay Horse Artillery comprising both British and Indian personnel had been established by 1845, plus three battalions of foot artillery.<ref name=Reid />

The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] was almost entirely confined to the [[Bengal Army]]. Of the thirty-two Bombay infantry regiments in existence at the time only two mutinied. After some initial uncertainty as to the loyalty of the remainder, it was deemed possible to send most of the British troops in the Presidency to Bengal, while the Bombay sepoy and [[sowar]] (cavalry) units held the southern districts of the North-West Frontier.<ref name=Mollo />{{rp|92}} Some Bombay units saw active service during the repression of the rebellion in Central India.<ref>{{cite book|first=Lt.

{{technical|date=January 2014}}
The '''salience''' (also called '''saliency''') of an item is the state or quality by which it stands out from its neighbors. Saliency detection is considered to be a key [[attention]]al mechanism that facilitates [[learning]] and survival by enabling organisms to focus their limited [[perception|perceptual]] and [[cognitive]] resources on the most pertinent subset of the available [[wikt:sensation|sensory]] [[data]].

Saliency typically arises from contrasts between items and their neighborhood, such as a red dot surrounded by white dots, a flickering message indicator of an answering machine, or a loud noise in an otherwise quiet environment. Saliency detection is often studied in the context of the [[visual perception|visual]] system, but similar mechanisms operate in other sensory systems. What is salient can be influenced by training: for example, for human subjects particular letters can become salient by training.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.1.1 |title=Controlled and automatic human information processing: I.

When attention deployment is driven by salient stimuli, it is considered to be bottom-up, [[memory]]-free, and reactive. Conversely, [[attention]] can also be guided by top-down, [[memory]]-dependent, or anticipatory mechanisms, such as when looking ahead of moving objects or sideways before crossing streets. Humans and other animals have difficulty paying attention to more than one item simultaneously, so they are faced with the challenge of continuously integrating and prioritizing different [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Neuroscience and psychology|bottom-up]] and [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Neuroscience and psychology|top-down]] influences.

==Neuroanatomy==
The brain component named the [[hippocampus]] helps with the assessment of salience and context by using past memories to filter new incoming stimuli, and placing those that are most important into long term memory.  The [[entorhinal]] cortex is the pathway into and out of the hippocampus, and is an important part of the brain's memory network; research shows that it is a brain region that suffers damage early on in [[Alzheimer's disease]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.3606 |pmid=24362760 |pmc=4044925 |title=Molecular drivers and cortical spread of lateral entorhinal cortex dysfunction in preclinical Alzheimer's disease |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=304–11 |year=2013 |last1=Khan |first1=Usman A |last2=Liu |first2=Li |last3=Provenzano |first3=Frank A |last4=Berman |first4=Diego E |last5=Profaci |first5=Caterina P |last6=Sloan |first6=Richard |last7=Mayeux |first7=Richard |last8=Duff |first8=Karen E |last9=Small |first9=Scott A }}</ref> one of the effects of which is altered (diminished) salience.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hbm.22248 |pmid=23418130 |title=Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease are related to functional connectivity alterations in the salience network |journal=Human Brain Mapping |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=1237–46 |year=2014 |last1=Balthazar |first1=Marcio L.

One group of neurons (i.e., [[D1-type]] [[medium spiny neuron]]s) within the [[nucleus accumbens shell]] (NAcc shell) assigns appetitive [[motivational salience]] (\"want\" and \"desire\", which includes a motivational component), aka [[incentive salience]], to [[rewarding stimuli]], while another group of neurons  (i.e., [[D2-type]] [[medium spiny neuron]]s) within the NAcc shell assigns aversive motivational salience to [[aversive stimuli]].<ref name=\"NAcc function\">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 147–148, 367, 376 | edition = 2nd | quote= VTA DA neurons play a critical role in motivation, reward-related behavior (Chapter 15), attention, and multiple forms of memory. This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (“wanting”) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid24107968\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1731-13.2013 |pmid=24107968 |pmc=3792469 |title=Parceling Human Accumbens into Putative Core and Shell Dissociates Encoding of Values for Reward and Pain |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=33 |issue=41 |pages=16383–93 |year=2013 |last1=Baliki |first1=M.

==In psychology==
The term is widely used in the study of perception and cognition to refer to any aspect of a stimulus that, for any of many reasons, stands out from the rest. Salience may be the result of emotional, motivational or cognitive factors and is not necessarily associated with physical factors such as intensity, clarity or size. Although salience is thought to determine attentional selection, salience associated with physical factors does not necessarily influence selection of a stimulus.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2004.01.005 |title=Latent inhibition, visual pop-out and schizotypy: Is disruption of latent inhibition due to enhanced stimulus salience? |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=1347–58 |year=2004 |last1=Tsakanikos |first1=Elias }}</ref>

===Salience bias===
'''Salience bias''' (also known as '''perceptual salience''') is the cognitive bias that predisposes individuals to focus on items that are more prominent or emotionally striking and ignore those that are unremarkable, even though this difference is often irrelevant by objective standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528121829/https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/salience-bias/|title=Salience Bias - The Decision Lab|website=https://thedecisionlab.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528121829/https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/salience-bias/ |archive-date=2019-05-28}}</ref> Salience bias is closely related to the concept of [[Availability heuristic|availability]] in [[behavioral economics]]:

{{Quote
|text=Accessibility and salience are closely related to availability, and they are important as well. If you have personally experienced a serious earthquake, you’re more likely to believe that an earthquake is likely than if you read about it in a weekly magazine. Thus, vivid and easily imagined causes of death (for example, tornadoes) often receive inflated estimates of probability, and less-vivid causes (for example, asthma attacks) receive low estimates, even if they occur with a far greater frequency (here, by a factor of twenty). Timing counts too: more recent events have a greater impact on our behavior, and on our fears, than earlier ones.

==Aberrant salience hypothesis of schizophrenia==

[[Shitij Kapur|Kapur]] (2003) proposed that a hyperdopaminergic state, at a \"brain\" level of description, leads to an aberrant assignment of salience to the elements of one's experience, at a \"mind\" level.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.1.13 |pmid=12505794 |title=Psychosis as a State of Aberrant Salience: A Framework Linking Biology, Phenomenology, and Pharmacology in Schizophrenia |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=2003 |last1=Kapur |first1=Shitij }}</ref>  These aberrant salience attributions have been associated with altered activities in the mesolimbic system, including the striatum, the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the parahippocampal gyrus.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0090792 |pmid=24619004 |pmc=3949688 |title=Abnormal Neural Processing during Emotional Salience Attribution of Affective Asymmetry in Patients with Schizophrenia |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=e90792 |year=2014 |last1=Lee |first1=Seon-Koo |last2=Chun |first2=Ji Won |last3=Lee |first3=Jung Suk |last4=Park |first4=Hae-Jeong |last5=Jung |first5=Young-Chul |last6=Seok |first6=Jeong-Ho |last7=Kim |first7=Jae-Jin |bibcode=2014PLoSO...990792L }}</ref> Dopamine mediates the conversion of the neural representation of an external stimulus from a neutral bit of information into an attractive or aversive entity, i.e. a salient event.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0165-0173(98)00019-8 |pmid=9858756 |title=What is the role of dopamine in reward: Hedonic impact, reward learning, or incentive salience? |journal=Brain Research Reviews |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=309–69 |year=1998 |last1=Berridge |first1=Kent C |last2=Robinson |first2=Terry E }}</ref>  Symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] may arise out of 'the aberrant assignment of salience to external objects and internal representations', and antipsychotic medications reduce positive symptoms by attenuating aberrant motivational salience via blockade of the [[Dopamine receptor|dopamine D2 receptors]] (Kapur, 2003).

Alternative areas of investigation include supplementary motor areas, frontal eye fields and parietal eye fields. These areas of the brain are involved with calculating predictions and visual salience. Changing expectations on where to look restructures these areas of the brain. This cognitive repatterning can result in some of the symptoms found in such disorders.

==Visual saliency modeling==

In the domain of [[psychology]], efforts have been made in modeling the mechanism of human attention, including the learning of prioritizing the different bottom-up and top-down influences.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0893-6080(97)00031-2 |pmid=12662494 |title=Task-Dependent Learning of Attention |journal=Neural Networks |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=981–992 |year=1997 |last1=Van De Laar |first1=Piërre |last2=Heskes |first2=Tom |last3=Gielen |first3=Stan |hdl=2066/24972 }}</ref>

In the domain of [[computer vision]], efforts have been made in modeling the mechanism of human attention, especially the bottom-up attentional mechanism<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/1658349.1658355 |title=Computational visual attention systems and their cognitive foundations |journal=ACM Transactions on Applied Perception |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–46 |year=2010 |last1=Frintrop |first1=Simone |last2=Rome |first2=Erich |last3=Christensen |first3=Henrik I. }}</ref>, including both [[Visual spatial attention|spatial]] and [[Visual temporal attention|temporal attention]]. Such a process is also called visual saliency detection.<ref>{{cite arXiv |author=A.

{{technical|date=January 2014}}
The '''salience''' (also called '''saliency''') of an item is the state or quality by which it stands out from its neighbors. Saliency detection is considered to be a key [[attention]]al mechanism that facilitates [[learning]] and survival by enabling organisms to focus their limited [[perception|perceptual]] and [[cognitive]] resources on the most pertinent subset of the available [[wikt:sensation|sensory]] [[data]].

Saliency typically arises from contrasts between items and their neighborhood, such as a red dot surrounded by white dots, a flickering message indicator of an answering machine, or a loud noise in an otherwise quiet environment. Saliency detection is often studied in the context of the [[visual perception|visual]] system, but similar mechanisms operate in other sensory systems. What is salient can be influenced by training: for example, for human subjects particular letters can become salient by training.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.1.1 |title=Controlled and automatic human information processing: I. Detection, search, and attention |journal=Psychological Review |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=1–66 |year=1977 |last1=Schneider |first1=Walter |last2=Shiffrin |first2=Richard M. }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.2.127 |title=Controlled and automatic human information processing: II.

When attention deployment is driven by salient stimuli, it is considered to be bottom-up, [[memory]]-free, and reactive. Conversely, [[attention]] can also be guided by top-down, [[memory]]-dependent, or anticipatory mechanisms, such as when looking ahead of moving objects or sideways before crossing streets. Humans and other animals have difficulty paying attention to more than one item simultaneously, so they are faced with the challenge of continuously integrating and prioritizing different [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Neuroscience and psychology|bottom-up]] and [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Neuroscience and psychology|top-down]] influences.

==Neuroanatomy==
The brain component named the [[hippocampus]] helps with the assessment of salience and context by using past memories to filter new incoming stimuli, and placing those that are most important into long term memory.  The [[entorhinal]] cortex is the pathway into and out of the hippocampus, and is an important part of the brain's memory network; research shows that it is a brain region that suffers damage early on in [[Alzheimer's disease]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.3606 |pmid=24362760 |pmc=4044925 |title=Molecular drivers and cortical spread of lateral entorhinal cortex dysfunction in preclinical Alzheimer's disease |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=304–11 |year=2013 |last1=Khan |first1=Usman A |last2=Liu |first2=Li |last3=Provenzano |first3=Frank A |last4=Berman |first4=Diego E |last5=Profaci |first5=Caterina P |last6=Sloan |first6=Richard |last7=Mayeux |first7=Richard |last8=Duff |first8=Karen E |last9=Small |first9=Scott A }}</ref> one of the effects of which is altered (diminished) salience.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hbm.22248 |pmid=23418130 |title=Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease are related to functional connectivity alterations in the salience network |journal=Human Brain Mapping |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=1237–46 |year=2014 |last1=Balthazar |first1=Marcio L.

The [[pulvinar nuclei]] (in the [[thalamus]]) modulates physical/perceptual salience in attentional selection.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0810086106 |jstor=40428498 |pmid=19237580 |pmc=2656203 |title=Impaired attentional selection following lesions to human pulvinar: Evidence for homology between human and monkey |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=10 |pages=4054–9 |year=2009 |last1=Snow |first1=J.

One group of neurons (i.e., [[D1-type]] [[medium spiny neuron]]s) within the [[nucleus accumbens shell]] (NAcc shell) assigns appetitive [[motivational salience]] (\"want\" and \"desire\", which includes a motivational component), aka [[incentive salience]], to [[rewarding stimuli]], while another group of neurons  (i.e., [[D2-type]] [[medium spiny neuron]]s) within the NAcc shell assigns aversive motivational salience to [[aversive stimuli]].<ref name=\"NAcc function\">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 147–148, 367, 376 | edition = 2nd | quote= VTA DA neurons play a critical role in motivation, reward-related behavior (Chapter 15), attention, and multiple forms of memory. This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (“wanting”) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid24107968\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1731-13.2013 |pmid=24107968 |pmc=3792469 |title=Parceling Human Accumbens into Putative Core and Shell Dissociates Encoding of Values for Reward and Pain |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=33 |issue=41 |pages=16383–93 |year=2013 |last1=Baliki |first1=M.

The V1  neural responses are sent to the  [[Superior colliculus|superior colluculus]] to guide gaze shifts to the salient locations. A fingerprint of the saliency map in V1 is that attention or gaze can be captured by the location of an eye-of-origin singleton in visual inputs, e.g., a bar uniquely shown to the left eye in a background of many other bars shown to the right eye, even when observers cannot tell the difference between the singleton and the background bars<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhaoping|first=L.|date=2008|title=Attention capture by eye of origin singletons even without awareness—A hallmark of a bottom-up saliency map in the primary visual cortex|url=https://doi.org/10.1167/8.5.1|journal=Journal of vision|volume=8|pages=|via=}}</ref>.

==In psychology==
The term is widely used in the study of perception and cognition to refer to any aspect of a stimulus that, for any of many reasons, stands out from the rest. Salience may be the result of emotional, motivational or cognitive factors and is not necessarily associated with physical factors such as intensity, clarity or size. Although salience is thought to determine attentional selection, salience associated with physical factors does not necessarily influence selection of a stimulus.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2004.01.005 |title=Latent inhibition, visual pop-out and schizotypy: Is disruption of latent inhibition due to enhanced stimulus salience? |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=1347–58 |year=2004 |last1=Tsakanikos |first1=Elias }}</ref>

===Salience bias===
'''Salience bias''' (also known as '''perceptual salience''') is the cognitive bias that predisposes individuals to focus on items that are more prominent or emotionally striking and ignore those that are unremarkable, even though this difference is often irrelevant by objective standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528121829/https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/salience-bias/|title=Salience Bias - The Decision Lab|website=https://thedecisionlab.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528121829/https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/salience-bias/ |archive-date=2019-05-28}}</ref> Salience bias is closely related to the concept of [[Availability heuristic|availability]] in [[behavioral economics]]:

{{Quote
|text=Accessibility and salience are closely related to availability, and they are important as well. If you have personally experienced a serious earthquake, you’re more likely to believe that an earthquake is likely than if you read about it in a weekly magazine. Thus, vivid and easily imagined causes of death (for example, tornadoes) often receive inflated estimates of probability, and less-vivid causes (for example, asthma attacks) receive low estimates, even if they occur with a far greater frequency (here, by a factor of twenty). Timing counts too: more recent events have a greater impact on our behavior, and on our fears, than earlier ones.

==Aberrant salience hypothesis of schizophrenia==

[[Shitij Kapur|Kapur]] (2003) proposed that a hyperdopaminergic state, at a \"brain\" level of description, leads to an aberrant assignment of salience to the elements of one's experience, at a \"mind\" level.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.1.13 |pmid=12505794 |title=Psychosis as a State of Aberrant Salience: A Framework Linking Biology, Phenomenology, and Pharmacology in Schizophrenia |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=2003 |last1=Kapur |first1=Shitij }}</ref>  These aberrant salience attributions have been associated with altered activities in the mesolimbic system, including the striatum, the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the parahippocampal gyrus.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0090792 |pmid=24619004 |pmc=3949688 |title=Abnormal Neural Processing during Emotional Salience Attribution of Affective Asymmetry in Patients with Schizophrenia |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=e90792 |year=2014 |last1=Lee |first1=Seon-Koo |last2=Chun |first2=Ji Won |last3=Lee |first3=Jung Suk |last4=Park |first4=Hae-Jeong |last5=Jung |first5=Young-Chul |last6=Seok |first6=Jeong-Ho |last7=Kim |first7=Jae-Jin |bibcode=2014PLoSO...990792L }}</ref> Dopamine mediates the conversion of the neural representation of an external stimulus from a neutral bit of information into an attractive or aversive entity, i.e. a salient event.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0165-0173(98)00019-8 |pmid=9858756 |title=What is the role of dopamine in reward: Hedonic impact, reward learning, or incentive salience? |journal=Brain Research Reviews |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=309–69 |year=1998 |last1=Berridge |first1=Kent C |last2=Robinson |first2=Terry E }}</ref>  Symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] may arise out of 'the aberrant assignment of salience to external objects and internal representations', and antipsychotic medications reduce positive symptoms by attenuating aberrant motivational salience via blockade of the [[Dopamine receptor|dopamine D2 receptors]] (Kapur, 2003).

Alternative areas of investigation include supplementary motor areas, frontal eye fields and parietal eye fields. These areas of the brain are involved with calculating predictions and visual salience. Changing expectations on where to look restructures these areas of the brain. This cognitive repatterning can result in some of the symptoms found in such disorders.

==Visual saliency modeling==

{{nihongo|'''''Argento Soma'''''|アルジェント ソーマ|Arujento Sōma}} is a 25-episode [[anime]] [[TV series]] that aired on [[TV Tokyo]] from October 6, 2000, to March 22, 2001.

Episode 26, {{nihongo|\"Alone and by myself\"|孤独と孤独|Kodoku to kodoku}}, was released [[OVA|direct-to-video]].

The anime was originally licensed by [[Bandai Entertainment]] in North America before going out of print in 2012. Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] announced at [[Otakon]] 2013, that [[Section23 Films#Sentai Filmworks|Sentai Filmworks]] has rescued ''Argento Soma'', along with a handful of other former BEI titles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sentai Filmworks Adds Sacred Seven, The Big O, Kurokami, More|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-10/sentai-filmworks-adds-sacred-seven-big-o-kurokami-more|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref>

In Japan, the title is stylized as {{lang|grc|ΑΠΗΕΝΤΟ ΣΟΜΑ}}; this is a misspelling of the [[Greek language|Greek]] title, which was supposed to be written as {{lang|grc|ΑΡΓΈΝΤΟ ΣΏΜΑ}}, which means \"The Silver Body\".

== Plot ==
In an effort to learn more about the metallic aliens that have been plaguing the planet for the past years, Dr. Noguchi and his assistant Maki Agata try to bring to life a construct pieced together from the destroyed aliens. They recruit Takuto Kaneshiro, Maki's boyfriend at the college they both attend, into this project because of his talent for metallurgy. While Takuto is unhappy with Maki keeping secrets from him again, he reluctantly helps with the project. However, in the process of reviving the monster that Dr. Noguchi has aptly called Frank (short for [[Frankenstein's monster]]), unidentified soldiers invade the MORGUE facility. They cut the power, leading to a power surge which violently brings Frank to life and causes an explosion that kills everyone, including Dr. Noguchi and Maki, in the facility, except Takuto.

\"Mr. X\" visits the scarred (emotionally and physically) Takuto in the hospital, and offers him a chance to get his vengeance on the monster he blames for killing Maki and destroying his life. Months later Lt. Ryu Soma is reborn from the ashes of Takuto's soul, as a military pilot who joins FUNERAL. This is the organization which deals with the attacking aliens, and has also recaptured Frank (who escaped after the explosion at MORGUE).

It quickly becomes clear that Ryu knows how to operate FUNERAL's SARGs. Suspicions arises from Dan as Ryu has more in his background than meets the eyes.

It quickly becomes clear that Frank has become the best weapon FUNERAL has to defend against the aliens, which leaves Ryu torn between revenge and the desire to protect his comrades. Further complicating the picture, the only person who can communicate with Frank is a young girl named Hattie (Harriet), who bears a striking resemblance to Ryu/Takuto's lost love Maki. As it becomes apparent that Frank is more than a simple monster, Ryu and his FUNERAL comrades have to come to terms with questions of human identity, grief, and loss.

Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] announced at [[Otakon]] 2013, that [[Section23 Films#Sentai Filmworks|Sentai Filmworks]] has rescued ''Argento Soma'', along with a handful of other former BEI titles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sentai Filmworks Adds Sacred Seven, The Big O, Kurokami, More|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-10/sentai-filmworks-adds-sacred-seven-big-o-kurokami-more|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref>

In Japan, the title is stylized as {{lang|grc|ΑΠΗΕΝΤΟ ΣΟΜΑ}}; this is a misspelling of the [[Greek language|Greek]] title, which was supposed to be written as {{lang|grc|ΑΡΓΈΝΤΟ ΣΏΜΑ}}, which means \"The Silver Body\".

== Plot ==
In an effort to learn more about the metallic aliens that have been plaguing the planet for the past years, Dr. Noguchi and his assistant Maki Agata try to bring to life a construct pieced together from the destroyed aliens. They recruit Takuto Kaneshiro, Maki's boyfriend at the college they both attend, into this project because of his talent for metallurgy. While Takuto is unhappy with Maki keeping secrets from him again, he reluctantly helps with the project. However, in the process of reviving the monster that Dr. Noguchi has aptly called Frank (short for [[Frankenstein's monster]]), unidentified soldiers invade the MORGUE facility. They cut the power, leading to a power surge which violently brings Frank to life and causes an explosion that kills everyone, including Dr. Noguchi and Maki, in the facility, except Takuto.

\"Mr. X\" visits the scarred (emotionally and physically) Takuto in the hospital, and offers him a chance to get his vengeance on the monster he blames for killing Maki and destroying his life. Months later Lt. Ryu Soma is reborn from the ashes of Takuto's soul, as a military pilot who joins FUNERAL. This is the organization which deals with the attacking aliens, and has also recaptured Frank (who escaped after the explosion at MORGUE).

It quickly becomes clear that Ryu knows how to operate FUNERAL’s SARGs. Suspicions arises from Dan as Ryu has more in his background than meets the eyes.

It quickly becomes clear that Frank has become the best weapon FUNERAL has to defend against the aliens, which leaves Ryu torn between revenge and the desire to protect his comrades. Further complicating the picture, the only person who can communicate with Frank is a young girl named Hattie (Harriet), who bears a striking resemblance to Ryu/Takuto's lost love Maki. As it becomes apparent that Frank is more than a simple monster, Ryu and his FUNERAL comrades have to come to terms with questions of human identity, grief, and loss.

The '''[[Beeching cuts]]''' were a reduction of route network and restructuring of [[British Rail]] in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.

Some former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.

== Completed reopenings ==

[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]

===London===
* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].
*

===South East===
* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]
* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] 
* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.

===South West===

* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].
* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service – now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] – was extended to Westbury.
* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.

The '''[[Beeching cuts]]''' were a reduction of route network and restructuring of [[British Rail]] in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.

Some former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.

The '''[[Beeching cuts]]''' were a reduction of route network and restructuring of [[British Rail]] in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.

Some former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.

The '''[[Beeching cuts]]''' were a reduction of route network and restructuring of [[British Rail]] in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.

Some former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.

===London===
* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].
*

* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.

===South West===

Altrincham was established by a [[Sunday school]] around 1891 as Rigby Memorial Club.<ref name=H1>[http://www.lusaweb.co.uk/history.htm Altrincham F.C., a Brief History] Altrincham F.C.</ref> They soon merged with another local team, Grapplers, to form Broadheath Football Club,<ref name=H1/> and were founder members of the [[Manchester Football League|Manchester League]] in 1893.<ref name=FCHD>{{fchd|id=ALTRINCH|name=Altrincham}}</ref> Their first match in the league on 16 September 1893 saw them lose 7–0 to Hulme, and they went on to lose 14 of the remaining league matches as they finished bottom of the table.<ref>[http://www.altrinchamfc.co.uk/altyhtol.htm A to Z of Altrincham Football Club] Altrincham F.C.</ref>

After playing at various grounds in [[Broadheath, Greater Manchester|Broadheath]], [[Timperley]] and Altrincham, the club moved to Pollitt's Field in 1903, at which point they changed their name to Altrincham.<ref name=H1/> They won the Cheshire Amateur Cup in their first season under the new name, and went on to win both the Manchester League and the [[Cheshire Senior Cup]] the following season.<ref name=H1/> They won the Manchester League again in [[1906–07 in English football|1906–07]], and moved to their current [[Moss Lane]] ground in 1910.<ref name=H1/> 

In 1911 the club joined Division Two of the [[Lancashire Combination]].<ref name=FCHD/> They finished as runners-up in their first season in the division, only missing out on the title on [[Goal difference|goal average]] and earning promotion to Division One.<ref name=FCHD/> They remained in Division One until [[World War I]]. When football resumed in 1919, the club were founder members of the [[Cheshire County League]], where they remained until [[World War II]], the highlights being finishing as runners-up in [[1934–35 in English football|1934–35]] and [[1935–36 in English football|1935–36]] and a League Cup win in [[1932–33 in English football|1932–33]].<ref name=H1/><ref name=FCHD/> In [[1934–35 FA Cup|1934–35]] they reached the first round of the [[FA Cup]] for the first time, losing 1–0 at [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]].<ref name=FCHD/>

After missing out the [[1945–46 in English football|1945–46]] season, they rejoined the Cheshire County League in 1946, achieving little success until the 1960s, when Altrincham director Noel White hired Freddie Pye as manager. A key turning point in the history of the club is often cited as the signing of [[Jackie Swindells]] in 1965, who in his first full season (1965–66) scored 82 goals.<ref>[http://www.altrinchamfc.co.uk/legend21.htm Altrincham Football Club Legends Section Eighteen Profiles 52–54] Altrincham F.C.</ref> helping Altrincham to the first of back-to-back Cheshire County League titles, scoring over 120 goals in the league in both seasons. After finishing as runners-up in [[1967–68 in English football|1967–68]], they were founder members of the [[Northern Premier League]] in 1968.<ref name=FCHD/>

They reached the semi-finals of the [[FA Trophy]] in [[1976–77 in English football|1976–77]], losing 2–1 to [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] in a second replay;<ref name=FCHD/> the season also saw them apply for election to the [[English Football League|Football League]] for the first time, but they received only 12 votes compared to the 27 received by the elected [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].<ref name=NLM/> The following season they went one better in the FA Trophy, reaching the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] final, where they beat [[Leatherhead F.C.|Leatherhead]] 3–1. In [[1978–79 Northern Premier League|1978–79]] they finished as runners-up in the Northern Premier League and applied for election to the Football League again. Although they finished as the top [[Non-League football|non-League]] club in the ballot, they received only 13 votes to the 37 received by [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]], the lowest-placed Football League club.<ref name=NLM>[http://www.nonleaguematters.co.uk/forum/gforum.cgi?do=post_attachment;postatt_id=3506; A history of admission to the Football League] Non-League Matters</ref> Instead, Altrincham became founder members of the [[National League (English football)|Alliance Premier League]], the top level of non-League football, the winner of which would be the sole non-League nomination for future Football League election ballots.

The league's [[1979–80 Alliance Premier League|inaugural season]] saw Altrincham crowned champions.<ref name=FCHD/> In the subsequent elections to the Football League, the club missing out by a single vote, receiving 25 to [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]]'s 26; this was considered especially unfortunate as the club had been promised the votes of [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], but the Grimsby representative was prevented from voting by being in the wrong part of the meeting room, whilst the Luton representative arrived too late after a mix-up over the start time.<ref>Dave Twydell (2001) ''Denied F.C.: The Football League election struggles'', Yore Publications, p27</ref> 

Altrincham retained the APL title the [[1980–81 Alliance Premier League|following season]], but again failed in the Football League elections, this time only receiving 15 votes to the 41 received by Halifax, who were again the lowest ranked Football League club.<ref name=NLM/> The next two seasons saw the club finish in mid-table, together with another FA Trophy final appearance in [[1981–82 FA Cup|1981–82]], this time losing 1–0 to [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]]. This was followed by four consecutive top-five finishes between 1984 and 1987 and a second FA Trophy win in 1985, beating [[Runcorn F.C. Halton|Runcorn]] 1–0 in the final. The [[1985–86 FA Cup|1985–86 season]] saw them record one of the biggest FA Cup giant-killings of all time when they defeated top division [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 2–1 at Birmingham's [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St Andrew's]].<ref>{{cite news |title=FA Cup: John Motson's 10 FA Cup third-round shocks |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30466552 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=2 January 2015 |accessdate=4 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50139021 |title=FA Cup first round: Guide to the 31 non-league teams taking part |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref>

[[Ustad]] '''Qamruddin \"Bismillah\" Khan''' (21 March 1916  – 21 August 2006) (born as Qamaruddin Khan), often referred to by the title ''Ustad'', was an Indian musician credited with popularizing the [[shehnai]], a [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinental]] wind instrument of the [[oboe]] class. While the shehnai had long held importance as a folk instrument played primarily [schooled] in traditional ceremonies, Khan is credited with elevating its status and bringing it to the concert stage.<ref name=\"Independent\">{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bismillah-khan-412865.html | title=Virtuoso musician who introduced the shehnai to a global audience | work=[[The Independent]] | date=22 August 2006 | accessdate=8 January 2013 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219221300/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bismillah-khan-412865.html | archivedate=19 December 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=b>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5270968.stm|title=Indian music's soulful maestro|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 August 2006|accessdate=1 January 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117092851/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5270968.stm|archivedate=17 November 2015}}</ref>

He was awarded India's highest civilian honour, the [[Bharat Ratna]], in 2001, becoming the third classical musician after [[M. S. Subbalakshmi]] and [[Ravi Shankar]] to be awarded Bharat Ratna.

==Ustad Bismillah Khan's Biography==
Khan was born on 21 March 1916 into a family of traditional [[Muslim]] musicians in Bhirung Raut Ki Gali, [[Dumraon]], in what is now the eastern Indian state of [[Bihar]], as the second son of Paigambar Bux Khan and Mitthan.<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news|last1=Massey|first1=Reginald|title=Bismillah Khan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/aug/22/guardianobituaries.india|accessdate=29 May 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 August 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618080516/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/aug/22/guardianobituaries.india|archivedate=18 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"ITC\">{{cite web|title=Ustad Bismillah Khan passes away |url=http://www.itcsra.org/sra_news_views/obituary/bismillah_khan.html |website=ITC Sangeet Research Academy |accessdate=29 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807160255/http://www.itcsra.org/sra_news_views/obituary/bismillah_khan.html |archivedate=7 August 2016  }}</ref> His father was a court musician employed in the court of Maharaja Keshav Prasad Singh of [[Dumraon|Dumraon Estate]] in Bihar. His grandfather Ustad Salar Hussain Khan and grandfather Rasool Bux Khan were also musicians in the Dumraon palace.<ref name=\"The Guardian\" /> He was named Qamruddin at birth, to rhyme with his elder brother's name Shamsuddin. Upon seeing the new born, his grandfather Rasool Baksh Khan, also a shehnai player, is said to have exclaimed \"Bismillah\", or \"In the name of Allah\", and thereafter he came to be known by this name.<ref name=\"Independent\" /><ref name=\"ITC\" />

At the age of six, he moved to Varanasi in the state of Uttar Pradesh,<ref name=\"b\" /> to be apprenticed to his maternal uncle, Ali Bux 'Vilayatu' Khan, a shehnai player attached to the [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]].<ref name=\"rupa\">''Bismillah Khan: The Shehnai Maestro'' by Neeraja Poddar, [[Rupa & Co.]], New Delhi, 2004.</ref>At the age of 14 Bismillah accompanied his uncle to the Allahabad music conference.

In 1932, at the age of 16, he entered into an arranged marriage with a cousin.

===Religious beliefs===
Although a devout [[Shia Muslim]], throughout his long career Khan took issue with rigidly orthodox Islamic elders who felt that playing such music on his shehnai was ''[[haram]]'' (contrary to the principles of his faith). Instead, Khansaheb, as he was usually respectfully called - came to be seen as an example of the [[Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb|successful, progressive culture that evolved out of the Hindu-Muslim encounter in India]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1526905/Bismillah-Khan.html |title=Bismillah Khan |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5270968.stm |title=Indian music's soulful maestro |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 September 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117092851/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5270968.stm |archivedate=17 November 2015}}</ref>

==Popular culture==
Khan had a brief association with movies. He played the shehnai for super star [[Rajkumar (actor)|Dr.Rajkumar]]'s role of ''Appanna'' in the [[Kannada]] movie ''[[Sanaadi Appanna]]'' which became a blockbuster. He acted in ''[[Jalsaghar]]'', a movie by [[Satyajit Ray]] and provided sound of shehnai in ''[[Goonj Uthi Shehnai]]'' (1959). Noted director [[Goutam Ghose]] directed ''[[Sange Meel Se Mulaqat]]'', a documentary about the life of Khan.<ref name=\"rupa\"/> In the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', there is a poster advertising \"Bismillah Khan and the seven musicians\" on a street of Berkeley, California. He as a five year old, played gilli danda near a pond in the ancient estate of Dumraon in Bihar. He would regularly go to the nearby Biharji temple to sing the Bhojpuri 'Chaita', at the end of which he would earn a big laddu weighing 1.25&nbsp;kg, a prize given by the local Maharaja.

==Students==
Khan attributed his skill to the blessings of Lord Vishwanath, and believed that there was little that he could teach his disciples.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/a-dying-fall-4519457/|title=A Dying Fall: Is the shehnai on its way out?|date=12 February 2017|work=The Indian Express|access-date=5 March 2018|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305202732/http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/a-dying-fall-4519457/|archivedate=5 March 2018}}</ref> Khan seldom accepted students.

[[Ustad]] '''Qamruddin \"Bismillah\" Khan''' (21 March 1916  – 21 August 2006) (born as Qamaruddin Khan), often referred to by the title ''Ustad'', was an Indian musician credited with popularizing the [[shehnai]], a [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinental]] wind instrument of the [[oboe]] class. While the shehnai had long held importance as a folk instrument played primarily [schooled] in traditional ceremonies, Khan is credited with elevating its status and bringing it to the concert stage.<ref name=\"Independent\">{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bismillah-khan-412865.html | title=Virtuoso musician who introduced the shehnai to a global audience | work=[[The Independent]] | date=22 August 2006 | accessdate=8 January 2013 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219221300/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bismillah-khan-412865.html | archivedate=19 December 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=b>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5270968.stm|title=Indian music's soulful maestro|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 August 2006|accessdate=1 January 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117092851/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5270968.stm|archivedate=17 November 2015}}</ref>

==Ustad Bismillah Khan's Biography==
Khan was born on 21 March 1916 into a family of traditional [[Muslim]] musicians in Bhirung Raut Ki Gali, [[Dumraon]], in what is now the eastern Indian state of [[Bihar]], as the second son of Paigambar Bux Khan and Mitthan.<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news|last1=Massey|first1=Reginald|title=Bismillah Khan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/aug/22/guardianobituaries.india|accessdate=29 May 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 August 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618080516/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/aug/22/guardianobituaries.india|archivedate=18 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"ITC\">{{cite web|title=Ustad Bismillah Khan passes away |url=http://www.itcsra.org/sra_news_views/obituary/bismillah_khan.html |website=ITC Sangeet Research Academy |accessdate=29 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807160255/http://www.itcsra.org/sra_news_views/obituary/bismillah_khan.html |archivedate=7 August 2016  }}</ref> His father was a court musician employed in the court of Maharaja Keshav Prasad Singh of [[Dumraon|Dumraon Estate]] in Bihar. His grandfather Ustad Salar Hussain Khan and grandfather Rasool Bux Khan were also musicians in the Dumraon palace.<ref name=\"The Guardian\" /> He was named Qamruddin at birth, to rhyme with his elder brother's name Shamsuddin. Upon seeing the new born, his grandfather Rasool Baksh Khan, also a shehnai player, is said to have exclaimed \"Bismillah\", or \"In the name of Allah\", and thereafter he came to be known by this name.<ref name=\"Independent\" /><ref name=\"ITC\" />

At the age of six, he moved to Varanasi in the state of Uttar Pradesh,<ref name=\"b\" /> to be apprenticed to his maternal uncle, Ali Bux 'Vilayatu' Khan, a shehnai player attached to the [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]].<ref name=\"rupa\">''Bismillah Khan: The Shehnai Maestro'' by Neeraja Poddar, [[Rupa & Co.]], New Delhi, 2004.</ref>At the age of 14 Bismillah accompanied his uncle to the Allahabad music conference.

In 1932, at the age of 16, he entered into an arranged marriage with a cousin.

===Religious beliefs===
Although a devout [[Shia Muslim]], throughout his long career Khan took issue with rigidly orthodox Islamic elders who felt that playing such music on his shehnai was ''[[haram]]'' (contrary to the principles of his faith). Instead, Khansaheb, as he was usually respectfully called - came to be seen as an example of the [[Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb|successful, progressive culture that evolved out of the Hindu-Muslim encounter in India]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1526905/Bismillah-Khan.html |title=Bismillah Khan |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5270968.stm |title=Indian music's soulful maestro |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 September 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117092851/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5270968.stm |archivedate=17 November 2015}}</ref>

==Popular culture==
Khan had a brief association with movies. He played the shehnai for super star [[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]]'s role of ''Appanna'' in the [[Kannada]] movie ''[[Sanaadi Appanna]]'' which became a blockbuster. He acted in ''[[Jalsaghar]]'', a movie by [[Satyajit Ray]] and provided sound of shehnai in ''[[Goonj Uthi Shehnai]]'' (1959). Noted director [[Goutam Ghose]] directed ''[[Sange Meel Se Mulaqat]]'', a documentary about the life of Khan.<ref name=\"rupa\"/> In the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', there is a poster advertising \"Bismillah Khan and the seven musicians\" on a street of Berkeley, California. He as a five year old, played gilli danda near a pond in the ancient estate of Dumraon in Bihar. He would regularly go to the nearby Biharji temple to sing the Bhojpuri 'Chaita', at the end of which he would earn a big laddu weighing 1.25&nbsp;kg, a prize given by the local Maharaja.

==Students==
Khan attributed his skill to the blessings of Lord Vishwanath, and believed that there was little that he could teach his disciples.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/a-dying-fall-4519457/|title=A Dying Fall: Is the shehnai on its way out?|date=12 February 2017|work=The Indian Express|access-date=5 March 2018|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305202732/http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/a-dying-fall-4519457/|archivedate=5 March 2018}}</ref> Khan seldom accepted students.

The machine shown runs in a 32-state version of von Neumann's cellular automata environment, not his original 29-state specification.]]

[[John von Neumann]]'s '''universal constructor''' is a [[self-replicating machine]] in a [[cellular automata]] (CA) environment. It was designed in the 1940s, without the use of a computer. The fundamental details of the machine were published in von Neumann's book ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'', completed in 1966 by [[Arthur Burks|Arthur W. Burks]] after von Neumann's death.<ref name=TSRA>{{Citation| url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''| author1=von Neumann, John| author2=Burks, Arthur W.| year=1966| publisher=University of Illinois Press| format=Scanned book online| archivedate=2015-06-24| accessdate=2017-02-28}}</ref>

Von Neumann's goal was to specify an abstract machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the machine consists of three parts: a 'blueprint' for itself, a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the machine (sans blueprint) specified by that blueprint, and a 'copy machine' that can make copies of any blueprint. After the mechanism has been used to construct the machine specified by the blueprint, the copy machine is used to create a copy of that blueprint, and this copy is placed into the new machine, resulting in a working replication of the original machine. Some machines will do this backwards, copying the blueprint and then building a machine.

To define his machine in more detail, von Neumann invented the concept of a cellular automaton. The [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|one he used]] consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of 29 states at any point in time. At each timestep, each cell updates its state depending on the states of the surrounding cells at the prior timestep. The rules governing these updates are identical for all cells.

The universal constructor is a certain pattern of cell states in this cellular automaton. It contains one line of cells that serve as a 'tape', encoding a sequence of instructions that serve as a 'blueprint' for the machine. The machine reads these instructions one by one and performs the corresponding actions. The instructions direct the machine to use its 'construction arm' to build a copy of the machine, without tape, at some other location in the cell grid. The tape can't contain instructions to build an equally long tape, just as a container can't contain a container of the same size. Therefore, the machine contains a separate 'copy machine' which reads the tape and places a copy into the newly constructed machine. The resulting new machine and tape is identical to the old one, and it proceeds to replicate again.

== Purpose ==

Von Neumann's design has traditionally been understood to be a demonstration of the logical requirements for machine self-replication.<ref name=McMullin2000>{{Citation|journal=Artificial Life|last=McMullin|first=B.|year=2000|title=John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards...|volume=6|issue=4|pages=347–361|url=http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~alife/bmcm-alj-2000/|doi=10.1162/106454600300103674|pmid=11348586}}</ref> However, it is clear that far simpler machines can achieve self-replication. Examples include trivial [[Crystal growth|crystal-like growth]], [[template replication]], and [[Langton's loops]]. But von Neumann was interested in something more profound: construction, universality, and evolution.<ref name=\"walenz.org\">[http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613231149/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}</ref>

This universal constructor can be seen as an abstract [[simulation]] of a physical [[universal assembler]].

Note that the simpler self-replicating CA structures (especially, [[Byl's loop]] and the [[Chou–Reggia loop]]) cannot exist in a wide variety of forms and thus have very limited [[evolvability]]. Other CA structures such as the [[Evoloop]] are somewhat evolvable but still don't support open-ended evolution. Commonly, simple replicators do not fully contain the machinery of construction, there being a degree to which the replicator is information copied by its surrounding environment. Although the Von Neumann design is a logical construction, it is in principle a design that could be instantiated as a physical machine. The issue of the environmental contribution to replication is somewhat open, since there are different conceptions of raw material and its availability.

The concept of a ''universal constructor'' is non-trivial because of the existence of [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden patterns]]. But a simple definition is that a universal constructor is able to construct any finite pattern of non-excited (quiescent) cells.

Von Neumann's crucial insight is that part of the replicator has a double use; being both an active component of the construction mechanism, and being the target of a passive copying process. This part is played by the tape of instructions in Von Neumann's combination of universal constructor plus instruction tape.

The combination of a universal constructor and a tape of instructions would i) allow self-replication, and also ii) guarantee that the open-ended complexity growth observed in biological organisms was possible.<ref name=McMullin2000/> The image below illustrates this possibility.

This insight is all the more remarkable because it preceded the discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule by [[James Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], though it followed the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] which identified [[DNA]] as the molecular carrier of genetic information in living organisms.<ref name=Rocha_lec_notes>{{citation |last=Rocha|first=Luis M.|title=Lecture Notes of I-585-Biologically Inspired Computing Course, Indiana University|contribution=Von Neumann and Natural Selection.|url=http://informatics.indiana.edu/rocha/i-bic/pdfs/ibic_lecnotes_c6.pdf}}</ref> The DNA molecule is processed by separate mechanisms that carry out its instructions and copy the DNA for insertion for the newly constructed cell. The ability to achieve open-ended evolution lies in the fact that, just as in nature, errors ([[mutation]]s) in the copying of the genetic tape can lead to viable variants of the automaton, which can then evolve via [[Natural Selection|natural selection]].

[[Image:Pesavento replicator inherited mutations.png|thumb|center|700px|A demonstration of the ability of von Neumann's machine to support inheritable mutations. (1) At an earlier timestep, a mutation was manually added to the second generation machine's tape. (2) Later generations both display the [[phenotype]] of the mutation (a drawing of a flower) and pass the mutation on to their children, since the tape is copied each time. This example illustrates how von Neumann's design allows for complexity growth (in theory) since the tape could specify a machine that is more complex than the one making it.]]

== Implementations ==

[[Arthur Burks]] and others extended the work of von Neumann, giving a much clearer and complete set of details regarding the design and operation of von Neumann's self-replicator. The work of J. W. Thatcher is particularly noteworthy, for he greatly simplified the design. Still, their work did not yield a complete design, cell by cell, of a configuration capable of demonstrating self-replication.

[[Renato Nobili]] and Umberto Pesavento published the first fully implemented self-reproducing cellular automaton in 1995, nearly fifty years after von Neumann's work.<ref name=Pesavento1995/><ref name=NobiliPesavento1996>{{Citation|last=Nobili|first=Renato|last2=Pesavento|first2=Umberto|contribution=Generalised von Neumann's Automata|title=Proc.

They also published an implementation of a general constructor within the original 29-state CA but not one capable of complete replication - the configuration cannot duplicate its tape, nor can it trigger its offspring; the configuration can only construct.<ref name=NobiliPesavento1996/><ref name=Automata2008/>

In 2004, D. Mange et al. reported an implementation of a self-replicator that is consistent with the designs of von Neumann.<ref>{{Citation|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE| title=A Macroscopic View of Self-replication| volume=92| issue=12| first=Daniel| last=Mange|last2=Stauffer|first2=A.|last3=Peparaolo|first3=L.|last4=Tempesti|first4=G.| pages=1929–1945| year=2004|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2004.837631}}</ref>

In 2007, Nobili published a 32-state implementation that uses [[run-length encoding]] to greatly reduce the size of the tape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129003524/http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2011 }}</ref>

In 2008, William R. Buckley published two configurations which are self-replicators within the original 29-state CA of von Neumann.<ref name=Automata2008>{{Citation|title=Proc. Automata 2008|contribution=Signal Crossing Solutions in von Neumann Self-replicating Cellular Automata| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley|editor=[[Andrew Adamatzky]] |editor2=Ramon Alonso-Sanz |editor3=Anna Lawniczak |editor4=Genaro Juarez Martinez |editor5=Kenichi Morita |editor6=Thomas Worsch |pages=453–503|publisher=Luniver Press|url=http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/free-books/automata2008reducedsize.pdf}}</ref> Buckley claims that the crossing of signal within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators.<ref name=Automata2008/> Buckley also points out that for the purposes of evolution, each replicator should return to its original configuration after replicating, in order to be capable (in theory) of making more than one copy. As published, the 1995 design of Nobili-Pesavento does not fulfill this requirement but the 2007 design of Nobili does; the same is true of Buckley's configurations.

In 2009, Buckley published with [[Golly (program)|Golly]] a third configuration for von Neumann 29-state cellular automata, which can perform either holistic self-replication, or self-replication by partial construction.  This configuration also demonstrates that signal crossing is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata.

C. L. Nehaniv in 2002, and also Y. Takada et al. in 2004, proposed a universal constructor directly implemented upon an asynchronous cellular automaton, rather than upon a synchronous cellular automaton.

As defined by von Neumann, universal construction entails the construction of passive configurations, only. As such, the concept of universal construction constituted nothing more than a literary (or, in this case, mathematical) device. It facilitated other proof, such as that a machine well constructed may engage in self-replication, while universal construction itself was simply assumed over a most minimal case. Universal construction under this standard is trivial. Hence, while all the configurations given here can construct any passive configuration, none can construct the real-time crossing organ devised by Gorman.<ref name=\"Automata2008\"/>

== Practicality ==

=== Computational cost ===

All the implementations of von Neumann's self-reproducing machine require considerable resources to run on computer. For example, in the Nobili-Pesavento 32-state implementation shown above, while the body of the machine is just 6,329 non-empty cells (within a rectangle of size 97x170), it requires a tape that is 145,315 cells long, and takes 63 billion timesteps to replicate. A simulator running at 1,000 timesteps per second would take over 2 years to make the first copy. In 1995, when the first implementation was published, the authors had not seen their own machine replicate. However, in 2008, the [[hashlife]] algorithm was extended to support the 29-state and 32-state rulesets in [[Golly (program)|Golly]]. On a modern desktop PC, replication now takes only a few minutes, although a significant amount of memory is required.

=== Evolvability ===

It has been argued that the problem Von Neumann was trying to address was not self-reproduction ''per se'', but the evolutionary growth of complexity.<ref name=McMullin2000/> His “proof-of-principle” designs showed how it is logically possible, by using a general purpose programmable (“universal”) constructor, to exhibit an indefinitely large class of self-reproducing machines, spanning a wide range of “complexity” (in von Neumann's sense of “the ability to do complicated things”), interconnected by a network of potential mutational pathways, including pathways from the most simple to the most complex. This is an important result, as prior to that, it might have been conjectured that there is a fundamental logical barrier to the existence of such pathways; in which case, biological organisms, which do support such pathways, could not be “machines”, as conventionally understood. But the result does not show what ''other'' conditions are necessary, in practice, for evolution along such pathways from simple to complex to be spontaneously realised or followed. In his unfinished work, he briefly considers conflict and interactions between his self-reproducing machines;<ref name=\"TSRA\"/>{{rp|147}} but in practice, his particular model cannot yield evolutionary dynamics because the machines are too fragile - the vast majority of perturbations cause them effectively to disintegrate.<ref name=McMullin2000/>

[[John von Neumann]]'s '''universal constructor''' is a [[self-replicating machine]] in a [[cellular automata]] (CA) environment. It was designed in the 1940s, without the use of a computer. The fundamental details of the machine were published in von Neumann's book ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'', completed in 1966 by [[Arthur Burks|Arthur W. Burks]] after von Neumann's death.<ref name=TSRA>{{Citation| url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''| author1=von Neumann, John| author2=Burks, Arthur W.| year=1966| publisher=University of Illinois Press| format=Scanned book online| archivedate=2015-06-24| accessdate=2017-02-28}}</ref>

Von Neumann's goal was to specify an abstract machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the machine consists of three parts: a 'blueprint' for itself, a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the machine (sans blueprint) specified by that blueprint, and a 'copy machine' that can make copies of any blueprint. After the mechanism has been used to construct the machine specified by the blueprint, the copy machine is used to create a copy of that blueprint, and this copy is placed into the new machine, resulting in a working replication of the original machine. Some machines will do this backwards, copying the blueprint and then building a machine.

To define his machine in more detail, von Neumann invented the concept of a cellular automaton. The [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|one he used]] consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of 29 states at any point in time. At each timestep, each cell updates its state depending on the states of the surrounding cells at the prior timestep. The rules governing these updates are identical for all cells.

The universal constructor is a certain pattern of cell states in this cellular automaton. It contains one line of cells that serve as a 'tape', encoding a sequence of instructions that serve as a 'blueprint' for the machine. The machine reads these instructions one by one and performs the corresponding actions. The instructions direct the machine to use its 'construction arm' to build a copy of the machine, without tape, at some other location in the cell grid. The tape can't contain instructions to build an equally long tape, just as a container can't contain a container of the same size. Therefore, the machine contains a separate 'copy machine' which reads the tape and places a copy into the newly constructed machine. The resulting new machine and tape is identical to the old one, and it proceeds to replicate again.

== Purpose ==

Von Neumann's design has traditionally been understood to be a demonstration of the logical requirements for machine self-replication.<ref name=McMullin2000>{{Citation|journal=Artificial Life|last=McMullin|first=B.|year=2000|title=John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards...|volume=6|issue=4|pages=347–361|url=http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~alife/bmcm-alj-2000/|doi=10.1162/106454600300103674|pmid=11348586}}</ref> However, it is clear that far simpler machines can achieve self-replication. Examples include trivial [[Crystal growth|crystal-like growth]], [[template replication]], and [[Langton's loops]]. But von Neumann was interested in something more profound: construction, universality, and evolution.<ref name=\"walenz.org\">[http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613231149/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}</ref>

This universal constructor can be seen as an abstract [[simulation]] of a physical [[universal assembler]].

Note that the simpler self-replicating CA structures (especially, [[Byl's loop]] and the [[Chou–Reggia loop]]) cannot exist in a wide variety of forms and thus have very limited [[evolvability]]. Other CA structures such as the [[Evoloop]] are somewhat evolvable but still don't support open-ended evolution. Commonly, simple replicators do not fully contain the machinery of construction, there being a degree to which the replicator is information copied by its surrounding environment. Although the Von Neumann design is a logical construction, it is in principle a design that could be instantiated as a physical machine. The issue of the environmental contribution to replication is somewhat open, since there are different conceptions of raw material and its availability.

The concept of a ''universal constructor'' is non-trivial because of the existence of [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden patterns]]. But a simple definition is that a universal constructor is able to construct any finite pattern of non-excited (quiescent) cells.

Von Neumann's crucial insight is that part of the replicator has a double use; being both an active component of the construction mechanism, and being the target of a passive copying process. This part is played by the tape of instructions in Von Neumann's combination of universal constructor plus instruction tape.

The combination of a universal constructor and a tape of instructions would i) allow self-replication, and also ii) guarantee that the open-ended complexity growth observed in biological organisms was possible.<ref name=McMullin2000/> The image below illustrates this possibility.

This insight is all the more remarkable because it preceded the discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule by [[James Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], though it followed the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] which identified [[DNA]] as the molecular carrier of genetic information in living organisms.<ref name=Rocha_lec_notes>{{citation |last=Rocha|first=Luis M.|title=Lecture Notes of I-585-Biologically Inspired Computing Course, Indiana University|contribution=Von Neumann and Natural Selection.|url=http://informatics.indiana.edu/rocha/i-bic/pdfs/ibic_lecnotes_c6.pdf}}</ref> The DNA molecule is processed by separate mechanisms that carry out its instructions and copy the DNA for insertion for the newly constructed cell. The ability to achieve open-ended evolution lies in the fact that, just as in nature, errors ([[mutation]]s) in the copying of the genetic tape can lead to viable variants of the automaton, which can then evolve via [[Natural Selection|natural selection]].

[[Image:Pesavento replicator inherited mutations.png|thumb|center|700px|A demonstration of the ability of von Neumann's machine to support inheritable mutations. (1) At an earlier timestep, a mutation was manually added to the second generation machine's tape. (2) Later generations both display the [[phenotype]] of the mutation (a drawing of a flower) and pass the mutation on to their children, since the tape is copied each time. This example illustrates how von Neumann's design allows for complexity growth (in theory) since the tape could specify a machine that is more complex than the one making it.]]

== Implementations ==

[[Arthur Burks]] and others extended the work of von Neumann, giving a much clearer and complete set of details regarding the design and operation of von Neumann's self-replicator. The work of J. W. Thatcher is particularly noteworthy, for he greatly simplified the design. Still, their work did not yield a complete design, cell by cell, of a configuration capable of demonstrating self-replication.

[[Renato Nobili]] and Umberto Pesavento published the first fully implemented self-reproducing cellular automaton in 1995, nearly fifty years after von Neumann's work.<ref name=Pesavento1995/><ref name=NobiliPesavento1996>{{Citation|last=Nobili|first=Renato|last2=Pesavento|first2=Umberto|contribution=Generalised von Neumann's Automata|title=Proc. Artificial Worlds and Urban Studies, Conference 1|year=1996|editor-last=Besussi|editor-first=E.|editor2-last=Cecchini|editor2-first=A.|location=Venice|publisher=DAEST|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/%7Ernobili/pdf_files/jvnconstr.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> They used a 32-state cellular automaton instead of von Neumann's original [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|29-state specification]], extending it to allow for easier signal-crossing, explicit memory function and a more compact design. They also published an implementation of a general constructor within the original 29-state CA but not one capable of complete replication - the configuration cannot duplicate its tape, nor can it trigger its offspring; the configuration can only construct.<ref name=NobiliPesavento1996/><ref name=Automata2008/>

In 2004, D. Mange et al. reported an implementation of a self-replicator that is consistent with the designs of von Neumann.<ref>{{Citation|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE| title=A Macroscopic View of Self-replication| volume=92| issue=12| first=Daniel| last=Mange|last2=Stauffer|first2=A.|last3=Peparaolo|first3=L.|last4=Tempesti|first4=G.| pages=1929–1945| year=2004|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2004.837631}}</ref>

In 2007, Nobili published a 32-state implementation that uses [[run-length encoding]] to greatly reduce the size of the tape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129003524/http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2011 }}</ref>

In 2008, William R. Buckley published two configurations which are self-replicators within the original 29-state CA of von Neumann.<ref name=Automata2008>{{Citation|title=Proc. Automata 2008|contribution=Signal Crossing Solutions in von Neumann Self-replicating Cellular Automata| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley|editor=[[Andrew Adamatzky]] |editor2=Ramon Alonso-Sanz |editor3=Anna Lawniczak |editor4=Genaro Juarez Martinez |editor5=Kenichi Morita |editor6=Thomas Worsch |pages=453–503|publisher=Luniver Press|url=http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/free-books/automata2008reducedsize.pdf}}</ref> Buckley claims that the crossing of signal within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators.<ref name=Automata2008/> Buckley also points out that for the purposes of evolution, each replicator should return to its original configuration after replicating, in order to be capable (in theory) of making more than one copy. As published, the 1995 design of Nobili-Pesavento does not fulfill this requirement but the 2007 design of Nobili does; the same is true of Buckley's configurations.

In 2009, Buckley published with [[Golly (program)|Golly]] a third configuration for von Neumann 29-state cellular automata, which can perform either holistic self-replication, or self-replication by partial construction.  This configuration also demonstrates that signal crossing is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata.

C. L. Nehaniv in 2002, and also Y. Takada et al. in 2004, proposed a universal constructor directly implemented upon an asynchronous cellular automaton, rather than upon a synchronous cellular automaton.

As defined by von Neumann, universal construction entails the construction of passive configurations, only. As such, the concept of universal construction constituted nothing more than a literary (or, in this case, mathematical) device. It facilitated other proof, such as that a machine well constructed may engage in self-replication, while universal construction itself was simply assumed over a most minimal case. Universal construction under this standard is trivial. Hence, while all the configurations given here can construct any passive configuration, none can construct the real-time crossing organ devised by Gorman.<ref name=\"Automata2008\"/>

== Practicality ==

=== Computational cost ===

All the implementations of von Neumann's self-reproducing machine require considerable resources to run on computer. For example, in the Nobili-Pesavento 32-state implementation shown above, while the body of the machine is just 6,329 non-empty cells (within a rectangle of size 97x170), it requires a tape that is 145,315 cells long, and takes 63 billion timesteps to replicate. A simulator running at 1,000 timesteps per second would take over 2 years to make the first copy. In 1995, when the first implementation was published, the authors had not seen their own machine replicate. However, in 2008, the [[hashlife]] algorithm was extended to support the 29-state and 32-state rulesets in [[Golly (program)|Golly]]. On a modern desktop PC, replication now takes only a few minutes, although a significant amount of memory is required.

=== Evolvability ===

It has been argued that the problem Von Neumann was trying to address was not self-reproduction ''per se'', but the evolutionary growth of complexity.<ref name=McMullin2000/> His “proof-of-principle” designs showed how it is logically possible, by using a general purpose programmable (“universal”) constructor, to exhibit an indefinitely large class of self-reproducing machines, spanning a wide range of “complexity” (in von Neumann's sense of “the ability to do complicated things”), interconnected by a network of potential mutational pathways, including pathways from the most simple to the most complex. This is an important result, as prior to that, it might have been conjectured that there is a fundamental logical barrier to the existence of such pathways; in which case, biological organisms, which do support such pathways, could not be “machines”, as conventionally understood. But the result does not show what ''other'' conditions are necessary, in practice, for evolution along such pathways from simple to complex to be spontaneously realised or followed. In his unfinished work he briefly considers conflict and interactions between his self-reproducing machines;<ref name=\"TSRA\"/>{{rp|147}} but in practice, his particular model cannot yield evolutionary dynamics because the machines are too fragile - the vast majority of perturbations cause them effectively to disintegrate.<ref name=McMullin2000/>

'''''PinkNews''''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[online newspaper]] marketed to the [[LGBT community|lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community]] ([[LGBT]]). It was founded by [[Benjamin Cohen (journalist)|Benjamin Cohen]] in 2005<ref name=\"Press Gazette 1\">{{cite web|last=Luft|first=Oliver|title=Pink News five years on: 'revenue could rise ten-fold'|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=45764|publisher=Press Gazette|accessdate=21 December 2011|date=28 July 2010}}</ref> and Sam Smith news for the LGBT community in the UK and worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=PinkNews |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/about-us/|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref> The UK editor as of March 2015 is Nick Duffy.<ref>{{cite web|title=PinkNews about|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/contact-us/|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref>

It closely follows political progress on LGBT rights around the world, and carries interviews with cultural figures, politicians and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Ministers]]. The news is split into different sections, with most recent, prominent and trending stories showing on the home page by default. People can filter news by the sections they have most interest in, including: ''transgender'', ''entertainment'', ''world'', ''politics'', ''arts'', and ''opinion''.

A paper version, ''The PinkNews'' was officially launched in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shoffman|first=Marc|title=The Pink News launches new gay era|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2006/06/29/the-pink-news-launches-new-gay-era/|newspaper=Pink News|date=29 June 2006}}</ref> However, ''PinkNews'' became an online-only publication when the print edition was dropped in 2007. The website continues to exist and is updated with news daily. Pinknews.co.uk is ranked the most visited LGBT website globally by SimilarWeb.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/category/people-and-society/gay,-lesbian,-and-bisexual|title=Top Gay, Lesbian, And Bisexual Websites in the world|website=www.similarweb.com}}</ref>

''PinkNews'' pays special attention to the topic of [[religion and homosexuality]]. It became one of the few LGBT publications to have interviewed a sitting [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 2014, when [[Justin Welby]] discussed the [[Church of England]]'s approach to homosexuality.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cohen|first=Benjamin|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/05/13/exclusive-archbishop-of-canterbury-its-great-that-equal-marriage-is-the-law-of-the-land/ |publisher=PinkNews |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2015 |title=Archbishop of Canterbury: It’s ‘great’ that equal marriage is the law of the land}}</ref>

''PinkNews'' also runs the PinkNews Awards, which launched in 2013 and take place in Westminster annually. The PinkNews Awards, which are voted on by the public alongside a panel of judges,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/09/26/the-nominees-for-the-fifth-annual-pinknews-awards/|title=The nominees for the fifth annual PinkNews Awards|work=PinkNews|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> honour the work of LGBT activists in the field as well as political speakers and businesses.

==Editorial policy and interviews with politicians==

==News International legal threat==
In 2006, ''PinkNews'' was threatened with legal action by [[News International]], the parent company of the British newspapers ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[News of the World]]''. Both newspapers published articles and a pixelated image between 12 and 19 February 2006 of what they claimed were a [[Premier League|Premiership]] [[Association football|footballer]] and a famous [[DJ]] engaging in a sex act with a [[mobile phone]] at a \"gay orgy\" with one using the headline \"Gay as You Go\". A week later ''PinkNews'' published what was claimed to be the [[Pixelation|unpixelated]] image from the [[Choice FM]] website superimposed on one from the printed articles in the newspapers, allegedly revealing the footballer as [[Ashley Cole]] and the DJ as Choice FM's Ian Thompson (DJ Masterstepz). Cole began legal action against both newspapers for libel, harassment and \"false privacy\" but not against ''PinkNews'', who had never made claims that either were gay. ''PinkNews'' claimed they were trying to expose the tactics of the ''NotW'' rather than \"[[Outing|out]]\" anyone but this backfired as both newspapers threatened to sue under the [[Theft Act 1978|Civil Liability Act]].
Cole's solicitors set up an online survey to investigate the impact, questioning respondents as to where they heard the story and if they discussed it in any forums. ''[[RWD Magazine]]'' allegedly had their forums shut down because of this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Months later the ''NotW'' and ''The Sun'' agreed to pay damages of £100,000, which would have closed ''PinkNews'', had they been [[Indictment|indicted]], and an apology was printed in the ''NotW'' stating: \"Although the photograph was pixelated some readers have understood Mr Cole to be one of the footballers and Masterstepz to be the DJ concerned. We are happy to make clear that Mr Cole and Masterstepz were not involved in any such activities. We apologise to them for any distress caused and we will be paying them each a sum in the way of damages.\" News International confirmed afterwards they would not be seeking damages from ''PinkNews''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Park |first=James |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/07/09/how-the-news-of-the-world-threatened-pinknews-after-ashley-cole-expose/ |title=How the News of the World threatened PinkNews after Ashley Cole expose |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=33515 |title=News of the World could sue website over Cole \"gay orgy\" story |publisher=Press Gazette |date=17 March 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/gay-news-site-threatened-if-ashley-cole-suit-succeeds/s2/a51765/ |title=Gay news site threatened if Ashley Cole suit succeeds &#124; Media news |publisher=Journalism.co.uk |date=16 March 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

==Relationship with Stonewall==
''PinkNews'' reported heavily on the refusal of [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]], an LGBT rights group, to actively campaign for marriage equality.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall's Chief Executive [[Ben Summerskill]] suggested \"it would cost a staggering £5 billion to implement\", a figure later seized upon by opponents of equality despite its lack of factual basis. The rift came to a head at Liberal Democrats conference in 2010, where Summerskill argued that \"there are lots of lesbians who actually don't want marriage\". The event was attended by [[Lynne Featherstone]], the minister for equality; [[Evan Harris]], president of Liberal Democrat LGBT group [[LGBT+ Liberal Democrats|DELGA]]; and [[Steve Gilbert]], the Lib Dem MP, all of which said they support same-sex marriage. A poll commissioned by ''PinkNews'' and answered by more than 800 of their readership found 98% in support of marriage equality, with many comments calling for Summerskill's resignation.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall was also criticised by a former founder, [[Michael Cashman|Michael Cashman, MEP]], over its policy.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?\">{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Andrew|title=What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?|url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/stonewall-gay-marriage-21378.html|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=LibDemVoice.org|date=28 September 2010}}</ref>

Summerskill later accused ''PinkNews'' of running an \"unethical campaign” against Stonewall after asking every LGBT organisation and political group to outline their stance on the issue, with only Stonewall refusing to comment. In October 2010, Stonewall revised its policy and agreed to support same-sex marriage, stating \"Stonewall is pleased to be widening its campaigning objectives to include extending the legal form of marriage to gay people\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20101204165931/http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2010 |title=Stonewall undermines campaign for gay marriage |publisher=Peter Tatchell |accessdate=22 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Geen |first=Jessica |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/10/27/stonewall-says-it-will-campaign-for-gay-marriage/ |title=Stonewall says it will campaign for gay marriage |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

''PinkNews'' also regularly reported on criticism of Stonewall for its refusal to campaign on transgender issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2008/11/07/celebs-split-over-trans-protests-at-stonewall-awards/|title=Celebs split over trans protest at Stonewall Awards|work=PinkNews|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> PinkNews has collaborated closely with Stonewall following the departure of Summerskill in 2014.

'''''PinkNews''''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[online newspaper]] marketed to the [[LGBT community|lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community]] ([[LGBT]]). It was founded by [[Benjamin Cohen (journalist)|Benjamin Cohen]] in 2005<ref name=\"Press Gazette 1\">{{cite web|last=Luft|first=Oliver|title=Pink News five years on: 'revenue could rise ten-fold'|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=45764|publisher=Press Gazette|accessdate=21 December 2011|date=28 July 2010}}</ref> and Sam Smith news for the LGBT community in the UK and worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=PinkNews |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/about-us/|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref> The UK editor as of March 2015 is Nick Duffy.<ref>{{cite web|title=PinkNews about|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/contact-us/|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref>

It closely follows political progress on LGBT rights around the world, and carries interviews with cultural figures, politicians and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Ministers]]. The news is split into different sections, with most recent, prominent and trending stories showing on the home page by default. People can filter news by the sections they have most interest in, including: ''transgender'', ''entertainment'', ''world'', ''politics'', ''arts'', and ''opinion''.

A paper version, ''The PinkNews'' was officially launched in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shoffman|first=Marc|title=The Pink News launches new gay era|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2006/06/29/the-pink-news-launches-new-gay-era/|newspaper=Pink News|date=29 June 2006}}</ref> However, ''PinkNews'' became an online-only publication when the print edition was dropped in 2007. The website continues to exist and is updated with news daily. Pinknews.co.uk is ranked the most visited LGBT website globally by SimilarWeb.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/category/people-and-society/gay,-lesbian,-and-bisexual|title=Top Gay, Lesbian, And Bisexual Websites in the world|website=www.similarweb.com}}</ref>

''PinkNews'' pays special attention to the topic of [[religion and homosexuality]]. It became one of the few LGBT publications to have interviewed a sitting [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 2014, when [[Justin Welby]] discussed the [[Church of England]]'s approach to homosexuality.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cohen|first=Benjamin|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/05/13/exclusive-archbishop-of-canterbury-its-great-that-equal-marriage-is-the-law-of-the-land/ |publisher=PinkNews |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2015 |title=Archbishop of Canterbury: It’s ‘great’ that equal marriage is the law of the land}}</ref>

''PinkNews'' also runs the PinkNews Awards, which launched in 2013 and take place in Westminster annually. The PinkNews Awards, which are voted on by the public alongside a panel of judges,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/09/26/the-nominees-for-the-fifth-annual-pinknews-awards/|title=The nominees for the fifth annual PinkNews Awards|work=PinkNews|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> honour the work of LGBT activists in the field as well as political speakers and businesses.

''PinkNews'' reported heavily on the refusal of [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]], an LGBT rights group, to actively campaign for marriage equality.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall's Chief Executive [[Ben Summerskill]] suggested \"it would cost a staggering £5 billion to implement\", a figure later seized upon by opponents of equality despite its lack of factual basis. The rift came to a head at Liberal Democrats conference in 2010, where Summerskill argued that \"there are lots of lesbians who actually don't want marriage\". The event was attended by [[Lynne Featherstone]], the minister for equality; [[Evan Harris]], president of Liberal Democrat LGBT group [[LGBT+ Liberal Democrats|DELGA]]; and [[Steve Gilbert]], the Lib Dem MP, all of which said they support same-sex marriage. A poll commissioned by ''PinkNews'' and answered by more than 800 of their readership found 98% in support of marriage equality, with many comments calling for Summerskill's resignation.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall was also criticised by a former founder, [[Michael Cashman|Michael Cashman, MEP]], over its policy.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?\">{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Andrew|title=What does Stonewall want if it isn’t gay marriage?|url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/stonewall-gay-marriage-21378.html|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=LibDemVoice.org|date=28 September 2010}}</ref>

Summerskill later accused ''PinkNews'' of running an \"unethical campaign” against Stonewall after asking every LGBT organisation and political group to outline their stance on the issue, with only Stonewall refusing to comment. In October 2010, Stonewall revised its policy and agreed to support same-sex marriage, stating \"Stonewall is pleased to be widening its campaigning objectives to include extending the legal form of marriage to gay people\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20101204165931/http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2010 |title=Stonewall undermines campaign for gay marriage |publisher=Peter Tatchell |accessdate=22 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Geen |first=Jessica |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/10/27/stonewall-says-it-will-campaign-for-gay-marriage/ |title=Stonewall says it will campaign for gay marriage |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

''PinkNews'' also regularly reported on criticism of Stonewall for its refusal to campaign on transgender issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2008/11/07/celebs-split-over-trans-protests-at-stonewall-awards/|title=Celebs split over trans protest at Stonewall Awards|work=PinkNews|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> PinkNews has collaborated closely with Stonewall following the departure of Summerskill in 2014.

[[File:Stratford Hall .entrance Westmoreland Virginia.jpg|thumb|View of the main facade, ''[[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]]'', [[Westmoreland County, Virginia|Westmoreland County]], ancestral home of the Lee family of [[Virginia]]. They, along with the [[William Byrd I|Byrds]], [[Robert Carter I|Carters]], [[Lawrence Washington (1659–1698)|Washingtons]], [[Harrison family of Virginia|Harrisons]] and others, were at the core of Virginia's [[aristocracy]] for centuries.]]
'''First Families of Virginia''' (FFV) were those families in [[Colonial Virginia]] who were socially prominent and wealthy, but not necessarily the earliest settlers.<ref> [[Lyon Gardiner Tyler|Tyler, Lyon Gardiner]], ed. (April 1915). \"The F. F. V.'s of Virginia\". William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine. Richmond, Virginia: Whittet & Shepperson. page 277.</ref> They descended from English colonists who primarily settled at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], [[Northern Neck|The Northern Neck]] and along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and other navigable waters in Virginia during the 17th century. These elite families generally married within their social class for many generations and, as a result, most surnames of First Families date to the colonial period.

The American Revolution cut ties with Britain but not with its social traditions. While some First Family members were loyal to Britain, others were Whigs who not only supported, but led the Revolution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gutzman |first=Kevin R. C. |title=Virginia's American Revolution: From Dominion tor Republic, 1776–1840 |location=Lanham |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7391-2131-3 }}</ref> Most First Families remained in Virginia, where they flourished as tobacco planters, and from the sale of slaves to the cotton states to the south. Indeed, many younger sons were relocated into the cotton belt to start their own plantations. The Civil War devastated the Virginia economy, and emancipated all the slaves without compensation. Planters and small farmers both were economically hurt, but in general the First Families, albeit poorer than before, maintained social and political leadership. [[Marshall Fishwick]] says that by the 1950s, \"the old-time aristocracy [had] not given up, or sunk into decadence as Southern novelists suggest.\" They adopted modern agricultural technology and co-opted rich \"Yankees\" into their upper-class, rural horse-estate society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fishwick |first=Marshall |title=F. F. V.'s |journal=American Quarterly |year=1959 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=147–156 |jstor=2710671 }}</ref>

==English heritage, second sons==
[[File:Mann Page II of Virginia Charles Bridges.jpeg|thumb|Mann Page II of [[Rosewell (plantation)|Rosewell]], painted by Charles Bridges.  The Rosewell plantation was called one of the finest homes in colonial America and built of brick imported from England.]]

English colonists who formed the FFV emigrated to the new [[Colony of Virginia]]. Their migration took place from the settlement of Jamestown through the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Interregnum]] period (1642–1660). Some royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King following the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, Charles II reputedly called Virginia his \"Old Dominion\" – a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early supposedly aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term \"distressed Cavaliers\", often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Some Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. FFVs often refer to Virginia as \"Cavalier Country\". These men were offered rewards of land, etc., by King Charles II, but most who had settled in Virginia stayed in Virginia.

Many such early settlers in Virginia were so-called \"Second Sons\". [[Primogeniture]] favored the first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Second or third sons went out to the colonies to make their fortune, or entered the military and the clergy. Tidewater Virginia evolved as a society descended from second or third sons of English gentry who inherited [[land grant]]s or land in Virginia. They formed part of what became the southern elite in America.

In some cases, longstanding ties among families of the English gentry were carried to the new colony, where they were reinforced by marriage and other relations. For instance, there were ancestral ties between the [[Nicholas Spencer|Spencer]] family of Bedfordshire and the [[Washington (name)|Washington]] family; a Spencer secured the land grant later purchased by the Washingtons, where they built their [[Mount Vernon]] home. These sorts of ties were common in the early colony, as families shuttled back and forth between England and Virginia, maintaining their connections with the mother country and with each other.

A thin network of increasingly interrelated families made up the planter elite and held power in colonial Virginia. \"As early as 1660 every seat on the ruling Council of Virginia was held by members of five interrelated families,\" writes British historian [[John Keegan]], \"and as late as 1775 every council member was descended from one of the 1660 councillors.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The American Civil War |page=[https://archive.org/details/americancivilwar00keeg/page/334 334] |first=John |last=Keegan |authorlink=John Keegan |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-26343-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/americancivilwar00keeg/page/334 }}</ref>

The ties among Virginia families were based on marriage. In a pre-Revolutionary War economy dependent on the production of tobacco as a commodity crop, the ownership of the best land was tightly controlled. It often passed between families of corresponding social rank. The Virginia economy was based on slave labor as the colony became a slave society. The landed gentry could keep tight rein on political power, which passed in somewhat orderly fashion from family to family. (In the more modern mercantile economy of the north, social mobility became more prominent. The power of the elite was muted by newcomers who gained wealth in the [[market economy]].)

==Pocahontas ==
[[File:Pocahontas by Simon van de Passe 1616.jpg|thumb|Pocahontas by [[Van de Passe family|Simon de Passe]]]]

[[Pocahontas]] (1595–1617), a [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]], was the daughter of  [[Chief Powhatan]], founder of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]]. According to [[Mattaponi]] and [[Patawomeck]] tradition, Pocahontas was previously married to a Patawomeck ''[[weroance]]'', Kocoum, who was murdered by Englishmen when [[Samuel Argall]] abducted her on April 13, 1613.<ref name=\"tides\">{{cite journal |last=Deyo |first=William \"Night Owl\" |date=5 September 2009 |title=Our Patawomeck Ancestors |url=http://patawomeckindians.org/Patawomeck%20Tides%202009.pdf |journal=Patawomeck Tides |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–7 |accessdate=6 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145119/http://patawomeckindians.org/Patawomeck%20Tides%202009.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Educated among the English of Virginia and converted to Christianity during her captivity in [[Henricus]], Pocahontas married colonist [[John Rolfe]] at a church in Jamestown on April 5, 1614. Rolfe had become prominent and wealthy as the first to successfully develop an export [[cash crop]] for the Colony with new varieties of tobacco. Their only child, [[Thomas Rolfe]], was born on January 30, 1615. He married and had a family: his descendants married into other elite families.

Pocahontas was much celebrated in London where she was welcomed with great ceremony at the Royal Court. She died young but became legendary as the first Indian from Virginia to become Christian, marry an Englishman, and have a known child from such a marriage. (There were no doubt mixed-race children born to lower-class colonists and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] women, although they may have been neither married nor Christian.) She became an important symbol of friendly Native American-English relations of the Jamestown colony. By virtue of many fictional accounts, her marriage was romanticized and became part of the mythology of early American history.<ref>[[Camilla Townsend]], ''Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma'' (2007)</ref><ref>F. W. Gleach, ''Powhatan's world and colonial Virginia'' (1997)</ref>

==Organizing the FFV==
In 1887, following the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Virginia Governor [[Wyndham Robertson]] wrote the first history of Pocahontas and her descendants, delineating the ancestry of FFV families including the Bollings, Clements, Whittles, Blands, Skipwiths, Flemings, Catletts, Gays, Jordans, Randolphs, Tazewells, and many others.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/pocahontasalias00robegoog <!-- quote=\"wyndham robertson\" pocahontas. --> Wyndham Robertson, ''Pocahontas, alias Matoaka, and Her Descendants''], Richmond VA: J. W. Randolph & English, 1887</ref> Excluded from this history were 'natural children', [[mixed-race]] descendants of unions with slaves.

Families often used surnames as given names, as in the \"Johns\" of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. A mother's maiden name might be used as a \"[[middle name]]\", to document that part of the person's ancestry. For example, Lt. Col. Powhatan Bolling Whittle of the [[38th Virginia Infantry]], [[Confederate States Army]] was an uncle of Matoaka Whittle Sims.<ref>[http://www.victorianvilla.com/sims-mitchell/history/whittle_pb/index.htm Lt. Col. Powhattan Bolling Whittle], Victorian Villa: Sims-Mitchell history</ref>

In 1907, the [[Jamestown Exposition]] was held near Norfolk to celebrate the tricentennial of the arrival of the first English colonists and the founding of Jamestown. [[Preservation Virginia]], formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was founded in Williamsburg in 1889 to memorialize Virginia history.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Blight |title=Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory |publisher=Belknap Press |edition=Paperback |year=2002 |isbn=0-674-00332-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/racereunion00davi }}</ref> In the 20th century, Preservation Virginia emphasized patriotism by highlighting the Founding Fathers that hailed from Virginia.<ref>{{cite journal |first=James M. |last=Lindgren |title=‘Virginia Needs Living Heroes’: Historic Preservation in the Progressive Era |journal=Public Historian |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=9–24 |jstor=3378156 }}</ref>

[[File:Stratford Hall .entrance Westmoreland Virginia.jpg|thumb|View of the main facade, ''[[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]]'', [[Westmoreland County, Virginia|Westmoreland County]], ancestral home of the Lee family of [[Virginia]]. They, along with the [[William Byrd I|Byrds]], [[Robert Carter I|Carters]], [[Lawrence Washington (1659–1698)|Washingtons]], [[Harrison family of Virginia|Harrisons]] and others, were at the core of Virginia's [[aristocracy]] for centuries.]]
'''First Families of Virginia''' (FFV) were those families in [[Colonial Virginia]] who were socially prominent and wealthy, but not necessarily the earliest settlers.<ref> [[Lyon Gardiner Tyler|Tyler, Lyon Gardiner]], ed. (April 1915). \"The F. F. V.'s of Virginia\". William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine. Richmond, Virginia: Whittet & Shepperson. page 277.</ref> They descended from English colonists who primarily settled at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], [[Northern Neck|The Northern Neck]] and along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and other navigable waters in Virginia during the 17th century. These elite families generally married within their social class for many generations and, as a result, most surnames of First Families date to the colonial period.

The American Revolution cut ties with Britain but not with its social traditions. While some First Family members were loyal to Britain, others were Whigs who not only supported, but led the Revolution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gutzman |first=Kevin R. C. |title=Virginia's American Revolution: From Dominion tor Republic, 1776–1840 |location=Lanham |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7391-2131-3 }}</ref> Most First Families remained in Virginia, where they flourished as tobacco planters, and from the sale of slaves to the cotton states to the south. Indeed, many younger sons were relocated into the cotton belt to start their own plantations. The Civil War devastated the Virginia economy, and emancipated all the slaves without compensation. Planters and small farmers both were economically hurt, but in general the First Families, albeit poorer than before, maintained social and political leadership. [[Marshall Fishwick]] says that by the 1950s, \"the old-time aristocracy [had] not given up, or sunk into decadence as Southern novelists suggest.\" They adopted modern agricultural technology and co-opted rich \"Yankees\" into their upper-class, rural horse-estate society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fishwick |first=Marshall |title=F. F. V.'s |journal=American Quarterly |year=1959 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=147–156 |jstor=2710671 }}</ref>

==English heritage, second sons==
[[File:Mann Page II of Virginia Charles Bridges.jpeg|thumb|Mann Page II of [[Rosewell (plantation)|Rosewell]], painted by Charles Bridges.  The Rosewell plantation was called one of the finest homes in colonial America and built of brick imported from England.]]

English colonists who formed the FFV emigrated to the new [[Colony of Virginia]]. Their migration took place from the settlement of Jamestown through the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Interregnum]] period (1642–1660). Some royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King following the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, Charles II reputedly called Virginia his \"Old Dominion\" – a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early supposedly aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term \"distressed Cavaliers\", often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Some Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. FFVs often refer to Virginia as \"Cavalier Country\". These men were offered rewards of land, etc., by King Charles II, but most who had settled in Virginia stayed in Virginia.

Many such early settlers in Virginia were so-called \"Second Sons\". [[Primogeniture]] favored the first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Second or third sons went out to the colonies to make their fortune, or entered the military and the clergy. Tidewater Virginia evolved as a society descended from second or third sons of English gentry who inherited [[land grant]]s or land in Virginia. They formed part of what became the southern elite in America.

In some cases, longstanding ties among families of the English gentry were carried to the new colony, where they were reinforced by marriage and other relations. For instance, there were ancestral ties between the [[Nicholas Spencer|Spencer]] family of Bedfordshire and the [[Washington (name)|Washington]] family; a Spencer secured the land grant later purchased by the Washingtons, where they built their [[Mount Vernon]] home. These sorts of ties were common in the early colony, as families shuttled back and forth between England and Virginia, maintaining their connections with the mother country and with each other.

A thin network of increasingly interrelated families made up the planter elite and held power in colonial Virginia. \"As early as 1660 every seat on the ruling Council of Virginia was held by members of five interrelated families,\" writes British historian [[John Keegan]], \"and as late as 1775 every council member was descended from one of the 1660 councillors.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The American Civil War |page=[https://archive.org/details/americancivilwar00keeg/page/334 334] |first=John |last=Keegan |authorlink=John Keegan |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-26343-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/americancivilwar00keeg/page/334 }}</ref>

The ties among Virginia families were based on marriage. In a pre-Revolutionary War economy dependent on the production of tobacco as a commodity crop, the ownership of the best land was tightly controlled. It often passed between families of corresponding social rank. The Virginia economy was based on slave labor as the colony became a slave society. The landed gentry could keep tight rein on political power, which passed in somewhat orderly fashion from family to family. (In the more modern mercantile economy of the north, social mobility became more prominent. The power of the elite was muted by newcomers who gained wealth in the [[market economy]].)

==Pocahontas ==
[[File:Pocahontas by Simon van de Passe 1616.jpg|thumb|Pocahontas by [[Van de Passe family|Simon de Passe]]]]

[[Pocahontas]] (1595–1617), a [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]], was the daughter of  [[Chief Powhatan]], founder of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]]. According to [[Mattaponi]] and [[Patawomeck]] tradition, Pocahontas was previously married to a Patawomeck ''[[weroance]]'', Kocoum, who was murdered by Englishmen when [[Samuel Argall]] abducted her on April 13, 1613.<ref name=\"tides\">{{cite journal |last=Deyo |first=William \"Night Owl\" |date=5 September 2009 |title=Our Patawomeck Ancestors |url=http://patawomeckindians.org/Patawomeck%20Tides%202009.pdf |journal=Patawomeck Tides |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–7 |accessdate=6 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145119/http://patawomeckindians.org/Patawomeck%20Tides%202009.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Educated among the English of Virginia and converted to Christianity during her captivity in [[Henricus]], Pocahontas married colonist [[John Rolfe]] at a church in Jamestown on April 5, 1614. Rolfe had become prominent and wealthy as the first to successfully develop an export [[cash crop]] for the Colony with new varieties of tobacco. Their only child, [[Thomas Rolfe]], was born on January 30, 1615. He married and had a family: his descendants married into other elite families.

Pocahontas was much celebrated in London where she was welcomed with great ceremony at the Royal Court. She died young but became legendary as the first Indian from Virginia to become Christian, marry an Englishman, and have a known child from such a marriage. (There were no doubt mixed-race children born to lower-class colonists and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] women, although they may have been neither married nor Christian.) She became an important symbol of friendly Native American-English relations of the Jamestown colony. By virtue of many fictional accounts, her marriage was romanticized and became part of the mythology of early American history.<ref>[[Camilla Townsend]], ''Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma'' (2007)</ref><ref>F. W. Gleach, ''Powhatan's world and colonial Virginia'' (1997)</ref>

==Organizing the FFV==
In 1887, following the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Virginia Governor [[Wyndham Robertson]] wrote the first history of Pocahontas and her descendants, delineating the ancestry of FFV families including the Bollings, Clements, Whittles, Blands, Skipwiths, Flemings, Catletts, Gays, Jordans, Randolphs, Tazewells, and many others.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/pocahontasalias00robegoog <!-- quote=\"wyndham robertson\" pocahontas. --> Wyndham Robertson, ''Pocahontas, alias Matoaka, and Her Descendants''], Richmond VA: J. W. Randolph & English, 1887</ref> Excluded from this history were 'natural children', [[mixed-race]] descendants of unions with slaves.

Families often used surnames as given names, as in the \"Johns\" of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. A mother's maiden name might be used as a \"[[middle name]]\", to document that part of the person's ancestry. For example, Lt. Col. Powhatan Bolling Whittle of the [[38th Virginia Infantry]], [[Confederate States Army]] was an uncle of Matoaka Whittle Sims.<ref>[http://www.victorianvilla.com/sims-mitchell/history/whittle_pb/index.htm Lt. Col. Powhattan Bolling Whittle], Victorian Villa: Sims-Mitchell history</ref>

In 1907, the [[Jamestown Exposition]] was held near Norfolk to celebrate the tricentennial of the arrival of the first English colonists and the founding of Jamestown. [[Preservation Virginia]], formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was founded in Williamsburg in 1889 to memorialize Virginia history.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Blight |title=Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory |publisher=Belknap Press |edition=Paperback |year=2002 |isbn=0-674-00332-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/racereunion00davi }}</ref> In the 20th century, Preservation Virginia emphasized patriotism by highlighting the Founding Fathers that hailed from Virginia.<ref>{{cite journal |first=James M. |last=Lindgren |title=‘Virginia Needs Living Heroes’: Historic Preservation in the Progressive Era |journal=Public Historian |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=9–24 |jstor=3378156 }}</ref>

'''Lois Lowry''' (born '''Lois Ann Hammersberg''' on March 20, 1937) is a [[American writer|U.S. writer]]. She is the author of several books for children and young adults, including ''[[The Giver Quartet]]'' and ''[[Number the Stars]]''. She is known for writing about difficult subject matters and complex themes in works for young audiences. 

Lowry has won two [[Newbery Medal]]s: for ''[[Number the Stars]]'' in 1990 and ''[[The Giver]]'' in 1994.<ref name=\"newbery\" />  Her book ''[[Gooney Bird Greene]]'' won the 2002 [[Rhode Island Children's Book Award]].

==Personal life==
Lowry was born on March 20, 1937, in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]],<ref name=pabook/> to parents Katherine Gordon Landis and Robert E. Hammersberg. Initially, Lowry's parents named her \"Cena\"  for her Norwegian grandmother but upon hearing this, her grandmother [[telegram|telegraphed]] and instructed Lowry's parents that the child should have an American name.<ref>[http://www.loislowry.com/pdf/Richmond_Speech.pdf Lois Lowry<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927111800/http://www.loislowry.com/pdf/Richmond_Speech.pdf |date=September 27, 2015 }}</ref>  

Lowry was the middle child, with an older sister, Helen, and a younger brother, Jon.<ref>{{cite web |title=My Brother Jon |url=http://www.loislowry.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69%3Amy-brother-jon&catid=37%3Abiography&Itemid=196 |website=Lois Lowry |accessdate=14 April 2019}}</ref> Helen died of cancer in 1962<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />, but Lowry and her brother still share a close relationship.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.loislowry.com/bio.html Lois Lowry – Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128115700/http://www.loislowry.com/bio.html |date=January 28, 2016 }}</ref>

Lowry's father had a career as a dentist and an arm officer whose work moved the family all over the United States and to many parts of the world. Lowry and her family moved from Hawaii to [[Brooklyn]], New York, in 1939 when Lowry was two years old. They relocated in 1942 to her mother's hometown, [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]], when Lowry's father was deployed to the Pacific during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />

Following World War II, Lowry and her family moved to Tokyo, Japan, where her father was stationed from 1948–1950.

{{efn |name=giver |1=
With the release of ''[[Son (novel)|Son]]'' (2012), the ''Giver'' series has been redefined as a finished \"quartet\" of fantasy novels. While ''[[Gathering Blue]]'' (2000) and ''[[Messenger (novel)|Messenger]]'' (2004) were only loosely related companions to ''[[The Giver]]'' (1993), ''Son'' ties all three storylines together, with \"heroes and fates colliding in a final, epic struggle.\"<br/>

With the release of ''[[Son (novel)|Son]]'' (2012), the ''Giver'' series has been redefined as a finished \"quartet\" of fantasy novels. While ''[[Gathering Blue]]'' (2000) and ''[[Messenger (novel)|Messenger]]'' (2004) were only loosely related companions to ''[[The Giver]]'' (1993), ''Son'' ties all three storylines together, with \"heroes and fates colliding in a final, epic struggle.\"<br/>

{{lead too short|date=November 2013}}
'''C. W. Smith''' (born 1940) is a [[novelist]], short-story and essay writer who serves as a Dedman Family Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at [[Southern Methodist University]].

==Early life==
[[File:Cw-smith.jpg|thumb|C.W. Smith]]
C. W. Smith (full name Charles William Smith) was born in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], and grew up in [[Hobbs, New Mexico]]. He received a B.A. in English from the [[University of North Texas]] in 1964 and an M.A. in English from [[Northern Illinois University]] in 1967. After teaching at [[Southwest Missouri State University]], he moved to [[Mexico]] for a year to work on his first novel, ''Thin Men of Haddam''. Published by Viking/Grossman in 1973, the book won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the [[Texas Institute of Letters]] for the Best Novel by a Texan or about Texas and was recognized by the Southwestern Library Association for making a “distinguished contribution to an understanding of a vital social issue in the American Southwest.” .”<ref>Citation awarded at 25th Biennial Conference, Galveston, TX, October 16–18, 1974</ref>

==Career==
Smith has said that his goal since beginning his first novel has been “to document in a dramatic fashion the cultural conflicts of the American Southwest as well as the universal, existential dilemmas that arise from being human regardless of place and time.” <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://smu.edu/english/People/FacultyProfiles/Smith.htm |title=Department of English - Department of English - Dedman College - SMU |access-date=2011-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045311/http://smu.edu/english/People/FacultyProfiles/Smith.htm |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In pursuit of that goal, his second novel, set in West Texas among oil field workers and small-town citizens, sought to portray the lives of young people trapped in circumstances too small for their aspirations. That novel, Country Music (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1975), was optioned by Playboy Productions. The novel was reviewed widely with largely, though not universally, positive notices: \"Smith's portrait of a troubled young man searching for himself he knows not where...is alive, funny, sad, and as real as it can be.\" <ref>Publishers Weekly, May 26, 1975, p.53</ref> \"The characters are convincing. The pace is unusually fast for a [[psychological novel]]. Smith is a writer of growing importance.\" <ref>Sullenger, Lee. Library Journal, July 8, 1975</ref> \"C.W. Smith’s technique has the impact of that of Claude Simon, the Provencal farmer-novelist who creates arresting amalgams of past, present, reverie and locale. Can’t do much better than that.<ref>Levin, Martin. New and Novel in The New York Times Book Review, May 5, 1974.</ref> ''The New Yorker'', on the other hand, posted that “This novel is easy to enjoy on a cartoon level, but only on that level…”<ref>The New Yorker, September 1, 1975, p. 66</ref>

Largely on the strength of the two novels, Smith was awarded a Dobie-Paisano Fellowship at the University of Texas, where he spent a year working on short stories. He was then hired to adapt the novel to the screen and spend time in Los Angeles working with producers on a script while his family resettled in Indianapolis. When the family returned to Texas, Smith became a reporter and film critic for ''The Dallas Times-Herald'' and subsequently began teaching at Southern Methodist University. His third novel, ''The Vestal Virgin Room'' (Atheneum, 1983), focused on a pair of married itinerant musicians, Mid-Westerners, whose efforts to secure fame in Las Vegas results in a strain in a marriage already under stress due to the loss of their only child. The novel has been optioned by three different producers with three different scripts, one by playwright Jonathan Tolins (“The Twilight of the Golds”), and the latest by producer Ed Bates with a screenplay by playwright and screenwriter David Dean Bottrell (“Dearly Departed”).

Smith then embarked upon a long historical novel based loosely upon the life of an Osage who was called in the press in the 1920s and 1930s “the world’s richest Indian.” ''Buffalo Nickel'' was published in 1989 by Simon & Schuster after nearly a decade of writing and revision. \"The destruction of native American cultures might be considered by some readers to be a literary dry hole. But this novel, about a Kiowa man who inadvertently becomes an Oklahoma oil millionaire, is a rich gusher of a novel - and consequently disproves any such notions….This is a big novel, in all senses - the characters and the incidents of their lives made memorably real.\" <ref>Gaughan, Thomas, in Booklist, August 7, 1989</ref> \"Critic Bruce Allen, writing in USA Today, said that “Buffalo Nickel is a delightful rarity: an old-fashioned ‘good read’ which tells the life story of a likable and interesting character who truly grows and changes....The novel is a roomy, agreeably slow-paced picaresque whose serious themes (the abrading of Indian culture, the gradual disappearance of space and wilderness) emerge with haunting clarity from a prose that continuously suggests and dramatizes, never once breaking into sermon. ''Buffalo Nickel'' may well be the year's best novel..\"<ref>Allen, Bruce, in USA Today, February 28, 1990</ref>

During the 1980s and 1990s, Smith wrote non-fiction as well as novels and short stories. He was, briefly, the ethics columnist for ''Esquire'' and the film critic for ''Texas Monthly''. As a freelance journalist and essayist, his work appeared in magazines and periodicals both scholarly and commercial. A cover article entitled “Uncle Dad” published by ''Esquire'' <ref>March 1985</ref> became a full-length memoir about his efforts to remain a part of his children’s lives after a divorce. The book, commissioned and published by Putnam, was also released under the author’s original title in a subsequent paperback edition by Berkley. His nonfiction work has been recognized through various awards: [[Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Awards|Penney-Missouri Special Merit Award]] for Feature Writing; the Stanley Walker Award for Journalism from the Texas Institute of Letters, and the award for Best Nonfiction Book by a Texan in 1987 from the Southwestern Booksellers Association.

In 1994, Texas Christian University Press began its long association with Smith’s works through the publication of his short-story collection, ''Letters From the Horse Latitudes''. Most of the stories in the collection were previously published, and his short fiction has appeared in ''Mademoiselle, Vision, Southwest Review, Sunstone Review, Carolina Quarterly, New Mexico Humanities Review, Quartet, Cimarron Review, [[American Literary Review]], American Short Fiction,'' ''The Missouri Review,'' and ''descant''. Writing about the collection in ''The New York Times'', Benjamin Cheever said, ”Set in Mexico and the American Southwest, Mr. Smith's stories have a rugged informality. Their sense of intimacy is so great that the reader feels he has uncovered a cache of personal letters or is overhearing a late-night conversation between friends. And yet, like the stories of O. Henry, each is cleverly contrived to capture some essence of life and also to make a point. Today most O. Henry stories read like antiques, dependent for their effects on credulous readers and illuminated with false optimism. But the world that Mr. Smith dramatizes is both contemporary and convincing.\" .”<ref>Cheever, Benjamin, in The New York Times Book Review, October 30, 1994, p.42</ref> His stories have received the Frank O'Connor Memorial Short Story Award from ''Quartet;'' the John H. McGinnis Short Story Award from ''Southwest Review'', as well as a Pushcart Prize nomination. An excerpt from his story “The Plantation Club” was included in, “Seeing Jazz: Artists and Writers on Jazz,” published by Chronicle Books in the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (1997). His short story, “The Bundelays,” was performed by Judith Ivey as part of the Dallas Museum of Arts’ “Arts and Letters Live Series,” as well as at sister programs in Denver and Houston.

Smith’s next novel, ''Hunter’s Trap'' (TCU Press, 1996), was designed to be an oblique sequel to the earlier Buffalo Nickel and the second part of a projected trilogy treating the theme of Native American assimilation into Anglo-European culture after the defeat of the Plains tribes by the U.S. military in the last quarter of the 19th century. “Somewhat reminiscent of the stories of Jim Harrison…Smith's novel offers an evocative exploration of the values and character of a time, a place, and a man. It's also a novel that would grace the lists of fine trade publishers, but refreshingly, it comes to us from a university press. Here's hoping that many readers come to know this skillfully wrought tale and that its success encourages TCU Press to bring us more such books.\" (Booklist) \"It's an eye for an eye - obsessive hatred, relentless pursuit and coldblooded revenge for irrevocable loss - in this hypnotic sequel to Smith's highly-praised western, Buffalo Nickel....The plot...moves inexorably to a stunning irony on the final page.\" .\"<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-87565-162-0 Fiction Review: Hunter's Trap by C. W. Smith, Author Texas Christian University Press $22.5 (216p)] {{ISBN|978-0-87565-162-0}}</ref> \"Beautifully bitter Depression-era revenge melodrama in which good guys lose, good women die, and virtue's reward is unreasonable tragedy.\" <ref>Kirkus Reviews, August 1, 1996.</ref>

Smith returned to more contemporary settings in his subsequent novel, ''Understanding Women'' (TCU Press, 1998), a coming-of-age story that takes place in the late 1950s when its sixteen-year-old protagonist and narrator leaves his home in Dallas to spend a summer working for his uncle in the oil fields. The novel won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the Texas Institute of Letters from the Best Novel of 1998 by a Texan or about Texas <ref>”Writers Honored,” in Dallas Morning News, April 11, 1999, p., 45A</ref> and also received an award from the Border Regional Library Association as an “Outstanding Book About the Southwest,” and the book garnered a starred review in Booklist.<ref>DeCandido, GraceAnne, in Booklist, September 1, 1998</ref>

''Gabriel's Eye'' (Winedale Publishing, 2001) utilizes Smith’s intimate knowledge of contemporary Dallas to focus upon the affair between a female teacher and her student at a local performing arts high school. While the book did secure mild praise from a reviewer in ''Publisher’s Weekly'', it went largely unnoticed in the press, although the Austin Chronicle gave it a full-length, somewhat mixed review. .<ref>Catmull, Katherine, \"Readings,\" in The Austin Chronicle, May 25, 2001</ref>

Smith once again embarked upon unearthing historical records to produce a lengthy tome based on the riots of 1943 in Beaumont, Texas, when war-time social and living conditions produced racial tension that flared into violent civil disorder when an African-American was falsely accused of raping the wife of an overseas sailor. The book, Purple Hearts (TCU Press, 2008) took seven years to write and went through thirteen drafts to reach its final form. Again, as was the case with his previous novel, the work went unnoticed, though scholar and critic Clay Reynolds has written fully of it. (See below.) The novel was a 2009 finalist for Best Novel award given by the Writers’ League of Texas. HIs short story \"Caustic\" (Southwest Review, Summer 2010) was given The Kay Catarulla Award for \"best short story of 2010\" by The Texas Institute of Letters.

Smith’s most recent novel, Steplings, was published in September 2011 by TCU Press. The novel is a coming-of-age story for a young man from a Dallas blue-collar suburb who allows his eleven-year-old stepsister to run away with him, setting off an Amber Alert that divides their newly married parents.  Early reviews ran from mixed to very positive: “Slow, a little weak in the plot department, but rich in psychological insight and lit by occasional flashes of humor”;<ref>[http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/childrens-books/cw-smith/steplings/ STEPLINGS by C.W. Smith | Kirkus Book Reviews]</ref> the two characters “make page-turning strides toward responsibility and maturity as they learn what an awesome task it is to take responsibility for each other\";<ref>tp://texasbooklover.blogspot.com/search?q=steplings</ref>“Texas novelist C.W. Smith has received just about every literary award the state and region bestow, and his latest work, the sprightly and wise Steplings, will no doubt add to his reputation as a Lone Star star…. Steplings comes to a completely realistic, bittersweet conclusion that will disappoint readers who like their endings tied in neat bows. But Smith is no fantasist — he’s a writer who can be depended on to write life as he actually sees it, not as he (or we) might wish it were”;<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/books/20110923-book-review-steplings-by-c.w.-smith.ece Book review: Steplings, by C.W. Smith | Dallas-Fort Worth Book Reviews and News - Entertainment News for Dallas Texas - GuideLive - The Dallas Morning News]</ref> “Even though these kinds of relationship dynamics have been mined many times before, Smith's story rings true and never feels stale. A dash of international politics spices up the personal politics of Steplings in a way that isn't forced or incongruent. The only misstep is a brief glimpse into the life of Jason's girlfriend that reads like a long parenthetical to the real story – a story of bonds between siblings and spouses, parents and children, and the fallout when they pull in different directions”.<ref>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2011-09-23/steplings-a-novel/ Review: Steplings: A Novel - Books - The Austin Chronicle]</ref>

In addition to the awards described above, Smith has twice received Creative Writing Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. In April 2011 he was given The Lon Tinkle Award for \"sustained excellence in a career\" by the Texas Institute of Letters. He belongs to PEN, The Authors Guild, Writer's Guild of America West, and the Texas Institute of Letters.

'''C. W. Smith''' (born 1940) is a [[novelist]], short-story and essay writer who serves as a Dedman Family Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at [[Southern Methodist University]].

==Early life==
[[File:Cw-smith.jpg|thumb|C.W. Smith]]
C. W. Smith (full name Charles William Smith) was born in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], and grew up in [[Hobbs, New Mexico]]. He received a B.A. in English from the [[University of North Texas]] in 1964 and an M.A. in English from [[Northern Illinois University]] in 1967. After teaching at [[Southwest Missouri State University]], he moved to [[Mexico]] for a year to work on his first novel, ''Thin Men of Haddam''. Published by Viking/Grossman in 1973, the book won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the [[Texas Institute of Letters]] for the Best Novel by a Texan or about Texas and was recognized by the Southwestern Library Association for making a “distinguished contribution to an understanding of a vital social issue in the American Southwest.” .”<ref>Citation awarded at 25th Biennial Conference, Galveston, TX, October 16–18, 1974</ref>

==Career==
Smith has said that his goal since beginning his first novel has been “to document in a dramatic fashion the cultural conflicts of the American Southwest as well as the universal, existential dilemmas that arise from being human regardless of place and time.” <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://smu.edu/english/People/FacultyProfiles/Smith.htm |title=Department of English - Department of English - Dedman College - SMU |access-date=2011-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045311/http://smu.edu/english/People/FacultyProfiles/Smith.htm |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In pursuit of that goal, his second novel, set in West Texas among oil field workers and small-town citizens, sought to portray the lives of young people trapped in circumstances too small for their aspirations. That novel, Country Music (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1975), was optioned by Playboy Productions. The novel was reviewed widely with largely, though not universally, positive notices: \"Smith's portrait of a troubled young man searching for himself he knows not where...is alive, funny, sad, and as real as it can be.\" <ref>Publishers Weekly, May 26, 1975, p.53</ref> \"The characters are convincing. The pace is unusually fast for a [[psychological novel]]. Smith is a writer of growing importance.\" <ref>Sullenger, Lee. Library Journal, July 8, 1975</ref> \"C.W. Smith’s technique has the impact of that of Claude Simon, the Provencal farmer-novelist who creates arresting amalgams of past, present, reverie and locale. Can’t do much better than that.<ref>Levin, Martin. New and Novel in The New York Times Book Review, May 5, 1974.</ref> ''The New Yorker'', on the other hand, posted that “This novel is easy to enjoy on a cartoon level, but only on that level…”<ref>The New Yorker, September 1, 1975, p. 66</ref>

Largely on the strength of the two novels, Smith was awarded a Dobie-Paisano Fellowship at the University of Texas, where he spent a year working on short stories. He was then hired to adapt the novel to the screen and spend time in Los Angeles working with producers on a script while his family resettled in Indianapolis. When the family returned to Texas, Smith became a reporter and film critic for ''The Dallas Times-Herald'' and subsequently began teaching at Southern Methodist University. His third novel, ''The Vestal Virgin Room'' (Atheneum, 1983), focused on a pair of married itinerant musicians, Mid-Westerners, whose efforts to secure fame in Las Vegas results in a strain in a marriage already under stress due to the loss of their only child. The novel has been optioned by three different producers with three different scripts, one by playwright Jonathan Tolins (“The Twilight of the Golds”), and the latest by producer Ed Bates with a screenplay by playwright and screenwriter David Dean Bottrell (“Dearly Departed”).

Smith then embarked upon a long historical novel based loosely upon the life of an Osage who was called in the press in the 1920s and 1930s “the world’s richest Indian.” ''Buffalo Nickel'' was published in 1989 by Simon & Schuster after nearly a decade of writing and revision. \"The destruction of native American cultures might be considered by some readers to be a literary dry hole. But this novel, about a Kiowa man who inadvertently becomes an Oklahoma oil millionaire, is a rich gusher of a novel - and consequently disproves any such notions….This is a big novel, in all senses - the characters and the incidents of their lives made memorably real.\" <ref>Gaughan, Thomas, in Booklist, August 7, 1989</ref> \"Critic Bruce Allen, writing in USA Today, said that “Buffalo Nickel is a delightful rarity: an old-fashioned ‘good read’ which tells the life story of a likable and interesting character who truly grows and changes....The novel is a roomy, agreeably slow-paced picaresque whose serious themes (the abrading of Indian culture, the gradual disappearance of space and wilderness) emerge with haunting clarity from a prose that continuously suggests and dramatizes, never once breaking into sermon. ''Buffalo Nickel'' may well be the year's best novel..\"<ref>Allen, Bruce, in USA Today, February 28, 1990</ref>

During the 1980s and 1990s, Smith wrote non-fiction as well as novels and short stories. He was, briefly, the ethics columnist for ''Esquire'' and the film critic for ''Texas Monthly''. As a freelance journalist and essayist, his work appeared in magazines and periodicals both scholarly and commercial. A cover article entitled “Uncle Dad” published by ''Esquire'' <ref>March 1985</ref> became a full-length memoir about his efforts to remain a part of his children’s lives after a divorce. The book, commissioned and published by Putnam, was also released under the author’s original title in a subsequent paperback edition by Berkley. His nonfiction work has been recognized through various awards: [[Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Awards|Penney-Missouri Special Merit Award]] for Feature Writing; the Stanley Walker Award for Journalism from the Texas Institute of Letters, and the award for Best Nonfiction Book by a Texan in 1987 from the Southwestern Booksellers Association.

In 1994, Texas Christian University Press began its long association with Smith’s works through the publication of his short-story collection, ''Letters From the Horse Latitudes''. Most of the stories in the collection were previously published, and his short fiction has appeared in ''Mademoiselle, Vision, Southwest Review, Sunstone Review, Carolina Quarterly, New Mexico Humanities Review, Quartet, Cimarron Review, [[American Literary Review]], American Short Fiction,'' ''The Missouri Review,'' and ''descant''. Writing about the collection in ''The New York Times'', Benjamin Cheever said, ”Set in Mexico and the American Southwest, Mr. Smith's stories have a rugged informality. Their sense of intimacy is so great that the reader feels he has uncovered a cache of personal letters or is overhearing a late-night conversation between friends. And yet, like the stories of O. Henry, each is cleverly contrived to capture some essence of life and also to make a point. Today most O. Henry stories read like antiques, dependent for their effects on credulous readers and illuminated with false optimism. But the world that Mr. Smith dramatizes is both contemporary and convincing.\" .”<ref>Cheever, Benjamin, in The New York Times Book Review, October 30, 1994, p.42</ref> His stories have received the Frank O'Connor Memorial Short Story Award from ''Quartet;'' the John H. McGinnis Short Story Award from ''Southwest Review'', as well as a Pushcart Prize nomination. An excerpt from his story “The Plantation Club” was included in, “Seeing Jazz: Artists and Writers on Jazz,” published by Chronicle Books in the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (1997). His short story, “The Bundelays,” was performed by Judith Ivey as part of the Dallas Museum of Arts’ “Arts and Letters Live Series,” as well as at sister programs in Denver and Houston.

Smith’s next novel, ''Hunter’s Trap'' (TCU Press, 1996), was designed to be an oblique sequel to the earlier Buffalo Nickel and the second part of a projected trilogy treating the theme of Native American assimilation into Anglo-European culture after the defeat of the Plains tribes by the U.S. military in the last quarter of the 19th century. “Somewhat reminiscent of the stories of Jim Harrison…Smith's novel offers an evocative exploration of the values and character of a time, a place, and a man. It's also a novel that would grace the lists of fine trade publishers, but refreshingly, it comes to us from a university press. Here's hoping that many readers come to know this skillfully wrought tale and that its success encourages TCU Press to bring us more such books.\" (Booklist) \"It's an eye for an eye - obsessive hatred, relentless pursuit and coldblooded revenge for irrevocable loss - in this hypnotic sequel to Smith's highly-praised western, Buffalo Nickel....The plot...moves inexorably to a stunning irony on the final page.\" .\"<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-87565-162-0 Fiction Review: Hunter's Trap by C. W. Smith, Author Texas Christian University Press $22.5 (216p)] {{ISBN|978-0-87565-162-0}}</ref> \"Beautifully bitter Depression-era revenge melodrama in which good guys lose, good women die, and virtue's reward is unreasonable tragedy.\" <ref>Kirkus Reviews, August 1, 1996.</ref>

Smith returned to more contemporary settings in his subsequent novel, ''Understanding Women'' (TCU Press, 1998), a coming-of-age story that takes place in the late 1950s when its sixteen-year-old protagonist and narrator leaves his home in Dallas to spend a summer working for his uncle in the oil fields. The novel won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the Texas Institute of Letters from the Best Novel of 1998 by a Texan or about Texas <ref>”Writers Honored,” in Dallas Morning News, April 11, 1999, p., 45A</ref> and also received an award from the Border Regional Library Association as an “Outstanding Book About the Southwest,” and the book garnered a starred review in Booklist.<ref>DeCandido, GraceAnne, in Booklist, September 1, 1998</ref>

''Gabriel's Eye'' (Winedale Publishing, 2001) utilizes Smith’s intimate knowledge of contemporary Dallas to focus upon the affair between a female teacher and her student at a local performing arts high school. While the book did secure mild praise from a reviewer in ''Publisher’s Weekly'', it went largely unnoticed in the press, although the Austin Chronicle gave it a full-length, somewhat mixed review. .<ref>Catmull, Katherine, \"Readings,\" in The Austin Chronicle, May 25, 2001</ref>

Smith once again embarked upon unearthing historical records to produce a lengthy tome based on the riots of 1943 in Beaumont, Texas, when war-time social and living conditions produced racial tension that flared into violent civil disorder when an African-American was falsely accused of raping the wife of an overseas sailor. The book, Purple Hearts (TCU Press, 2008) took seven years to write and went through thirteen drafts to reach its final form. Again, as was the case with his previous novel, the work went unnoticed, though scholar and critic Clay Reynolds has written fully of it. (See below.) The novel was a 2009 finalist for Best Novel award given by the Writers’ League of Texas. HIs short story \"Caustic\" (Southwest Review, Summer 2010) was given The Kay Catarulla Award for \"best short story of 2010\" by The Texas Institute of Letters.

Smith’s most recent novel, Steplings, was published in September 2011 by TCU Press. The novel is a coming-of-age story for a young man from a Dallas blue-collar suburb who allows his eleven-year-old stepsister to run away with him, setting off an Amber Alert that divides their newly married parents.  Early reviews ran from mixed to very positive: “Slow, a little weak in the plot department, but rich in psychological insight and lit by occasional flashes of humor”;<ref>[http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/childrens-books/cw-smith/steplings/ STEPLINGS by C.W. Smith | Kirkus Book Reviews]</ref> the two characters “make page-turning strides toward responsibility and maturity as they learn what an awesome task it is to take responsibility for each other\";<ref>tp://texasbooklover.blogspot.com/search?q=steplings</ref>“Texas novelist C.W. Smith has received just about every literary award the state and region bestow, and his latest work, the sprightly and wise Steplings, will no doubt add to his reputation as a Lone Star star…. Steplings comes to a completely realistic, bittersweet conclusion that will disappoint readers who like their endings tied in neat bows. But Smith is no fantasist — he’s a writer who can be depended on to write life as he actually sees it, not as he (or we) might wish it were”;<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/books/20110923-book-review-steplings-by-c.w.-smith.ece Book review: Steplings, by C.W. Smith | Dallas-Fort Worth Book Reviews and News - Entertainment News for Dallas Texas - GuideLive - The Dallas Morning News]</ref> “Even though these kinds of relationship dynamics have been mined many times before, Smith's story rings true and never feels stale. A dash of international politics spices up the personal politics of Steplings in a way that isn't forced or incongruent. The only misstep is a brief glimpse into the life of Jason's girlfriend that reads like a long parenthetical to the real story – a story of bonds between siblings and spouses, parents and children, and the fallout when they pull in different directions”.<ref>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2011-09-23/steplings-a-novel/ Review: Steplings: A Novel - Books - The Austin Chronicle]</ref>

In addition to the awards described above, Smith has twice received Creative Writing Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. In April 2011 he was given The Lon Tinkle Award for \"sustained excellence in a career\" by the Texas Institute of Letters. He belongs to PEN, The Authors Guild, Writer's Guild of America West, and the Texas Institute of Letters.

'''Wernicke's area''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɛər|n|ᵻ|k|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈvɛʁnɪkə|lang}}), also called '''Wernicke's speech area''', is one of the two parts of the [[cerebral cortex]] that are linked to speech, the other being [[Broca's area]]. It is involved in the comprehension of written and spoken language, in contrast to Broca's area, which is involved in the production of language. It is traditionally thought to reside in [[Brodmann area 22]], which is located in the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere, which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of [[right-handed]] individuals and 60% of left-handed individuals. 

Damage caused to Wernicke's area results in receptive, [[Wernicke's aphasia|fluent aphasia]]. This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words, but the phrases will lack meaning. This is unlike [[Broca's aphasia|non-fluent aphasia]], in which the person will use meaningful words, but in a non-fluent, [[Telegraphic speech|telegraphic manner]].<ref name=\"urlAphasia: Signs & Symptoms\">{{cite web | url = http://www.asha.org/PRPSpecificTopic.aspx?folderid=8589934663&section=Signs_and_Symptoms | title = Aphasia: Signs & Symptoms | format = | website = | publisher = American Speech-Language-Hearing Association }}</ref>

==Structure==
Wernicke's area is traditionally view as being located in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] (STG), usually in the left cerebral hemisphere. This area encircles the [[auditory cortex]] on the [[lateral sulcus]], the part of the [[human brain|brain]] where the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]] meet.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to language development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage.}}</ref> This area is neuroanatomically described as the posterior part of [[Brodmann area]] [[Brodmann area 22|22]].

==Function==

===Right homologous area===

Research using [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] suggests that the area corresponding to the Wernicke’s area in the non-dominant cerebral hemisphere has a role in processing and resolution of subordinate meanings of ambiguous words—such as ‘‘river’’ when given the ambiguous word \"bank.\"  In contrast, the Wernicke's area in the dominant hemisphere processes dominant word meanings (‘‘teller’’ given ‘‘bank’’).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Harpaz Y, Levkovitz Y, Lavidor M | title = Lexical ambiguity resolution in Wernicke's area and its right homologue | journal = Cortex | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 1097–103 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19251255 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.01.002 }}</ref>

===Modern views===
[[Neuroimaging]] suggests the functions earlier attributed to Wernicke's area occur more broadly in the [[temporal lobe]] and indeed happen also in Broca's area.

{{cquote|There are some suggestions that middle and inferior temporal gyri and basal temporal cortex reflect lexical processing ... there is consensus that the STG from rostral to caudal fields and the [[superior temporal sulcus|STS]] constitute the neural tissue in which many of the critical computations for speech recognition are executed ... aspects of Broca’s area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45) are also regularly implicated in speech processing.

... the range of areas implicated in speech processing go well beyond the classical language areas typically mentioned for speech; the vast majority of textbooks still state that this aspect of perception and language processing occurs in Wernicke’s area (the posterior third of the STG).<ref name=\"Poeppel08\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Poeppel D, Idsardi WJ, van Wassenhove V | title = Speech perception at the interface of neurobiology and linguistics | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 363 | issue = 1493 | pages = 1071–86 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 17890189 | pmc = 2606797 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2007.2160  }}</ref>}}

Support for a broad range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study carried out at the [[University of Rochester]] in which [[American Sign Language]] native speakers were subject to [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax (relationship is determined by the word order) or inflection (relationship is determined by physical motion of \"moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body\").

===Aphasia===

Wernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]] and [[psychiatrist]] who, in 1874, hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wernicke K. |chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875) |editor=Paul Eling |title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to) |publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co |location=Amsterdam |year=1995 |pages=69–89 |isbn=978-90-272-1893-3 |volume=4 }}</ref> He did this on the basis of the location of [[Acquired brain injury|brain injuries]] that caused [[aphasia]]. [[Receptive aphasia]] in which such abilities are preserved is also known as '''Wernicke's aphasia'''. In this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax]]. Language as a result is largely meaningless (a condition sometimes called ''fluent'' or ''[[jargon aphasia]]'').

Wernicke’s area receives information from the auditory cortex, and functions to assign word meanings. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia?search=wernicke%27s%20aphasia&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1~4&usage_type=default&display_rank=1|title=Approach to the patient with aphasia|last=Glenn Clark|first=David|date=2018|website=Up To Date|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This is why damage to this area results in meaningless speech, often with paraphasic errors and newly created words or expressions.

Another symptom of Wernicke's aphasia is use of semantic [[paraphasia]]s or \"empty speech\" which is the use of generic terms like \"stuff\" or \"things\" to stand in for the specific words that the patient cannot think of. Some Wernicke's aphasia patients also talk around missing words, which is called \"[[circumlocution]].\" Patients with Wernicke's aphasia can tend to run on when they talk, due to circumlocution combined with deficient self-monitoring. This overabundance of words or press of speech can be described as logorrhea.

'''Wernicke's area''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɛər|n|ᵻ|k|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈvɛʁnɪkə|lang}}), also called '''Wernicke's speech area''', is one of the two parts of the [[cerebral cortex]] that are linked to speech, the other being [[Broca's area]]. It is involved in the comprehension of written and spoken language, in contrast to Broca's area, which is involved in the production of language. It is traditionally thought to reside in [[Brodmann area 22]], which is located in the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere, which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of [[right-handed]] individuals and 60% of left-handed individuals. 

Damage caused to Wernicke's area results in receptive, [[Wernicke's aphasia|fluent aphasia]]. This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words, but the phrases will lack meaning. This is unlike [[Broca's aphasia|non-fluent aphasia]], in which the person will use meaningful words, but in a non-fluent, [[Telegraphic speech|telegraphic manner]].<ref name=\"urlAphasia: Signs & Symptoms\">{{cite web | url = http://www.asha.org/PRPSpecificTopic.aspx?folderid=8589934663&section=Signs_and_Symptoms | title = Aphasia: Signs & Symptoms | format = | website = | publisher = American Speech-Language-Hearing Association }}</ref>

==Structure==
Wernicke's area is traditionally view as being located in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] (STG), usually in the left cerebral hemisphere. This area encircles the [[auditory cortex]] on the [[lateral sulcus]], the part of the [[human brain|brain]] where the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]] meet.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to language development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage.}}</ref> This area is neuroanatomically described as the posterior part of [[Brodmann area]] [[Brodmann area 22|22]].

==Function==

===Right homologous area===

Research using [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] suggests that the area corresponding to the Wernicke’s area in the non-dominant cerebral hemisphere has a role in processing and resolution of subordinate meanings of ambiguous words—such as ‘‘river’’ when given the ambiguous word \"bank.\"  In contrast, the Wernicke's area in the dominant hemisphere processes dominant word meanings (‘‘teller’’ given ‘‘bank’’).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Harpaz Y, Levkovitz Y, Lavidor M | title = Lexical ambiguity resolution in Wernicke's area and its right homologue | journal = Cortex | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 1097–103 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19251255 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.01.002 }}</ref>

===Modern views===
[[Neuroimaging]] suggests the functions earlier attributed to Wernicke's area occur more broadly in the [[temporal lobe]] and indeed happen also in Broca's area.

{{cquote|There are some suggestions that middle and inferior temporal gyri and basal temporal cortex reflect lexical processing ... there is consensus that the STG from rostral to caudal fields and the [[superior temporal sulcus|STS]] constitute the neural tissue in which many of the critical computations for speech recognition are executed ... aspects of Broca’s area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45) are also regularly implicated in speech processing.

... the range of areas implicated in speech processing go well beyond the classical language areas typically mentioned for speech; the vast majority of textbooks still state that this aspect of perception and language processing occurs in Wernicke’s area (the posterior third of the STG).<ref name=\"Poeppel08\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Poeppel D, Idsardi WJ, van Wassenhove V | title = Speech perception at the interface of neurobiology and linguistics | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 363 | issue = 1493 | pages = 1071–86 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 17890189 | pmc = 2606797 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2007.2160  }}</ref>}}

Support for a broad range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study carried out at the [[University of Rochester]] in which [[American Sign Language]] native speakers were subject to [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax (relationship is determined by the word order) or inflection (relationship is determined by physical motion of \"moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body\").  Distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex (associated with ability to put information into sequences) being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes (associated with dividing information into its constituent parts) being more active in the inflection condition.  However, these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap.  These findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process, the brain may be using fairly basic, preexisting computational methods.<ref name=\"Newman2010\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman AJ, Supalla T, Hauser P, Newport EL, Bavelier D | title = Dissociating neural subsystems for grammar by contrasting word order and inflection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 107 | issue = 16 | pages = 7539–44 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20368422 | pmc = 2867749 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1003174107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.7539N }}</ref>

'''Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev''' ({{lang-ru|Фёдор Иванович Тютчев}}, Pre-Reform orthography: Ѳедоръ Ивановичъ Тютчевъ; {{OldStyleDate|December 5|1803|November 23}} &ndash; {{OldStyleDate|July 27|1873|July 15}}) was a Russian poet and statesman.

== Life ==

Tyutchev was born into a [[Russian nobility|Russian noble]] family in the Ovstug family estate near [[Bryansk]] (modern-day [[Zhukovsky District, Bryansk Oblast]] of [[Russia]]). His father Ivan Nikolaevich Tyutchev (1768—1846) was a [[Table of ranks#Table of Ranks|court councillor]] who served in the Kremlin Expedition that managed all building and restoration works of Moscow palaces. One of Ivan's sisters, [[:ru:Мещерская, Евдокия Николаевна|Evdokia Meshcherskaya]] (1774—1837), was a [[hegumen]]ia famous for founding the Borisoglebsky Anosin Women's Monastery.<ref name='aksakov'>''[[Ivan Aksakov]] (1997)''.

Most of his childhood years were spent in Moscow, where he joined the literary circle of Professor Merzlyakov at the age of 13. His first printed work was a translation of [[Horace]]'s epistle to [[Maecenas]], published when he was still 15. From that time on, his poetic language was distinguished from that of Pushkin and other contemporaries by its liberal use of majestic, solemn Slavonic archaisms.

His family tutor was [[Semyon Raich]], a minor poet and translator under whose guidance Tyutchev undertook his first poetic steps. From 1819 to 1821 Tyutchev studied at the Philological Faculty of [[Moscow University]]. After graduating he joined the Foreign Office and in 1822 accompanied his relative, Count [[Ostermann-Tolstoy]], to [[Munich]] to take up a post as trainee diplomat at the Russian legation. He was to remain abroad for 22 years.

In Munich he fell in love with [[Amalie Adlerberg|Amalie von Lerchenfeld]], the illegitimate half-sister of a young Bavarian diplomat, Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld. Tyutchev's poem ''Tears'' or ''Slyozy'' (''Liubliu, druz'ya, laskat' ochami...'') coincides with one of their meetings, and is most likely dedicated to Amalie (or Amélie, as she was usually known). Among other poems inspired by her are ''K. N.'', and ''Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe…'' Published extracts from the letters and diaries of Maximilian von Lerchenfeld illuminate the first years of Tyutchev as a diplomat in Munich (1822–1826), giving details of his [[frustration|frustrated]] love affair for Amélie, nearly involving a duel (probably with his colleague, Baron [[Alexander von Krüdener]]), in January 1825. Amélie was coerced by her relatives into marrying the much older Krüdener, but she and Tyutchev continued to be friends and frequented the same diplomatic society in Munich. A late poem of 1870 with the title ''K.B.'' (''Ia vstretil vas - i vsio biloe''), long accepted on dubious evidence as addressed to Amélie, is now thought much more likely to refer to Tyutchev's sister-in-law Clotilde (or Klothilde) von Bothmer.<ref>Nikolayev, A.A., 'Zagaka \"K.B.\"', ''Neva'', 1988, No. 2, pp. 190-196.</ref> Tyutchev's last meeting with Amélie took place on March 31, 1873 (OS) when she visited him on his deathbed. The next day, Tyutchev wrote to his daughter Daria: 
<blockquote>
Yesterday I felt a moment of burning emotion due to my meeting with... my dear Amalie Krüdener who wished to see me for the last time in this world and came to take her leave of me. In her person my past and the best years of my life came to give me a farewell kiss.<ref>F.I. Tyutchev, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniy i pis'ma'', 6 vols., Moscow, 2002-2005. VI, p. 416.</ref>
</blockquote>

In Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] and the philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]]. In 1826, he married the [[Bavaria]]n widow of a Russian diplomat [[Eleonore Peterson]], née Countess von Bothmer. She became the mother of his daughter [[Anna Tiuttjev]].  Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness [[Ernestine von Dörnberg]], née von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. 
[[Image:Owstug.JPG|thumb|left|The manor of Tyutchev's father in the [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk region]]]]

In 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in ''[[Sovremennik]]'', a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).

In 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in [[Turin]]. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as chargé d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to [[St Petersburg]] in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wooed her, \"almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness\", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.

Tyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.

As a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as ''bagatelles'', not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.

In 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\".<ref>I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.</ref> One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.

In the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.

==Political views==
[[File:Tyutcheva.jpg|thumb|165px|Tyutchev's second wife, Baroness Ernestine [[Pfeffel family|von Pfeffel]]. Her father was a Bavarian Ambassador in Paris and London.]]
Tyutchev was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.

On domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.

His fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: 
{{Quotation|
:Who would grasp Russia with the mind?
:For her no yardstick was created:
:Her soul is of a special kind,
:By faith alone appreciated.
:::::::::::(translated by John Dewey)}}

== Poetry ==

Tyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.

The 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].

== Sample of verse ==

''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" {{note|nasledstvo}}

Incidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by [[Rakhmaninov]] of Tyutchev's poem ''Spring Waters''. While the title of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s 1910 tone poem, \"Silence\", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata \"Signs of the Zodiac\". The Ukrainian<ref>[[Valentyn Sylvestrov]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'.  At the end of [[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Stalker (1979 film)|''Stalker'']], a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician [[Björk]] used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to \"[[The Dull Flame Of Desire]]\" from her album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] includes a setting of Tyutchev's French-language poem “Nous avons pu tous deux…” by the composer [[Isabelle Aboulker]].

'''Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev''' ({{lang-ru|Фёдор Иванович Тютчев}}, Pre-Reform orthography: Ѳедоръ Ивановичъ Тютчевъ; {{OldStyleDate|December 5|1803|November 23}} &ndash; {{OldStyleDate|July 27|1873|July 15}}) was a Russian poet and statesman.

== Life ==

Tyutchev was born into a [[Russian nobility|Russian noble]] family in the Ovstug family estate near [[Bryansk]] (modern-day [[Zhukovsky District, Bryansk Oblast]] of [[Russia]]). His father Ivan Nikolaevich Tyutchev (1768—1846) was a [[Table of ranks#Table of Ranks|court councillor]] who served in the Kremlin Expedition that managed all building and restoration works of Moscow palaces. One of Ivan's sisters, [[:ru:Мещерская, Евдокия Николаевна|Evdokia Meshcherskaya]] (1774—1837), was a [[hegumen]]ia famous for founding the Borisoglebsky Anosin Women's Monastery.<ref name='aksakov'>''[[Ivan Aksakov]] (1997)''.

Most of his childhood years were spent in Moscow, where he joined the literary circle of Professor Merzlyakov at the age of 13. His first printed work was a translation of [[Horace]]'s epistle to [[Maecenas]], published when he was still 15. From that time on, his poetic language was distinguished from that of Pushkin and other contemporaries by its liberal use of majestic, solemn Slavonic archaisms.

His family tutor was [[Semyon Raich]], a minor poet and translator under whose guidance Tyutchev undertook his first poetic steps. From 1819 to 1821 Tyutchev studied at the Philological Faculty of [[Moscow University]]. After graduating he joined the Foreign Office and in 1822 accompanied his relative, Count [[Ostermann-Tolstoy]], to [[Munich]] to take up a post as trainee diplomat at the Russian legation. He was to remain abroad for 22 years.

In Munich he fell in love with [[Amalie Adlerberg|Amalie von Lerchenfeld]], the illegitimate half-sister of a young Bavarian diplomat, Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld. Tyutchev's poem ''Tears'' or ''Slyozy'' (''Liubliu, druz'ya, laskat' ochami...'') coincides with one of their meetings, and is most likely dedicated to Amalie (or Amélie, as she was usually known). Among other poems inspired by her are ''K. N.'', and ''Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe…'' Published extracts from the letters and diaries of Maximilian von Lerchenfeld illuminate the first years of Tyutchev as a diplomat in Munich (1822–1826), giving details of his [[frustration|frustrated]] love affair for Amélie, nearly involving a duel (probably with his colleague, Baron [[Alexander von Krüdener]]), in January 1825. Amélie was coerced by her relatives into marrying the much older Krüdener, but she and Tyutchev continued to be friends and frequented the same diplomatic society in Munich. A late poem of 1870 with the title ''K.B.'' (''Ia vstretil vas - i vsio biloe''), long accepted on dubious evidence as addressed to Amélie, is now thought much more likely to refer to Tyutchev's sister-in-law Clotilde (or Klothilde) von Bothmer.<ref>Nikolayev, A.A., 'Zagaka \"K.B.\"', ''Neva'', 1988, No. 2, pp. 190-196.</ref> Tyutchev's last meeting with Amélie took place on March 31, 1873 (OS) when she visited him on his deathbed. The next day, Tyutchev wrote to his daughter Daria: 
<blockquote>
Yesterday I felt a moment of burning emotion due to my meeting with... my dear Amalie Krüdener who wished to see me for the last time in this world and came to take her leave of me. In her person my past and the best years of my life came to give me a farewell kiss.<ref>F.I. Tyutchev, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniy i pis'ma'', 6 vols., Moscow, 2002-2005. VI, p. 416.</ref>
</blockquote>

In Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] and the philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]]. In 1826, he married the [[Bavaria]]n widow of a Russian diplomat [[Eleonore Peterson]], née Countess von Bothmer. She became the mother of his daughter [[Anna Tiuttjev]].  Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness [[Ernestine von Dörnberg]], née von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. 
[[Image:Owstug.JPG|thumb|left|The manor of Tyutchev's father in the [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk region]]]]

In 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in ''[[Sovremennik]]'', a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).

In 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in [[Turin]]. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as chargé d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to [[St Petersburg]] in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wooed her, \"almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness\", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.

Tyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.

As a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as ''bagatelles'', not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.

In 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\".<ref>I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.</ref> One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.

In the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.

==Political views==
[[File:Tyutcheva.jpg|thumb|165px|Tyutchev's second wife, Baroness Ernestine [[Pfeffer family|von Pfeffer]]. Her father was a Bavarian Ambassador in Paris and London.]]
Tyutchev was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.

On domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.

His fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: 
{{Quotation|
:Who would grasp Russia with the mind?
:For her no yardstick was created:
:Her soul is of a special kind,
:By faith alone appreciated.
:::::::::::(translated by John Dewey)}}

== Poetry ==

Tyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.

The 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].

== Sample of verse ==

''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" {{note|nasledstvo}} 
[[File:Fedor Tutchev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky|Levitsky]], 1856.]]
:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal
:the way you dream, the things you feel.
:Deep in your spirit let them rise
:akin to stars in crystal skies
:that set before the night is blurred:
:delight in them and speak no word.

:How can a heart expression find?
:How should another know your mind?
:Will he discern what quickens you?
:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.
:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:
:drink at the source and speak no word.

:Live in your inner self alone
:within your soul a world has grown,
:the magic of veiled thoughts that might
:be blinded by the outer light,
:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...
:take in their song and speak no word. 
:::::::::::(trans. by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])

Incidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911.

'''Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev''' ({{lang-ru|Фёдор Иванович Тютчев}}, Pre-Reform orthography: Ѳедоръ Ивановичъ Тютчевъ; {{OldStyleDate|December 5|1803|November 23}} &ndash; {{OldStyleDate|July 27|1873|July 15}}) was a Russian poet and diplomat.

== Life ==

Tyutchev was born into a [[Russian nobility|Russian noble]] family in the Ovstug family estate near [[Bryansk]] (modern-day [[Zhukovsky District, Bryansk Oblast]] of [[Russia]]). His father Ivan Nikolaevich Tyutchev (1768—1846) was a [[Table of ranks#Table of Ranks|court councillor]] who served in the Kremlin Expedition that managed all building and restoration works of Moscow palaces. One of Ivan's sisters, [[:ru:Мещерская, Евдокия Николаевна|Evdokia Meshcherskaya]] (1774—1837), was a [[hegumen]]ia famous for founding the Borisoglebsky Anosin Women's Monastery.<ref name='aksakov'>''[[Ivan Aksakov]] (1997)''.

Most of his childhood years were spent in Moscow, where he joined the literary circle of Professor Merzlyakov at the age of 13. His first printed work was a translation of [[Horace]]'s epistle to [[Maecenas]], published when he was still 15. From that time on, his poetic language was distinguished from that of Pushkin and other contemporaries by its liberal use of majestic, solemn Slavonic archaisms.

His family tutor was [[Semyon Raich]], a minor poet and translator under whose guidance Tyutchev undertook his first poetic steps. From 1819 to 1821 Tyutchev studied at the Philological Faculty of [[Moscow University]]. After graduating he joined the Foreign Office and in 1822 accompanied his relative, Count [[Ostermann-Tolstoy]], to [[Munich]] to take up a post as trainee diplomat at the Russian legation. He was to remain abroad for 22 years.

In Munich he fell in love with [[Amalie Adlerberg|Amalie von Lerchenfeld]], the illegitimate half-sister of a young Bavarian diplomat, Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld. Tyutchev's poem ''Tears'' or ''Slyozy'' (''Liubliu, druz'ya, laskat' ochami...'') coincides with one of their meetings, and is most likely dedicated to Amalie (or Amélie, as she was usually known). Among other poems inspired by her are ''K. N.'', and ''Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe…'' Published extracts from the letters and diaries of Maximilian von Lerchenfeld illuminate the first years of Tyutchev as a diplomat in Munich (1822–1826), giving details of his [[frustration|frustrated]] love affair for Amélie, nearly involving a duel (probably with his colleague, Baron [[Alexander von Krüdener]]), in January 1825. Amélie was coerced by her relatives into marrying the much older Krüdener, but she and Tyutchev continued to be friends and frequented the same diplomatic society in Munich. A late poem of 1870 with the title ''K.B.'' (''Ia vstretil vas - i vsio biloe''), long accepted on dubious evidence as addressed to Amélie, is now thought much more likely to refer to Tyutchev's sister-in-law Clotilde (or Klothilde) von Bothmer.<ref>Nikolayev, A.A., 'Zagaka \"K.B.\"', ''Neva'', 1988, No. 2, pp. 190-196.</ref> Tyutchev's last meeting with Amélie took place on March 31, 1873 (OS) when she visited him on his deathbed. The next day, Tyutchev wrote to his daughter Daria: 
<blockquote>
Yesterday I felt a moment of burning emotion due to my meeting with... my dear Amalie Krüdener who wished to see me for the last time in this world and came to take her leave of me. In her person my past and the best years of my life came to give me a farewell kiss.<ref>F.I. Tyutchev, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniy i pis'ma'', 6 vols., Moscow, 2002-2005. VI, p. 416.</ref>
</blockquote>

In Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] and the philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]]. In 1826, he married the [[Bavaria]]n widow of a Russian diplomat [[Eleonore Peterson]], née Countess von Bothmer. She became the mother of his daughter [[Anna Tiuttjev]].  Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness [[Ernestine von Dörnberg]], née von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. 
[[Image:Owstug.JPG|thumb|left|The manor of Tyutchev's father in the [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk region]]]]

In 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in ''[[Sovremennik]]'', a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).

In 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in [[Turin]]. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as chargé d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to [[St Petersburg]] in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wooed her, \"almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness\", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.

Tyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.

As a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as ''bagatelles'', not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.

In 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\".<ref>I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.</ref> One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.

In the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.

==Political views==
[[File:Tyutcheva.jpg|thumb|165px|Tyutchev's second wife, Baroness Ernestine [[Pfeffel family|von Pfeffel]]. Her father was a Bavarian Ambassador in Paris and London.]]
Tyutchev was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.

On domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.

His fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: 
{{Quotation|
:Who would grasp Russia with the mind?
:For her no yardstick was created:
:Her soul is of a special kind,
:By faith alone appreciated.
:::::::::::(translated by John Dewey)}}

== Poetry ==

Tyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.

The 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].

== Sample of verse ==

''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" {{note|nasledstvo}} 
[[File:Fedor Tutchev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky|Levitsky]], 1856.]]
:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal
:the way you dream, the things you feel.
:Deep in your spirit let them rise
:akin to stars in crystal skies
:that set before the night is blurred:
:delight in them and speak no word.

:How can a heart expression find?
:How should another know your mind?
:Will he discern what quickens you?
:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.
:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:
:drink at the source and speak no word.

:Live in your inner self alone
:within your soul a world has grown,
:the magic of veiled thoughts that might
:be blinded by the outer light,
:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...
:take in their song and speak no word. 
:::::::::::(trans. by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])

Incidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by [[Rakhmaninov]] of Tyutchev's poem ''Spring Waters''. While the title of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s 1910 tone poem, \"Silence\", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata \"Signs of the Zodiac\". The Ukrainian<ref>[[Valentyn Sylvestrov]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'.  At the end of [[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Stalker (1979 film)|''Stalker'']], a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician [[Björk]] used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to \"[[The Dull Flame Of Desire]]\" from her album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] includes a setting of Tyutchev's French-language poem “Nous avons pu tous deux…” by the composer [[Isabelle Aboulker]].

In Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] and the philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]]. In 1826, he married the [[Bavaria]]n widow of a Russian diplomat [[Eleonore Peterson]], née Countess von Bothmer. She became the mother of his daughter [[Anna Tiuttjev]].  Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness [[Ernestine von Dörnberg]], née von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language.

In 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in ''[[Sovremennik]]'', a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).

In 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in [[Turin]]. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as chargé d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to [[St Petersburg]] in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wooed her, \"almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness\", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.

Tyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.

As a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as ''bagatelles'', not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.

In 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\".<ref>I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.</ref> One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.

In the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.

==Political views==
[[File:Tyutcheva.jpg|thumb|165px|Tyutchev's second wife, Baroness Ernestine [[Pfeffel family|von Pfeffel]]. Her father was a Bavarian Ambassador in Paris and London.]]
Tyutchev was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.

On domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.

His fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia:

== Poetry ==

Tyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.

The 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].

== Sample of verse ==

''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" {{note|nasledstvo}} 
[[File:Fedor Tutchev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky|Levitsky]], 1856.]]
:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal
:the way you dream, the things you feel.
:Deep in your spirit let them rise
:akin to stars in crystal skies
:that set before the night is blurred:
:delight in them and speak no word.

:How can a heart expression find?
:How should another know your mind?
:Will he discern what quickens you?
:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.
:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:
:drink at the source and speak no word.

:Live in your inner self alone
:within your soul a world has grown,
:the magic of veiled thoughts that might
:be blinded by the outer light,
:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...
:take in their song and speak no word. 
:::::::::::(trans. by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])

Incidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by [[Rakhmaninov]] of Tyutchev's poem ''Spring Waters''. While the title of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s 1910 tone poem, \"Silence\", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata \"Signs of the Zodiac\". The Ukrainian<ref>[[Valentyn Sylvestrov]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'.  At the end of [[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Stalker (1979 film)|''Stalker'']], a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician [[Björk]] used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to \"[[The Dull Flame Of Desire]]\" from her album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] includes a setting of Tyutchev's French-language poem “Nous avons pu tous deux…” by the composer [[Isabelle Aboulker]].
