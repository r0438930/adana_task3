She also wrote the world's longest-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]],'' performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]] since 1952, as well as six novels under the pseudonym '''Mary Westmacott'''. In 1971, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature.\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]]. She served in a Devon hospital during the [[World War I|First World War]], acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which would later feature in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed when ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'' was published in 1920 featuring Hercule Poirot. Following her second marriage in 1930 to an archaeologist, she used her first-hand knowledge of her husband's profession in her fiction. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], she worked as a pharmacy assistant at [[University College Hospital]], London, updating her knowledge of toxins while contributing to the war effort.\n\n''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time. Her novels have sold roughly 2 billion copies, and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world's most-widely published books, behind only [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works and the [[Bible]]. According to [[Index Translationum]], she remains the [[list of most-translated individual authors|most-translated individual author]], having been translated into at least 103 languages. ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is Christie's best-selling novel, with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever and one of the best-selling books of all time. Christie's stage play ''The Mousetrap'' holds the world record for longest initial run. It opened at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]] in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by September 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances.\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s [[MWA Grand Master Award|Grand Master Award]]. Later that year, ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' received an [[Edgar Award]]  for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the [[Crime Writers' Association]]. In September 2015, coinciding with her 125th birthday, ''And Then There Were None'' was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. Most of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and comics, and more than thirty feature films have been based on her work.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Childhood and adolescence: 1890\u20131910===\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller<!-- Christie comes from her first marriage. --> was born on 15 September 1890 into a wealthy [[upper-middle-class]] family in Torquay, Devon.

She also read the work of [[Edith Nesbit]], including ''[[The Story of the Treasure Seekers]]'' (1899), ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'' (1903), and ''[[The Railway Children]]'' (1906). When a little older, she moved on to reading the surreal verse of [[Edward Lear]] and [[Lewis Carroll]].<ref name=\"Morgan1984\"/>{{rp|18\u201319}} In April 1901, at age 10, she wrote her first poem, \"The cowslip\".<ref name=\"film\">{{cite av media|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 A Trip With David Suchet (Directed by Claire Lewins)|publisher=Testimony films (for ITV)}}</ref>\n\nAlthough she devoted much time to her pets, Christie spent much of her childhood apart from other children.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Act Tragedy|last=Christie, Agatha|date=2018|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nAnticipating the publication of ''Curtain'', Poirot became the first fictional character to be covered on the front page of ''The New York Times'' when his obituary was printed there on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|last=Hobbs|first=JD|date=6 August 1975|website=|publisher=Poirot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=11 April 2020|place=USA}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new\".<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

(from the [[Book of Common Prayer]]), and ''[[Come, Tell Me How You Live]]'' (from Lewis Carroll's ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'').\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said that \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|208}} Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's [[nursery rhyme]]s: ''And Then There Were None'' (from \"[[Ten Little Indians]]\"), ''[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (novel)|One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]'' (from \"[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]\"), ''Five Little Pigs'' (from \"[[This Little Piggy]]\"), ''[[Crooked House]]'' (from \"[[There Was a Crooked Man]]\"), ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (from \"[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]\"), ''[[Hickory Dickory Dock (novel)|Hickory Dickory Dock]]'' (from \"[[Hickory Dickory Dock]]\"), and ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories|Three Blind Mice]]'' (from \"[[Three Blind Mice]]\"). Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie would insert stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works. Christie's British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to \"omit the word 'Jew' when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books\".<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|386}}\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''Three Act Tragedy''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\n==== Plays ====\n[[File:Agatha Christie Memorial (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to Christie in central London]]\nIn 1928, ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' was adapted for the stage by Michael Morton under the title ''[[Alibi (play)|Alibi]]''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|177}} While the play enjoyed a respectable run, Christie disliked the changes made to her original work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself.

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals==\nChristie has been portrayed in film and television. Biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'' (2018), in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie.

She also wrote the world's longest-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]],'' performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]] since 1952, as well as six novels under the pseudonym '''Mary Westmacott'''. In 1971, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature.\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]]. She served in a Devon hospital during the [[World War I|First World War]], acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which would later feature in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed when ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'' was published in 1920 featuring Hercule Poirot. Following her second marriage in 1930 to an archaeologist, she used her first-hand knowledge of her husband's profession in her fiction. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], she worked as a pharmacy assistant at [[University College Hospital]], London, updating her knowledge of toxins while contributing to the war effort.\n\n''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time. Her novels have sold roughly 2 billion copies, and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world's most-widely published books, behind only [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works and the [[Bible]]. According to [[Index Translationum]], she remains the [[list of most-translated individual authors|most-translated individual author]], having been translated into at least 103 languages. ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is Christie's best-selling novel, with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever and one of the best-selling books of all time. Christie's stage play ''The Mousetrap'' holds the world record for longest initial run. It opened at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]] in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by September 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances.\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s [[MWA Grand Master Award|Grand Master Award]]. Later that year, ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' received an [[Edgar Award]]  for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the [[Crime Writers' Association]]. In September 2015, coinciding with her 125th birthday, ''And Then There Were None'' was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. Most of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and comics, and more than thirty feature films have been based on her work.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Childhood and adolescence: 1890\u20131910===\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller<!-- Christie comes from her first marriage. --> was born on 15 September 1890 into a wealthy [[upper-middle-class]] family in Torquay, Devon.

Among her earliest memories were those of reading the children's books written by [[Mary Louisa Molesworth|Mrs Molesworth]], including ''The Adventures of Herr Baby'' (1881), ''Christmas Tree Land'' (1897), and ''The Magic Nuts'' (1898). She also read the work of [[Edith Nesbit]], including ''[[The Story of the Treasure Seekers]]'' (1899), ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'' (1903), and ''[[The Railway Children]]'' (1906). When a little older, she moved on to reading the surreal verse of [[Edward Lear]] and [[Lewis Carroll]].<ref name=\"Morgan1984\"/>{{rp|18\u201319}} In April 1901, at age 10, she wrote her first poem, \"The cowslip\".<ref name=\"film\">{{cite av media|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 A Trip With David Suchet (Directed by Claire Lewins)|publisher=Testimony films (for ITV)}}</ref>\n\nAlthough she devoted much time to her pets, Christie spent much of her childhood apart from other children.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Act Tragedy|last=Christie, Agatha|date=2018|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nAnticipating the publication of ''Curtain'', Poirot became the first fictional character to be covered on the front page of ''The New York Times'' when his obituary was printed there on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|last=Hobbs|first=JD|date=6 August 1975|website=|publisher=Poirot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=11 April 2020|place=USA}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier.

(from the [[Book of Common Prayer]]), and ''[[Come, Tell Me How You Live]]'' (from Lewis Carroll's ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'').\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said that \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|208}} Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's [[nursery rhyme]]s: ''And Then There Were None'' (from \"[[Ten Little Indians]]\"), ''[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (novel)|One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]'' (from \"[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]\"), ''Five Little Pigs'' (from \"[[This Little Piggy]]\"), ''[[Crooked House]]'' (from \"[[There Was a Crooked Man]]\"), ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (from \"[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]\"), ''[[Hickory Dickory Dock (novel)|Hickory Dickory Dock]]'' (from \"[[Hickory Dickory Dock]]\"), and ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories|Three Blind Mice]]'' (from \"[[Three Blind Mice]]\"). Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie would insert stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works.

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''Three Act Tragedy''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\n==== Plays ====\n[[File:Agatha Christie Memorial (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to Christie in central London]]\nIn 1928, ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' was adapted for the stage by Michael Morton under the title ''[[Alibi (play)|Alibi]]''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|177}} While the play enjoyed a respectable run, Christie disliked the changes made to her original work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself.

While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a solid background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up-to-date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|235,470}}\n\nAs Michael C.

She met her second husband, Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dever|first=Norma|date=2004|title=They Also Dug!

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling was reflected in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals==\nChristie has been portrayed in film and television. Biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'' (2018), in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie.
