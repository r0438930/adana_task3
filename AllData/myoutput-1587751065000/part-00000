Other hit versions were later recorded by [[Eruption (band)|Eruption]] and [[Tina Turner]].\n\n==Ann Peebles version==\nThe song was written by Peebles, her partner (and later husband) Don Bryant, and [[DJ]] Bernard \"Bernie\" Miller in 1973:<blockquote>One evening in Memphis in 1973, soul singer Ann Peebles was meeting friends, including her partner, [[Hi Records]] staff writer Don Bryant, to go to a concert. Just as they were about to set off, the heavens opened and Peebles snapped: \"I can't stand the rain.\" As a professional songwriter in constant need of new material, Bryant was used to plucking resonant phrases out of the air and he liked the idea of reacting against recent R&B hits that celebrated bad weather, such as [[the Dramatics]]' \"In the Rain\" and [[Love Unlimited]]'s \"[[Walkin' in the Rain with the One I Love]]\".  So he sat down at the piano and started riffing on the theme, weaving in ideas from Peebles and local DJ Bernie Miller. The song was finished that night and presented the next morning to Hi's studio maestro, Willie Mitchell, who used a brand new gadget, the [[timbales|electric timbale]], to create the song's distinctive raindrop riff. It really was that easy. \"We didn't go to the concert,\" Bryant remembers. \"We forgot about the concert.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/20/ann-peebles-girl-with-the-big-voice Dorian Lynskey, \"Ann Peebles: the girl with the big voice\", ''The Guardian'', 20 February 2014]. Retrieved 30 June 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnn Peebles said: \"At first, we had the timbales all the way through the song but as we played the tape, [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]] said 'what about if the timbales were in front before anything else comes in?'. So we did that and when we listened back I said 'I love it, let's do that'.\"<ref name=funkyflyy>[http://hem.bredband.net/funkyflyy/peebles/  Miss FunkyFlyy, \"Ann Peebles\"].
