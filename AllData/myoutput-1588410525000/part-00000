Stanbridge described part of their system in a lecture delivered before the [[Philosophical Institute of Victoria]] in September 1857.

The northern rise of ''Marpeankuurk'' ([[Arcturus]]) signalled that it was time to harvest the larvae of the [[honeypot ant|wood ant]], a species of [[carpenter ant]]. When ''Neilloan'' ([[Vega]]) set just after duskfall, it indicated that [[malleefowl]] eggs were ready to be collected. The setting of ''Coonartoorung'' (the [[Beehive Cluster]]) in the constellation of [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] marked the onset of autumn.{{sfn|Hamacher|2011}}\n\nOne [[dreamtime]] story of the Wudjubalug people tells of how [[Gnowee]], the sun, was created by ''Pupperimbul'', one of the ''Nurrumbunguttia'' before these ancient spirits disappeared from the heavens before man himself was created, and the earth was in sheer darkness. Pupperimbul hurled an emu egg into the firmament, whereupon it burst and shed light over the sky. The celestial pattern of the near stars reflected kinship patterns: Gnowee's sister was ''Chargee Gnowee'' ([[Venus]]), the wife of ''Ginabongbearp'' ([[Jupiter]]).{{sfn|Haynes|2012|p=57}}{{sfn|Stanbridge|1861|p=301}}\n\n===European contact and history===\nIt is likely that first contact with Europeans was through smallpox epidemics which arrived with the [[First Fleet]] in 1788 and rapidly spread through the trading networks of indigenous Australians and killed many people in two waves before the 1830s. It killed large numbers of people, and disfigured many more with pock-marked faces, and tribal elders said it came down the [[Murray River]] sent by malevolent sorcerers to the north. One Wudjubalug account called the disease ''thinba micka''.{{sfn|Broome|2005|p=9}}\n\nThe explorer [[Edward John Eyre]] was possibly the first European (called by the Wergaia ''ngamadjidj''){{sfn|Clark|1995|p=177}} seen by the Maligundidj when he followed the [[Wimmera River]] to [[Lake Hindmarsh]] in 1838. His reports of the well-watered mallee country provided encouragement for the subsequent rush of settlers with their cattle and sheep eager to establish pastoral stations.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=177}} Strong resistance to this influx meant that Europeans could not travel unarmed in Wergaia territory during the first decade of settlement.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=177}} Horatio Cockburn Ellerman, an early settler who came to run the Antwerp station in 1846, had participated in several raids on aboriginal camps,{{sfn|Clark|1995|pp=180\u2013182}} and was notoriously hard on the indigenous people early in his career. He had, according to the testimony of William Taylor, had taken part in a punitive raid in the southern Wimmera. His ruthlessness drew the enmity particularly of the Wudjubalug, who were rumoured to be intent on killing him. Ellerman obtained a warrant in 1844, and, enlisting the assistance of Border Police, tracked down the suspect, shooting him together with another Wudjubalug.{{sfn|Kenny|2007|p=140}} He was widely believed to have been involved in the murder of an aboriginal woman at ''Banji bunag'' in 1846,{{sfn|Jensz|2010|p=116}} where he had fired at random at a Gur-balug group of aboriginals at their camp site on the [[Wimmera River]].{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=180}} Ellerman took her orphaned child in. Ellerman lost track of the boy while he consigned his wool to Melbourne in 1850, and Willie, who was picked up and befriended by schoolboys, was adopted by the Reverend Lloyd Chase and later taken to Britain to be educated as a missionary to his people. While in England, he found the climate and solitude unbearable and, contracting, a lung disease died on 10 March 1852.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=180}} Just before his death he asked to be baptised in the Christian faith, and was given the baptismal name William Wimmera. A sixteen-page account of his life, ''A Short memoir of William Wimmera, an Australian Boy,'' was published which focused on his religious redemption.{{sfn|Kenny|2007|pp=21,120}}\n[[File:\u2018King Richard\u2019 or \u2018Dick-a-Dick\u2019, the tracker who found the Duff children, 20 August 1864.jpeg|thumb|[[Dick-a-Dick]]]]\n\n[[Dick-a-Dick]] was a Wudjubalug [[Aboriginal tracker|tracker]] responsible for finding the three Duff children lost in the Australian bush for 9&nbsp;days in 1864 which garnered national and even international attention. Dick-a-Dick was one of the Wudjubalug and [[Jardwadjali]] men who formed the basis for the [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868]].\n\nIn 1981 or early 1982 the aboriginal community met in [[Horsham]] and applied for registration as the ''Goolum Goolum Aboriginal Cooperative''. According to Clark, ''Goolum goolum'' is a Wergaia word meaning 'stranger, especially a dangerous stranger, wild blackfellow.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=180}}\n\n===Ebenezer Mission===\n{{main|Ebenezer Mission}}\nTwo [[Moravian Church|Moravian missionaries]], [[Friedrich Hagenauer]] and F.W. Spieseke, who had been active at [[Lake Boga, Victoria|lake Boga]] for several years, established the [[Ebenezer Mission]] in 1859 in Wergaia country at a site called ''Banji bunag'' (variously spelled ''Bungo budnutt''/''Punyo Bunnutt''),{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=181}} close to where Willie's mother was killed, and a traditional meeting place and [[corroboree]] ground. The site was chosen with the assistance of Ellerman.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=177}}\n\nIn 1902 the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|State Government of Victoria]] decided to close the Ebenezer Mission due to low numbers. The mission closed in 1904, and most of the land reverted to the Victorian Lands Department as crown land, and was opened up for [[Selection (Australian history)|selection]]. In the following twenty years many Wergaia people were forcibly moved to [[Lake Tyers Mission]] in [[Gippsland]] under police escort, along with closure of all rations to Ebenezer Mission and seizure of children.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=179}}\n\n==Native Title recognition==\n{{main|Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagulk Peoples v Victoria}}\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the [[Wimmera]] won native title recognition on 13 December 2005 after a ten-year legal process. It was the first successful native title claim in south-eastern Australia and in Victoria, determined by Justice [[Ron Merkel]] involving Wudjubalug, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagalk people.{{sfn|Shiel|2005}} In his reasons for judgement Justice Merkel made special mention of Wudjubalug elder [[William John Kennedy|Uncle Jack Kennedy]] and explained the significance of his orders:\n\n<blockquote>The orders I propose to make are of special significance as they constitute the first recognition and protection of native title resulting in the ongoing enjoyment of native title in the State of Victoria and, it would appear, on the South-Eastern seaboard of Australia. These are areas in which the Aboriginal peoples suffered severe and extensive dispossession, degradation and devastation as a consequence of the establishment of British sovereignty over their lands and waters during the 19th century.{{sfn|AustLII|2005}}</blockquote>\n\n==Prominent speakers of Wergaia==\n* [[William John Kennedy]]\n* [[Dick-a-Dick]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alfred William Howitt]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n*{{Cite book| title = Aboriginal Victorians: A History Since 1800\n | last = Broome | first = Richard | year = 2005\n | author-link = Richard Broome\n | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]]\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=vrlVxsEq524C&pg=PA9\n | isbn = 978-1-741-14569-4\n}}\n*{{Cite book| chapter = Recent Investigations at the Ebenezer Mission Cemetery\n | last1 = Brown | first1 = Steve\n | last2 = Avery | first2 = Steven\n | last3 = Goulding | first3 = Megan\n | year = 2004\n | title = After Captain Cook: The Archaeology of the Recent Indigenous Past in Australia\n | editor1-last = Harrison | editor1-first = Rodney\n | editor2-last = Williamson | editor2-first = Christine\n | publisher = [[Rowman Altamira]]\n | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Pcyaws7Izu4C&pg=PA149\n | pages = 147\u2013169\n | isbn = 978-0-759-10657-4\n}}\n*{{Cite news| title = Stories in the Stars \u2013 the night sky of the Boorong people\n | last1 = Christies | first1 = Patricia\n | last2 = Bush | first2 = Martin\n | year = 2008 | orig-year = First published 2005\n | pages = 1\u201312\n | publisher = [[Museum Victoria]]\n | url = https://museumvictoria.com.au/media/1860/stories-in-the-stars.pdf\n}}\n*{{Cite book| title = Aboriginal Languages and Clans: An Historical Atlas of Western and Central Victoria, 1800-1900\n | last = Clark | first = Ian | year = 1990\n | publisher = [[Monash University|Monash publications in geography, No.37]]\n | isbn = 978-0-909-68541-6\n}}\n*{{Cite book| title = Scars in the Landscape: A Register of Massacre Sites in Western Victoria, 1803-1859\n | last = Clark | first = Ian | year = 1995\n | publisher = [[Aboriginal Studies Press]]\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=N0dIhJqRqYgC&pg=PA177\n | isbn = 978-0-855-75595-9\n}}\n*{{Cite book| title = The Languages of Australia\n | last = Dixon | first = Robert M.

The northern rise of ''Marpeankuurk'' ([[Arcturus]]) signalled that it was time to harvest the larvae of the [[honeypot ant|wood ant]], a species of [[carpenter ant]]. When ''Neilloan'' ([[Vega]]) set just after duskfall, it indicated that [[malleefowl]] eggs were ready to be collected. The setting of ''Coonartoorung'' (the [[Beehive Cluster]]) in the constellation of [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] marked the onset of autumn.{{sfn|Hamacher|2011}}\n\nOne [[dreamtime]] story of the Wudjubalug people tells of how [[Gnowee]], the sun, was created by ''Pupperimbul'', one of the ''Nurrumbunguttia'' before these ancient spirits disappeared from the heavens before man himself was created, and the earth was in sheer darkness. Pupperimbul hurled an emu egg into the firmament, whereupon it burst and shed light over the sky. The celestial pattern of the near stars reflected kinship patterns: Gnowee's sister was ''Chargee Gnowee'' ([[Venus]]), the wife of ''Ginabongbearp'' ([[Jupiter]]).{{sfn|Haynes|2012|p=57}}{{sfn|Stanbridge|1861|p=301}}\n\n===European contact and history===\nIt is likely that first contact with Europeans was through smallpox epidemics which arrived with the [[First Fleet]] in 1788 and rapidly spread through the trading networks of indigenous Australians and killed many people in two waves before the 1830s. It killed large numbers of people, and disfigured many more with pock-marked faces, and tribal elders said it came down the [[Murray River]] sent by malevolent sorcerers to the north. One Wudjubalug account called the disease ''thinba micka''.{{sfn|Broome|2005|p=9}}\n\nThe explorer [[Edward John Eyre]] was possibly the first European (called by the Wergaia ''ngamadjidj''){{sfn|Clark|1995|p=177}} seen by the Maligundidj when he followed the [[Wimmera River]] to [[Lake Hindmarsh]] in 1838. His reports of the well-watered mallee country provided encouragement for the subsequent rush of settlers with their cattle and sheep eager to establish pastoral stations.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=177}} Strong resistance to this influx meant that Europeans could not travel unarmed in Wergaia territory during the first decade of settlement.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=177}} Horatio Cockburn Ellerman, an early settler who came to run the Antwerp station in 1846, had participated in several raids on aboriginal camps,{{sfn|Clark|1995|pp=180\u2013182}} and was notoriously hard on the indigenous people early in his career. He had, according to the testimony of William Taylor, had taken part in a punitive raid in the southern Wimmera. His ruthlessness drew the enmity particularly of the Wudjubalug, who were rumoured to be intent on killing him. Ellerman obtained a warrant in 1844, and, enlisting the assistance of Border Police, tracked down the suspect, shooting him together with another Wudjubalug.{{sfn|Kenny|2007|p=140}} He was widely believed to have been involved in the murder of an aboriginal woman at ''Banji bunag'' in 1846,{{sfn|Jensz|2010|p=116}} where he had fired at random at a Gur-balug group of aboriginals at their camp site on the [[Wimmera River]].{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=180}} Ellerman took her orphaned child in. Ellerman lost track of the boy while he consigned his wool to Melbourne in 1850, and Willie, who was picked up and befriended by schoolboys, was adopted by the Reverend Lloyd Chase and later taken to Britain to be educated as a missionary to his people. While in England, he found the climate and solitude unbearable and, contracting, a lung disease died on 10 March 1852.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=180}} Just before his death he asked to be baptised in the Christian faith, and was given the baptismal name William Wimmera. A sixteen-page account of his life, ''A Short memoir of William Wimmera, an Australian Boy,'' was published which focused on his religious redemption.{{sfn|Kenny|2007|pp=21,120}}\n[[File:\u2018King Richard\u2019 or \u2018Dick-a-Dick\u2019, the tracker who found the Duff children, 20 August 1864.jpeg|thumb|[[Dick-a-Dick]]]]\n\n[[Dick-a-Dick]] was a Wudjubalug [[Aboriginal tracker|tracker]] responsible for finding the three Duff children lost in the Australian bush for 9&nbsp;days in 1864 which garnered national and even international attention. Dick-a-Dick was one of the Wudjubalug and [[Jardwadjali]] men who formed the basis for the [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868]].\n\nIn 1981 or early 1982 the aboriginal community met in [[Horsham]] and applied for registration as the ''Goolum Goolum Aboriginal Cooperative''. According to Clark, ''Goolum goolum'' is a Wergaia word meaning 'stranger, especially a dangerous stranger, wild blackfellow.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=180}}\n\n===Ebenezer Mission===\n{{main|Ebenezer Mission}}\nTwo [[Moravian Church|Moravian missionaries]], [[Friedrich Hagenauer]] and F.W. Spieseke, who had been active at [[Lake Boga, Victoria|lake Boga]] for several years, established the [[Ebenezer Mission]] in 1859 in Wergaia country at a site called ''Banji bunag'' (variously spelled ''Bungo budnutt''/''Punyo Bunnutt''),{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=181}} close to where Willie's mother was killed, and a traditional meeting place and [[corroboree]] ground. The site was chosen with the assistance of Ellerman.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=177}}\n\nIn 1902 the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|State Government of Victoria]] decided to close the Ebenezer Mission due to low numbers. The mission closed in 1904, and most of the land reverted to the Victorian Lands Department as crown land, and was opened up for [[Selection (Australian history)|selection]]. In the following twenty years many Wergaia people were forcibly moved to [[Lake Tyers Mission]] in [[Gippsland]] under police escort, along with closure of all rations to Ebenezer Mission and seizure of children.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=179}}\n\n==Native Title recognition==\n{{main|Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagulk Peoples v Victoria}}\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the [[Wimmera]] won native title recognition on 13 December 2005 after a ten-year legal process. It was the first successful native title claim in south-eastern Australia and in Victoria, determined by Justice [[Ron Merkel]] involving Wudjubalug, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagalk people.{{sfn|Shiel|2005}} In his reasons for judgement Justice Merkel made special mention of Wudjubalug elder [[William John Kennedy|Uncle Jack Kennedy]] and explained the significance of his orders:\n\n<blockquote>The orders I propose to make are of special significance as they constitute the first recognition and protection of native title resulting in the ongoing enjoyment of native title in the State of Victoria and, it would appear, on the South-Eastern seaboard of Australia. These are areas in which the Aboriginal peoples suffered severe and extensive dispossession, degradation and devastation as a consequence of the establishment of British sovereignty over their lands and waters during the 19th century.{{sfn|AustLII|2005}}</blockquote>\n\n==Prominent speakers of Wergaia==\n* [[William John Kennedy]]\n* [[Dick-a-Dick]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alfred William Howitt]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n*{{Cite book| title = Aboriginal Victorians: A History Since 1800\n | last = Broome | first = Richard | year = 2005\n | author-link = Richard Broome\n | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]]\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=vrlVxsEq524C&pg=PA9\n | isbn = 978-1-741-14569-4\n | ref = harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book| chapter = Recent Investigations at the Ebenezer Mission Cemetery\n | last1 = Brown | first1 = Steve\n | last2 = Avery | first2 = Steven\n | last3 = Goulding | first3 = Megan\n | year = 2004\n | title = After Captain Cook: The Archaeology of the Recent Indigenous Past in Australia\n | editor1-last = Harrison | editor1-first = Rodney\n | editor2-last = Williamson | editor2-first = Christine\n | publisher = [[Rowman Altamira]]\n | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Pcyaws7Izu4C&pg=PA149\n | pages = 147\u2013169\n | isbn = 978-0-759-10657-4\n | ref = harv\n}}\n*{{Cite news| title = Stories in the Stars \u2013 the night sky of the Boorong people\n | last1 = Christies | first1 = Patricia\n | last2 = Bush | first2 = Martin\n | year = 2008 | orig-year = First published 2005\n | pages = 1\u201312\n | publisher = [[Museum Victoria]]\n | url = https://museumvictoria.com.au/media/1860/stories-in-the-stars.pdf\n | ref = harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book| title = Aboriginal Languages and Clans: An Historical Atlas of Western and Central Victoria, 1800-1900\n | last = Clark | first = Ian | year = 1990\n | publisher = [[Monash University|Monash publications in geography, No.37]]\n | isbn = 978-0-909-68541-6\n | ref = harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book| title = Scars in the Landscape: A Register of Massacre Sites in Western Victoria, 1803-1859\n | last = Clark | first = Ian | year = 1995\n | publisher = [[Aboriginal Studies Press]]\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=N0dIhJqRqYgC&pg=PA177\n | isbn = 978-0-855-75595-9\n | ref = harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book| title = The Languages of Australia\n | last = Dixon | first = Robert M.
