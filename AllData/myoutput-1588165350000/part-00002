It was introduced late in the 1953 model year, and produced through 1962. It is commonly referred to as the \"solid-axle\" generation, as the independent rear suspension did not appear until the 1963 Sting Ray. The Corvette was rushed into production for its debut model year to capitalize on the enthusiastic public reaction to the [[concept car|concept vehicle]], but expectations for the new model were largely unfulfilled.<ref name=Prince/> Reviews were mixed and sales fell far short of expectations through the car's early years.

The outer body was made out of then-revolutionary [[fiberglass|glass fiber reinforced plastic]] material. Although steel shortages or quotas are sometimes mentioned as a factor in the decision to use fiberglass, no evidence exists to support this. In calendar years 1952 and 1953 Chevrolet produced nearly 2 million steel bodied full-size passenger cars and the intended production volume of 10,000 Corvette for 1954 was only a small fraction of that.<ref name=Premo1>{{cite journal|last=Premo |first=Ellis |title=The Corvette Plastic Body|journal=Society of Automotive Engineers |date=1954 |volume=540257 |url= http://papers.sae.org/540257/ |accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=SAE International}}</ref>\n\nThe body engineer for the Corvette was Ellis James Premo. He presented a paper to the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] in 1954 regarding the development of the body.<ref name=Premo1 /> Several excerpts highlight some of the key points in the body material choice:\n{{Quote|text=\n''The body on the show model was made of reinforced plastic purely as an expedient to get the job done quickly.''\n\n''Although we were going ahead with the building of an experimental plastic body in order to get a car rolling for chassis development work \u2013 at the time of the Waldorf Show, we were actually concentrating body-design-wise on a steel body utilizing [[Zamak|Kirksite]] tooling for the projected production of 10,000 units during the 1954 model year. It was some time later that we decided to produce this quantity in reinforced plastic.''\n\n''About this time, some doubt was expressed that we should build the 1954 model of steel. People seemed to be captivated by the idea of the fiberglass plastic body. Furthermore, information being given to us by the reinforced plastic industry seemed to indicate the practicality of fabricating plastic body parts for automobiles on a large scale.''\n}}\n\nA 55 degree raked windshield was made of safety glass, while the license plate holder was set back in the trunk, covered with a plastic window.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Underneath the new body material were standard components from Chevrolet's regular car line, including the \"Blue Flame\" [[Straight-6|inline six-cylinder]] engine, two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, and [[drum brake]]s.

All 1953 models had Polo White exteriors, red interiors,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and black canvas soft tops.

Other problems, such as water leaks and doors that could open while the car was driven, were reported with the most severe errors corrected in subsequent units produced, but some shortcomings continued beyond the Corvette's inaugural year.<ref name=Prince/> By December 1953, Chevrolet had a newly equipped factory in St. Louis ready to build 10,000 Corvettes annually. However, negative customer reaction in 1953 and early 1954 models caused sales to plummet.\n\n===1954===\nIn 1954, only 3,640 of this model were built and nearly a third were unsold at year's end. New colors were available, but the six-cylinder engine and Powerglide automatic, the only engine and transmission available, were not what sports car enthusiasts expected. It is known that 1954 models were painted Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red, and Black, in addition to Polo White. All had red interiors, except for those finished in Pennant Blue which had a beige interior and beige canvas soft top.

The surprising finding was their opinions in comparison to foreign sports cars. It was found that 36% of those taking the survey had owned a foreign sports car, and of that, half of them rated the Corvette as better than their previous foreign sports car. Nineteen percent rated the Corvette as equal to their foreign sports car and 22% rated the Corvette as inferior. While many were well pleased with the Corvette, they did not consider it as a true sports car.

At first 1955 V8 Corvettes continued with the mandatory-option Powerglide automatic transmission (as did the few 6-cylinder models built), but a new three-speed manual transmission came along later in the year for V8 models only. Exterior color choices were expanded to at least five, combined with at least four interior colors. Even soft-tops came in three colors and different materials. Despite all this, only 700 1955 Corvettes were built, making it second only to 1953 in scarcity. Very few six-cylinder 1955 models were built, and all documented examples are equipped with automatic transmissions. The \"V\" in the Corvette emblem was enlarged and gold colored, signifying the V8 engine under the hood and 12 volt electrical systems, while 6-cylinder models retained the 6-volt systems used in 1953-54.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Rare option estimate: Manual transmission (75).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlthough not a part of the original Corvette project, [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]] was responsible for the addition of the V8 engine and three-speed manual transmission.

It was introduced late in the 1953 model year, and produced through 1962. It is commonly referred to as the \"solid-axle\" generation, as the independent rear suspension did not appear until the 1963 Sting Ray. The Corvette was rushed into production for its debut model year to capitalize on the enthusiastic public reaction to the [[concept car|concept vehicle]], but expectations for the new model were largely unfulfilled.<ref name=Prince/> Reviews were mixed and sales fell far short of expectations through the car's early years.

Because there was currently no manual transmission available to Chevrolet rated to handle 150 HP, a two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic was used. {{cvt|0|-|60|mph}} time was 11.5 seconds.\n\nThree body variants were created.

The outer body was made out of then-revolutionary [[fiberglass|glass fiber reinforced plastic]] material. Although steel shortages or quotas are sometimes mentioned as a factor in the decision to use fiberglass, no evidence exists to support this. In calendar years 1952 and 1953 Chevrolet produced nearly 2 million steel bodied full-size passenger cars and the intended production volume of 10,000 Corvette for 1954 was only a small fraction of that.<ref name=Premo1>{{cite journal|last=Premo |first=Ellis |title=The Corvette Plastic Body|journal=Society of Automotive Engineers |date=1954 |volume=540257 |url= http://papers.sae.org/540257/ |accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=SAE International}}</ref>\n\nThe body engineer for the Corvette was Ellis James Premo. He presented a paper to the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] in 1954 regarding the development of the body.<ref name=Premo1 /> Several excerpts highlight some of the key points in the body material choice:\n{{Quote|text=\n''The body on the show model was made of reinforced plastic purely as an expedient to get the job done quickly.''\n\n''Although we were going ahead with the building of an experimental plastic body in order to get a car rolling for chassis development work \u2013 at the time of the Waldorf Show, we were actually concentrating body-design-wise on a steel body utilizing [[Zamak|Kirksite]] tooling for the projected production of 10,000 units during the 1954 model year.

All 1953 models had Polo White exteriors, red interiors,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and black canvas soft tops.

However, negative customer reaction in 1953 and early 1954 models caused sales to plummet.\n\n===1954===\nIn 1954, only 3,640 of this model were built and nearly a third were unsold at year's end. New colors were available, but the six-cylinder engine and Powerglide automatic, the only engine and transmission available, were not what sports car enthusiasts expected. It is known that 1954 models were painted Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red, and Black, in addition to Polo White. All had red interiors, except for those finished in Pennant Blue which had a beige interior and beige canvas soft top.

The surprising finding was their opinions in comparison to foreign sports cars. It was found that 36% of those taking the survey had owned a foreign sports car, and of that, half of them rated the Corvette as better than their previous foreign sports car. Nineteen percent rated the Corvette as equal to their foreign sports car and 22% rated the Corvette as inferior. While many were well pleased with the Corvette, they did not consider it as a true sports car. The principal complaint of the surveyed owners was the tendency of the body to leak extensively during rain storms.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA118&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oMYwT4n1Lsnyggfv2OCyBQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Corvette Is A Fine Fun Car But It Has Its Limitations.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1954, pp. 118-122/356.</ref>\n\n===1955===\nChevrolet debuted its [[Chevrolet small-block engine#265|{{cvt|265|CID|L}} small-block, {{cvt|195|hp}}]] [[V8]] in 1955 and the engine found its way into the Corvette. At first 1955 V8 Corvettes continued with the mandatory-option Powerglide automatic transmission (as did the few 6-cylinder models built), but a new three-speed manual transmission came along later in the year for V8 models only. Exterior color choices were expanded to at least five, combined with at least four interior colors. Even soft-tops came in three colors and different materials. Despite all this, only 700 1955 Corvettes were built, making it second only to 1953 in scarcity. Very few six-cylinder 1955 models were built, and all documented examples are equipped with automatic transmissions. The \"V\" in the Corvette emblem was enlarged and gold colored, signifying the V8 engine under the hood and 12 volt electrical systems, while 6-cylinder models retained the 6-volt systems used in 1953-54.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Rare option estimate: Manual transmission (75).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlthough not a part of the original Corvette project, [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]] was responsible for the addition of the V8 engine and three-speed manual transmission. Duntov improved the car's marketing and image and helped the car compete with the new V8\u2014engined [[Ford Thunderbird]], and turned the Corvette from its lackluster performance into a credible performer.
