Irish and [[Scotland|Scottish]] feudal titles, particularly those granted by palatine lords, are difficult to classify in law, they are acknowledged as genuine [[hereditament]]s by the arms granting bodies of Ireland, Scotland, and England, but were never formally recognised by [[the Crown]].\n\nThe seat of the Baron of Loughmoe is [[Loughmoe Castle]] at [[Loughmore]] Village, [[Templemore]], Co. Tipperary. \n\n\n\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest documented Purcell is the Norman Hugh Purcell who in 1035 AD granted the tithes of Montmarquet, a vill on the frontiers of Picardy, and near Aumerle, to the Abbey of Aumerle.  \nThe successor of Sir Hugh Purcell was Dyno Purcell, who in about 1120, received a grant of the manor of Catteshull, Surrey, from King Henry I. Catteshull is a manor and tithing the north-east of Godalming (Surrey), and included lands in Chiddingfold. \u00d8yno married a daughter of [[Nigel de Broc]], a famous Justiciar of the time. In 1129\u201330, his elder son Geoffrey, the King's usher (hostiarius), paid his relief for his father\u2019s land and held it free of toll as it had been in his father's time, and gave it to Reading Abbey on becoming a monk there.  This gift was confirmed both by the Empress Maud and by her opponent Stephen. No mention is made of Catteshull in the confirmatory grants of Henry II to Reading Abbey, and he seems to have regranted it to Ralph de Broc, son of \u00d8yno Purcell (identical with Ralph Purcell), to hold by the service of usher of the king\u2019s chamber.  \n[[File:Castles of Munster, Loughmoe, Tipperary (4) - geograph.org.uk - 1542655.jpg|thumb|The outside of the castle, as seen from the West.

Ranulf was excommunicated for theft of property of the Archbishopric by Becket, on Christmas Day, 1170, the traditional day of forgiveness. When [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who was in Normandy, heard of this, he is said to have asked why none of his knights had rid him of \u201cthis troublesome priest\u201d. A few days later, four knights arrived at [[Saltwood Castle|Saltwood]], Ranulf de Broc\u2019s castle in Kent. After the murder, [[Saltwood Castle|Saltwood]] was confiscated by Henry for De Broc's involvement in the murder. De Broc argued that the knights had lied to him and said Henry had ordered Becket be arrested.\n\nJust as Randulf de Broc had no male issue, neither had his nephew Robert, who as Justiciar is frequently mentioned in the public Records; Robert came to be represented by the De Lodges\u2019 and the Peto\u2019s.\n\nThe Purcell male representation then passed to the family of the lords of Newton-Purcell Oxon., and Shareshull, Staffordshire. Ralph, the founder of this line, inherited those manors and others in Normandy, near Rouen, together with the Court Office, viz.: Usher of the King\u2019s Chamber, as well as his maternal uncle Robert Burnell\u2019s Court Office of Usher, who was living in 1129\u201330 and enjoyed the Royal favour shown by the remission of the Dane-Geld.  About 1154, a charter of confirmation of his uncle\u2019s lands and office passed attested, among others, by St. Thomas a Beckett, the Chancellor.  About 1160 he made a grant of land in Normandy to the Abbey of the Holy Trinity, Rouen.  He must have lived to a great age, as he obtained another confirmation under the payment from King John A.D. 1200.  He was the Patriarch of a numerous tribe in England and Ireland; one of his sons being Hugh, who took part in the English Invasion of Ireland in 1171 and became the founder of the House of Purcell in that country.\n\n===Norman invasion of Ireland 1171 AD===\n[[File:Norman Invasion Leaders.jpg|thumb|Leaders of the Norman invasion of Ireland, depicted by Giraldus Cambrensis. ]]\nAccording to O'Hart, this Hugh was the unnamed knight mentioned by [[Giraldus Cambrensis]], as slain at Waterford.

As part of his marriage, Hugh received from FitzWalter, the town of Loughmoe. Sir Hugh founded, in 1241, a Monastery of Franciscans or Grey Friars in Waterford. Hugh's tomb is described by 17th century sources as having on it, the figure of a man in armour, in high relief, with a shield on his left arm, on which were three lions passant guardant in pale.
