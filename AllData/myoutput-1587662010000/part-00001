Eren is a teenager who swears revenge on enormous creatures known as Titans that devoured his mother and destroyed his town in the Shiganshina district in Wall Maria. In order to defeat the Titans, Eren, alongside his childhood friends [[Mikasa Ackerman]] and [[Armin Arlert]], enlist in the Military and join the Exploration Corps\u2014an elite group of soldiers who fight Titans outside the walls and also study the physiology of Titans in order to know what they are fighting. As the story progresses, later learning it was his father's doing, Eren gained the power of becoming a Titan later identified as the titular {{Nihongo|'''Attack Titan'''|\u9032\u6483\u306e\u5de8\u4eba|Shingeki no Kyojin}}. Eren uses this power to give Humanity an advantage to defeat their enemies while learning of their true identity and their own history.\n\nIn the [[anime]] adaptation of the series, Eren has been voiced by [[Y\u016bki Kaji]] in Japanese and [[Bryce Papenbrook]] in English. In the live-action film adaptations, he is portrayed by [[Haruma Miura]]. Critical reception to Eren was initially quite mixed but grew more positive as the series progressed, though the character has typically proven popular within the ''Attack on Titan'' fanbase and anime in general.\n\n==Creation and design==\nAuthor [[Hajime Isayama]] created Eren to be \"an ordinary youngster who gets paralyzed with fear when he sees a titan\" rather than a stereotypical hotheaded protagonist often seen in [[shonen manga]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Nelkin|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2015-07-22/live-action-attack-on-titan-writer-warns-fans-of-more-changes/.90765 |title= Live-Action Attack on Titan Writer Warns Fans of More Changes|work=Anime News Network|date=July 22, 2015|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref> He also stated that Eren's wish to go outside the city's walls is similar to his own when he was a child: He lived in a rural Japanese town surrounded by mountains. One day, he wanted to go beyond the mountains, which reflected in the town surrounded by walls in the manga where Eren lived in the series' beginning.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Nelkin|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-09-23/attack-on-titan-creator-reveals-secrets-on-japanese-tv-show |title=Attack on Titan Creator Reveals Secrets on Japanese TV Show|work=Anime News Network|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref> The character's Titan form's physique was modeled after middleweight mixed martial artist [[Yushin Okami]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/06/14/attack-on-titan-creator-hajime-isayama-interview/ |first=Brigid |last=Alverson | title=MTV Geek \u2013 Interview with Attack on Titan Creator Hajime Isayama |work = MTV Geek News | publisher = Viacom | date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"vol 1 interview\">''Attack on Titan'' manga, volume 1, interview \"For the Titan version of Eren, I use martial artist Yuushin Okami's body as a model.

While initially thinking about Annie, Isayama noted that there was no such rivalry between themselves and instead thought that Eren needed to overcome something to become stronger. Despite initial issues in understanding Eren, Isayama noted that the character reminded more about himself instead, though he still found Eren hard to write.<ref>{{cite book|title=Attack on Titan Guidebook|publisher=Kodansha|year=2014|page=172|isbn=9781612629452}}</ref> By the manga's 22nd volume, Isayama drew an image of Eren seeing the sea as something that motivated him during his childhood. However, Isayama stated that starting this moment, Eren and his friends matured as they are party of the military. Originally, Isayama idealized Eren as a character who was dragged by the plot in early chapters but he was always around Mikasa and Armin during these moments as they wanted to help him. Isayama noted Eren's characterization is different of what it was originally viewed by the fans; While originally wishing to see the sea as a dream, Eren instead believed mankind should have the right to see, resulting in a different perspective on how the character changes. Isayama further compared the trio of Eren, Mikasa and Armin to high school student who grow up across the life until their graduation. He viewed the scene of the trio seeing the sea as an alternate ending to the manga.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shingeki no Kyojin Character Directory|publisher=Kodansha|year=2017|transcript=https://fuku-shuu.tumblr.com/post/164182335102/snk-character-directory-isayama-hajime-interview|page=153|isbn=978-4-06510-216-9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:27th Tokyo International Film Festival Y\u016bki Kaji.jpg|thumb|Japanese voice actor [[Y\u016bki Kaji]]|150px]]\n[[File:10.12.12BrycePapenbrookByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|English voice actor [[Bryce Papenbrook]]|150px]]\nJapanese actor [[Y\u016bki Kaji]] commented on how it was important that he should voice Eren's Titan form because he believes it is an extension of the character.

The squad is assigned to watch over him and kill him should he lose control while in Titan form.<ref>{{cite book|title=Attack on Titan, vol. 3|author=Isayama, Hajime|year=2012|isbn=978-1-61262-026-8|chapter=Chapter 12|publisher=Kodansha Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Attack on Titan, vol. 5|author=Isayama, Hajime|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61262-254-5|chapter=Chapter 20|publisher=Kodansha Comics}}</ref> Shortly after joining the Spec Ops Squad, Eren finds himself hunted by a female Titan who determinedly kills all of his squad-mates to get to him. With help of Levi and Mikasa, Eren is saved from the Titan, later revealed to be his 104th classmate Annie Leonhart. Though Eren defeats Annie alongside his allies, they are unable to get answers as they watch her encase her human body in crystal using her Titan form's hardening ability. Eren soon learns during a mission to reach Krista Lenz, revealed to be Historia Reiss, that their other classmates Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover are the human forms of the Armored and Colossal Titans who were responsible for the Shiganshina attack.\n\nIt was then that Eren learns he possess a power that the enemy Titans seek called \"The Coordinate,\" subconsciously directing a group to kill and devour the Titan that killed his mother before having them attack Reiner and Bertolt so he and his friends can fall back.<ref>{{cite book|title=Attack on Titan, vol. 12|author=Isayama, Hajime|year=2014|isbn=978-1-61262-678-9|chapter=Chapter 50|publisher=Kodansha Comics}}</ref> Soon after, Eren is sent with his friends to an isolated village while preparations are made for a campaign to retake Wall Maria for good, by making use of his newfound power. But Eren is then captured by Rod Reiss, who reveals the Founding Titan (the true name of the \"Coordinate\") was originally in his family for years since their ancestor Karl Fritz created the walls and ruled the city from the shadows until it was stolen by Grisha. Eren also learns that his transformation into a Titan was caused by Grisha, another Titan Shifter, whom he unconsciously devoured to inherit the Founding Titan which Grisha obtained from eating Historia's half sister Frieda Reiss. Upon realizing Rod's plan to have Historia become a Titan and eat him to restore the Founding Titan to the Reiss bloodline he, Eren accepts his fate out of guilt for the people that died as a result of his father's actions while asking Historia to save humanity in his place. However, Eren finds Historia refusing to aid her father and frees him as Rod becomes an Abnormal Titan while Mikasa, Levi, and Jean arrive. Eren ingests a liquid labeled \"Armor\" that bestows him a new power to harden his Titan form, using it to save himself and his friends from being crushed by a collapsing ceiling before he and the Survey Corps head to the Orvud district where they confront and kill Rod.\n\nAfter the old regime is ousted and Historia ascends to the throne in his place, Eren and the Survey Corps depart to Shiganshina to reclaim Wall Maria by sealing its breach with his new power. But they face an army of Titans led by Zeke, the Beast Titan, and his subordinates Bertolt and Reiner. The vicious battle ends with Erwin and most of the expedition killed, Zeke and his men forced to abandon Bertolt as he was devoured by Armin when he was made a Titan to save his life. With Shiganshina secured, Eren and his friends enter his old house's basement and retrieve some books and a photograph of Grisha with his first family: Zeke revealed to be Eren's half brother whose mother Dina was the Titan that killed Eren's mother. Upon returning home, learning that humanity exists beyond the walls and that their true enemy is Marley while having a limited life as a side effect of being a holder of one of the Nine Titans' power, Eren realizes he can only use the Founding Titan when in the presence one of Ymir Fritz's direct descendants as was the case with Dina, a descendant of the Eldian kings herself, in her Titan form and seeing the Eldians' ultimate fate from touching Historia. Following the Survey Corps' incognito trip to Marley to hold an \"Association to Protect the Subjects of Ymir\", Eren becomes distant after the attendants' distain towards the Paradis Eldians and feigns siding with Zeke to access the Founding Titan's full power.\n\nFour years later, assumed to have been fending off Marleyan infiltrators with the new Colossal Titan Armin, Eren was leading the Survey Corps in an extraction of Zeke in Liberio following Marley having won its war with the Mid-East Allied Forces. Having his left leg amputated while assuming the identity of {{nihongo|Mr. Kruger|\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u3055\u3093|Kur\u016bg\u0101-sa}}, a former Marleyan military officer who was Eren's namesake who gave Grisha the power of the Attack Titan, to use a Warrior candidate named Falco Grice for intel gathering before having the boy bring Reiner Braun to him during the festival held by Willy Tybur. After making a subtle threat to Reiner and the people around them, Eren listens to Tybur's speech and learns how the Reiss family's founding patriarch, the 145th King Karl Fritz, engineered Eldia's fall with the Tybur family while covering their act through Helos. Eren then hears Willy condemning him as a threat to the world order as the actions of Grisha destroyed a ceasefire which Fritz arranged with the Tybur family, the king having promised that the Founding Titan power would not to be used against the world as long as it remains with his living descendants. In the fight that followed as his group succeed in faking Zeke's death, Eren kills Willy and then his sister to gain the War Hammer Titan's power.\n\nBut Eren's conduct throughout the mission though indiscriminately killing Marleyans, along with Sasha Blouse's death by Gabi Braun on his hands, results in his arrest for causing an international incident with his friends concerned over his new demeanor. Eren later escapes with a group of Survey Corps recruits calling themselves \"Yeagerists\" to find Zeke. Eren later makes himself known to Armin and Mikasa when they were at a restaurant owned by Marleyan turncoats, capturing his former friends and Gabi while dismissing their belief that Zeke is manipulating him. Later getting Pieck in his custody when she infiltrated the Yeagerists, revealing that Marley has begun to see Titans as obsolete with plans of wiping all Eldians, Eren finds himself ambushed by Galliard before being overpowered by him, Reiner, and Marley's fleet as Zeke arrives. He escapes with assistance from the Cart Titan and using his hardening ability to trap Reiner before existing his Titan body, only to have his head blown off by Gabi while attempting to reach Zeke.\n\nZeke catches Eren's head and the brothers enter the realm of Paths where they meet Ymir Fritz herself, Eren revealing his ruse before finding himself in chains as Zeke explains he nullified Karl Fritz's renunciation vow and now possesses the Founding Titan within the realm of Paths. Zeke then attempts to convince Eren that Grisha was manipulating him, only to realize that it was the opposite as Eren metaphysically coerced their father into taking the Founding Titan from the Reiss family as the Attack Titan's power allows its current user to see the memories of future successors. Once the vision ends as Grisha pleas Zeke to stop him, Eren discloses of knowing their people's final fate as he breaks free and convinces Ymir to obey him after giving her the choice to make her own decision. Revived in a new form, Eren frees the Titans within the Walls with the intention of exterminating all life outside Paradis Island to protect his people.\n\n===In other media===\nEren stars in the parody manga ''[[Attack on Titan: Junior High]]'' where he is presented as a student from high school who is obsessed with the Titans.<ref>{{cite book|title=Attack on Titan: Junior High, vol. 1|author=Nakagawa, Saki|year=2014|isbn=978-1-61262-916-2|publisher=Kodansha Comics}}</ref> He is a playable character in ''[[Attack on Titan: Humanity in Chains|Attack on Titan: The Last Wings of Mankind]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/12/04/one-glimpse-attack-titan-game-3ds/|title=One More Glimpse At The Attack On Titan Game For 3DS|publisher=Siliconera}}</ref> His Titan form also makes an appearance in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/01/matters_of_import_grappling_with_attack_on_titan_the_last_wings_of_mankind|title=Matters of Import: Grappling With Attack On Titan: The Last Wings Of Mankind|website=Nintendo Life}}</ref> Jin Haganeya's visual novel ''Burning bright in the forest of the night'' has Eren and Levi as the leading characters.

Eren is a teenager who swears revenge on enormous creatures known as Titans that devoured his mother and destroyed his town in the Shiganshina district in Wall Maria. In order to defeat the Titans, Eren, alongside his childhood friends [[Mikasa Ackerman]] and [[Armin Arlert]], enlist in the Military and join the Exploration Corps\u2014an elite group of soldiers who fight Titans outside the walls and also study the physiology of Titans in order to know what they are fighting. As the story progresses, later learning it was his father's doing, Eren gained the power of becoming a Titan later identified as the titular {{Nihongo|'''Attack Titan'''|\u9032\u6483\u306e\u5de8\u4eba|Shingeki no Kyojin}}. Eren uses this power to give Humanity an advantage to defeat their enemies while learning of their true identity and their own history.\n\nIn the [[anime]] adaptation of the series, Eren has been voiced by [[Y\u016bki Kaji]] in Japanese and [[Bryce Papenbrook]] in English. In the live-action film adaptations, he is portrayed by [[Haruma Miura]]. Critical reception to Eren was initially quite mixed but grew more positive as the series progressed, though the character has typically proven popular within the ''Attack on Titan'' fanbase and anime in general.\n\n==Creation and design==\nAuthor [[Hajime Isayama]] created Eren to be \"an ordinary youngster who gets paralyzed with fear when he sees a titan\" rather than a stereotypical hotheaded protagonist often seen in [[shonen manga]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Nelkin|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2015-07-22/live-action-attack-on-titan-writer-warns-fans-of-more-changes/.90765 |title= Live-Action Attack on Titan Writer Warns Fans of More Changes|work=Anime News Network|date=July 22, 2015|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref> He also stated that Eren's wish to go outside the city's walls is similar to his own when he was a child: He lived in a rural Japanese town surrounded by mountains.

While initially thinking about Annie, Isayama noted that there was no such rivalry between themselves and instead thought that Eren needed to overcome something to become stronger. Despite initial issues in understanding Eren, Isayama noted that the character reminded more about himself instead, though he still found Eren hard to write.<ref>{{cite book|title=Attack on Titan Guidebook|publisher=Kodansha|year=2014|page=172|isbn=9781612629452}}</ref> By the manga's 22nd volume, Isayama drew an image of Eren seeing the sea as something that motivated him during his childhood. However, Isayama stated that starting this moment, Eren and his friends matured as they are party of the military. Originally, Isayama idealized Eren as a character who was dragged by the plot in early chapters but he was always around Mikasa and Armin during these moments as they wanted to help him. Isayama noted Eren's characterization is different of what it was originally viewed by the fans; While originally wishing to see the sea as a dream, Eren instead believed mankind should have the right to see, resulting in a different perspective on how the character changes. Isayama further compared the trio of Eren, Mikasa and Armin to high school student who grow up across the life until their graduation. He viewed the scene of the trio seeing the sea as an alternate ending to the manga.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shingeki no Kyojin Character Directory|publisher=Kodansha|year=2017|transcript=https://fuku-shuu.tumblr.com/post/164182335102/snk-character-directory-isayama-hajime-interview|page=153|isbn=978-4-06510-216-9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:27th Tokyo International Film Festival Y\u016bki Kaji.jpg|thumb|Japanese voice actor [[Y\u016bki Kaji]]|150px]]\n[[File:10.12.12BrycePapenbrookByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|English voice actor [[Bryce Papenbrook]]|150px]]\nJapanese actor [[Y\u016bki Kaji]] commented on how it was important that he should voice Eren's Titan form because he believes it is an extension of the character.

With help of Levi and Mikasa, Eren is saved from the Titan, later revealed to be his 104th classmate Annie Leonhart. Though Eren defeats Annie alongside his allies, they are unable to get answers as they watch her encase her human body in crystal using her Titan form's hardening ability. Eren soon learns during a mission to reach Krista Lenz, revealed to be Historia Reiss, that their other classmates Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover are the human forms of the Armored and Colossal Titans who were responsible for the Shiganshina attack.\n\nIt was then that Eren learns he possess a power that the enemy Titans seek called \"The Coordinate,\" subconsciously directing a group to kill and devour the Titan that killed his mother before having them attack Reiner and Bertolt so he and his friends can fall back.<ref>{{cite book|title=Attack on Titan, vol. 12|author=Isayama, Hajime|year=2014|isbn=978-1-61262-678-9|chapter=Chapter 50|publisher=Kodansha Comics}}</ref> Soon after, Eren is sent with his friends to an isolated village while preparations are made for a campaign to retake Wall Maria for good, by making use of his newfound power. But Eren is then captured by Rod Reiss, who reveals the Founding Titan (the true name of the \"Coordinate\") was originally in his family for years since their ancestor Karl Fritz created the walls and ruled the city from the shadows until it was stolen by Grisha. Eren also learns that his transformation into a Titan was caused by Grisha, another Titan Shifter, whom he unconsciously devoured to inherit the Founding Titan which Grisha obtained from eating Historia's half sister Frieda Reiss. Upon realizing Rod's plan to have Historia become a Titan and eat him to restore the Founding Titan to the Reiss bloodline he, Eren accepts his fate out of guilt for the people that died as a result of his father's actions while asking Historia to save humanity in his place. However, Eren finds Historia refusing to aid her father and frees him as Rod becomes an Abnormal Titan while Mikasa, Levi, and Jean arrive. Eren ingests a liquid labeled \"Armor\" that bestows him a new power to harden his Titan form, using it to save himself and his friends from being crushed by a collapsing ceiling before he and the Survey Corps head to the Orvud district where they confront and kill Rod.\n\nAfter the old regime is ousted and Historia ascends to the throne in his place, Eren and the Survey Corps depart to Shiganshina to reclaim Wall Maria by sealing its breach with his new power. But they face an army of Titans led by Zeke, the Beast Titan, and his subordinates Bertolt and Reiner. The vicious battle ends with Erwin and most of the expedition killed, Zeke and his men forced to abandon Bertolt as he was devoured by Armin when he was made a Titan to save his life. With Shiganshina secured, Eren and his friends enter his old house's basement and retrieve some books and a photograph of Grisha with his first family: Zeke revealed to be Eren's half brother whose mother Dina was the Titan that killed Eren's mother. Upon returning home, learning that humanity exists beyond the walls and that their true enemy is Marley while having a limited life as a side effect of being a holder of one of the Nine Titans' power, Eren realizes he can only use the Founding Titan when in the presence one of Ymir Fritz's direct descendants as was the case with Dina, a descendant of the Eldian kings herself, in her Titan form and seeing the Eldians' ultimate fate from touching Historia. Following the Survey Corps' incognito trip to Marley to hold an \"Association to Protect the Subjects of Ymir\", Eren becomes distant after the attendants' distain towards the Paradis Eldians and feigns siding with Zeke to access the Founding Titan's full power.\n\nFour years later, assumed to have been fending off Marleyan infiltrators with the new Colossal Titan Armin, Eren was leading the Survey Corps in an extraction of Zeke in Liberio following Marley having won its war with the Mid-East Allied Forces. Having his left leg amputated while assuming the identity of {{nihongo|Mr. Kruger|\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u3055\u3093|Kur\u016bg\u0101-sa}}, a former Marleyan military officer who was Eren's namesake who gave Grisha the power of the Attack Titan, to use a Warrior candidate named Falco Grice for intel gathering before having the boy bring Reiner Braun to him during the festival held by Willy Tybur. After making a subtle threat to Reiner and the people around them, Eren listens to Tybur's speech and learns how the Reiss family's founding patriarch, the 145th King Karl Fritz, engineered Eldia's fall with the Tybur family while covering their act through Helos. Eren then hears Willy condemning him as a threat to the world order as the actions of Grisha destroyed a ceasefire which Fritz arranged with the Tybur family, the king having promised that the Founding Titan power would not to be used against the world as long as it remains with his living descendants. In the fight that followed as his group succeed in faking Zeke's death, Eren kills Willy and then his sister to gain the War Hammer Titan's power.\n\nBut Eren's conduct throughout the mission though indiscriminately killing Marleyans, along with Sasha Blouse's death by Gabi Braun on his hands, results in his arrest for causing an international incident with his friends concerned over his new demeanor. Eren later escapes with a group of Survey Corps recruits calling themselves \"Yeagerists\" to find Zeke. Eren later makes himself known to Armin and Mikasa when they were at a restaurant owned by Marleyan turncoats, capturing his former friends and Gabi while dismissing their belief that Zeke is manipulating him. Later getting Pieck in his custody when she infiltrated the Yeagerists, revealing that Marley has begun to see Titans as obsolete with plans of wiping all Eldians, Eren finds himself ambushed by Galliard before being overpowered by him, Reiner, and Marley's fleet as Zeke arrives. He escapes with assistance from the Cart Titan and using his hardening ability to trap Reiner before existing his Titan body, only to have his head blown off by Gabi while attempting to reach Zeke.\n\nZeke catches Eren's head and the brothers enter the realm of Paths where they meet Ymir Fritz herself, Eren revealing his ruse before finding himself in chains as Zeke explains he nullified Karl Fritz's renunciation vow and now possesses the Founding Titan within the realm of Paths. Zeke then attempts to convince Eren that Grisha was manipulating him, only to realize that it was the opposite as Eren metaphysically coerced their father into taking the Founding Titan from the Reiss family as the Attack Titan's power allows its current user to see the memories of future successors. Once the vision ends as Grisha pleas Zeke to stop him, Eren discloses of knowing their people's final fate as he breaks free and convinces Ymir to obey him after giving her the choice to make her own decision.
