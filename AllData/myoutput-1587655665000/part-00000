Their two older children are Erica ([[Hayley Orrantia]]) and Barry ([[Troy Gentile]]). The youngest child, Adam ([[Sean Giambrone]]), documents his family life with his video camera. Beverly's father, Albert \"Pops\" Solomon ([[George Segal]]), is frequently around to provide advice or to help out his grandchildren (often behind his daughter's back).\n\nThe present-day \"Adult Adam\" ([[Patton Oswalt]]) narrates every episode as taking place in \"1980-something\". The show makes references to the era's pop culture in a non-chronological order and each season contains references from throughout the decade.\n\nMany references to real-life Philadelphia-area businesses are made, including the [[Wawa (company)|Wawa]] convenience store chain, [[Gimbel's]] department store, [[Willow Grove Park Mall]], and Kremp's Florist of [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania]]. Additionally, several 1980s cultural icons guest star as themselves on the show and a number of figures from Goldberg's actual life guest star as fictional characters.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Portrayed by\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"7\" | Seasons\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 4)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 5)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 6)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 7)|7]]\n|-\n|Beverly Goldberg (n\u00e9e Solomon)\n| [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] \n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Adam Frederick Goldberg\n|[[Sean Giambrone]]\n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Barry Norman Goldberg\n|[[Troy Gentile]]\n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Erica Dorothy Goldberg\n|[[Hayley Orrantia]]\n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Albert \"Pops\" Solomon\n|[[George Segal]]\n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Murray Christian Goldberg\n|[[Jeff Garlin]]\n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Lainey Lewis \n|[[AJ Michalka]] \n| colspan=2 {{cRecurring}} \n| colspan=2 {{cMain}} \n| colspan=2 {{cRecurring}}\n| {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| Geoff \"Madman\" Schwartz\n|[[Sam Lerner]] \n| colspan=1 {{n/a|}} \n| colspan=3 {{cRecurring}} \n| colspan=3 {{cMain}} \n<!--Rich is not listed in the opening credits of any episode of 'The Goldbergs', therefore she should not be listed as main cast\n|-\n| Erica \"Valley Erica\" Coolidge\n| Alison Rich \n| colspan=4 {{n/a|}} \n| colspan=1 {{cRecurring}} \n| colspan=1 {{cMain}} \n-->\n|}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as Beverly Goldberg (n\u00e9e Solomon),<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the overprotective matriarch of the Goldbergs. She is often called their \"smother\" by the kids. She frequently injects herself into her children's lives, often to their embarrassment, and is supremely confident in their abilities.\n* [[Sean Giambrone]] as [[Adam F. Goldberg]],<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the pop-culture obsessed youngest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and geeky, he frequently films his family's activities on a VHS camcorder. He often ends up having to use his middle initial to distinguish himself from another Adam Goldberg who attends the same school and is also an aspiring filmmaker.\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] voices the adult Adam Goldberg,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=TV Review: ''The Goldbergs''|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/reviews/the-goldbergs-TV-review-1200613772/|work=Variety|date=September 17, 2013}}</ref> who narrates the show from the present day.\n* [[Troy Gentile]] as Barry Norman Goldberg,<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the overconfident, slightly dim-witted middle child of the Goldbergs. Though seemingly untalented in every way (except in ice hockey and wrestling, at which he excels), he remains highly self-assured while trying to become popular in high school. He is determined to dominate everything he does, especially sports; loves rap music (giving himself the pseudonym \"Big Tasty\"); and is the leader of a crew called the Jenkintown Posse (abbreviated \"JTP\", which fellow members repeat whenever the initials are spoken). In the fifth-season finale, he proposes to Lainey and she accepts, but they don't go through with a wedding. By this point, he decided to become a doctor. Barry graduates from high school in the sixth-season finale, and heads to college in season 7 along with his sister Erica. Barry is based on Adam's real-life brother of the same name.\n* [[Hayley Orrantia]] as Erica Dorothy Goldberg,<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/><ref>stated on driver's license, s5 e7</ref> the sarcastic, somewhat bad-tempered oldest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and musically gifted but rebellious, she is popular in school and dominant over her younger brothers. In the fifth season, Erica left for college at D.C. School of the Arts, only to drop out at the end of the season to start a band with Lainey and Valley Erica. After her music aspirations end up going nowhere, Erica decides to head back to college to get her life back on track. \"Erica\" is based on Adam's real-life brother, Eric Goldberg.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Wojciechowski |first=Michelle \"Wojo\" |date=May 17, 2016 |title=The Goldbergs Creator Adam F.

Though an elderly man with a number of comic eccentricities, he acts much younger than his age and often gives sage advice to his grandchildren. Adam considers him his best friend and they often go on side adventures together. He once owned a successful furniture store called Ottoman Empire that allowed him to retire comfortably, and he now lets his son-in-law Murray run the business.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Murray Goldberg,<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the gruff, somewhat asocial patriarch of the Goldbergs. Unlike Beverly, he is realistic about his children's abilities and believes she smothers them too much. Despite his apathetic tendencies at home, he values hard work and has held various full-time positions since his teenage years. Though he does not always show affection for his children, calling them \"morons\" when they make mistakes or behave in silly ways, he truly cares about them and wants them to learn how to fend for themselves. He runs his father-in-law's furniture business, loves sports, and is often seen lounging in front of his TV in his  white [[briefs]].\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as Lainey Lewis (Season 3&ndash;4; recurring 1&ndash;2, 5&ndash;present),<ref>{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - AJ Michalka Not Returning as Series Regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-aj-michalka-not.html|website=SpoilerTV|publisher=SpoilerTV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> Erica's best friend and one of the most popular girls at school, whom Barry has had a lifelong crush on. Lainey is being raised by a single father, Bill, given that her alcoholic mother left them a few years prior to the series. To the surprise of many, Lainey kisses Barry at a party in the first-season finale, the two slowly grow closer together in season two, and eventually become an unlikely couple. Following the fourth season, she has gone to attend fashion school in Savannah, Georgia and ended her relationship with Barry. In season 5, she returns to Jenkintown after dropping out along with Erica to start a band. In the final seconds of the season finale she and Barry agree to wed. In the sixth season, Lainey not only ends the engagement but leaves for L.A. to pursue her dreams alone, but not before promising Barry that when they were ready, they'd be together. Lainey appears as a main character in the spin-off series, ''[[Schooled (TV series)|Schooled]]''.\n* [[Sam Lerner]] as \"Madman\" Geoff Schwartz (Season 5&ndash;present; recurring 2&ndash;4),<ref>{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - Sam Lerner promoted to regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-sam-lerner.html|website=Spoiler TV|publisher=Spoiler TV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> one of Barry's best friends, and a member of the \"JTP\". His nickname \"Madman\" is a form of ironic humor, given how well-behaved the character is, especially compared to Barry. He is infatuated with Erica and makes many futile attempts to win her affections. At the end of the third season, he begins dating Evelyn Silver just as Erica realizes she reciprocates Geoff's feelings. He later breaks up with Evey to be with Erica. As Erica prepares to return to college at the start of season 7, Geoff confides that he wants to stay home for a gap year.  After months of following the [[Grateful Dead]] and starting a failed business venture, however, he decides to enroll in college full time, as well as moving in with Erica.\n\n===Recurring cast===\n====Extended family====\n* [[Judd Hirsch]] as Ben \"Pop Pop\" Goldberg, Murray's cantankerous, opinionated father.

While the family originally got the dog based on Barry's insistence for one, Lucky develops a bond with Murray.\n\n====Friends and classmates====\n* [[Natalie Alyn Lind]] as Dana Caldwell, Adam's classmate who becomes his girlfriend. In the season 2 finale, it is revealed Dana may be moving to Seattle. The season 3 premiere confirms she is now living in Seattle. Adam and Dana continue a long-distance relationship, but it ends when the two realize how different they have become. Dana returns to Jenkintown in season 7 after her grandmother in Seattle passes away, but makes it clear to Adam that she just wants to be friends. \"Dana\"'s real-life name is Amanda Caldwell; it was changed due to early legal concerns about the show's autobiographical nature.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 22, 2014 |title='The Goldbergs' Boss Talks Time Slots, Plans for John Hughes, New Kids Tributes, More |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/goldbergs-boss-talks-time-slots-697442 |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date= |quote=In the beginning, there were a lot of legal concerns about using real people.

Though seemingly untalented in every way (except in ice hockey and wrestling, at which he excels), he remains highly self-assured while trying to become popular in high school. He is determined to dominate everything he does, especially sports; loves rap music (giving himself the pseudonym \"Big Tasty\"); and is the leader of a crew called the Jenkintown Posse (abbreviated \"JTP\", which fellow members repeat whenever the initials are spoken). In the fifth-season finale, he proposes to Lainey and she accepts, but they don't go through with a wedding. By this point, he decided to become a doctor. Barry graduates from high school in the sixth-season finale, and heads to college in season 7 along with his sister Erica. Barry is based on Adam's real-life brother of the same name.\n* [[Hayley Orrantia]] as Erica Dorothy Goldberg,<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/><ref>stated on driver's license, s5 e7</ref> the sarcastic, somewhat bad-tempered oldest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and musically gifted but rebellious, she is popular in school and dominant over her younger brothers. In the fifth season, Erica left for college at D.C. School of the Arts, only to drop out at the end of the season to start a band with Lainey and Valley Erica. After her music aspirations end up going nowhere, Erica decides to head back to college to get her life back on track. \"Erica\" is based on Adam's real-life brother, Eric Goldberg.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Wojciechowski |first=Michelle \"Wojo\" |date=May 17, 2016 |title=The Goldbergs Creator Adam F.

Though an elderly man with a number of comic eccentricities, he acts much younger than his age and often gives sage advice to his grandchildren.

He once owned a successful furniture store called Ottoman Empire that allowed him to retire comfortably, and he now lets his son-in-law Murray run the business.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Murray Goldberg,<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the gruff, somewhat asocial patriarch of the Goldbergs. Unlike Beverly, he is realistic about his children's abilities and believes she smothers them too much. Despite his apathetic tendencies at home, he values hard work and has held various full-time positions since his teenage years. Though he does not always show affection for his children, calling them \"morons\" when they make mistakes or behave in silly ways, he truly cares about them and wants them to learn how to fend for themselves. He runs his father-in-law's furniture business, loves sports, and is often seen lounging in front of his TV in his  white [[briefs]].\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as Lainey Lewis (Season 3&ndash;4; recurring 1&ndash;2, 5&ndash;present),<ref>{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - AJ Michalka Not Returning as Series Regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-aj-michalka-not.html|website=SpoilerTV|publisher=SpoilerTV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> Erica's best friend and one of the most popular girls at school, whom Barry has had a lifelong crush on. Lainey is being raised by a single father, Bill, given that her alcoholic mother left them a few years prior to the series. To the surprise of many, Lainey kisses Barry at a party in the first-season finale, the two slowly grow closer together in season two, and eventually become an unlikely couple. Following the fourth season, she has gone to attend fashion school in Savannah, Georgia and ended her relationship with Barry. In season 5, she returns to Jenkintown after dropping out along with Erica to start a band. In the final seconds of the season finale she and Barry agree to wed. In the sixth season, Lainey not only ends the engagement but leaves for L.A. to pursue her dreams alone, but not before promising Barry that when they were ready, they'd be together. Lainey appears as a main character in the spin-off series, ''[[Schooled (TV series)|Schooled]]''.\n* [[Sam Lerner]] as \"Madman\" Geoff Schwartz (Season 5&ndash;present; recurring 2&ndash;4),<ref>{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - Sam Lerner promoted to regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-sam-lerner.html|website=Spoiler TV|publisher=Spoiler TV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> one of Barry's best friends, and a member of the \"JTP\". His nickname \"Madman\" is a form of ironic humor, given how well-behaved the character is, especially compared to Barry. He is infatuated with Erica and makes many futile attempts to win her affections. At the end of the third season, he begins dating Evelyn Silver just as Erica realizes she reciprocates Geoff's feelings. He later breaks up with Evey to be with Erica. As Erica prepares to return to college at the start of season 7, Geoff confides that he wants to stay home for a gap year.

In the season 2 finale, it is revealed Dana may be moving to Seattle. The season 3 premiere confirms she is now living in Seattle. Adam and Dana continue a long-distance relationship, but it ends when the two realize how different they have become. Dana returns to Jenkintown in season 7 after her grandmother in Seattle passes away, but makes it clear to Adam that she just wants to be friends. \"Dana\"'s real-life name is Amanda Caldwell; it was changed due to early legal concerns about the show's autobiographical nature.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 22, 2014 |title='The Goldbergs' Boss Talks Time Slots, Plans for John Hughes, New Kids Tributes, More |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/goldbergs-boss-talks-time-slots-697442 |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date= |quote=In the beginning, there were a lot of legal concerns about using real people.
