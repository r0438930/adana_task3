Stage set by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] (1781\u20131841) for an 1815 production]]\n\"'''O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn'''\" (\"Oh, don't tremble, my dear son\") is the first [[aria]] performed by the Queen of the Night (a famous [[coloratura soprano]] role) in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] [[singspiel]] ''[[The Magic Flute]] (Die Zauberfl\u00f6te)''. It is not as well known as the Queen's second aria, \"[[Queen of the Night aria|Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen]]\", though no less demanding; the aria requires a soprano coloratura with extremely high [[tessitura]] and great vocal flexibility.\n\n==Significance==\n\nThe role of Queen of the Night demands a range that until Mozart's time was almost never called for, and this opened the door for later composers to call for specific kind of singers ([[Lyric soprano|lyric]], [[Dramatic soprano|dramatic]], [[Coloratura soprano|coloratura]] etc.), rather than just \"soprano\", \"tenor\" etc.<ref name=Coffin>{{cite book\n|title= Coloratura, Lyric and Dramatic Soprano, Vol. 1\n|last= Coffin\n|first= Berton\n|year= 1960\n|publisher= Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.\n|isbn= 978-0-8108-0188-2\n|url-access= registration\n|url= https://archive.org/details/singersrepertoir0000coff\n}}</ref>\n\nThe part, in whole, includes two arias, ''O zittre nicht'' and ''Der H\u00f6lle Rache''. The first calls for a rather lyric and flexible voice while the second requires a dramatic and powerful voice. Originally, the part was written for [[Josepha Weber|Josepha Hofer]], the composer's sister-in-law, whose voice possessed both of these qualities. Most modern performers are specialists in either lyric or dramatic style. This, along with the difficulty of the two arias, makes the role of the Queen of the Night one of the most demanding in operatic repertoire.\n\n==Context in the opera==\n\nIn the preceding scene, Prince Tamino was shown a portrait of the Queen's daughter Pamina and fell instantly in love with her, singing of his feelings in the aria \"[[Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd sch\u00f6n]]\". The Queen then makes a dramatic entrance, preceded by the Three Ladies calling to Tamino \"Sie kommt! Sie kommt!\" (\"[Here] she comes!\"). The grand entrance music for the Queen is in [[B-flat major|B-flat]], marked ''Allegro maestoso'', with the following stage direction:\n\n:''The mountains [in the scenery] are parted, and the stage is transformed into a magnificent chamber. The Queen is seated on a throne adorned with shining stars.''<ref>Dover edition (1985, 41).  Original German:  \"Die Berge teilen sich auseinander, und das Theater verwandelt sich in ein pr\u00e4chtiges Gemach. DIE K\u00d6NIGIN sitzt auf einem Thron, welcher mit transparenten Sternen geziert ist.\"  (Source:  NMA edition, linked below)</ref>\n\nNot all modern productions adhere to this prescription.\n\nIn the aria, the Queen first quiets Tamino's fears and attempts to befriend him, then tells the sad, although misleading, tale of Pamina's abduction by Sarastro, and finally makes a stirring plea to Tamino to rescue her daughter. As the aria ends, the Queen and the Three Ladies leave the stage, leaving the astonished Tamino to ponder his task and gather his resolve. A performance takes about five minutes.\n\n==Libretto==\nThe verse to which the aria was set was written by the opera's [[libretto|librettist]] [[Emanuel Schikaneder]]. Schikaneder was the [[impresario]] for whom the opera was written as well as the first performer of the role of Papageno.\n\n<poem lang=\"de\" style=\"float:left;\">\nO zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn,\ndu bist unschuldig, weise, fromm\nEin J\u00fcngling so wie du, vermag am besten,\ndies tiefbetr\u00fcbte Mutterherz zu tr\u00f6sten.\n\nZum Leiden bin ich auserkoren,\ndenn meine Tochter fehlet mir.\nDurch sie ging all mein Gl\u00fcck verloren,\nein B\u00f6sewicht, ein B\u00f6sewicht entfloh mit ihr.\nNoch seh' ich ihr Zittern\nmit bangem Ersch\u00fcttern,\nihr \u00e4ngstliches Beben,\nihr sch\u00fcchternes Streben.\nIch mu\u00dfte sie mir rauben sehen.\n\"Ach helft!
