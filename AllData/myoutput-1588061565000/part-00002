The largest of the Zaza diaspora - about half a million people - is located in Europe, mainly in Germany.\n\n== Ethnogenesis ==\nWhile almost all linguists agree that the Zaza language is not a Kurdish dialect but rather an independent language just like [[Gorani language|Gorani]], they also agree on the fact that Zazas and Kurds are ethnically and culturally linked. This ethnic and culturally linkage though is more of an overshadowing of Kurdish identity upon the Zaza.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> For centuries, the Zaza have been surrounded by the Kurds, a people with a homogeneous language and close culture. Therefore, outside of the region, the Zaza have always been considered to be a part of the Kurds, or a \"Kurdish tribe\".<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/>\n\nThis suppression of Zaza autonomy has only been increased in the past century as a result of Kurdish political strivings from multiple resistance movements against the government. These political Turko-Kurdish conflicts put significant twin pressure on the Zaza identity. Intense political agitation around them encourages the Zazas to be part of the \"imagined community\" of Kurds, the biggest 'ethnic grouping' to be without nationhood, while simultaneously admitting that its participants are the very mixed product \u2014 an homogenisation or cultural mosaic of \"tribes\" over millennia.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\">{{Cite journal|last=Trompf|first=Garry W.|date=2013|title=Ethno-Religious Minorities in the Near East: Some Macrohistorical Reflections with Special Reference to the Zazas|journal=Iran & the Caucasus|volume=17|issue=3|pages=321\u2013344|jstor=23597500|doi=10.1163/1573384X-20130306}}</ref> Also, Kurdish nationalists play on the point that a large component of so-called Zazas do not want to be called by that name at all, but prefer self-inscribing as [[Kirmanji]], a designation sounding one step away from being [[Kurmanji Kurds|Kurmanji]] speaking Kurds.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, in the Zaza language the term Kirmanji is regarded as a synonym for [[Alevism|Alevi]], which is the main religious group of Zazas living in Dersim separate from Northern Kurds. Among the Armenians, the Zazas are also known as Zaza-Kider, i.e. Zaza-Kurds - the fact, which by no means shows the identification of the Zazas with the Kurds, but rather distinguishes them as a specific group from a common Kurdish background.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> A scientific report from 2005 concluded that Zazas share the same genetical pattern as other 'Kurdish groups'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nasidze|first=Ivan|last2=Quinque|first2=Dominique|last3=Ozturk|first3=Murat|last4=Bendukidze|first4=Nina|last5=Stoneking|first5=Mark|date=2005-03-19|title=MtDNA and Y-chromosome Variation in Kurdish Groups|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|volume=69|issue=4|pages=401\u2013412|doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2005.00174.x|pmid=15996169|issn=0003-4800}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Kurds are not the only group to claim linkage to the Zazas. It is debated that the Zaza may possess roots going back to the [[Hittites]] or derive from a migration from the linguistically-related south Caspian.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/> Similar cultural expressions, and folkloric traditions of the \"Old Women\" in connection with the dead would further suggest a possible deeper connection between the Zazas and Hittites.

Opposed to Alevi-Zazas who live in the North self-describing as Kirmanji, those who live south of Dersim refer to themselves as Dimil\u00ee.<ref name=\"PanARMENIAN.Net\"/> The word Daylam describes a region of [[Gilan Province]] in today's [[Iran]]. Some linguists connect the word Dimil\u00ee with the Daylamites (Gilaks)  in the [[Alborz Mountains]] near the shores of the Caspian Sea in Iran and believe that the Zaza have migrated from Daylam towards the west. The Armenians call this people Ddmik, the term which goes Middle Iranian delmik i.e. daylamit, the dweller of the Daylam.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> Today, [[Iranian languages]] are still spoken in southern regions of the Caspian Sea (also called the Caspian languages), including [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]], [[Sangsari language|Sangsari]], [[Mazanderani language|Mazanderani]], [[Tati language (Iran)|Tati]], [[Semnani languages|Semnani]], and [[Talysh language|Talysh]], and they are grammatically and lexically very close to Zaza; this supports the argument that Zazas emigrated from the southern regions of the Caspian Sea reaching eastern Anatolia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sims-Williams|first1=ed. by Nicholas|title=Old and middle Iranian studies|date=1998|publisher=Reichert|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783895000706|pages=163\u2013177|url=http://zazaki.de/english/articels/Paul-1998-Zaza.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\nThese claims have already been disproven by genetical studies on Zazaki-speakers.

The lack of documentation, and the decline in the number of native Zaza speakers can largely be attributed to the Turkish laws put in place in the mid-1920s, after the creation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. These laws banned the Kurdish language, of which Zaza was often erroneously considered a dialect, from being spoken in public, being written down, and being published. One specific law, the [[Language Ban Act of 1985]], explicitly stated that only Turkish could be spoken in public, not only greatly discouraged the use of Zaza, but it also endangered the cultural identity of the Zaza.<ref name=\"elliance\"/> The consequences of this process of [[turkification]] were so detrimental that under the Alawi-Zaza population the youngest generations hardly speak the language or teaches it to its children.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\">{{Cite web|url=http://zazaki.de/english/index.htm|title=Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza|website=zazaki.de|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> Only until very recently has Zaza been allowed back in the public sphere of Turkey. But the effects of these past policies are still very present as there has been a lack of literature and substantial development in the language.\n\nDuring the 1980s following the passage of these persecutory laws, the Zaza diaspora resulted in a small renaissance following meager efforts by Zazas in Europe.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\"/> This was followed by the publication of magazines and books in Turkey, particularly in Istanbul. The efforts of Zaza intellectuals to advance the comprehensibility of their native language by alphabetizing were not fruitless: the number of publications in Zaza increased by the multiple. The rediscovery of the native culture by Zaza intellectuals not only caused a revival of Zaza language and culture, it also triggered feelings among younger generations of Zazas (who unfortunately, rarely spoke Zaza as a mothertongue at the time) in favor of modern western in the Zaza language, and thus their interest in the most important inheritance of their ancestors.<ref name=\"elliance\"/>\n\n== Connection to Kurds ==\n[[File:Kurdes Zaza de Diarbekir (Kurdistan).jpg|250px|thumb|right|\"Zaza Kurds in [[Diyarbakir]] (Kurdistan)\", E.Chantre & C.Barry, 1881]]\nKurds and Zazas have for centuries lived in the same areas in Anatolia. In the 1920s and 1930s, Zazas played a key role in the rise of Kurdish nationalism with their rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later the [[Republic of Turkey]].

The largest of the Zaza diaspora - about half a million people - is located in Europe, mainly in Germany.\n\n== Ethnogenesis ==\nWhile almost all linguists agree that the Zaza language is not a Kurdish dialect but rather an independent language just like [[Gorani language|Gorani]], they also agree on the fact that Zazas and Kurds are ethnically and culturally linked. This ethnic and culturally linkage though is more of an overshadowing of Kurdish identity upon the Zaza.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> For centuries, the Zaza have been surrounded by the Kurds, a people with a homogeneous language and close culture. Therefore, outside of the region, the Zaza have always been considered to be a part of the Kurds, or a \"Kurdish tribe\".<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/>\n\nThis suppression of Zaza autonomy has only been increased in the past century as a result of Kurdish political strivings from multiple resistance movements against the government. These political Turko-Kurdish conflicts put significant twin pressure on the Zaza identity. Intense political agitation around them encourages the Zazas to be part of the \"imagined community\" of Kurds, the biggest 'ethnic grouping' to be without nationhood, while simultaneously admitting that its participants are the very mixed product \u2014 an homogenisation or cultural mosaic of \"tribes\" over millennia.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\">{{Cite journal|last=Trompf|first=Garry W.|date=2013|title=Ethno-Religious Minorities in the Near East: Some Macrohistorical Reflections with Special Reference to the Zazas|journal=Iran & the Caucasus|volume=17|issue=3|pages=321\u2013344|jstor=23597500|doi=10.1163/1573384X-20130306}}</ref> Also, Kurdish nationalists play on the point that a large component of so-called Zazas do not want to be called by that name at all, but prefer self-inscribing as [[Kirmanji]], a designation sounding one step away from being [[Kurmanji Kurds|Kurmanji]] speaking Kurds.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, in the Zaza language the term Kirmanji is regarded as a synonym for [[Alevism|Alevi]], which is the main religious group of Zazas living in Dersim separate from Northern Kurds. Among the Armenians, the Zazas are also known as Zaza-Kider, i.e. Zaza-Kurds - the fact, which by no means shows the identification of the Zazas with the Kurds, but rather distinguishes them as a specific group from a common Kurdish background.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> A scientific report from 2005 concluded that Zazas share the same genetical pattern as other 'Kurdish groups'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nasidze|first=Ivan|last2=Quinque|first2=Dominique|last3=Ozturk|first3=Murat|last4=Bendukidze|first4=Nina|last5=Stoneking|first5=Mark|date=2005-03-19|title=MtDNA and Y-chromosome Variation in Kurdish Groups|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|volume=69|issue=4|pages=401\u2013412|doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2005.00174.x|pmid=15996169|issn=0003-4800}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Kurds are not the only group to claim linkage to the Zazas. It is debated that the Zaza may possess roots going back to the [[Hittites]] or derive from a migration from the linguistically-related south Caspian.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/> Similar cultural expressions, and folkloric traditions of the \"Old Women\" in connection with the dead would further suggest a possible deeper connection between the Zazas and Hittites.

Opposed to Alevi-Zazas who live in the North self-describing as Kirmanji, those who live south of Dersim refer to themselves as Dimil\u00ee.<ref name=\"PanARMENIAN.Net\"/> The word Daylam describes a region of [[Gilan Province]] in today's [[Iran]]. Some linguists connect the word Dimil\u00ee with the Daylamites (Gilaks)  in the [[Alborz Mountains]] near the shores of the Caspian Sea in Iran and believe that the Zaza have migrated from Daylam towards the west. The Armenians call this people Ddmik, the term which goes Middle Iranian delmik i.e. daylamit, the dweller of the Daylam.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> Today, [[Iranian languages]] are still spoken in southern regions of the Caspian Sea (also called the Caspian languages), including [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]], [[Sangsari language|Sangsari]], [[Mazanderani language|Mazanderani]], [[Tati language (Iran)|Tati]], [[Semnani languages|Semnani]], and [[Talysh language|Talysh]], and they are grammatically and lexically very close to Zaza; this supports the argument that Zazas emigrated from the southern regions of the Caspian Sea reaching eastern Anatolia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sims-Williams|first1=ed. by Nicholas|title=Old and middle Iranian studies|date=1998|publisher=Reichert|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783895000706|pages=163\u2013177|url=http://zazaki.de/english/articels/Paul-1998-Zaza.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\nThese claims have already been disproven by genetical studies on Zazaki-speakers.

The lack of documentation, and the decline in the number of native Zaza speakers can largely be attributed to the Turkish laws put in place in the mid-1920s, after the creation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. These laws banned the Kurdish language, of which Zaza was often erroneously considered a dialect, from being spoken in public, being written down, and being published. One specific law, the [[Language Ban Act of 1985]], explicitly stated that only Turkish could be spoken in public, not only greatly discouraged the use of Zaza, but it also endangered the cultural identity of the Zaza.<ref name=\"elliance\"/> The consequences of this process of [[turkification]] were so detrimental that under the Alawi-Zaza population the youngest generations hardly speak the language or teaches it to its children.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\">{{Cite web|url=http://zazaki.de/english/index.htm|title=Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza|website=zazaki.de|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> Only until very recently has Zaza been allowed back in the public sphere of Turkey. But the effects of these past policies are still very present as there has been a lack of literature and substantial development in the language.\n\nDuring the 1980s following the passage of these persecutory laws, the Zaza diaspora resulted in a small renaissance following meager efforts by Zazas in Europe.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\"/> This was followed by the publication of magazines and books in Turkey, particularly in Istanbul. The efforts of Zaza intellectuals to advance the comprehensibility of their native language by alphabetizing were not fruitless: the number of publications in Zaza increased by the multiple. The rediscovery of the native culture by Zaza intellectuals not only caused a revival of Zaza language and culture, it also triggered feelings among younger generations of Zazas (who unfortunately, rarely spoke Zaza as a mothertongue at the time) in favor of modern western in the Zaza language, and thus their interest in the most important inheritance of their ancestors.<ref name=\"elliance\"/>\n\n== Connection to Kurds ==\n[[File:Kurdes Zaza de Diarbekir (Kurdistan).jpg|250px|thumb|right|\"Zaza Kurds in [[Diyarbakir]] (Kurdistan)\", E.Chantre & C.Barry, 1881]]\nKurds and Zazas have for centuries lived in the same areas in Anatolia. In the 1920s and 1930s, Zazas played a key role in the rise of Kurdish nationalism with their rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later the [[Republic of Turkey]].

The Alevi Zaza did not support the 1925 rebellion led by the Sunni Zaza widely supported by other Kurdish groups. Sunni Zaza elders claim the rebellion was suppressed by the government using Alevi Zaza help. In 1937, the Alevi Zaza rose up against the government, in the event known as the \"[[Dersim rebellion]]\", which was suppressed by the government using Sunni Zaza help.

They indicate of protecting Zaza culture, language and heritage rather than seeking any kind of [[autonomy]] within [[Turkey]].<ref>Zulf\u00fc Selcan, Grammatik der Zaza-Sprache, Nord-Dialekt (Dersim-Dialekt), Wissenschaft & Technik Verlag, Berlin, 1998, p. 23.</ref> During this time period, following in the footsteps of the revival of Alevi cultural expression, the Zazas were able to find their own national self-consciousness in the freer European political climate. [[Ebubekir Pamukchu]], the founder of the Zaza national movement expressed this idea in the following sentence: \"From that moment I became Zaza.\"<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> E. Pamukchu was born in Dersim in 1946. Being graduated from a higher college he taught the Turkish language in many parts of the country. At the age of 20 he joined the leftists and was several times imprisoned for his political activities and seditious poems. In 1989 E. Pamukchu emigrated to Sweden where he continued his work until he died in 1991. Ebubekir Pamukchu was the founder of the first periodicals in the Zaza language - \"Ayre\" and \"Piya\".<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/>\n\nSome Kurds and international foundations suggest a link between the founder of Zaza nationalism, [[Ebubekir Pamuk\u00e7u]] (d. 1993), and the Turkish intelligence services.<ref name=\"Arakelova\" /> The Zaza nationalistic movement was welcomed and financially supported by certain circles in Turkey's intelligence establishment and Pamukcu has since been accused of having ties to Turkish intelligence. These are not the only claims by Kurds, and others of attempts by the Turkish government to use Zaza nationalism to attack the strength of Kurdish resistance. The Zazas have the attractions of modern Turkey, and the socio-economic (especially educational) benefits it offers other neighboring minorities who eschew involvement in Kurdish separatism (such as the Lazi[c]s to the far north, or Arabic and Syriac-speaking enclaves in and around Mardin).<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nIn an interview with Kurdmedia, Kurdish-Zaza linguist [[Mehemed Malm\u00eesanij]] said the name of this \u201cZazaistan\u201d publisher was the \u201cZaza Culture and Publication House\u201d and was part of the Turkish intelligence services with the task of attacking the Kurdish nationalist movement. \u201cThe conclusion that I draw\u2026 is that these [Zaza nationalist groups] were groups based in the state, or with a more favorable expression, groups that thought in parallel with the state\u201d.{{r|wilgenburg}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Sedat Bucak]]\n*[[Kurdistan]]\n*[[Daylamites]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|25em|refs=\n<ref name=Lezgin>{{cite web |last=Lezg\u00een |first=Ro\u015fan |title=Among Social Kurdish Groups \u2013 General Glance at Zazas |website=Zazaki.net |url=http://www.zazaki.net/haber/among-social-kurdish-groups-general-glance-at-zazas-503.htm }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Malm\u00eesanij\">{{Cite book |author=Malmisanij |year=1996 |title=Kird, Kirmanc, Dimili or Zaza Kurds |location=Istanbul |publisher=Deng Publishing |url=https://archive.org/details/Kird-Kirmanc-Dimili-Zaza-Kurtleri }}</ref>\n<ref name=Kehl-Bo99>{{cite journal |last=Kehl-Bodrogi |first=Krisztina |date=October 1999 |title=Kurds, Turks, or a People in their own Right?
