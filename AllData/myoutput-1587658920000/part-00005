The video was shot on the Mojave River Bridge in [[Victorville, CA]] and shows the band performing the song on location, below and in front of a bridge. A girl wanders onto the bridge and eventually tosses her [[Game Boy Advance]] at them. Gradually, more and more people arrive at the bridge and start throwing other inanimate objects (including appliances, instruments, and furniture) behind and around the oblivious band members. The items never hit any of them, though they come close. The actions of the participants would suggest that their motivations and intentions are to cast off the material trappings of society which prohibit them from living freely.\n\nTwo cars are then simultaneously dropped off the bridge and behind the band, resulting in clouds of smoke and fire. This is followed by an entire house (only with walls and roof) being dropped onto the band by a crane, and the walls falling onto the ground without anyone getting hurt.

The Foo Fighters later managed to perform the song at Glastonbury in 2017, opening their set and dedicating it to Florence Welch.\n\n==In media==\nThe acoustic version of this song was used in episode 20 of season 4 (\u201cThe Birth and Death of the Day\u201d) of ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' during the graduation scene, which is also when Haley's water breaks.\n\nThis is also used as the theme song for a video montage showing memorable past goals at [[Turf Moor]] for all of [[Burnley FC]]'s home games from 2009 to the present.\n\nIt was used by [[George W. Bush]] for his 2004 re-election campaign without the band's knowledge. \"That was weird,\" Grohl remarked. \"And to me it just seemed like a pretty good example of how completely out of touch he was. You read those lyrics: they're about hope and love and compassion. And look at his [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration]]: [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war]] and fear and death. It was laughable. You couldn't have picked a worse song. That's why I jumped on the [[John Kerry]] campaign.

It was laughable. You couldn't have picked a worse song. That's why I jumped on the [[John Kerry]] campaign.
