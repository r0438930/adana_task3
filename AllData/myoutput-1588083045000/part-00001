The architectural firm, Silliman & Farnsworth, filed for the construction of the eight-story building, including a raised basement and an attic. Construction began in June 1878 and was completed in March 1880. Upon its completion, the owners claimed that the Morse Building was \u201cthe tallest straight wall building in the world.\" Interior amenities included 175 offices, two hydraulic [[Otis elevators]], steam heat, gas lighting, and fireplaces.<ref name=\"NYCLPC\"/>\n\nThe base of the Morse Building was damaged in a January 1882 fire that destroyed the [[Potter Building#Context|old ''New York World'' Building]]. From 1896 to 1900, the Morse Building contained the office and rooftop studio of one of the earliest American motion picture companies, which became the [[Vitagraph Company of America]] founded by [[J. Stuart Blackton]] and [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Abert E. Smith]].<ref name=\"NYCLPC\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe Morse Building's design was marked three periods of construction: the original (1878\u201380), as well as alterations in 1901-02 and c. 1965. Today, the structure\u2019s 6-story midsection, with two articulated facades featuring round- and segmental-arched fenestration, is, in part, the earliest surviving tall \u201cfireproof\u201d New York office building of the period prior to the full development of the\nskyscraper.<ref name=\"NYCLPC\"/>\n\nThe building was designed in with [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Gothic]], [[Neo-Grec]], and [[Rundbogenstil]] influences. It is an early example of the use of brick and [[terra cotta]] for the exterior cladding of office buildings constructed during that time period. The intricate [[polychrome brickwork]] was supplied by the Peerless Brick Company of [[Philadelphia]]. It features hues of deep red and glazed black, the latter employed ornamentally, largely to emphasize the outlines of the [[fenestration (architecture)|fenestration]]. The terra cotta was manufactured by the Boston Terra Cotta Co., one of\nthe first East Coast firms.<ref name=\"NYCLPC\"/>\n\nThe building was significantly altered in 1901-02 to an [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] [[Neo-Classical architecture|Neo-Classical]] style, designed by of architects Bannister & Schell. The renovations included remodeling the base; reconstructing the upper two stories, capped by a projecting balcony/cornice supported by large [[Bracket (architecture)|scroll brackets]]; and adding four steel-framed stories clad in cream-colored brick, bringing it to 14 stories. The building's base was altered again around 1965, removing the 10th-story balcony/cornice. The building was converted from commercial to residential use in 1980. One-over-one double-hung wood-framed windows (with [[Transom (architectural)|transoms]] in the round arches) were replaced in 1986 with [[anodized aluminum]] windows (except for the 8th story, which are mostly wood).<ref name=\"NYCLPC\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscat-inline|Morse Building (Manhattan)}}\n*[https://www.emporis.com/buildings/114743/morse-building-new-york-city-ny-usa Morse Building - Emporis]\n\n{{Civic Center, Manhattan}}\n{{Financial District, Manhattan}}\n\n[[Category:New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:1880 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Edwardian architecture]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival architecture in New York City]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in New York City]]\n[[Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in New York City]]\n[[Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Financial District, Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1880]]\n[[Category:Residential buildings completed in 1880]]\n[[Category:Civic Center, Manhattan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{Short description|Office skyscraper in Manhattan, New York}}\n{{Infobox building\n|name               = Morse Building\n|image              = File:Morse Bldg jeh.JPG\n|caption            = \n|location           = 140 [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] at Beekman Street, [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]\n|coordinates        = {{coord|40.711259|-74.006165|type:landmark_region:US-NY|display=inline,title}}\n|status             = \n|start_date         = 1878\n|completion_date    = 1880\n|opening            = \n|building_type      = Commercial\n|antenna_spire      = \n|roof               = {{convert|180|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|top_floor          = \n|floor_count        = 14\n|elevator_count     = \n|cost               = \n|floor_area         =\n|architect          = Silliman and Farnsworth\n|structural_engineer= \n|main_contractor    =\n|owner              = \n|management         = \n|references         = \n{{Designation list\n| embed = yes\n| designation1 = NYC\n| designation1_date = September 19, 2006\n| designation1_number = 2191\n}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Morse Building''', also known as the '''Nassau\u2013Beekman Building''', is a high-rise building located in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].
