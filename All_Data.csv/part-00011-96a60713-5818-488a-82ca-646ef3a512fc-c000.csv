The '''observable universe''' is a [[spherical]] region of the [[universe]] comprising all [[matter]] that can be [[observation|observed]] from [[Earth]] or its space-based telescopes and exploratory probes at the present time, because [[electromagnetic radiation]] from these [[astronomical object|objects]] has had time to reach the [[Solar System]] and Earth since the beginning of the [[metric expansion of space|cosmological expansion]]. There are at least 2 trillion [[galaxy|galaxies]] in the observable universe.<ref name=\"Conselice\">{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Galaxy Number Density at ''z'' < 8 and Its Implications |first=Christopher J. |last=Conselice|display-authors=etal|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=830 |issue=2 |year=2016 |arxiv=1607.03909v2 |bibcode= 2016ApJ...830...83C |doi=10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/83 |page=83}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20161017\">{{cite news |last=Fountain |first=Henry |title=Two Trillion Galaxies, at the Very Least |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/science/two-trillion-galaxies-at-the-very-least.html |date=17 October 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}</ref> Assuming the universe is [[isotropy|isotropic]], the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly [[equidistant|the same]] in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a [[sphere|spherical]] volume (a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) centered on the observer. Every location in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.

The word ''observable'' in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect [[light]] or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the [[speed of light]] itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light could travel in the [[age of the universe]] (estimated {{as of|2015|lc=y}} around {{val|13.799|0.021|ul=billion}} years<ref name=\"Planck 2015\"/>) simply cannot be detected, as the signals could not have reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the ''visible'' universe, which includes only signals emitted since [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] (when hydrogen atoms were formed from protons and electrons and photons were emitted)—and the ''observable'' universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the [[Big Bang cosmology|Big Bang]] in traditional [[physical cosmology]], the end of the [[inflationary epoch]] in modern cosmology).

According to calculations, the current ''[[comoving distance]]''—proper distance, which takes into account that the universe has expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) was emitted, which represents the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion [[parsec]]s (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),<ref name=\"mapofuniverse\">{{cite journal|last = Gott III|first = J.

As the universe's expansion is accelerating, all currently observable objects will eventually appear to freeze in time, while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For instance, objects with the current redshift ''z'' from 5 to 10 will remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs) will never reach Earth.<ref name=Loeb2002>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.047301|title=Long-term future of extragalactic astronomy|journal=Physical Review D|volume=65|issue=4|pages=047301|year=2002|last1=Loeb|first1=Abraham|arxiv=astro-ph/0107568|bibcode=2002PhRvD..65d7301L}}</ref>

== The universe versus the observable universe ==
{{Physical cosmology|comp/struct}}
Some parts of the universe are too far away for the light emitted since the [[Big Bang]] to have had enough time to reach Earth or its scientific space-based instruments, and so lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to [[Hubble's law]], regions sufficiently distant from the Earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light ([[special relativity]] prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see [[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion) and furthermore the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion rate appears to be accelerating]] due to [[dark energy]]. 

Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging [[cosmological constant]]), so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a \"future visibility limit\" beyond which objects will never enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually.<ref name=ly93 /><ref>[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575 Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?] (see the last two paragraphs)</ref>) This future visibility limit is calculated at a [[comoving distance]] of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light-years), assuming the universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36.<ref name=\"mapofuniverse2\">The comoving distance of the future visibility limit is calculated on p. 8 of Gott et al.'s [http://www.astro.princeton.edu/universe/ms.pdf A Map of the Universe] to be 4.50 times the [[Hubble radius]], given as 4.220 billion parsecs (13.76 billion light-years), whereas the current comoving radius of the observable universe is calculated on p. 7 to be 3.38 times the Hubble radius. The number of galaxies in a sphere of a given comoving radius is proportional to the cube of the radius, so as shown on p. 8 the ratio between the number of galaxies observable in the future visibility limit to the number of galaxies observable today would be (4.50/3.38)<sup>3</sup> = 2.36.</ref>

Though in principle more galaxies will become observable in the future, in practice an increasing number of galaxies will become extremely [[redshift]]ed due to ongoing expansion, so much so that they will seem to disappear from view and become invisible.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Krauss|first = Lawrence M.|author2=Robert J.

For example, the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening at present can eventually reach the Earth in the future if the event is less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal will never reach the Earth if the event is more than 16 billion light-years away.<ref name=ly93 />

Both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term \"universe\" to mean \"observable universe\".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the universe that is [[Causality (physics)|causally disconnected]] from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the universe has any physical boundary in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. 

It is plausible that the [[galaxy|galaxies]] within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the universe. According to the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] initially introduced by its founder, [[Alan Guth]] (and by D. Kazanas<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/183361|title=Dynamics of the universe and spontaneous symmetry breaking|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=241|pages=L59–L63|year=1980|last1=Kazanas|first1=D.|bibcode=1980ApJ...241L..59K}}</ref>), if it is assumed that inflation began about 10<sup>−37</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3{{e|23}} times the radius of the observable universe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan H.

If the universe is finite but unbounded, it is also possible that the universe is smaller than the observable universe. In this case, what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies, formed by light that has circumnavigated the universe. It is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history, and consequently might appear quite different.

=== Misconceptions about its size === <!-- This section is linked from [[Universe]] -->

[[File:Incorrect plaque at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, April 2011.jpg|thumb|An example of the misconception that the radius of the observable universe is 13 billion light-years. This plaque appears at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City.]]

Many secondary sources have reported a wide variety of incorrect figures for the size of the visible universe. Some of these figures are listed below, with brief descriptions of possible reasons for misconceptions about them.

;13.8 billion light-years
:The [[age of the universe]] is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static [[Minkowski space]]time conception under special relativity were correct.

[[Redshift survey|Sky surveys]] and mappings of the various [[wavelength]] bands of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (in particular [[Hydrogen line|21-cm emission]]) have yielded much information on the content and character of the [[universe]]'s structure. The organization of structure appears to follow as a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] model with organization up to the [[scale (spatial)|scale]] of [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filament]]s. Larger than this (at scales between 30 and 200 megaparsecs<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|page=1178|language=en}}</ref>), there seems to be no continued structure, a phenomenon that has been referred to as the ''End of Greatness''.<ref name=Kirshner />

=== Walls, filaments, nodes, and voids ===

[[File:2dfdtfe.gif|thumb|300px|left|[[Dtfe|DTFE reconstruction]] of the inner parts of the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]]]]
The organization of structure arguably begins at the stellar level, though most cosmologists rarely address [[astrophysics]] on that scale.  [[Star]]s are organized into [[galaxy|galaxies]], which in turn form [[galaxy group]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s, [[supercluster]]s, sheets, [[galaxy filament|walls and filaments]], which are separated by immense [[void (astronomy)|voids]], creating a vast foam-like structure<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|pages=1173–1174|language=en}}</ref> sometimes called the \"cosmic web\". Prior to 1989, it was commonly assumed that [[virial theorem|virialized]] galaxy clusters were the largest structures in existence, and that they were distributed more or less uniformly throughout the universe in every direction. However, since the early 1980s, more and more structures have been discovered. In 1983, Adrian Webster identified the Webster LQG, a [[large quasar group]] consisting of 5 quasars. The discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure, and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the universe. 

In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light-years across. That same year, an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered, the [[Giant Void]], which measures 1.3 billion light-years across. Based on [[redshift survey]] data, in 1989 [[Margaret Geller]] and [[John Huchra]] discovered the \"[[CfA2 Great Wall|Great Wall]]\",<ref name=\"redshift\">{{cite journal |author= M. J.

The existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions, which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from [[redshift]]s.
Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano discovered the [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], a [[large quasar group]] measuring two billion light-years at its widest point which was the largest known structure in the universe at the time of its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the [[Sloan Great Wall]]. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12546-biggest-void-in-space-is-1-billion-light-years-across.html Biggest void in space is 1 billion light years across – space – 24 August 2007 – New Scientist]. Space.newscientist.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.</ref> It coincides with the '[[CMB cold spot]]', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.

Another large-scale structure is the [[SSA22 Protocluster]], a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light-years across.

In 2011, a large quasar group was discovered, [[U1.11]], measuring about 2.5 billion light-years across.

===End of Greatness===
The ''End of Greatness'' is an observational scale discovered at roughly 100&nbsp;[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] (roughly 300 million light-years) where the lumpiness seen in the large-scale structure of the [[universe]] is [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogenized]] and [[isotropic|isotropized]] in accordance with the [[Cosmological Principle]].<ref name=Kirshner /> At this scale, no pseudo-random [[fractal]]ness is apparent.<ref>LiveScience.com, [https://news.yahoo.com/universe-isnt-fractal-study-finds-215053937.html \"The Universe Isn't a Fractal, Study Finds\"], Natalie Wolchover,22 August 2012</ref>
The [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] seen in smaller surveys are [[random]]ized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent. It was not until the [[redshift survey]]s of the 1990s were completed that this scale could accurately be observed.<ref name=Kirshner>{{cite book |title=The Extravagant Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Cosmos |author=Robert P Kirshner |url=https://archive.org/details/extravagantunive00kirs |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/extravagantunive00kirs/page/71 71] |isbn=978-0-691-05862-7 |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>

===Observations===
[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|right|399px|thumb|\"Panoramic view of the entire near-infrared sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. The image is derived from the [[2MASS|2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC)]]—more than 1.5 million galaxies, and the Point Source Catalog (PSC)—nearly 0.5 billion Milky Way stars. The galaxies are color-coded by '[[redshift]]' obtained from the [[Uppsala General Catalogue|UGC]], [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|CfA]], Tully NBGC, LCRS, [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dF]], 6dFGS, and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] surveys (and from various observations compiled by the [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database|NASA Extragalactic Database]]), or photo-metrically deduced from the [[K band (infrared)|K band]] (2.2 μm). Blue are the nearest sources (''z'' < 0.01); green are at moderate distances (0.01 < ''z'' < 0.04) and red are the most distant sources that 2MASS resolves (0.04 < ''z'' < 0.1). The map is projected with an equal area Aitoff in the Galactic system (Milky Way at center).\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Large Scale Structure in the Local Universe: The 2MASS Galaxy Catalog |last=1Jarrett |first1=T.

Another indicator of large-scale structure is the '[[Lyman-alpha forest]]'. This is a collection of [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] that appear in the spectra of light from [[quasar]]s, which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic (mostly [[hydrogen]]) gas. These sheets appear to be associated with the formation of new galaxies.

Caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear. [[Gravitational lens]]ing (bending of light by gravitation) can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source. This is caused when foreground objects (such as galaxies) curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by [[general relativity]]), and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. [[Weak Gravitational Lensing|Weak lensing]] (gravitational shear) by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure.

The large-scale structure of the universe also looks different if one only uses [[redshift]] to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be if there were no cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks somewhat squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a \"''[[Redshift-space distortions|finger of God]]''\"—the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.

===Cosmography of Earth's cosmic neighborhood===
At the centre of the [[Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster]], a gravitational anomaly called the [[Great Attractor]] affects the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light-years across. These galaxies are all [[redshift]]ed, in accordance with [[Hubble's law]]. This indicates that they are receding from us and from each other, but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies.

The Great Attractor, discovered in 1986, lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years (250 million is the most recent estimate), in the direction of the [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] and [[Centaurus]] [[constellation]]s. In its vicinity there is a preponderance of large old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours, or radiating large amounts of radio waves.

In 1987, [[astronomer]] [[R. Brent Tully]] of the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Institute of Astronomy identified what he called the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], a structure one billion [[light-year]]s long and 150 million light-years across in which, he claimed, the Local Supercluster was embedded.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/science/massive-clusters-of-galaxies-defy-concepts-of-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all Massive Clusters of Galaxies Defy Concepts of the Universe N.Y.

However, it excludes [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. This quoted value for the mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be estimated based on critical density. The calculations are for the observable universe only as the volume of the whole is unknown and may be infinite.

===Estimates based on critical density===
Critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat.<ref>See [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter]].</ref> If there is no dark energy, it is also the [[density]] for which the expansion of the universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Parallel Worlds: A Journey Through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKULZJpcJBwC|year=2006|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-27698-8|page=385}}</ref> From the [[Friedmann equations]], the value for <math>\\rho_c</math> critical density, is:<ref>{{cite book|author=Bernard F.

:<math>\\rho_c = \\frac{3 H^2}{8 \\pi G},</math>

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and H = ''H<sub>0</sub>'' is the present value of the [[Hubble constant]]. The value for ''H<sub>0</sub>'', due to the European Space Agency's Planck Telescope, is ''H<sub>0</sub>'' = 67.15 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This gives a critical density of {{val|0.85|e=-26|u=kg/m3}} (commonly quoted as about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter). This density includes four significant types of energy/mass: ordinary matter (4.8%), neutrinos (0.1%), [[cold dark matter]] (26.8%), and [[dark energy]] (68.3%).<ref name='planck_cosmological_parameters'>{{cite journal | arxiv=1303.5076 | title=Planck 2013 results.

The density of ordinary matter, as measured by Planck, is 4.8% of the total critical density or {{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}. To convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume, a value based on the radius of the \"observable universe\". Since the universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, the [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving distance]] (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light-years. Thus, volume ({{sfrac|4|3}}''πr''<sup>3</sup>) equals {{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}} and the mass of ordinary matter equals density ({{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}) times volume ({{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}}) or {{val|1.46|e=53|u=kg}}.

Assuming the mass of ordinary matter is about {{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} as discussed above, and assuming all atoms are [[hydrogen atom]]s (which are about 74% of all atoms in our galaxy by mass, see [[Abundance of the chemical elements]]), the estimated total number of atoms in the observable universe is obtained by dividing the mass of ordinary matter by the mass of a hydrogen atom ({{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} divided by {{val|1.67|e=-27|u=kg}}). The result is approximately 10<sup>80</sup> hydrogen atoms.

The limit of observability in our universe is set by a set of cosmological horizons which limit—based on various physical constraints—the extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the universe. The most famous horizon is the [[particle horizon]] which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite [[age of the universe]]. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations (larger than the particle horizon owing to the [[expansion of space]]), an \"optical horizon\" at the [[Cosmic microwave background|surface of last scattering]], and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]] and [[gravitational wave background|gravitational waves]].

The '''observable universe''' is a [[spherical]] region of the [[universe]] comprising all [[matter]] that can be [[observation|observed]] from [[Earth]] or its space-based telescopes and exploratory probes at the present time, because [[electromagnetic radiation]] from these [[astronomical object|objects]] has had time to reach the [[Solar System]] and Earth since the beginning of the [[metric expansion of space|cosmological expansion]]. There are at least 2 trillion [[galaxy|galaxies]] in the observable universe.<ref name=\"Conselice\">{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Galaxy Number Density at ''z'' < 8 and Its Implications |first=Christopher J. |last=Conselice|display-authors=etal|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=830 |issue=2 |year=2016 |arxiv=1607.03909v2 |bibcode= 2016ApJ...830...83C |doi=10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/83 |page=83}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20161017\">{{cite news |last=Fountain |first=Henry |title=Two Trillion Galaxies, at the Very Least |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/science/two-trillion-galaxies-at-the-very-least.html |date=17 October 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}</ref> Assuming the universe is [[isotropy|isotropic]], the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly [[equidistant|the same]] in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a [[sphere|spherical]] volume (a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) centered on the observer. Every location in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.

The word ''observable'' in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect [[light]] or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the [[speed of light]] itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light could travel in the [[age of the universe]] (estimated {{as of|2015|lc=y}} around {{val|13.799|0.021|ul=billion}} years<ref name=\"Planck 2015\"/>) simply cannot be detected, as the signals could not have reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the ''visible'' universe, which includes only signals emitted since [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] (when hydrogen atoms were formed from protons and electrons and photons were emitted)—and the ''observable'' universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the [[Big Bang cosmology|Big Bang]] in traditional [[physical cosmology]], the end of the [[inflationary epoch]] in modern cosmology).

According to calculations, the current ''[[comoving distance]]''—proper distance, which takes into account that the universe has expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) was emitted, which represents the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion [[parsec]]s (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),<ref name=\"mapofuniverse\">{{cite journal|last = Gott III|first = J.

As the universe's expansion is accelerating, all currently observable objects will eventually appear to freeze in time, while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For instance, objects with the current redshift ''z'' from 5 to 10 will remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs) will never reach Earth.<ref name=Loeb2002>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.047301|title=Long-term future of extragalactic astronomy|journal=Physical Review D|volume=65|issue=4|pages=047301|year=2002|last1=Loeb|first1=Abraham|arxiv=astro-ph/0107568|bibcode=2002PhRvD..65d7301L}}</ref>

== The universe versus the observable universe ==
{{Physical cosmology|comp/struct}}
Some parts of the universe are too far away for the light emitted since the [[Big Bang]] to have had enough time to reach Earth or its scientific space-based instruments, and so lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to [[Hubble's law]], regions sufficiently distant from the Earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light ([[special relativity]] prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see [[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion) and furthermore the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion rate appears to be accelerating]] due to [[dark energy]]. 

Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging [[cosmological constant]]), so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a \"future visibility limit\" beyond which objects will never enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually.<ref name=ly93 /><ref>[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575 Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?] (see the last two paragraphs)</ref>) This future visibility limit is calculated at a [[comoving distance]] of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light-years), assuming the universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36.<ref name=\"mapofuniverse2\">The comoving distance of the future visibility limit is calculated on p. 8 of Gott et al.'s [http://www.astro.princeton.edu/universe/ms.pdf A Map of the Universe] to be 4.50 times the [[Hubble radius]], given as 4.220 billion parsecs (13.76 billion light-years), whereas the current comoving radius of the observable universe is calculated on p. 7 to be 3.38 times the Hubble radius. The number of galaxies in a sphere of a given comoving radius is proportional to the cube of the radius, so as shown on p. 8 the ratio between the number of galaxies observable in the future visibility limit to the number of galaxies observable today would be (4.50/3.38)<sup>3</sup> = 2.36.</ref>

Though in principle more galaxies will become observable in the future, in practice an increasing number of galaxies will become extremely [[redshift]]ed due to ongoing expansion, so much so that they will seem to disappear from view and become invisible.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Krauss|first = Lawrence M.|author2=Robert J.

For example, the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening at present can eventually reach the Earth in the future if the event is less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal will never reach the Earth if the event is more than 16 billion light-years away.<ref name=ly93 />

Both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term \"universe\" to mean \"observable universe\".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the universe that is [[Causality (physics)|causally disconnected]] from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the universe has any physical boundary in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. 

It is plausible that the [[galaxy|galaxies]] within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the universe. According to the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] initially introduced by its founder, [[Alan Guth]] (and by D. Kazanas<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/183361|title=Dynamics of the universe and spontaneous symmetry breaking|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=241|pages=L59–L63|year=1980|last1=Kazanas|first1=D.|bibcode=1980ApJ...241L..59K}}</ref>), if it is assumed that inflation began about 10<sup>−37</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3{{e|23}} times the radius of the observable universe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan H.

If the universe is finite but unbounded, it is also possible that the universe is smaller than the observable universe. In this case, what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies, formed by light that has circumnavigated the universe. It is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history, and consequently might appear quite different.

=== Misconceptions about its size === <!-- This section is linked from [[Universe]] -->

[[File:Incorrect plaque at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, April 2011.jpg|thumb|An example of the misconception that the radius of the observable universe is 13 billion light-years. This plaque appears at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City.]]

Many secondary sources have reported a wide variety of incorrect figures for the size of the visible universe. Some of these figures are listed below, with brief descriptions of possible reasons for misconceptions about them.

;13.8 billion light-years
:The [[age of the universe]] is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static [[Minkowski space]]time conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, [[spacetime]] is curved in a way that corresponds to the [[Expansion of the universe|expansion of space]], as evidenced by [[Hubble's law]]. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.<ref>Ned Wright, [http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html \"Why the Light Travel Time Distance should not be used in Press Releases\"].</ref>

[[Redshift survey|Sky surveys]] and mappings of the various [[wavelength]] bands of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (in particular [[Hydrogen line|21-cm emission]]) have yielded much information on the content and character of the [[universe]]'s structure. The organization of structure appears to follow as a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] model with organization up to the [[scale (spatial)|scale]] of [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filament]]s. Larger than this (at scales between 30 and 200 megaparsecs<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|page=1178|language=en}}</ref>), there seems to be no continued structure, a phenomenon that has been referred to as the ''End of Greatness''.<ref name=Kirshner />

=== Walls, filaments, nodes, and voids ===

[[File:2dfdtfe.gif|thumb|300px|left|[[Dtfe|DTFE reconstruction]] of the inner parts of the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]]]]
The organization of structure arguably begins at the stellar level, though most cosmologists rarely address [[astrophysics]] on that scale.  [[Star]]s are organized into [[galaxy|galaxies]], which in turn form [[galaxy group]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s, [[supercluster]]s, sheets, [[galaxy filament|walls and filaments]], which are separated by immense [[void (astronomy)|voids]], creating a vast foam-like structure<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|pages=1173–1174|language=en}}</ref> sometimes called the \"cosmic web\". Prior to 1989, it was commonly assumed that [[virial theorem|virialized]] galaxy clusters were the largest structures in existence, and that they were distributed more or less uniformly throughout the universe in every direction. However, since the early 1980s, more and more structures have been discovered. In 1983, Adrian Webster identified the Webster LQG, a [[large quasar group]] consisting of 5 quasars. The discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure, and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the universe. 

In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light-years across. That same year, an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered, the [[Giant Void]], which measures 1.3 billion light-years across. Based on [[redshift survey]] data, in 1989 [[Margaret Geller]] and [[John Huchra]] discovered the \"[[CfA2 Great Wall|Great Wall]]\",<ref name=\"redshift\">{{cite journal |author= M. J. Geller |author2=J. P.

The existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions, which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from [[redshift]]s.
Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano discovered the [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], a [[large quasar group]] measuring two billion light-years at its widest point which was the largest known structure in the universe at the time of its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the [[Sloan Great Wall]]. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12546-biggest-void-in-space-is-1-billion-light-years-across.html Biggest void in space is 1 billion light years across – space – 24 August 2007 – New Scientist]. Space.newscientist.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.</ref> It coincides with the '[[CMB cold spot]]', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.

Another large-scale structure is the [[SSA22 Protocluster]], a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light-years across.

In 2011, a large quasar group was discovered, [[U1.11]], measuring about 2.5 billion light-years across.

===End of Greatness===
The ''End of Greatness'' is an observational scale discovered at roughly 100&nbsp;[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] (roughly 300 million light-years) where the lumpiness seen in the large-scale structure of the [[universe]] is [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogenized]] and [[isotropic|isotropized]] in accordance with the [[Cosmological Principle]].<ref name=Kirshner /> At this scale, no pseudo-random [[fractal]]ness is apparent.<ref>LiveScience.com, [https://news.yahoo.com/universe-isnt-fractal-study-finds-215053937.html \"The Universe Isn't a Fractal, Study Finds\"], Natalie Wolchover,22 August 2012</ref>
The [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] seen in smaller surveys are [[random]]ized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent. It was not until the [[redshift survey]]s of the 1990s were completed that this scale could accurately be observed.<ref name=Kirshner>{{cite book |title=The Extravagant Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Cosmos |author=Robert P Kirshner |url=https://archive.org/details/extravagantunive00kirs |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/extravagantunive00kirs/page/71 71] |isbn=978-0-691-05862-7 |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>

===Observations===
[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|right|399px|thumb|\"Panoramic view of the entire near-infrared sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. The image is derived from the [[2MASS|2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC)]]—more than 1.5 million galaxies, and the Point Source Catalog (PSC)—nearly 0.5 billion Milky Way stars. The galaxies are color-coded by '[[redshift]]' obtained from the [[Uppsala General Catalogue|UGC]], [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|CfA]], Tully NBGC, LCRS, [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dF]], 6dFGS, and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] surveys (and from various observations compiled by the [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database|NASA Extragalactic Database]]), or photo-metrically deduced from the [[K band (infrared)|K band]] (2.2 μm). Blue are the nearest sources (''z'' < 0.01); green are at moderate distances (0.01 < ''z'' < 0.04) and red are the most distant sources that 2MASS resolves (0.04 < ''z'' < 0.1). The map is projected with an equal area Aitoff in the Galactic system (Milky Way at center).\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Large Scale Structure in the Local Universe: The 2MASS Galaxy Catalog |last=1Jarrett |first1=T. H. |date=2004 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=396–403 |doi=10.1071/AS04050 |arxiv=astro-ph/0405069 |bibcode=2004PASA...21..396J}}</ref>]]
Another indicator of large-scale structure is the '[[Lyman-alpha forest]]'. This is a collection of [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] that appear in the spectra of light from [[quasar]]s, which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic (mostly [[hydrogen]]) gas. These sheets appear to be associated with the formation of new galaxies.

Caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear. [[Gravitational lens]]ing (bending of light by gravitation) can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source. This is caused when foreground objects (such as galaxies) curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by [[general relativity]]), and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. [[Weak Gravitational Lensing|Weak lensing]] (gravitational shear) by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure.

The large-scale structure of the universe also looks different if one only uses [[redshift]] to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be if there were no cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks somewhat squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a \"''[[Redshift-space distortions|finger of God]]''\"—the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.

===Cosmography of Earth's cosmic neighborhood===
At the centre of the [[Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster]], a gravitational anomaly called the [[Great Attractor]] affects the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light-years across. These galaxies are all [[redshift]]ed, in accordance with [[Hubble's law]]. This indicates that they are receding from us and from each other, but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies.

The Great Attractor, discovered in 1986, lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years (250 million is the most recent estimate), in the direction of the [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] and [[Centaurus]] [[constellation]]s. In its vicinity there is a preponderance of large old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours, or radiating large amounts of radio waves.

In 1987, [[astronomer]] [[R. Brent Tully]] of the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Institute of Astronomy identified what he called the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], a structure one billion [[light-year]]s long and 150 million light-years across in which, he claimed, the Local Supercluster was embedded.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/science/massive-clusters-of-galaxies-defy-concepts-of-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all Massive Clusters of Galaxies Defy Concepts of the Universe N.Y.

However, it excludes [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. This quoted value for the mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be estimated based on critical density. The calculations are for the observable universe only as the volume of the whole is unknown and may be infinite.

===Estimates based on critical density===
Critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat.<ref>See [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter]].</ref> If there is no dark energy, it is also the [[density]] for which the expansion of the universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Parallel Worlds: A Journey Through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKULZJpcJBwC|year=2006|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-27698-8|page=385}}</ref> From the [[Friedmann equations]], the value for <math>\\rho_c</math> critical density, is:<ref>{{cite book|author=Bernard F.

:<math>\\rho_c = \\frac{3 H^2}{8 \\pi G},</math>

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and H = ''H<sub>0</sub>'' is the present value of the [[Hubble constant]]. The value for ''H<sub>0</sub>'', due to the European Space Agency's Planck Telescope, is ''H<sub>0</sub>'' = 67.15 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This gives a critical density of {{val|0.85|e=-26|u=kg/m3}} (commonly quoted as about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter). This density includes four significant types of energy/mass: ordinary matter (4.8%), neutrinos (0.1%), [[cold dark matter]] (26.8%), and [[dark energy]] (68.3%).<ref name='planck_cosmological_parameters'>{{cite journal | arxiv=1303.5076 | title=Planck 2013 results.

The density of ordinary matter, as measured by Planck, is 4.8% of the total critical density or {{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}. To convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume, a value based on the radius of the \"observable universe\". Since the universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, the [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving distance]] (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light-years. Thus, volume ({{sfrac|4|3}}''πr''<sup>3</sup>) equals {{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}} and the mass of ordinary matter equals density ({{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}) times volume ({{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}}) or {{val|1.46|e=53|u=kg}}.

<!-- [[Atoms in the universe]] redirects here -->
{{Main|Abundance of the chemical elements}}
Assuming the mass of ordinary matter is about {{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} as discussed above, and assuming all atoms are [[hydrogen atom]]s (which are about 74% of all atoms in our galaxy by mass, see [[Abundance of the chemical elements]]), the estimated total number of atoms in the observable universe is obtained by dividing the mass of ordinary matter by the mass of a hydrogen atom ({{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} divided by {{val|1.67|e=-27|u=kg}}). The result is approximately 10<sup>80</sup> hydrogen atoms.

==Most distant objects==
{{main|List of the most distant astronomical objects}}
The most distant [[astronomical object]] yet announced as of 2016 is a galaxy classified [[GN-z11]]. In 2009, a [[gamma ray burst]], [[GRB 090423]], was found to have a [[redshift]] of 8.2, which indicates that the collapsing star that caused it exploded when the universe was only 630 million years old.<ref name=\"NASAGRB\">[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/28apr_grbsmash/ New Gamma-Ray Burst Smashes Cosmic Distance Record – NASA Science].

==Horizons==
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
The limit of observability in our universe is set by a set of cosmological horizons which limit—based on various physical constraints—the extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the universe. The most famous horizon is the [[particle horizon]] which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite [[age of the universe]]. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations (larger than the particle horizon owing to the [[expansion of space]]), an \"optical horizon\" at the [[Cosmic microwave background|surface of last scattering]], and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]] and [[gravitational wave background|gravitational waves]].

The etymologies of the three generic names ''Manis'' (Linnaeus, 1758), ''Phataginus'' (Rafinesque, 1821), and ''Smutsia'' (Gray, 1865) are sometimes misunderstood.

[[Carl Linnaeus]] (1758) invented the [[Neo Latin|Neo-Latin]] generic name ''Manis'' apparently as a feminine singular form of the Latin masculine plural [[Manes]], the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] name for a type of [[spirit]], after the animal's strange appearance.<ref>{{cite web |title=ITIS Report Manis Linnaeus, 1758 |url=https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=584905#null |accessdate= May 28, 2018}}</ref>

[[Constantine Rafinesque]] (1821) formed the Neo-Latin generic name ''Phataginus'' from the French term ''phatagin'', adopted by [[Count Buffon]] (1763) after the reported local name ''phatagin'' or ''phatagen'' used in the [[East Indies]].

The British [[naturalist]] [[John Edward Gray]] named ''Smutsia'' for the [[South Africa]]n naturalist [[Johannes Smuts]] (1808–1869),<ref>{{cite web |title=S2A3 Biographical Database of Southern African Science [Johannes Smuts] |url=http://www.s2a3.org.za/bio/Biograph_final.php?serial=2641 |accessdate =May 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=T.S. |date=1904 |title=Index Generum Mammalium: a List of the Genera and Families of Mammals |journal=North American Fauna |volume=23 |pages=635 |doi=10.3996/nafa.23.0001 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/164195#page/643/mode/1up |access-date=May 28, 2018}}</ref> the first South African to write a [[treatise]] on mammals in 1832 (in which he described the species ''Manis temminckii'').

===Among Manidae===
The first dichotomy in the [[phylogeny]] of extant Manidae separates Asian pangolins (''Manis'') from African pangolins (''Smutsia'' and ''Phataginus''). 
Within the former, ''Manis pentadactyla'' is the [[sister group]] to a clade comprising ''M. crassicaudata'' and ''M. javanica''. Within the latter, a split separates large taxa of genus ''Smutsia'' from small taxa of genus ''Phataginus''.<ref name=\"Gaubert2018\" />

The tongues of pangolins are extremely long and &ndash; like those of the [[giant anteater]] and the [[tube-lipped nectar bat]] &ndash; the root of the tongue is not attached to the [[hyoid]] bone, but is in the [[thorax]] between the [[sternum]] and the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chan |first=Lap-Ki | title = Extrinsic Lingual Musculature of Two Pangolins (Pholidota: Manidae) | journal = [[Journal of Mammalogy]]| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxfordshire, England|volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 472–480 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.2307/1382356 | jstor = 1382356}}</ref> Large pangolins can extend their tongues as much as {{Convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with a diameter of only {{Convert|0.5|cm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Mondadori/>

===Diet===
[[File:Pangolin defending itself from lions (Gir Forest, Gujarat, India).jpg|thumb|right|[[Indian pangolin]] defending itself against [[Asiatic lion]]s]]
Pangolins are [[insectivory|insectivorous]]. Most of their diet consists of various species of ants and termites and may be supplemented by other insects, especially larvae. They are somewhat particular and tend to consume only one or two species of insects, even when many species are available to them. A pangolin can consume {{convert|140|to|200|g|abbr=on}} of insects per day.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/grosshue_crai/diet.htm|title= Rollin' With the Pangolin – Diet|first= Craig|last= Grosshuesch|year= 2012|publisher= [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]]|location=La Crosse, Wisconsin|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141223020558/http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/grosshue_crai/diet.htm|archivedate= 23 December 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> Pangolins are an important regulator of termite populations in their natural habitats.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.7717/peerj.4140|pmid=29302388|pmc=5742527|title=Transcriptomic analysis identifies genes and pathways related to myrmecophagy in the Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica)|journal=[[PeerJ]]|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|location=Corte Madera, California|volume=5|pages=e4140|year=2017|last1=Ma|first1=Jing-E|last2=Li|first2=Lin-Miao|last3=Jiang|first3=Hai-Ying|last4=Zhang|first4=Xiu-Juan|last5=Li|first5=Juan|last6=Li|first6=Guan-Yu|last7=Yuan|first7=Li-Hong|last8=Wu|first8=Jun|last9=Chen|first9=Jin-Ping}}</ref>

Pangolins have very poor [[Visual perception|vision]], so they rely heavily on [[Olfaction|smell]] and [[hearing]]. Pangolins also lack teeth; therefore they have evolved other physical characteristics to help them eat ants and termites. Their skeletal structure is sturdy and they have strong front legs that are useful for tearing into termite mounds.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=eLS|last=Rose|first=Kd|last2=Gaudin|first2=Tj|date=2001|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|isbn=978-0470015902|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0001556.pub2}}</ref> They use their powerful front claws to dig into trees, ground, and vegetation to find prey,<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Coulson, Ian M |author2=Heath, Martha E |date=Dec 1997|title=Foraging behaviour and ecology of the Cape pangolin (Manis temminckii) in north-western Zimbabwe|url=|journal=African Journal of Ecology|volume=35|issue=4|pages=361–369 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.1997.101-89101.x|via=EBSCO}}</ref> then proceed to use their long tongues to probe inside the insect tunnels and to retrieve their prey.

===Reproduction===
Pangolins are solitary and meet only to mate. Males are larger than females, weighing up to 40% more. While the mating season is not defined, they typically mate once each year, usually during the summer or autumn. Rather than the males seeking out the females, males mark their location with urine or feces and the females will find them. If there is competition over a female, the males will use their tails as clubs to fight for the opportunity to mate with her.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/grosshue_crai/reproduction.htm|title= Rollin' With the Pangolin - Reproduction|first= Craig|last= Grosshuesch|year= 2012|publisher= University of Wisconsin–La Crosse|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141223040747/http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/grosshue_crai/reproduction.htm|archivedate= 23 December 2014|url-status= dead}}</ref>

At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. After several days, they harden and darken to resemble those of an adult pangolin. During the vulnerable stage, the mother stays with her offspring in the burrow, nursing it, and wraps her body around it if she senses danger. The young cling to the mother's tail as she moves about, although in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first two to four weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. [[Weaning]] takes place around three months of age, at which stage the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At two years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |last=Dickman |first=Christopher R. |editor-last=MacDonald |editor-first=D. |year=1984 |title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/780 780–781] |isbn=978-0-87196-871-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/780 }}</ref>

==Claims about medical efficacy==
The medical powers of pangolin meat and scales claimed by [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are based on behavioral observations: they eat ants; they have long tongues, and they have scales that protect them. The Chinese name ''chuan shan jia'' ({{lang|zh|穿山甲}}) \"penetrating-the-mountain scales\") emphasizes the idea of penetration({{lang|zh|穿}})  or passing all the way through even massive obstructions such as mountains({{lang|zh|山}}), plus the distinctive scales({{lang|zh|甲}})  which embody both penetration and protection and imply similar powers to penetrate blockages within the body and to give protection.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv2622493/ |title=我们仍未知道那天穿山甲说了什么 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=May 5, 2019 |website=bilibili |publisher= |access-date=26 March 2020 |quote=中医黑子常用来抨击中医的“穿山甲能穿山，所以能通经络”这句话的原文出处大概是《本草纲目》}}</ref>

The first record of pangolin scales occurs in ''Ben Cao Jinji Zhu'' (\"Variorum of Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica\", 500 CE), which recommends pangolin scales for protection against ant bites; burning the scales is a cure for people crying hysterically during the night.<ref name=PanMed>{{cite book |last1=Xing |first1=Shuang  |author-link1= |last2=Bonebrake |first2=Timothy C.  |author-link2= |last3=Cheng |first3=Wenda  |author-link3= |last4=Zhang |first4=Mingxia |author-link4= |last5=Ades |first5=Gary |last6=Shaw |first6=Debbie  |last7=Zhou |first7=Youlong |display-authors=3 |date=2019 |orig-year= |chapter=Meat and medicine: historic and contemporary use in Asia |script-chapter= |trans-chapter= |chapter-format= |editor1-last=Challender |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-link=Daniel Challender |editor2-last=Nash |editor2-first=Helen |editor2-link= |editor3-last=Waterman |editor3-first=Carly |title=Pangolins: Science, Society and Conservation |script-title= |trans-title= |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zey_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233 |url-status=live |edition=First |location= |publisher=Academic Press |page=233 |nopp= |arxiv= |bibcode= |doi= |isbn=9780128155073 |access-date=27 March 2020 |name-list-format= |mode= |ref=}}</ref>

During the [[Tang dynasty]], a recipe for expelling evil spirits with a formulation of scales, herbs, and minerals appeared in 682, and in 752 CE the idea that pangolin scales could also stimulate milk secretion in lactating women, one of the important uses today, was recommended in the ''Wai Tai Mi Yao'' (\"Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library\").<ref name=PanMed/>

In the [[Song dynasty]], the notion of penetrating and clearing blockages was emphasized in the ''Taiping sheng hui fan''  (\"Formulas from Benevolent Sages Compiled During the Era of Peace and Tranquility\"), compiled by Wang Huaiyin in 992.<ref name=PanMed/>

Today the main uses of pangolin scales are to unblock blood clots, promote blood circulation, and to help lactating women secrete milk. There are many other applications for treating gynecological diseases, and pills that contain powdered pangolin scales are used for treating blockages of the fallopian tubes to cure infertility.<ref name=PanMed/>

The official [[pharmacopoeia]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] continues to include Chinese pangolin scales as an ingredient in TCM formulations, and there is a legal market for scales.<ref name=PanMed/>

Pangolins have large, protective [[keratin]] scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this feature. They live in hollow trees or [[burrow]]s, depending on the species. Pangolins are [[nocturnal]], and their diet consists of mainly [[ants]] and [[termites]], which they capture using their long tongues.

The etymologies of the three generic names ''Manis'' (Linnaeus, 1758), ''Phataginus'' (Rafinesque, 1821), and ''Smutsia'' (Gray, 1865) are sometimes misunderstood.

[[Carl Linnaeus]] (1758) invented the [[Neo Latin|Neo-Latin]] generic name ''Manis'' apparently as a feminine singular form of the Latin masculine plural [[Manes]], the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] name for a type of [[spirit]], after the animal's strange appearance.<ref>{{cite web |title=ITIS Report Manis Linnaeus, 1758 |url=https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=584905#null |accessdate= May 28, 2018}}</ref>

[[Constantine Rafinesque]] (1821) formed the Neo-Latin generic name ''Phataginus'' from the French term ''phatagin'', adopted by [[Count Buffon]] (1763) after the reported local name ''phatagin'' or ''phatagen'' used in the [[East Indies]].

The British [[naturalist]] [[John Edward Gray]] named ''Smutsia'' for the [[South Africa]]n naturalist [[Johannes Smuts]] (1808–1869),<ref>{{cite web |title=S2A3 Biographical Database of Southern African Science [Johannes Smuts] |url=http://www.s2a3.org.za/bio/Biograph_final.php?serial=2641 |accessdate =May 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=T.S. |date=1904 |title=Index Generum Mammalium: a List of the Genera and Families of Mammals |journal=North American Fauna |volume=23 |pages=635 |doi=10.3996/nafa.23.0001 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/164195#page/643/mode/1up |access-date=May 28, 2018}}</ref> the first South African to write a [[treatise]] on mammals in 1832 (in which he described the species ''Manis temminckii'').

===Diet===

Pangolins are [[insectivory|insectivorous]]. Most of their diet consists of various species of ants and termites and may be supplemented by other insects, especially larvae. They are somewhat particular and tend to consume only one or two species of insects, even when many species are available to them. A pangolin can consume {{convert|140|to|200|g|abbr=on}} of insects per day.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/grosshue_crai/diet.htm|title= Rollin' With the Pangolin – Diet|first= Craig|last= Grosshuesch|year= 2012|publisher= [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]]|location=La Crosse, Wisconsin|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141223020558/http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/grosshue_crai/diet.htm|archivedate= 23 December 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> Pangolins are an important regulator of termite populations in their natural habitats.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.7717/peerj.4140|pmid=29302388|pmc=5742527|title=Transcriptomic analysis identifies genes and pathways related to myrmecophagy in the Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica)|journal=[[PeerJ]]|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|location=Corte Madera, California|volume=5|pages=e4140|year=2017|last1=Ma|first1=Jing-E|last2=Li|first2=Lin-Miao|last3=Jiang|first3=Hai-Ying|last4=Zhang|first4=Xiu-Juan|last5=Li|first5=Juan|last6=Li|first6=Guan-Yu|last7=Yuan|first7=Li-Hong|last8=Wu|first8=Jun|last9=Chen|first9=Jin-Ping}}</ref>

Pangolins have very poor [[Visual perception|vision]], so they rely heavily on [[Olfaction|smell]] and [[hearing]]. Pangolins also lack teeth; therefore they have evolved other physical characteristics to help them eat ants and termites.

===Reproduction===
Pangolins are solitary and meet only to mate. Males are larger than females, weighing up to 40% more. While the mating season is not defined, they typically mate once each year, usually during the summer or autumn. Rather than the males seeking out the females, males mark their location with urine or feces and the females will find them. If there is competition over a female, the males will use their tails as clubs to fight for the opportunity to mate with her.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/grosshue_crai/reproduction.htm|title= Rollin' With the Pangolin - Reproduction|first= Craig|last= Grosshuesch|year= 2012|publisher= University of Wisconsin–La Crosse|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141223040747/http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/grosshue_crai/reproduction.htm|archivedate= 23 December 2014|url-status= dead}}</ref>

At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. After several days, they harden and darken to resemble those of an adult pangolin. During the vulnerable stage, the mother stays with her offspring in the burrow, nursing it, and wraps her body around it if she senses danger. The young cling to the mother's tail as she moves about, although in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first two to four weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. [[Weaning]] takes place around three months of age, at which stage the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At two years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |last=Dickman |first=Christopher R. |editor-last=MacDonald |editor-first=D. |year=1984 |title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/780 780–781] |isbn=978-0-87196-871-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/780 }}</ref>

However, further study was less conclusive on pangolins as the definitive source of (SARS-CoV-2), namely being the bridge that the virus used to jump from bats to humans, after it emerged that the 99% match did not actually refer to the entire genome, but to a specific site known as the receptor-binding domain (RBD).<ref name=\"Nature-coronavirus-mystery\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/d41586-020-00548-w | title=Mystery deepens over animal source of coronavirus |journal=Nature |date=26 February 2020 | last1=Cyranoski | first1=David | volume=579 | issue=7797 | pages=18–19 | pmid=32127703 | bibcode=2020Natur.579...18C }}</ref> A whole-genome comparison found that the pangolin and human viruses share only 90.3% of their RNA.<ref name=\"Nature-coronavirus-mystery\" /> Ecologists worried that the early speculation about pangolins being the source may have led to mass slaughters, endangering the animals further, which was similar to what happened to [[civet | civets]] during the [[SARS]] outbreak.<ref name=\"Nature-coronavirus-mystery\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/civet-cat-slaughter-to-fight-sars | title=Civet Cat Slaughter To Fight SARS|publisher=CBSNews |date=11 January 2004 |accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref>

==Claims about medical efficacy==
The medical powers of pangolin meat and scales claimed by [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are based on behavioral observations: they eat ants; they have long tongues, and they have scales that protect them. The Chinese name ''chuan shan jia'' ({{lang|zh|穿山甲}}) \"penetrating-the-mountain scales\") emphasizes the idea of penetration({{lang|zh|穿}})  or passing all the way through even massive obstructions such as mountains({{lang|zh|山}}), plus the distinctive scales({{lang|zh|甲}})  which embody both penetration and protection and imply similar powers to penetrate blockages within the body and to give protection.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv2622493/ |title=我们仍未知道那天穿山甲说了什么 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=May 5, 2019 |website=bilibili |publisher= |access-date=26 March 2020 |quote=中医黑子常用来抨击中医的“穿山甲能穿山，所以能通经络”这句话的原文出处大概是《本草纲目》}}</ref>

The first record of pangolin scales occurs in ''Ben Cao Jinji Zhu'' (\"Variorum of Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica\", 500 CE), which recommends pangolin scales for protection against ant bites; burning the scales is a cure for people crying hysterically during the night.<ref name=PanMed>{{cite book |last1=Xing |first1=Shuang  |author-link1= |last2=Bonebrake |first2=Timothy C.  |author-link2= |last3=Cheng |first3=Wenda  |author-link3= |last4=Zhang |first4=Mingxia |author-link4= |last5=Ades |first5=Gary |last6=Shaw |first6=Debbie  |last7=Zhou |first7=Youlong |display-authors=3 |date=2019 |orig-year= |chapter=Meat and medicine: historic and contemporary use in Asia |script-chapter= |trans-chapter= |chapter-format= |editor1-last=Challender |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-link=Daniel Challender |editor2-last=Nash |editor2-first=Helen |editor2-link= |editor3-last=Waterman |editor3-first=Carly |title=Pangolins: Science, Society and Conservation |script-title= |trans-title= |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zey_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233 |url-status=live |edition=First |location= |publisher=Academic Press |page=233 |nopp= |arxiv= |bibcode= |doi= |isbn=9780128155073 |access-date=27 March 2020 |name-list-format= |mode= |ref=}}</ref>

During the [[Tang dynasty]], a recipe for expelling evil spirits with a formulation of scales, herbs, and minerals appeared in 682, and in 752 CE the idea that pangolin scales could also stimulate milk secretion in lactating women, one of the important uses today, was recommended in the ''Wai Tai Mi Yao'' (\"Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library\").<ref name=PanMed/>

In the [[Song dynasty]], the notion of penetrating and clearing blockages was emphasized in the ''Taiping sheng hui fan''  (\"Formulas from Benevolent Sages Compiled During the Era of Peace and Tranquility\"), compiled by Wang Huaiyin in 992.<ref name=PanMed/>

Today the main uses of pangolin scales are to unblock blood clots, promote blood circulation, and to help lactating women secrete milk. There are many other applications for treating gynecological diseases, and pills that contain powdered pangolin scales are used for treating blockages of the fallopian tubes to cure infertility.<ref name=PanMed/>

The official [[pharmacopoeia]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] continues to include Chinese pangolin scales as an ingredient in TCM formulations, and there is a legal market for scales.<ref name=PanMed/>

As a result of increasing threats to pangolins, mainly in the form of illegal, international trade in pangolin skin, scales, and meat, these species have received increasing conservation attention in recent years. {{As of|January 2020}}, the IUCN considered all eight species of pangolin on its [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]] as threatened.<ref name=\"IUCN Manidae\"/> Also, the IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group launched a global action plan to conserve pangolins, dubbed \"Scaling up Pangolin Conservation\" in July 2014. This action plan aims to improve all aspects of pangolin conservation with an added emphasis on combating poaching and trafficking of the animal, while educating communities in its importance.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |title=Action Plan |website=www.pangolinsg.org |url=http://www.pangolinsg.org/members-work/action-plan/ |access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref> Another suggested approach to fighting pangolin (and general wildlife) trafficking consists in \"following the money\" rather than \"the animal\", which aims to disrupt smugglers' profits by interrupting money flows. Financial intelligence gathering could thus become a key tool in protecting these animals, although this opportunity is often overlooked.<ref name=\":4\" /> In 2018, a Chinese NGO launched the Counting Pangolins movement, calling for joint efforts to save the mammals from [[trafficking]].<ref>Xinhua News (2018-11-21) [http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-11/21/c_137620372.htm Spotlight: Pangolin conservationists call for ban on illegal trade of mammal products]</ref><ref>China Plus (2017-02-18) [http://english.cri.cn/12394/2017/02/18/3124s952140.htm World Pangolin Day: Conservationists demand greater protection to stop extinction]</ref><ref>Xinhua News (2018-06-08) [http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/08/c_137240161.htm How China is combating wildlife trafficking in Africa]</ref> Wildlife conservation group [[Traffic (conservation programme)|TRAFFIC]] has identified 159 smuggling routes used by pangolin traffickers and aims to shut these down.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pangolins – Species we work with at TRAFFIC |website=www.traffic.org |url=https://www.traffic.org/what-we-do/species/pangolins/ |access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref>

In this zone, three bodies of law would be implemented: EU law, Turkish/Syrian/Iraqi/Iranian law and Kurdish law. This proposal was adopted by the PKK programme following the \"Refoundation Congress\" in April 2005.<ref name=REFOUNDATION>[http://www.pkk-info.com/tr/eskisite/pkktarihi/PKK.ilk.bildirgesi.html PKK Yeniden İnşa Bildirgesi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206200234/http://www.pkk-info.com/tr/eskisite/pkktarihi/PKK.ilk.bildirgesi.html |date=6 February 2009 }} PKK web site, 20 April 2005</ref>

Öcalan's statement said, \"The PKK should not use weapons unless it is attacked with the aim of annihilation,\" and \"it is very important to build a democratic union between Turks and Kurds. With this process, the way to democratic dialogue will be also opened\".<ref name=CEASE>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5389746.stm Kurdish rebel boss in truce plea], ''[[BBC News]]''</ref>

On 31 May 2010, however, Öcalan said he was abandoning the ongoing dialogue with Turkey, as \"this process is no longer meaningful or useful\". Öcalan stated that Turkey had ignored his three protocols for negotiation: (a) his terms of health and security, (b) his release, and (c) a peaceful resolution to the Kurdish issue in Turkey. Though the Turkish government had received Öcalan's protocols, they were never released to the public. Öcalan said he would leave the top PKK commanders in charge of the conflict, but that this should not be misinterpreted as a call for the PKK to intensify its armed conflict with Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=pkk-steps-up-attacks-in-turkey-2010-05-30|title=TURKEY – PKK steps up attacks in Turkey|accessdate=23 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://haber.ekolay.net/haber/3/1007462/Kandil-kabul-etti-Ankara-reddetti.aspx |title=Hürriyet - Haberler, Son Dakika Haberleri ve Güncel Haber |access-date=1 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426185907/http://haber.ekolay.net/haber/3/1007462/Kandil-kabul-etti-Ankara-reddetti.aspx |archive-date=26 April 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>

In 2013, Öcalan initiated new peace negotiations. On 21 March of  that year, Öcalan declared a ceasefire between the PKK and the Turkish state. Öcalan's statement was read to hundreds of thousands of Kurds in Diyarbakir who had gathered to celebrate the Kurdish New Year, [[Newroz as celebrated by Kurds|Newroz]]. The statement said in part, \"Let guns be silenced and politics dominate... a new door is being opened from the process of armed conflict to democratization and democratic politics. It's not the end. It's the start of a new era.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://de.reuters.com/article/trkei-kurden-idDEBEE92K03D20130321|title=Inhaftierter Kurden-Chef stößt Tür zum Frieden auf|date=2013-03-21|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-08-18|language=de}}</ref> Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] welcomed the statement, and hope for a peaceful settlement was raised on both sides.

Soon after Öcalan's declaration, the functional head of the PKK, [[Murat Karayılan]] responded by promising to implement a ceasefire, stating, \"Everyone should know the PKK is as ready for peace as it is for war\".

=== Democratic confederalism ===
{{Communalism|People}}
{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|People}}
Since his incarceration, Öcalan has significantly changed his ideology through exposure to Western [[social theorist]]s such as [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Fernand Braudel]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who Öcalan calls \"a prophet\").<ref name=\"BOOKS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abdullah-ocalan.com/index1.htm|title=abdullah-ocalan.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106181415/http://www.abdullah-ocalan.com/index1.htm|archive-date=6 January 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"DES\">[http://www.pwdnerin.com/modules.php?name=Content7&pa=showpage&pid=97 Tarihli Görüşme Notları] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316140439/http://www.pwdnerin.com/modules.php?name=Content7&pa=showpage&pid=97 |date=16 March 2012 }} PWD-Kurdistan, 16 March 2005</ref> Drawing heavily on Bookchin's [[libertarian socialist]] idea of [[Communalism (political philosophy)|communalism]],<ref name=\"biehl dialectics\">{{cite web|url=http://new-compass.net/articles/bookchin-öcalan-and-dialectics-democracy|title=Bookchin, Öcalan, and the Dialectics of Democracy|last=Biehl|first=Janet|date=16 February 2012|publisher=New Compass|accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref> Öcalan fashioned his ideal society called \"democratic confederalism\".

'''Democratic confederalism''' is a \"system of popularly elected administrative councils, allowing local communities to exercise autonomous control over their assets, while linking to other communities via a network of confederal councils.\"<ref name=\":0\">Paul White, \"Democratic Confederalism and the PKK's Feminist Transformation,\" in ''The PKK: Coming Down from the Mountains'' (London: Zed Books, 2015), pp. 126–149.</ref> Decisions are made by communes in each neighborhood, village, or city. All are welcome to partake in the communal councils, but political participation is not mandated. There is no private property, but rather “ownership by use, which grants individuals usage rights to the buildings, land, and infrastructure, but not the right to sell and buy on the market or convert them to private enterprises.”<ref name=\":0\" /> The economy is in the hands of the communal councils, and is thus (in the words of Bookchin) ‘neither collectivised nor privatised - it is common.’<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Feminism]], [[ecology]], and [[direct democracy]] are essential in democratic confederalism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democratic Confederalism|last=Öcalan|first=Abdullah|publisher=Transmedia Publishing Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=978-3-941012-47-9|location=London|pages=21}}</ref>

With his 2005 \"Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan\", Öcalan advocated for a Kurdish implementation of Bookchin's ''[[The Ecology of Freedom]]'' via municipal assemblies as a democratic confederation of Kurdish communities beyond the state borders of Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. Öcalan promoted a platform of shared values: environmentalism, self-defense, gender equality, and a pluralistic tolerance for religion, politics, and culture. While some of his followers questioned Öcalan's conversion from [[Marxism-Leninism]], the PKK adopted Öcalan's proposal and began to form assemblies.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Enzinna |first1=Wes |title=A Dream of Secular Utopia in ISIS' Backyard |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-11-24 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/a-dream-of-utopia-in-hell.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In early 2004, Öcalan attempted to arrange a meeting with [[Murray Bookchin]] through Öcalan's lawyers, describing himself as Bookchin's \"student\" eager to adapt Bookchin's thought to Middle Eastern society. Bookchin was too ill to meet with Öcalan. In May 2004 Bookchin conveyed this message \"My hope is that the Kurdish people will one day be able to establish a free, rational society that will allow their brilliance once again to flourish. They are fortunate indeed to have a leader of Mr. Öcalan's talents to guide them\". When Bookchin died in 2006, the PKK hailed the American thinker as \"one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century\" and vowed to put his theories into practice.<ref name=\"biehl dialectics\" />

Followers of Öcalan and members of the PKK are known by his [[diminutive]] name as ''Apocu'' (Apo-ites), and his movement is known as ''Apoculuk'' (Apoism).<ref name=\"Mango2005\">{{cite book|author=Andrew Mango|title=Turkey and the War on Terror: For Forty Years We Fought Alone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9lfQvRL7J4C&pg=PA32|year=2005|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=978-0-415-35002-0|page=32}}</ref>

On 31 May 2010, however, Öcalan said he was abandoning the ongoing dialogue with Turkey, as \"this process is no longer meaningful or useful\".

Though the Turkish government had received Öcalan's protocols, they were never released to the public. Öcalan said he would leave the top PKK commanders in charge of the conflict, but that this should not be misinterpreted as a call for the PKK to intensify its armed conflict with Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=pkk-steps-up-attacks-in-turkey-2010-05-30|title=TURKEY – PKK steps up attacks in Turkey|accessdate=23 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://haber.ekolay.net/haber/3/1007462/Kandil-kabul-etti-Ankara-reddetti.aspx |title=Hürriyet - Haberler, Son Dakika Haberleri ve Güncel Haber |access-date=1 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426185907/http://haber.ekolay.net/haber/3/1007462/Kandil-kabul-etti-Ankara-reddetti.aspx |archive-date=26 April 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Öcalan's statement was read to hundreds of thousands of Kurds in Diyarbakir who had gathered to celebrate the Kurdish New Year, [[Newroz as celebrated by Kurds|Newroz]]. The statement said in part, \"Let guns be silenced and politics dominate... a new door is being opened from the process of armed conflict to democratization and democratic politics. It's not the end. It's the start of a new era.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://de.reuters.com/article/trkei-kurden-idDEBEE92K03D20130321|title=Inhaftierter Kurden-Chef stößt Tür zum Frieden auf|date=2013-03-21|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-08-18|language=de}}</ref> Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] welcomed the statement, and hope for a peaceful settlement was raised on both sides.

Soon after Öcalan's declaration, the functional head of the PKK, [[Murat Karayılan]] responded by promising to implement a ceasefire, stating, \"Everyone should know the PKK is as ready for peace as it is for war\".

Since his incarceration, Öcalan has significantly changed his ideology through exposure to Western [[social theorist]]s such as [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Fernand Braudel]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who Öcalan calls \"a prophet\").<ref name=\"BOOKS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abdullah-ocalan.com/index1.htm|title=abdullah-ocalan.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106181415/http://www.abdullah-ocalan.com/index1.htm|archive-date=6 January 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"DES\">[http://www.pwdnerin.com/modules.php?name=Content7&pa=showpage&pid=97 Tarihli Görüşme Notları] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316140439/http://www.pwdnerin.com/modules.php?name=Content7&pa=showpage&pid=97 |date=16 March 2012 }} PWD-Kurdistan, 16 March 2005</ref> Drawing heavily on Bookchin's [[libertarian socialist]] idea of [[Communalism (political philosophy)|communalism]],<ref name=\"biehl dialectics\">{{cite web|url=http://new-compass.net/articles/bookchin-öcalan-and-dialectics-democracy|title=Bookchin, Öcalan, and the Dialectics of Democracy|last=Biehl|first=Janet|date=16 February 2012|publisher=New Compass|accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref> Öcalan fashioned his ideal society called \"democratic confederalism\".

'''Democratic confederalism''' is a \"system of popularly elected administrative councils, allowing local communities to exercise autonomous control over their assets, while linking to other communities via a network of confederal councils.\"<ref name=\":0\">Paul White, \"Democratic Confederalism and the PKK's Feminist Transformation,\" in ''The PKK: Coming Down from the Mountains'' (London: Zed Books, 2015), pp. 126–149.</ref> Decisions are made by communes in each neighborhood, village, or city. All are welcome to partake in the communal councils, but political participation is not mandated. There is no private property, but rather “ownership by use, which grants individuals usage rights to the buildings, land, and infrastructure, but not the right to sell and buy on the market or convert them to private enterprises.”<ref name=\":0\" /> The economy is in the hands of the communal councils, and is thus (in the words of Bookchin) ‘neither collectivised nor privatised - it is common.’<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Feminism]], [[ecology]], and [[direct democracy]] are essential in democratic confederalism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democratic Confederalism|last=Öcalan|first=Abdullah|publisher=Transmedia Publishing Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=978-3-941012-47-9|location=London|pages=21}}</ref>

With his 2005 \"Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan\", Öcalan advocated for a Kurdish implementation of Bookchin's ''[[The Ecology of Freedom]]'' via municipal assemblies as a democratic confederation of Kurdish communities beyond the state borders of Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. Öcalan promoted a platform of shared values: environmentalism, self-defense, gender equality, and a pluralistic tolerance for religion, politics, and culture. While some of his followers questioned Öcalan's conversion from [[Marxism-Leninism]], the PKK adopted Öcalan's proposal and began to form assemblies.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Enzinna |first1=Wes |title=A Dream of Secular Utopia in ISIS' Backyard |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-11-24 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/a-dream-of-utopia-in-hell.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In early 2004, Öcalan attempted to arrange a meeting with [[Murray Bookchin]] through Öcalan's lawyers, describing himself as Bookchin's \"student\" eager to adapt Bookchin's thought to Middle Eastern society. Bookchin was too ill to meet with Öcalan. In May 2004 Bookchin conveyed this message \"My hope is that the Kurdish people will one day be able to establish a free, rational society that will allow their brilliance once again to flourish. They are fortunate indeed to have a leader of Mr. Öcalan's talents to guide them\". When Bookchin died in 2006, the PKK hailed the American thinker as \"one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century\" and vowed to put his theories into practice.<ref name=\"biehl dialectics\" />

Followers of Öcalan and members of the PKK are known by his [[diminutive]] name as ''Apocu'' (Apo-ites), and his movement is known as ''Apoculuk'' (Apoism).<ref name=\"Mango2005\">{{cite book|author=Andrew Mango|title=Turkey and the War on Terror: For Forty Years We Fought Alone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9lfQvRL7J4C&pg=PA32|year=2005|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=978-0-415-35002-0|page=32}}</ref>

In the spring of 1996, NBC announced that the series had been canceled after finishing 79th in the ratings, leaving one episode unaired. In December 1996, the rival network CBS announced it had picked up the series as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired 15 new episodes as its second season. For several seasons, ''JAG'' climbed in the ratings and ultimately ran for nine additional seasons. ''JAG'' furthermore spawned the hit series ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'', which in turn led to spin-offs ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]''.

In total, 227 episodes were produced over 10 seasons.

==Production==

===Background and development===
The creator of ''JAG'', Donald P. Bellisario, served for four years in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and after having worked his way up through advertising jobs, he landed his first network television job as a story editor for the World War II-era series ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'', where he got a habit of promoting a consistent promilitary stance in a business where he got the perception that \"antiwar\" and \"antisoldier\" mentality were the commonplace.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 127.</ref> The stereotype in the post-[[Vietnam war]] era of \"[[Vietnam Veteran#Negative stereotypes of Vietnam veterans and efforts to overcome|crazed Vietnam veterans]]\" was notably subverted, by not just one, but three of the main characters, in ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'', of which Bellisario was the co-creator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/> 
Following the cancellation of his series ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', Bellisario began working on a one-shot screenplay of a murder mystery aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, where the victim was a female aviator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>

The issue of whether or not to expand the options for women serving in the U.S. armed forces as fighter pilots and in other frontline assignments was a contentious social issue of the day. In 1991, a famous incident had occurred at the [[Tailhook Association]] [[Tailhook scandal|convention in Las Vegas]], where male naval aviators had behaved in manners inappropriate, if not criminal.  The follow-up criminal and other investigations by the [[Naval Investigative Service|then-named NIS]], the [[Naval Inspector General]], and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, were later heavily criticized by the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense]].  The  [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Acting Secretary of the Navy]] [[Sean O'Keefe]], to whom the report was delivered, agreed with the findings and began to take corrective action with respect to both the perceived attitude problems towards women and the functions of the investigative arms of the Department of the Navy.<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1992-09-24 | title = Defense Department News Briefing | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193630/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>
The fallout from the incident resulted in a hard blow to the [[Naval aviation|naval aviation community]], where the promotions of many [[naval aviator]]s were put on hold. The common counterclaim from the other side of the aisle, as articulated by former Secretary of the Navy in the [[Reagan administration]] and [[naval flight officer]] [[John F. Lehman]], was that the naval aviation community had been unfairly subjected to a witch-hunt motivated by [[political correctness]], in effect killing its ''esprit de corps'', and by extension damaging its combat effectiveness.<ref name=\"Lehman:372\">[[#Lehman|Lehman]]: p. 372.</ref> During the [[Clinton administration]] in April 1993, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Les Aspin]] announced a new policy, which in effect made it possible to have female fighter pilots serving on aircraft carriers at sea and in other new positions (but still prohibited from serving in [[infantry]], etc.)
<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1993-04-28 | title = Women in Combat (Department of Defense briefing) | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193631/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>
Thus, the stage was set for the reality-based fictional drama, when Bellisario read in a newspaper about the forthcoming introduction of female fighter pilots on aircraft carriers.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>

While doing research on which organizational entities would partake in investigative efforts of crimes committed aboard Naval vessels, Bellisario found  the special agents of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] filled the police role, and the uniformed lawyers, in the Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, could alternate between the role of defense attorney, prosecutor, and field investigator. Bellisario chose to go ahead with the lawyers and remarked season six about the unique advantages it brought from a story-telling point of view: \"Unlike most [[legal drama|law shows]], I've got a detective, a prosecutor, and a defender.\"<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>

===Collaboration with the military===
[[File:RADM Donald Guter, JAGC, USN visited the JAG television series set, 2001-02-20.jpg|thumb|The then-[[Judge Advocate General of the Navy]], Rear Admiral Donald J. Guter (second from left), visiting the set, meeting with the cast during the shooting of \"[[JAG (season 6)#ep128|Liberty]]\" in 2001]]

Initially, the producers of ''JAG'' did not receive any co-operation from the Department of the Navy, due to sensitivity in light of all the accumulative negative publicity that had been generated from the [[Tailhook scandal]] and its aftermath.<ref name=\"Erickson:129\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 129.</ref> However, the lack of co-operation from the military was not a show-stopper, as the ''JAG'' production team, by virtue of being a [[Paramount Pictures]] production, had access to the [[stock footage]] of the motion pictures owned by the studio, which included many films with military content, such as ''[[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]]'', ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]].<ref name=\"Erickson:128\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 128.</ref>

In 1997, though, the naval services had begun to change their minds, and began to render support to the production team on a script-by-script basis. A primetime network series about Navy lawyers bringing out controversial subjects in a very public arena was apparently no longer an issue in itself, but as noted by Commander Bob Anderson of the Navy's [[Public affairs (military)|entertainment media liaison office]] in Los Angeles in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' interview: \"We're fine with that as long as the bad guys are caught and punished, and the institution of the Navy is not the bad guy\".<ref name=\"Erickson:129\"/>

===Ships===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Almost all episodes of the series feature scenes filmed aboard real United States Navy ships. The ship most widely used was {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}, in commission as a training carrier at the time. Most of the ''Nimitz''-class carriers also appear in one or several episodes. {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, and {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} were also used in the series.

USS ''Enterprise'' was used as the fictional USS ''Seahawk'' in many episodes. USS ''Forrestal'' and {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69|6}} were also used as the fictional ''Seahawk'', both in season four and for one episode each. For scenes filmed aboard ''Enterprise'', the whole crew wore caps reading ''USS Seahawk – CVN 65'' so they matched the ship's real hull number.

USS ''Forrestal'' was featured in many episodes, most prominently two in which she portrayed the fictional USS ''Reprisal''.  In these episodes, all crew members wore caps with the ''CV-35'' pennant number.  This number was intentionally out of sequence with the pennant numbers of active USN carriers at the time the series was filmed. CV-35 would have been the real pennant number of an ''Essex''-class carrier actually called ''Reprisal'', which was canceled during construction in 1945 when World War II ended, and broken up in 1949 after consideration had been given to completing her to a revised design roughly similar to that of {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}}.

Only six USN ships featured in the series were called by their real names: {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}, {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}}, {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}, {{USS|America|CV-66|6}}, {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}}, and {{USS|Belknap|CG-26|6}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' is mentioned in one of the season-three episodes, but never seen on screen. ''America'' is the murder scene in a season-three episode, but shots supposedly depicting her are in fact shots of ''Forrestal''. Real shots of ''Theodore Roosevelt'' in harbor are used in one episode of season one.

[[File:US Navy 050125-N-0685S-001 Crewmembers for the hit television show JAG set up for the next shot outside the Transient Aircraft Line on board Naval Air Station North Island, Calif.jpg|thumb|upright|Crewmembers set up for a shot at [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS North Island]] (2005)]]

Season-three opener \"Ghost Ship\" was filmed entirely aboard ''Hornet'' while she was laid up at Alameda Naval Air Station before being preserved as a museum ship. Part of the storyline in \"Ghost Ship\" deals with the final fate of ''Hornet''. It implies (though not explicitly stating it) she was eventually scrapped due to severe fire damage sustained during the course of the episode, contrary to her real-life fate as a national landmark. The subplot in \"Ghost Ship\" indicating that the ship's double hull had to be cut open from the inside to repair supposed damage to her bow during Vietnam was not at all correct with her service record.

''Coral Sea'' is also featured in the season-three episode \"Vanished\" and season-four episodes \"Angels 30\" and \"Shakedown\". As she had already been scrapped at the time the episodes supposedly took place, archival footage of ''Coral Sea'' was used, with other footage shot aboard ''Forrestal''. The majority of the exterior scenes from \"Angels 30\" were filmed aboard ''Forrestal'' and a few aboard ''Enterprise''.

''Belknap'' is mentioned in the season-four episode \"Going after Francesca\" as the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] flagship, a role she actually fulfilled in real life from 1986 until her decommissioning in 1994. ''Belknap'' had already been decommissioned and was laid up awaiting scrapping when the episode was filmed, allowing for actual exterior shots of the ship to be featured in the episode.

The series also includes appearances by {{sclass-|Tarawa|amphibious assault ship|1}}s, {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s, {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}s (in particular {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51|6}} itself during the opening credit montage), and {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|1}}s. In one of the episodes, the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] frigate {{ship|Spanish frigate|Santa María||2}} is used to depict a fictional USN ''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class ship (denoted by her NATO pennant number \"F 81\" painted under the bridge, instead of the U.S. practice of having a \"number only\" ID painted on the bow).

While most sea episodes are focused on aviation missions, several are based around submarine warfare: namely episodes 1:3, 2:6, 4:16, 5:22, 6:15, 7:14, 7:24, 8:7, 8:17, and 9:7.

===Series end===
[[File:JAGcoin.png|thumb|right|Harm (David James Elliott) and Mac (Catherine Bell) use a challenge coin to determine who will resign his or her commission.]]
In February 2005, David James Elliott announced he would leave the show at the end of the 10th season; the show was subsequently not renewed for an 11th season by the network.<ref name=\"Why JAG\">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title=Why 'JAG' came to an abrupt end|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 29, 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012052549/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show also introduced new younger characters, including former ''[[As the World Turns]]'' star [[Chris Beetem]], and [[Jordana Spiro]] from ''[[The Huntress (TV series)|The Huntress]]''.

The producers also considered relocating the fictional setting of the show, from Falls Church to [[Naval Base San Diego]]. An episode of the final season, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep222|JAG: San Diego]]\" had the main cast, excluding Harm, going to the San Diego naval base and working with the local JAG office there. Though it was reportedly considered as a pilot episode, as a reformat of the show aiming for a younger audience, CBS ultimately decided not to pursue a new series.

Nevertheless, CBS announced the cancellation of the show on April 4, 2005, after 10 seasons. The final episode, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep227|Fair Winds and Following Seas]]\", aired on April 29, 2005, and in which Harm and Mac are assigned different [[Military base|stations]]: Harm in [[London]], Mac in [[San Diego]]. They finally confront their feelings and decide to get married. The episode ends with Bud tossing a [[challenge coin]] to decide which one would give up his or her military career to be with the other. However, in keeping with ''JAG'' tradition, the outcome of the toss is never seen, as the screen fades to black, showing only the coin, which bears the inscription \"1995 – 2005\", the years the series spanned.

What happened is later revealed in the 2019 finale of the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|tenth season]] of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'', ''\"False Flag\"'', in which David James Elliott and Catherine Bell both appeared. Mac won the coin toss and Harm resigned his commission and moved with her to San Diego, but later they mutually ended their relationship and Harm rejoined the Navy and is currently serving as the [[Executive officer|XO]] of the (fictional) aircraft carrier, ''USS Allegiance''. Mac left the Marines to serve as Marine Liaison to the Secretary of State, a civilian position. Harm and Mac had not seen each other in 9 years until video conferencing with each other in their new roles. In the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 11)|eleventh season]] premiere, Harm and Mac reunite in person, share an embrace, and later renew a discussion of their relationship, once again without reaching a conclusion.

===''NCIS'' spin-off===
{{Main|NCIS (TV series)}}
In January 2003, CBS announced that Donald P. Bellisario was developing a ''JAG'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]],  around the work of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]].<ref name=\"Variety20030113\">{{cite web|title=CBS ‘Angel’ to fly home – Net also eyes 'JAG' spinoff|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=January 13, 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033839/http://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was aired in April 2003 in a two-part [[backdoor pilot]] in which Commander Rabb is arrested, but later vindicated as innocent, for the murder of Lieutenant Singer. The two episodes, titled \"[[Ice Queen (JAG)|Ice Queen]]\" and \"[[Meltdown (JAG)|Meltdown]]\", focused on the NCIS team, with most of the JAG regulars as supporting characters. Whereas the episodes of ''JAG'' are primarily oriented on a mixture of courtroom drama and military activities in the field, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' episodes are more focused, as the meaning of  the acronym suggests, on criminal investigations. ''NCIS'' also follows a different storytelling format from ''JAG'', emphasizing character humor to a larger extent than its parent program. ''NCIS'' later produced its own spin-offs, ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'', which shows a further departure from the styles and themes of ''JAG''.

The two episodes \"Ice Queen\" and \"Meltdown\" were edited down to a one-hour pilot film, which was then used to sell the idea of ''NCIS'' as a new series to CBS; the pilot used the title, \"NCIS – The Beginning\". It was later also used to introduce the show to CBS affiliates and advertisers.  It was only broadcast once and is not available on home video.

Excluding the backdoor pilot, few major characters from ''JAG'' have appeared in the ''NCIS'' series. Patrick Labyorteaux appeared briefly as Lieutenant Bud Roberts in the ''NCIS'' first-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep2|Hung Out to Dry]]\", and again – now with the rank of captain – in the season fourteen episode \"Rogue,\" advising the NCIS team on a legal issue. [[John M. Jackson]] returned in May 2013 as retired Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden, now a civilian attorney in the private sector hired by [[List of NCIS characters#Leon Vance|Director Vance]] to provide legal representation for [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs|Special Agent Gibbs]], in the season ten ''NCIS'' finale, \"[[Damned If You Do (NCIS)|Damned If You Do]]\".<ref name=tl>{{cite web|last=Roots|first=Kimberly|title=NCIS Exclusive: A JAG Favorite to Return in This Season's 'Nail-Biter' of a Finale|url=http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 12, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043344/http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Jackson has recurred as A.J. Chegwidden since the eighth season of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''. Chegwidden is a Vietnam-era compatriot of series regulars Hetty Lange ([[Linda Hunt]]) and Owen Granger ([[Miguel Ferrer]]). David James Elliot and Catherine Bell returned to their roles as Harmon Rabb and Sarah MacKenzie for the first time since ''JAG'' ended in the last two episodes of [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|the tenth season of ''NCIS: Los Angeles'']].<ref>\"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)#ep23|The Guardian]]\" and \"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)#ep24|False Flag]]\".</ref>

While several other actors who played major roles on ''JAG'' have also appeared on ''NCIS'', such as Scott Lawrence (Sturgis Turner on ''JAG''),<ref>Scott Lawrence played Captain Thomas Lind in the ''NCIS'' episode \"[[A Man Walks Into a Bar...]]\".</ref> Steven Culp (Clayton Webb on ''JAG''),<ref>Steven Culp played Commander William Skinner in the ''NCIS'' fifth-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 5)#ep100|Chimera]]\".</ref> Randy Vazquez (Victor Galindez on ''JAG''),<ref>Randy Vazquez played ATF Special Agent Phillip Caffey in the ''NCIS'' twelfth-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 12)#ep278|No Good Deed]]\".</ref> and [[Michael Bellisario]] ([[Mikey Roberts]] on ''JAG'');<ref>Recurring part as [[List of NCIS characters#Charles .22Chip.22 Sterling|Chip Sterling]] in four episodes (\"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep52|The Voyeur's Web]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep53|Honor Code]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep54|Under Covers]]\", and \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep55|Frame Up]]\") of the third season of ''NCIS''.</ref> they played completely different characters when appearing on ''NCIS''. Similarly, after [[Sean Murray (actor)|Sean Murray]] (Donald Bellisario's stepson) played a one-off Ensign character in ''JAG'' season 4, and the recurring character of Danny Walden in season 6, he joined the core cast of ''NCIS'' during the first season as Tim McGee, and is still on the show as of 2019.

First introduced in the NCIS back-door pilot, [[Alicia Coppola]] appeared as Navy judge advocate Lieutenant Commander Faith Coleman in several episodes of ''NCIS''.<ref>''NCIS'' episodes: \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep18|UnSEALeD]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 2)#7|Call of Silence]]\" and \"[[NCIS (season 2)#ep44|Hometown Hero]]\".</ref> [[Adam Baldwin]] played the same guest role, Navy SEAL Commander Michael Rainer, in one episode of each show.<ref>''JAG'': \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep195|Good Intentions]]\"'' NCIS'': \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep22|A Weak Link]]\" (first season).</ref>

===''First Monday'' cross-over===
''[[First Monday]]'' was a short-lived series co-created by Bellisario and [[Paul Levine]] about fictional [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices and their clerks, which aired in 2002 and starred [[James Garner]] and [[Joe Mantegna]]. The character of [[U.S. Senator]] Edward Sheffield ([[Dean Stockwell]]), who appeared in three episodes of that show, later became a recurring character on ''JAG'' as the new [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], starting in season eight.

===''Yes, Dear'' tribute===
The sitcom ''[[Yes, Dear]]'' did an episode called \"Let's Get Jaggy With It\" where Greg's father Tom ([[Tim Conway]]) wins a walk-on role on ''JAG''. Catherine Bell guest-starred as herself while David James Elliott, Patrick Labyorteaux, and Scott Lawrence guest-starred as their respective ''JAG'' characters.

==Home media==
On September 1, 1998, the pilot episode of ''JAG'' was released on [[VHS]] cassette in the U.S. by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]]. However, no further episodes of the series proper were released on any home entertainment media while the show was still in production, allegedly due to syndication deals made with several broadcasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |title=JAG faq |accessdate=2013-09-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305193454/http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}, Retrieved on 2013-09-17.</ref>

In the spring of 1996, NBC announced that the series had been canceled after finishing 79th in the ratings, leaving one episode unaired. In December 1996, the rival network CBS announced it had picked up the series as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired 15 new episodes as its second season. For several seasons, ''JAG'' climbed in the ratings and ultimately ran for nine additional seasons. ''JAG'' furthermore spawned the hit series ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'', which in turn led to spin-offs ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]''.

In total, 227 episodes were produced over 10 seasons. At the time of the original airing of its fifth season in the United States, ''JAG'' was seen in over 90 countries worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paramount.com/television/jag/abouttheshow/index.html |title=JAG – About the show |accessdate=2000-11-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001110063400/http://www.paramount.com/television/jag/abouttheshow/index.html |archivedate=November 10, 2000 }}.

Akin to ''[[Law & Order (TV series)|Law & Order]]'', the plots from many episodes were often \"[[ripped from the headlines]]\" with portions of the plot either resembling or referencing recognizable aspects of actual cases or incidents, such as the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] (\"[[List of JAG episodes#ep67|Act of Terror]]\" and \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep127|Valor]]\"), the [[Scott O'Grady|rescue of downed pilot Scott O'Grady]] (\"[[List of JAG episodes#ep13|Defensive Action]]\"), the [[Cavalese cable car disaster (1998)|Cavalese cable car disaster]] (\"[[List of JAG episodes#ep59|Clipped Wings]]\"), the [[USS Iowa turret explosion|USS ''Iowa'' turret explosion]] (\"[[List of JAG episodes#ep97|Into the Breech]]\"), and the [[Kelly Flinn incident]] (\"[[List of JAG episodes#ep39|The Court-Martial of Sandra Gilbert]]\").<ref name=\"2000pn3\"/>

While not part of the mission of its real-world counterpart, some of the main characters are at times also involved, directly and indirectly, in various [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] intelligence operations, often revolving around the recurring character CIA officer [[Clayton Webb]] (played by [[Steven Culp]]).

==Production==

===Background and development===
The creator of ''JAG'', Donald P. Bellisario, served for four years in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and after having worked his way up through advertising jobs, he landed his first network television job as a story editor for the World War II-era series ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'', where he got a habit of promoting a consistent promilitary stance in a business where he got the perception that \"antiwar\" and \"antisoldier\" mentality were the commonplace.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 127.</ref> The stereotype in the post-[[Vietnam war]] era of \"[[Vietnam Veteran#Negative stereotypes of Vietnam veterans and efforts to overcome|crazed Vietnam veterans]]\" was notably subverted, by not just one, but three of the main characters, in ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'', of which Bellisario was the co-creator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/> 
Following the cancellation of his series ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', Bellisario began working on a one-shot screenplay of a murder mystery aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, where the victim was a female aviator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>

The issue of whether or not to expand the options for women serving in the U.S. armed forces as fighter pilots and in other frontline assignments was a contentious social issue of the day. In 1991, a famous incident had occurred at the [[Tailhook Association]] [[Tailhook scandal|convention in Las Vegas]], where male naval aviators had behaved in manners inappropriate, if not criminal.  The follow-up criminal and other investigations by the [[Naval Investigative Service|then-named NIS]], the [[Naval Inspector General]], and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, were later heavily criticized by the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense]].  The  [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Acting Secretary of the Navy]] [[Sean O'Keefe]], to whom the report was delivered, agreed with the findings and began to take corrective action with respect to both the perceived attitude problems towards women and the functions of the investigative arms of the Department of the Navy.<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1992-09-24 | title = Defense Department News Briefing | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193630/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>
The fallout from the incident resulted in a hard blow to the [[Naval aviation|naval aviation community]], where the promotions of many [[naval aviator]]s were put on hold. The common counterclaim from the other side of the aisle, as articulated by former Secretary of the Navy in the [[Reagan administration]] and [[naval flight officer]] [[John F. Lehman]], was that the naval aviation community had been unfairly subjected to a witch-hunt motivated by [[political correctness]], in effect killing its ''esprit de corps'', and by extension damaging its combat effectiveness.<ref name=\"Lehman:372\">[[#Lehman|Lehman]]: p. 372.</ref> During the [[Clinton administration]] in April 1993, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Les Aspin]] announced a new policy, which in effect made it possible to have female fighter pilots serving on aircraft carriers at sea and in other new positions (but still prohibited from serving in [[infantry]], etc.)
<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1993-04-28 | title = Women in Combat (Department of Defense briefing) | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193631/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>
Thus, the stage was set for the reality-based fictional drama, when Bellisario read in a newspaper about the forthcoming introduction of female fighter pilots on aircraft carriers.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>

While doing research on which organizational entities would partake in investigative efforts of crimes committed aboard Naval vessels, Bellisario found  the special agents of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] filled the police role, and the uniformed lawyers, in the Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, could alternate between the role of defense attorney, prosecutor, and field investigator. Bellisario chose to go ahead with the lawyers and remarked season six about the unique advantages it brought from a story-telling point of view: \"Unlike most [[legal drama|law shows]], I've got a detective, a prosecutor, and a defender.\"<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>

===Collaboration with the military===
[[File:RADM Donald Guter, JAGC, USN visited the JAG television series set, 2001-02-20.jpg|thumb|The then-[[Judge Advocate General of the Navy]], Rear Admiral Donald J. Guter (second from left), visiting the set, meeting with the cast during the shooting of \"[[JAG (season 6)#ep128|Liberty]]\" in 2001]]

Initially, the producers of ''JAG'' did not receive any co-operation from the Department of the Navy, due to sensitivity in light of all the accumulative negative publicity that had been generated from the [[Tailhook scandal]] and its aftermath.<ref name=\"Erickson:129\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 129.</ref> However, the lack of co-operation from the military was not a show-stopper, as the ''JAG'' production team, by virtue of being a [[Paramount Pictures]] production, had access to the [[stock footage]] of the motion pictures owned by the studio, which included many films with military content, such as ''[[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]]'', ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]].<ref name=\"Erickson:128\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 128.</ref>

In 1997, though, the naval services had begun to change their minds, and began to render support to the production team on a script-by-script basis. A primetime network series about Navy lawyers bringing out controversial subjects in a very public arena was apparently no longer an issue in itself, but as noted by Commander Bob Anderson of the Navy's [[Public affairs (military)|entertainment media liaison office]] in Los Angeles in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' interview: \"We're fine with that as long as the bad guys are caught and punished, and the institution of the Navy is not the bad guy\".<ref name=\"Erickson:129\"/>

===Ships===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Almost all episodes of the series feature scenes filmed aboard real United States Navy ships. The ship most widely used was {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}, in commission as a training carrier at the time. Most of the ''Nimitz''-class carriers also appear in one or several episodes. {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, and {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} were also used in the series.

USS ''Enterprise'' was used as the fictional USS ''Seahawk'' in many episodes. USS ''Forrestal'' and {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69|6}} were also used as the fictional ''Seahawk'', both in season four and for one episode each. For scenes filmed aboard ''Enterprise'', the whole crew wore caps reading ''USS Seahawk – CVN 65'' so they matched the ship's real hull number.

USS ''Forrestal'' was featured in many episodes, most prominently two in which she portrayed the fictional USS ''Reprisal''.  In these episodes, all crew members wore caps with the ''CV-35'' pennant number.  This number was intentionally out of sequence with the pennant numbers of active USN carriers at the time the series was filmed. CV-35 would have been the real pennant number of an ''Essex''-class carrier actually called ''Reprisal'', which was canceled during construction in 1945 when World War II ended, and broken up in 1949 after consideration had been given to completing her to a revised design roughly similar to that of {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}}.

Only six USN ships featured in the series were called by their real names: {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}, {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}}, {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}, {{USS|America|CV-66|6}}, {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}}, and {{USS|Belknap|CG-26|6}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' is mentioned in one of the season-three episodes, but never seen on screen. ''America'' is the murder scene in a season-three episode, but shots supposedly depicting her are in fact shots of ''Forrestal''. Real shots of ''Theodore Roosevelt'' in harbor are used in one episode of season one.

[[File:US Navy 050125-N-0685S-001 Crewmembers for the hit television show JAG set up for the next shot outside the Transient Aircraft Line on board Naval Air Station North Island, Calif.jpg|thumb|upright|Crewmembers set up for a shot at [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS North Island]] (2005)]]

Season-three opener \"Ghost Ship\" was filmed entirely aboard ''Hornet'' while she was laid up at Alameda Naval Air Station before being preserved as a museum ship. Part of the storyline in \"Ghost Ship\" deals with the final fate of ''Hornet''. It implies (though not explicitly stating it) she was eventually scrapped due to severe fire damage sustained during the course of the episode, contrary to her real-life fate as a national landmark. The subplot in \"Ghost Ship\" indicating that the ship's double hull had to be cut open from the inside to repair supposed damage to her bow during Vietnam was not at all correct with her service record.

''Coral Sea'' is also featured in the season-three episode \"Vanished\" and season-four episodes \"Angels 30\" and \"Shakedown\". As she had already been scrapped at the time the episodes supposedly took place, archival footage of ''Coral Sea'' was used, with other footage shot aboard ''Forrestal''. The majority of the exterior scenes from \"Angels 30\" were filmed aboard ''Forrestal'' and a few aboard ''Enterprise''.

''Belknap'' is mentioned in the season-four episode \"Going after Francesca\" as the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] flagship, a role she actually fulfilled in real life from 1986 until her decommissioning in 1994. ''Belknap'' had already been decommissioned and was laid up awaiting scrapping when the episode was filmed, allowing for actual exterior shots of the ship to be featured in the episode.

The series also includes appearances by {{sclass-|Tarawa|amphibious assault ship|1}}s, {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s, {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}s (in particular {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51|6}} itself during the opening credit montage), and {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|1}}s. In one of the episodes, the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] frigate {{ship|Spanish frigate|Santa María||2}} is used to depict a fictional USN ''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class ship (denoted by her NATO pennant number \"F 81\" painted under the bridge, instead of the U.S. practice of having a \"number only\" ID painted on the bow).

While most sea episodes are focused on aviation missions, several are based around submarine warfare: namely episodes 1:3, 2:6, 4:16, 5:22, 6:15, 7:14, 7:24, 8:7, 8:17, and 9:7.

===Series end===
[[File:JAGcoin.png|thumb|right|Harm (David James Elliott) and Mac (Catherine Bell) use a challenge coin to determine who will resign his or her commission.]]
In February 2005, David James Elliott announced he would leave the show at the end of the 10th season; the show was subsequently not renewed for an 11th season by the network.<ref name=\"Why JAG\">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title=Why 'JAG' came to an abrupt end|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 29, 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012052549/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show also introduced new younger characters, including former ''[[As the World Turns]]'' star [[Chris Beetem]], and [[Jordana Spiro]] from ''[[The Huntress (TV series)|The Huntress]]''.

The producers also considered relocating the fictional setting of the show, from Falls Church to [[Naval Base San Diego]]. An episode of the final season, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep222|JAG: San Diego]]\" had the main cast, excluding Harm, going to the San Diego naval base and working with the local JAG office there. Though it was reportedly considered as a pilot episode, as a reformat of the show aiming for a younger audience, CBS ultimately decided not to pursue a new series.

Nevertheless, CBS announced the cancellation of the show on April 4, 2005, after 10 seasons. The final episode, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep227|Fair Winds and Following Seas]]\", aired on April 29, 2005, and in which Harm and Mac are assigned different [[Military base|stations]]: Harm in [[London]], Mac in [[San Diego]]. They finally confront their feelings and decide to get married. The episode ends with Bud tossing a [[challenge coin]] to decide which one would give up his or her military career to be with the other. However, in keeping with ''JAG'' tradition, the outcome of the toss is never seen, as the screen fades to black, showing only the coin, which bears the inscription \"1995 – 2005\", the years the series spanned.

What happened is later revealed in the 2019 finale of the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|tenth season]] of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'', ''\"False Flag\"'', in which David James Elliott and Catherine Bell both appeared. Mac won the coin toss and Harm resigned his commission and moved with her to San Diego, but later they mutually ended their relationship and Harm rejoined the Navy and is currently serving as the [[Executive officer|XO]] of the (fictional) aircraft carrier, ''USS Allegiance''. Mac left the Marines to serve as Marine Liaison to the Secretary of State, a civilian position. Harm and Mac had not seen each other in 9 years until video conferencing with each other in their new roles. In the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 11)|eleventh season]] premiere, Harm and Mac reunite in person, share an embrace, and later renew a discussion of their relationship, once again without reaching a conclusion.

===''NCIS'' spin-off===
{{Main|NCIS (TV series)}}
In January 2003, CBS announced that Donald P. Bellisario was developing a ''JAG'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]],  around the work of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]].<ref name=\"Variety20030113\">{{cite web|title=CBS ‘Angel’ to fly home – Net also eyes 'JAG' spinoff|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=January 13, 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033839/http://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was aired in April 2003 in a two-part [[backdoor pilot]] in which Commander Rabb is arrested, but later vindicated as innocent, for the murder of Lieutenant Singer. The two episodes, titled \"[[Ice Queen (JAG)|Ice Queen]]\" and \"[[Meltdown (JAG)|Meltdown]]\", focused on the NCIS team, with most of the JAG regulars as supporting characters. Whereas the episodes of ''JAG'' are primarily oriented on a mixture of courtroom drama and military activities in the field, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' episodes are more focused, as the meaning of  the acronym suggests, on criminal investigations. ''NCIS'' also follows a different storytelling format from ''JAG'', emphasizing character humor to a larger extent than its parent program. ''NCIS'' later produced its own spin-offs, ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'', which shows a further departure from the styles and themes of ''JAG''.

The two episodes \"Ice Queen\" and \"Meltdown\" were edited down to a one-hour pilot film, which was then used to sell the idea of ''NCIS'' as a new series to CBS; the pilot used the title, \"NCIS – The Beginning\". It was later also used to introduce the show to CBS affiliates and advertisers.  It was only broadcast once and is not available on home video.

Excluding the backdoor pilot, few major characters from ''JAG'' have appeared in the ''NCIS'' series. Patrick Labyorteaux appeared briefly as Lieutenant Bud Roberts in the ''NCIS'' first-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep2|Hung Out to Dry]]\", and again – now with the rank of captain – in the season fourteen episode \"Rogue,\" advising the NCIS team on a legal issue. [[John M. Jackson]] returned in May 2013 as retired Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden, now a civilian attorney in the private sector hired by [[List of NCIS characters#Leon Vance|Director Vance]] to provide legal representation for [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs|Special Agent Gibbs]], in the season ten ''NCIS'' finale, \"[[Damned If You Do (NCIS)|Damned If You Do]]\".<ref name=tl>{{cite web|last=Roots|first=Kimberly|title=NCIS Exclusive: A JAG Favorite to Return in This Season's 'Nail-Biter' of a Finale|url=http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 12, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043344/http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Jackson has recurred as A.J. Chegwidden since the eighth season of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''. Chegwidden is a Vietnam-era compatriot of series regulars Hetty Lange ([[Linda Hunt]]) and Owen Granger ([[Miguel Ferrer]]). David James Elliot and Catherine Bell returned to their roles as Harmon Rabb and Sarah MacKenzie for the first time since ''JAG'' ended in the last two episodes of [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|the tenth season of ''NCIS: Los Angeles'']].<ref>\"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)#ep23|The Guardian]]\" and \"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)#ep24|False Flag]]\".</ref>

While several other actors who played major roles on ''JAG'' have also appeared on ''NCIS'', such as Scott Lawrence (Sturgis Turner on ''JAG''),<ref>Scott Lawrence played Captain Thomas Lind in the ''NCIS'' episode \"[[A Man Walks Into a Bar...]]\".</ref> Steven Culp (Clayton Webb on ''JAG''),<ref>Steven Culp played Commander William Skinner in the ''NCIS'' fifth-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 5)#ep100|Chimera]]\".</ref> Randy Vazquez (Victor Galindez on ''JAG''),<ref>Randy Vazquez played ATF Special Agent Phillip Caffey in the ''NCIS'' twelfth-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 12)#ep278|No Good Deed]]\".</ref> and [[Michael Bellisario]] ([[Mikey Roberts]] on ''JAG'');<ref>Recurring part as [[List of NCIS characters#Charles .22Chip.22 Sterling|Chip Sterling]] in four episodes (\"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep52|The Voyeur's Web]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep53|Honor Code]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep54|Under Covers]]\", and \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep55|Frame Up]]\") of the third season of ''NCIS''.</ref> they played completely different characters when appearing on ''NCIS''. Similarly, after [[Sean Murray (actor)|Sean Murray]] (Donald Bellisario's stepson) played a one-off Ensign character in ''JAG'' season 4, and the recurring character of Danny Walden in season 6, he joined the core cast of ''NCIS'' during the first season as Tim McGee, and is still on the show as of 2019.

First introduced in the NCIS back-door pilot, [[Alicia Coppola]] appeared as Navy judge advocate Lieutenant Commander Faith Coleman in several episodes of ''NCIS''.<ref>''NCIS'' episodes: \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep18|UnSEALeD]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 2)#7|Call of Silence]]\" and \"[[NCIS (season 2)#ep44|Hometown Hero]]\".</ref> [[Adam Baldwin]] played the same guest role, Navy SEAL Commander Michael Rainer, in one episode of each show.<ref>''JAG'': \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep195|Good Intentions]]\"'' NCIS'': \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep22|A Weak Link]]\" (first season).</ref>

===''First Monday'' cross-over===
''[[First Monday]]'' was a short-lived series co-created by Bellisario and [[Paul Levine]] about fictional [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices and their clerks, which aired in 2002 and starred [[James Garner]] and [[Joe Mantegna]]. The character of [[U.S. Senator]] Edward Sheffield ([[Dean Stockwell]]), who appeared in three episodes of that show, later became a recurring character on ''JAG'' as the new [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], starting in season eight.

===''Yes, Dear'' tribute===
The sitcom ''[[Yes, Dear]]'' did an episode called \"Let's Get Jaggy With It\" where Greg's father Tom ([[Tim Conway]]) wins a walk-on role on ''JAG''. Catherine Bell guest-starred as herself while David James Elliott, Patrick Labyorteaux, and Scott Lawrence guest-starred as their respective ''JAG'' characters.

==Home media==
On September 1, 1998, the pilot episode of ''JAG'' was released on [[VHS]] cassette in the U.S. by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]]. However, no further episodes of the series proper were released on any home entertainment media while the show was still in production, allegedly due to syndication deals made with several broadcasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |title=JAG faq |accessdate=2013-09-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305193454/http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}, Retrieved on 2013-09-17.</ref>

The wearing of '''face masks during the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]]''' has received varying recommendations from different [[List of national public health agencies|public health agencies]] and [[governments]]. The topic has been a subject of debate, with public health agencies and governments disagreeing on a universal protocol for wearing face masks. Some groups are recommending that all members of the public wear masks, while others recommend that only [[COVID-19]] patients and their caretakers should wear masks. Additionally, public health agencies of different countries and territories have changed their recommendations regarding face masks over time.<ref name=\"mask_not_mask\"/> Face masks have been a subject of [[shortage]]s and also been made compulsory in some countries. 

Types of face masks, from least to most protective, include [[Cloth facemask|cloth facemasks]], medical (non-surgical) masks,<ref name=\"nhc_masks\" /><ref name=20200402businessinsider/> [[surgical masks]], and filtering facepiece [[respirator]]s such as [[N95 mask]]s and [[FFP mask]]s.

A [[cloth facemask]] is a mask made of common [[Textile|textiles]], usually [[cotton]], worn over the mouth and nose.  Unlike surgical masks and respirators, they are not subject to regulation, and there is currently little research or guidance on their effectiveness as a protective measure against [[Transmission (medicine)|infectious disease transmission]] or [[Particulates|particulate]] [[air pollution]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}  They were routinely used by healthcare workers starting from the late 19th century until the mid 20th century.

A [[surgical mask]] is a loose-fitting, [[Disposable product|disposable]] device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential [[Contamination|contaminants]] in the immediate environment. If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle [[Respiratory droplets|droplets]], splashes, [[Spray (liquid drop)|sprays]], or splatter that may contain [[Virus|viruses]] and [[bacteria]], keeping it from reaching the wearer's mouth and nose.  Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of the wearer's [[saliva]] and respiratory secretions to others.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks|title=N95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks)|last=|first=|date=2020-03-11|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|language=en|accessdate=2020-03-28}} {{PD-inline}}</ref> A surgical mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures. Surgical masks also do not provide complete protection from [[Pathogen|germs]] and other contaminants because of the loose fit between the surface of the face mask and the face. Surgical masks may be labeled as surgical, isolation, dental, or medical procedure masks.<ref name=\":2\" /> Surgical masks are made of a [[nonwoven fabric]] created using a [[melt blowing]] process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/05/811387424/face-masks-not-enough-are-made-in-america-to-deal-with-coronavirus|title=Not Enough Face Masks Are Made In America To Deal With Coronavirus|date=2020-03-05|website=NPR.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/09e13687-f7e1-485e-ba90-355959449c71|title=Chinese mask makers use loopholes to speed up regulatory approval|date=2020-04-01|website=Financial Times|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

An [[N95 mask]] is a particulate-filtering facepiece [[respirator]] that meets the N95 [[NIOSH air filtration rating|air filtration rating]] of the US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], meaning that it filters at least 95 percent of [[airborne particles]], while not resistant to [[oil]] like the P95.

=== World Health Organization ===
World Health Organization advice to the public in the context of COVID-19 endorsed the use of masks only under the following conditions:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks|title=Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: When and how to use masks|year=2020|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>{{quote frame|
* If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.
* Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing.
* Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based [[hand sanitizer]] or soap and water.
* If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommended in March 2020 that if neither respirators nor surgical masks are available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for healthcare workers to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks, though caution should be exercised when considering this option.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/crisis-alternate-strategies.html|title=Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Crisis/Alternate Strategies|last=|first=|date=2020-03-17|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>  In April 2020, the CDC recommended that the general public wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other [[social distancing]] measures are difficult to maintain such as, grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission, due to the significance of [[Asymptomatic carrier|asymptomatic]] and pre-symptomatic disease transmission.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html|title=Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19|last=|first=|date=2020-04-04|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-05}} {{PD-inline}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html|title=Recommendation Regarding the Use of Cloth Face Coverings, Especially in Areas of Significant Community-Based Transmission|last=|first=|date=2020-04-03|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>

== Rationale for wearing masks ==
[[File:Watson queue for face masks 20200130 DSCF2199 (49464278376).jpg|thumb|Queue to buy face masks in Hong Kong, January 30, 2020. Everyone in the line is already wearing a disposable medical mask.]]

Among the reasons cited by Chinese health officials for wearing masks even by healthy individuals are the following:<ref name=\"nhc_why\"/>

# Asymptomatic transmission. Many people can be infected without symptoms or only with mild symptoms.
# Impossibility of appropriate social distancing in many public places at all times.
# Cost-benefit mismatch. If only the infected individuals wear a mask, they would possibly have a negative incentive to do so. An infected individual might get nothing positive, but only bear the costs such as inconvenience, purchasing expenses and even prejudice.
# There is no shortage of masks supply in China, which has been producing 100 million masks per day since early March.

Leading microbiologist [[Yuen Kwok-yung]] from the [[University of Hong Kong]] cites a large [[viral load]] in [[sputum]] and [[saliva]] of an infected person and asymptomatic cases as the reasons why even healthy individuals should wear a mask.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Li|first1=Isabelle|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/exclusive-qa-with-hong-kong-microbiologist-yuen-kwok-yung-who-helped-confirm|title=Q&A with HK microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung who helped confirm coronavirus' human spread|date=March 10, 2020|work=[[The Straits Times]]|last2=Zuoyan|first2=Zhao}}</ref><ref name=\"hku_saliva\"/>

According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the [[University of Leeds]], \"Wearing a mask can reduce the propensity [of] people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200317-how-to-stop-touching-your-face|title=How to avoid touching your face so much|date=18 March 2020|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

The wearing of '''face masks during the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]]''' has received varying recommendations from different [[List of national public health agencies|public health agencies]] and [[governments]]. The topic has been a subject of debate, with public health agencies and governments disagreeing on a universal protocol for wearing face masks. Some groups are recommending that all members of the public wear masks, while others recommend that only [[COVID-19]] patients and their caretakers should wear masks. Additionally, public health agencies of different countries and territories have changed their recommendations regarding face masks over time.<ref name=\"mask_not_mask\"/> Face masks have been a subject of [[shortage]]s and also been made compulsory in some countries. 

Types of face masks, from least to most protective, include [[Cloth facemask|cloth facemasks]], medical (non-surgical) masks,<ref name=\"nhc_masks\" /><ref name=20200402businessinsider/> [[surgical masks]], and filtering facepiece [[respirator]]s such as [[N95 mask]]s and [[FFP mask]]s.

A [[surgical mask]] is a loose-fitting, [[Disposable product|disposable]] device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential [[Contamination|contaminants]] in the immediate environment. If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle [[Respiratory droplets|droplets]], splashes, [[Spray (liquid drop)|sprays]], or splatter that may contain [[Virus|viruses]] and [[bacteria]], keeping it from reaching the wearer's mouth and nose.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommended in March 2020 that if neither respirators nor surgical masks are available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for healthcare workers to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks, though caution should be exercised when considering this option.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/crisis-alternate-strategies.html|title=Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Crisis/Alternate Strategies|last=|first=|date=2020-03-17|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>  In April 2020, the CDC recommended that the general public wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other [[social distancing]] measures are difficult to maintain such as, grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission, due to the significance of [[Asymptomatic carrier|asymptomatic]] and pre-symptomatic disease transmission.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html|title=Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19|last=|first=|date=2020-04-04|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-05}} {{PD-inline}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html|title=Recommendation Regarding the Use of Cloth Face Coverings, Especially in Areas of Significant Community-Based Transmission|last=|first=|date=2020-04-03|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>

== Rationale for wearing masks ==
[[File:Watson queue for face masks 20200130 DSCF2199 (49464278376).jpg|thumb|Queue to buy face masks in Hong Kong, January 30, 2020. Everyone in the line is already wearing a disposable medical mask.]]

Among the reasons cited by Chinese health officials for wearing masks even by healthy individuals are the following:<ref name=\"nhc_why\"/>

# Asymptomatic transmission. Many people can be infected without symptoms or only with mild symptoms.
# Impossibility of appropriate social distancing in many public places at all times.
# Cost-benefit mismatch. If only the infected individuals wear a mask, they would possibly have a negative incentive to do so. An infected individual might get nothing positive, but only bear the costs such as inconvenience, purchasing expenses and even prejudice.
# There is no shortage of masks supply in China, which has been producing 100 million masks per day since early March.

Leading microbiologist [[Yuen Kwok-yung]] from the [[University of Hong Kong]] cites a large [[viral load]] in [[sputum]] and [[saliva]] of an infected person and asymptomatic cases as the reasons why even healthy individuals should wear a mask.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Li|first1=Isabelle|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/exclusive-qa-with-hong-kong-microbiologist-yuen-kwok-yung-who-helped-confirm|title=Q&A with HK microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung who helped confirm coronavirus' human spread|date=March 10, 2020|work=[[The Straits Times]]|last2=Zuoyan|first2=Zhao}}</ref><ref name=\"hku_saliva\"/>

According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the [[University of Leeds]], \"Wearing a mask can reduce the propensity [of] people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200317-how-to-stop-touching-your-face|title=How to avoid touching your face so much|date=18 March 2020|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

'''James Christopher Gaffigan''' (born July 7, 1966) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer and producer. He was raised in [[Chesterton, Indiana]]. His material is often about fatherhood, observations, laziness, and food. He is also regarded as a \"clean\" comic, using little profanity in his routines. He has had several successful comedy specials, including ''[[Jim Gaffigan: Mr. Universe|Mr. Universe]],'' ''Obsessed'', ''Cinco,'' and ''Quality Time'', all of which have received Grammy nominations.

His memoir, ''Dad Is Fat'' (2013) and his most recent book, ''Food: A Love Story'' (2014), are both published by [[Crown Publishers]]. He co-created and starred in a [[TV Land]] television series based on his life called ''[[The Jim Gaffigan Show]]''.
He collaborates extensively with his wife, actress [[Jeannie Gaffigan]],<ref name= NYTwedding>{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/style/weddings-celebrations-jeannie-noth-jim-gaffigan.html | title= WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS; Jeannie Noth, Jim Gaffigan| date= July 27, 2003 | access-date= July 17, 2016| work= The New York Times}}</ref> and together they have five children. They are [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]], a topic that comes up in his comedy, and live in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

==Career==

===Stand-up===
[[File:JimGaffiganMay2008.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Gaffigan performing in May 2009]]
Gaffigan moved to New York in 1990 to pursue comedy,<ref name=UTSanD /> a move that was inspired by his admiration for fellow [[Hoosier]] [[David Letterman]].<ref name=bigbreak/> He found a job in advertising,<ref name=steinberg/> and he would work during the day and take acting classes at night.<ref name=spin/><ref name=bigbreak/> His career began in earnest when a friend from the class dared him to take a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] seminar that required a live set at the end.<ref name=spin>{{cite web|url=http://www.laughspin.com/2005/11/28/jim-gaffigan/ |title=Jim Gaffigan |website=Laugh Spin |date=November 28, 2005 |accessdate=January 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202203300/http://www.laughspin.com/2005/11/28/jim-gaffigan/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref name= suewhite/>  He fell in love with stand-up,<ref name=spin/> and began to play comedy clubs nightly—after his evening acting classes—until the wee hours of the morning.<ref name=bigbreak>{{cite news| date= July 19, 2015| url= https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=424403663 |title= From Adman To Stand-Up: Jim Gaffigan's Transition Took A Few Good Naps| work=My Big Break| publisher= NPR | access-date= July 28, 2015}}</ref> He was often found sleeping on the job; his boss had to wake him up to fire him.<ref name=bigbreak/>

For the first seven years of his career, he tried various styles, ranging from angry comedy to impressions and voices. Also, live comedy was in decline following its peak of the 1980s, further affected by the increased popularity of [[cable television]].<ref name=spin/>  After periodically auditioning for ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' for six years,<ref>{{cite AV media |last1=Mazan |first1=Steve |last2=Fincioen |first2=Joke |last3=Messina |first3=Biagio |date=March 4, 2011 |title=Dying to Do Letterman |medium=Motion picture |language=English |url=http://www.dyingtodoletterman.com/ |access-date=September 21, 2018 |time=24:37-24:42 |quote=I had auditioned for Lettermen for, I don’t know, six years}}</ref> he then had a successful stand-up routine on the show, and his career took off.<ref name=bigbreak/>

Gaffigan's style is largely [[Observational comedy|observational]], and his principal topics relate to laziness, eating, and parenthood.  He is famous for his [[Hot Pocket]] routine, which was inspired by a commercial he saw that he mistook for a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch.<ref name=suewhite/>  Also, during his routines, he will sometimes perform [[soliloquy|soliloquies]] by using a high-pitched voice and—in the third-person—deliver negative feedback on his own performance, such as after making a diarrhea joke in his 2012 special \"Mr. Universe\" using the voice and saying \"Really, he’s using diarrhea jokes?\"<ref name=stevens/> He says \"that inside voice is my connection with the audience\".<ref name=suewhite/>

In an interview with the ''[[Duluth News-Tribune]]'', he explained that the voice was developed over time, beginning as a teenager when he would disarm people by talking for them in their presence.<ref name=bellamy/>  He also used it as a way to fend off hecklers earlier in his career, when he says that comedy clubs were more combative.<ref name=bellamy/> He cursed early in his career, and he added cursing to his comedy album ''Doing My Time'', at the request of his label, in the hopes of drawing more teenagers.<ref name=Schmidt>{{cite news| last= Schmidt| first= Alex |date= April 26, 2014| url= http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2014/04/the-10-trials-of-jim-gaffigan.html |title= The 10 Trials of Jim Gaffigan| work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]| access-date=July 29, 2015}}</ref> However, he has largely removed profanity from his routine, as he feels that his subject matter doesn't lend itself to cursing and that it reduced the effort he put into crafting his jokes.<ref name=Schmidt/><ref>{{cite news| last= Brouk| first= Tim |date= September 6, 2007| title= Jim Gaffigan returns to his old stomping grounds, Purdue| work= [[Journal and Courier]]| url= | pages=1, 2D| access-date= }}</ref> 

In 2004, Gaffigan's stand up material was featured in [[Comedy Central]]'s animated series ''Shorties Watchin' Shortie.'' October 2005, he filmed a live [[Comedy Central]] special that aired for the following January,<ref name=spin/> and became the comedy album/DVD ''[[Beyond the Pale (Jim Gaffigan album)|Beyond the Pale]]''.  The routine consisted primarily of material regarding food and American eating habits, and the comedian unknowingly predicted a future menu item at [[Dunkin Donuts]]—the 'glazed donut breakfast sandwich'—while commenting on the future of America's eating habits.<ref>{{cite news|title= Jim Gaffigan Predicted The Dunkin' Donuts Donut Sandwich | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/jim-gaffigan-predicted-dunkin-donut-sandwich_n_3574729.html#slide=1208178 |website=The Huffington Post |date=July 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 29, 2014 |first=Katla |last=McGlynn}}</ref> His 2009 album ''[[King Baby (Jim Gaffigan album)|King Baby]]'' was also a television special filmed in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]], at the end of his \"The Sexy Tour\". Comedy Central released ''King Baby'' on DVD. In a March 2009 interview on ''[[Anytime with Bob Kushell]]'', Gaffigan defended his naming of the tour, stating that he thought it would be funny that parents would be unsure about whether to bring their teenage children to the show.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat.

Prior to meeting his wife, actress Jeannie Noth, Gaffigan largely wrote alone.  However, while working on his first show, ''Welcome to New York'', he was overwhelmed and asked for input from her (then his friend). Although initially hesitant to have a collaborator, as their relationship grew, so did Noth's ability to write material for him.  Once they married, she left behind her work with her youth theater project (Shakespeare on the Playground) to devote herself to raising their expanding brood, and after a joke she wrote drew big laughs at a show, she and Jim began to collaborate more.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  She gradually transferred into the position of Jim's chief co-writer, and they are now full writing partners.  She has been a credited writer and/or executive producer on all his comedy endeavors since ''Beyond the Pale'', including his two books and television show.<ref name=katz/>  He also credits her with \"coaching\" him through his performance in ''That Championship Season''.<ref name=suewhite/>

He has had several successful comedy specials, including ''[[Jim Gaffigan: Mr. Universe|Mr. Universe]],'' ''Obsessed'', ''Cinco,'' and ''Quality Time'', all of which have received Grammy nominations.

His memoir, ''Dad Is Fat'' (2013) and his most recent book, ''Food: A Love Story'' (2014), are both published by [[Crown Publishers]]. He co-created and starred in a [[TV Land]] television series based on his life called ''[[The Jim Gaffigan Show]]''.

==Career==

===Stand-up===
[[File:JimGaffiganMay2008.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Gaffigan performing in May 2009]]
Gaffigan moved to New York in 1990 to pursue comedy,<ref name=UTSanD /> a move that was inspired by his admiration for fellow [[Hoosier]] [[David Letterman]].<ref name=bigbreak/> He found a job in advertising,<ref name=steinberg/> and he would work during the day and take acting classes at night.<ref name=spin/><ref name=bigbreak/> His career began in earnest when a friend from the class dared him to take a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] seminar that required a live set at the end.<ref name=spin>{{cite web|url=http://www.laughspin.com/2005/11/28/jim-gaffigan/ |title=Jim Gaffigan |website=Laugh Spin |date=November 28, 2005 |accessdate=January 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202203300/http://www.laughspin.com/2005/11/28/jim-gaffigan/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref name= suewhite/>  He fell in love with stand-up,<ref name=spin/> and began to play comedy clubs nightly—after his evening acting classes—until the wee hours of the morning.<ref name=bigbreak>{{cite news| date= July 19, 2015| url= https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=424403663 |title= From Adman To Stand-Up: Jim Gaffigan's Transition Took A Few Good Naps| work=My Big Break| publisher= NPR | access-date= July 28, 2015}}</ref> He was often found sleeping on the job; his boss had to wake him up to fire him.<ref name=bigbreak/>

For the first seven years of his career, he tried various styles, ranging from angry comedy to impressions and voices. Also, live comedy was in decline following its peak of the 1980s, further affected by the increased popularity of [[cable television]].<ref name=spin/>  After periodically auditioning for ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' for six years,<ref>{{cite AV media |last1=Mazan |first1=Steve |last2=Fincioen |first2=Joke |last3=Messina |first3=Biagio |date=March 4, 2011 |title=Dying to Do Letterman |medium=Motion picture |language=English |url=http://www.dyingtodoletterman.com/ |access-date=September 21, 2018 |time=24:37-24:42 |quote=I had auditioned for Lettermen for, I don’t know, six years}}</ref> he then had a successful stand-up routine on the show, and his career took off.<ref name=bigbreak/>

Gaffigan's style is largely [[Observational comedy|observational]], and his principal topics relate to laziness, eating, and parenthood.  He is famous for his [[Hot Pocket]] routine, which was inspired by a commercial he saw that he mistook for a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch.<ref name=suewhite/>  Also, during his routines, he will sometimes perform [[soliloquy|soliloquies]] by using a high-pitched voice and—in the third-person—deliver negative feedback on his own performance, such as after making a diarrhea joke in his 2012 special \"Mr. Universe\" using the voice and saying \"Really, he’s using diarrhea jokes?\"<ref name=stevens/> He says \"that inside voice is my connection with the audience\".<ref name=suewhite/>

In an interview with the ''[[Duluth News-Tribune]]'', he explained that the voice was developed over time, beginning as a teenager when he would disarm people by talking for them in their presence.<ref name=bellamy/>  He also used it as a way to fend off hecklers earlier in his career, when he says that comedy clubs were more combative.<ref name=bellamy/> He cursed early in his career, and he added cursing to his comedy album ''Doing My Time'', at the request of his label, in the hopes of drawing more teenagers.<ref name=Schmidt>{{cite news| last= Schmidt| first= Alex |date= April 26, 2014| url= http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2014/04/the-10-trials-of-jim-gaffigan.html |title= The 10 Trials of Jim Gaffigan| work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]| access-date=July 29, 2015}}</ref> However, he has largely removed profanity from his routine, as he feels that his subject matter doesn't lend itself to cursing and that it reduced the effort he put into crafting his jokes.<ref name=Schmidt/><ref>{{cite news| last= Brouk| first= Tim |date= September 6, 2007| title= Jim Gaffigan returns to his old stomping grounds, Purdue| work= [[Journal and Courier]]| url= | pages=1, 2D| access-date= }}</ref> 

In 2004, Gaffigan's stand up material was featured in [[Comedy Central]]'s animated series ''Shorties Watchin' Shortie.'' October 2005, he filmed a live [[Comedy Central]] special that aired for the following January,<ref name=spin/> and became the comedy album/DVD ''[[Beyond the Pale (Jim Gaffigan album)|Beyond the Pale]]''.  The routine consisted primarily of material regarding food and American eating habits, and the comedian unknowingly predicted a future menu item at [[Dunkin Donuts]]—the 'glazed donut breakfast sandwich'—while commenting on the future of America's eating habits.<ref>{{cite news|title= Jim Gaffigan Predicted The Dunkin' Donuts Donut Sandwich | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/jim-gaffigan-predicted-dunkin-donut-sandwich_n_3574729.html#slide=1208178 |website=The Huffington Post |date=July 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 29, 2014 |first=Katla |last=McGlynn}}</ref> His 2009 album ''[[King Baby (Jim Gaffigan album)|King Baby]]'' was also a television special filmed in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]], at the end of his \"The Sexy Tour\". Comedy Central released ''King Baby'' on DVD. In a March 2009 interview on ''[[Anytime with Bob Kushell]]'', Gaffigan defended his naming of the tour, stating that he thought it would be funny that parents would be unsure about whether to bring their teenage children to the show.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat.

[[File:Tenby Lifeboat sheds - geograph.org.uk - 242734.jpg|thumb|All weather lifeboat station with a slipway for launching.]]
[[File:Lifeboat Station - Porthcawl - geograph.org.uk - 1400792.jpg|thumb|Inshore lifeboat station, which uses a carriage to launch lifeboats.]]

'''Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stations''' are the bases for the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s fleet of search and rescue [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] that cover the coastal waters around the entire [[British Isles]], as well as major inland waterways.

The service was established in 1824 and is operated largely by volunteers. Its headquarters are at [[Poole]], [[Dorset]] and it is a registered charity in both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]].

== Key ==
=== Lifeboat types ===
{{Main|Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats}}
The types of boats provided at each station and the launching methods vary depending on local needs. If more than one boat is provided they are sometimes stationed in separate buildings at different locations in the same town. Current RNLI boats fall into three broad groups:
* All weather lifeboats (ALBs): {{Lbb|Mersey}}, {{Lbb|Severn}}, {{Lbb|Shannon}}, {{Lbb|Tamar}}, and {{Lbb|Trent}}.
* Inshore lifeboats (ILBs): {{Lbc|D|IB1}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 75}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 85}} and {{Lbc|E}}
* Hovercraft: [[RNLI hovercraft lifeboat|''H''-class]]

=== Launch methods ===
[[File:Minehead - launching D-712 (2).jpg|thumb|'Tooltrack' tractor launching an inshore lifeboat at {{lbs|Minehead}}]]
The principal launching methods are:

* Carriage – an ALB or ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by a tractor
* Davit – an ILB is lowered into the water by a crane
* Launchway – an ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by hand
* Moored afloat – an ALB or ILB is kept in the water alongside the lifeboat station or nearby, in which case a small boarding boat is provided so that the crew can reach it
* Slipway – an ALB slides down a slipway straight into the water
* Transporter – hovercraft are kept on the rear of trucks that can transport and offload them anywhere

=== Divisions ===
The following lists do not include the lifeguard patrolled beaches which also have their own equipment including [[Arancia-class lifeboat|inflatable boats]] and [[jetski]]s. The information is correct to 2009 unless noted otherwise,<ref>{{cite book |last= Denton |first= Tony |title= Handbook 2009 |year= 2009 |publisher= Lifeboat Enthusiasts Society |location= Shrewsbury |pages= 66–71 }}</ref> and is set out like the RNLI's divisional model. As far as possible it follows a clockwise route around the coast.

* East Division – [[East Anglia]] and South East England
* South Division – South West England and the [[Channel Islands]]
* West Division – [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]
* North Division – East and west coasts of northern England
* Scotland Division – [[Scotland]]
* Ireland Division – [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]

'''Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stations''' are the bases for the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s fleet of search and rescue [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] that cover the coastal waters around the entire [[British Isles]], as well as major inland waterways.

The service was established in 1824 and is operated largely by volunteers. Its headquarters are at [[Poole]], [[Dorset]] and it is a registered charity in both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]].

== Key ==
=== Lifeboat types ===
{{Main|Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats}}
The types of boats provided at each station and the launching methods vary depending on local needs. If more than one boat is provided they are sometimes stationed in separate buildings at different locations in the same town. Current RNLI boats fall into three broad groups:
* All weather lifeboats (ALBs): {{Lbb|Mersey}}, {{Lbb|Severn}}, {{Lbb|Shannon}}, {{Lbb|Tamar}}, and {{Lbb|Trent}}.
* Inshore lifeboats (ILBs): {{Lbc|D|IB1}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 75}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 85}} and {{Lbc|E}}
* Hovercraft: [[RNLI hovercraft lifeboat|''H''-class]]

=== Launch methods ===
[[File:Minehead - launching D-712 (2).jpg|thumb|'Tooltrack' tractor launching an inshore lifeboat at {{lbs|Minehead}}]]
The principal launching methods are:

* Carriage – an ALB or ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by a tractor
* Davit – an ILB is lowered into the water by a crane
* Launchway – an ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by hand
* Moored afloat – an ALB or ILB is kept in the water alongside the lifeboat station or nearby, in which case a small boarding boat is provided so that the crew can reach it
* Slipway – an ALB slides down a slipway straight into the water
* Transporter – hovercraft are kept on the rear of trucks that can transport and offload them anywhere

=== Divisions ===
The following lists do not include the lifeguard patrolled beaches which also have their own equipment including [[Arancia-class lifeboat|inflatable boats]] and [[jetski]]s. The information is correct to 2009 unless noted otherwise,<ref>{{cite book |last= Denton |first= Tony |title= Handbook 2009 |year= 2009 |publisher= Lifeboat Enthusiasts Society |location= Shrewsbury |pages= 66–71 }}</ref> and is set out like the RNLI's divisional model. As far as possible it follows a clockwise route around the coast.

* East Division – [[East Anglia]] and South East England
* South Division – South West England and the [[Channel Islands]]
* West Division – [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]
* North Division – East and west coasts of northern England
* Scotland Division – [[Scotland]]
* Ireland Division – [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]

[[File:Lifeboat Station - Porthcawl - geograph.org.uk - 1400792.jpg|thumb|Inshore lifeboat station, which uses a carriage to launch lifeboats.]]

'''Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stations''' are the bases for the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s fleet of search and rescue [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] that cover the coastal waters around the entire [[British Isles]], as well as major inland waterways.

The service was established in 1824 and is operated largely by volunteers. Its headquarters are at [[Poole]], [[Dorset]] and it is a registered charity in both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]].

=== Lifeboat types ===
{{Main|Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats}}
The types of boats provided at each station and the launching methods vary depending on local needs. If more than one boat is provided they are sometimes stationed in separate buildings at different locations in the same town. Current RNLI boats fall into three broad groups:
* All weather lifeboats (ALBs): {{Lbb|Mersey}}, {{Lbb|Severn}}, {{Lbb|Shannon}}, {{Lbb|Tamar}}, and {{Lbb|Trent}}.
* Inshore lifeboats (ILBs): {{Lbc|D|IB1}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 75}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 85}} and {{Lbc|E}}
* Hovercraft: [[RNLI hovercraft lifeboat|''H''-class]]

=== Launch methods ===
[[File:Minehead - launching D-712 (2).jpg|thumb|'Tooltrack' tractor launching an inshore lifeboat at {{lbs|Minehead}}]]
The principal launching methods are:

* Carriage – an ALB or ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by a tractor
* Davit – an ILB is lowered into the water by a crane
* Launchway – an ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by hand
* Moored afloat – an ALB or ILB is kept in the water alongside the lifeboat station or nearby, in which case a small boarding boat is provided so that the crew can reach it
* Slipway – an ALB slides down a slipway straight into the water
* Transporter – hovercraft are kept on the rear of trucks that can transport and offload them anywhere

=== Divisions ===
The following lists do not include the lifeguard patrolled beaches which also have their own equipment including [[Arancia-class lifeboat|inflatable boats]] and [[jetski]]s. The information is correct to 2009 unless noted otherwise,<ref>{{cite book |last= Denton |first= Tony |title= Handbook 2009 |year= 2009 |publisher= Lifeboat Enthusiasts Society |location= Shrewsbury |pages= 66–71 }}</ref> and is set out like the RNLI's divisional model. As far as possible it follows a clockwise route around the coast.

* East Division – [[East Anglia]] and South East England
* South Division – South West England and the [[Channel Islands]]
* West Division – [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]
* North Division – East and west coasts of northern England
* Scotland Division – [[Scotland]]
* Ireland Division – [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]

'''Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stations''' are the bases for the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s fleet of search and rescue [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] that cover the coastal waters around the entire [[British Isles]], as well as major inland waterways.

The service was established in 1824 and is operated largely by volunteers. Its headquarters are at [[Poole]], [[Dorset]] and it is a registered charity in both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]].

== Key ==
=== Lifeboat types ===
{{Main|Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats}}
The types of boats provided at each station and the launching methods vary depending on local needs. If more than one boat is provided they are sometimes stationed in separate buildings at different locations in the same town. Current RNLI boats fall into three broad groups:
* All weather lifeboats (ALBs): {{Lbb|Mersey}}, {{Lbb|Severn}}, {{Lbb|Shannon}}, {{Lbb|Tamar}}, and {{Lbb|Trent}}.
* Inshore lifeboats (ILBs): {{Lbc|D|IB1}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 75}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 85}} and {{Lbc|E}}
* Hovercraft: [[RNLI hovercraft lifeboat|''H''-class]]

=== Launch methods ===
[[File:Minehead - launching D-712 (2).jpg|thumb|'Tooltrack' tractor launching an inshore lifeboat at {{lbs|Minehead}}]]
The principal launching methods are:

* Carriage – an ALB or ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by a tractor
* Davit – an ILB is lowered into the water by a crane
* Launchway – an ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by hand
* Moored afloat – an ALB or ILB is kept in the water alongside the lifeboat station or nearby, in which case a small boarding boat is provided so that the crew can reach it
* Slipway – an ALB slides down a slipway straight into the water
* Transporter – hovercraft are kept on the rear of trucks that can transport and offload them anywhere

=== Divisions ===
The following lists do not include the lifeguard patrolled beaches which also have their own equipment including [[Arancia-class lifeboat|inflatable boats]] and [[jetski]]s. The information is correct to 2009 unless noted otherwise,<ref>{{cite book |last= Denton |first= Tony |title= Handbook 2009 |year= 2009 |publisher= Lifeboat Enthusiasts Society |location= Shrewsbury |pages= 66–71 }}</ref> and is set out like the RNLI's divisional model. As far as possible it follows a clockwise route around the coast.

* East Division – [[East Anglia]] and South East England
* South Division – South West England and the [[Channel Islands]]
* West Division – [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]
* North Division – East and west coasts of northern England
* Scotland Division – [[Scotland]]
* Ireland Division – [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]

==History==
Work on Julia was started in 2009, by Jeff Bezanson, [[Stefan Karpinski]], [[Viral B. Shah]], and [[Alan Edelman]], who set out to create a free language that was both high-level and fast. On 14 February 2012, the team launched a website with a blog post explaining the language's mission.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral Shah, Alan Edelman|title=Why We Created Julia|url=https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia|website=JuliaLang.org|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref>  In an interview with InfoWorld in April 2012, Karpinski said of the name \"Julia\": \"There's no good reason, really. It just seemed like a pretty name.\"<ref>[[Stefan Karpinski]], [https://www.infoworld.com/article/2616709/application-development/new-julia-language-seeks-to-be-the-c-for-scientists.html New Julia language seeks to be the C for scientists], [[InfoWorld]], 18 April 2012</ref> Bezanson said he chose the name on the recommendation of a friend.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Torre |first1=Charles |title=Stefan Karpinski and Jeff Bezanson on Julia |url=https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/Stefan-Karpinski-and-Jeff-Bezanson-Julia-Programming-Language |website=Channel 9 |publisher=MSDN |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

Since the 2012 launch, the Julia community has grown, with over 13,000,000 downloads {{as of|2020|03|lc=y}} (and is used at more than 1,500 universities),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://juliacomputing.com/|title=Julia Computing|website=juliacomputing.com||access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2019/11/07/november-newsletter.html|title=Newsletter November 2019|date=2019-11-07|website=juliacomputing.com|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2019/01/04/january-newsletter.html |title=Julia Computing Newsletter, Growth Metrics|website=juliacomputing.com|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref> The Official Julia Docker images, at [[Docker, Inc.|Docker Hub]], have seen over 4,000,000 downloads as of January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2019/01/04/january-newsletter.html|title=Newsletter January 2019|website=juliacomputing.com|date=4 January 2019|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref><ref>https://hub.docker.com/_/julia</ref> The JuliaCon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://juliacon.org/ |title=JuliaCon website |website=juliacon.org |accessdate=2018-05-10}}</ref> [[academic conference]] for Julia users and developers has been held annually since 2014.

Version 0.3 was released in August 2014, version 0.4 in October 2015, version 0.5 in October 2016,<ref>[https://julialang.org/blog/ The Julia Blog]</ref> and version 0.6 in June 2017.<ref>https://julialang.org/blog/2017/06/julia-0.6-release</ref>  Both Julia 0.7 (a useful release for testing packages, and for knowing how to upgrade them for 1.0<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://discourse.julialang.org/t/what-is-julia-0-7-how-does-it-relate-to-1-0/9994|title=What is Julia 0.7?

Work on Julia 0.7 was a \"huge undertaking\" (e.g., because of \"entirely new optimizer\"), and some changes were made to semantics, e.g. the [[iteration]] interface was simplified;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://julialang.org/blog/2018/07/iterators-in-julia-0.7 |title=Writing Iterators in Julia 0.7 |authors=Eric Davies |website=julialang.org |access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref> and the syntax changed a little (with the syntax now stable, and same for 1.x and 0.7).

The release candidate for Julia 1.0 (Julia 1.0.0-rc1) was released on 7 August 2018, and the final version a day later (and by now, Julia 1.0.x are the oldest versions still supported, having [[long-term support]]; for at least a year). Julia 1.1 was released in January 2019 with, e.g., a new \"exception stack\" language feature. Bugfix releases are expected roughly monthly, for 1.4.x and 1.0.x and Julia 1.0.1 up to 1.0.5 have followed that schedule. Julia 1.2 was released in August 2019, and it has e.g. some built-in support for web browsers (for testing if running in [[JavaScript]] VM),<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sys.isjsvm([os])|date=2019-08-20|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/75c10e435b2b9c947422ad38fa0b020595d3f747/base/sysinfo.jl#L401|quote=Predicate for testing if Julia is running in a JavaScript VM (JSVM), including e.g. a WebAssembly JavaScript embedding in a web browser.|publisher=The Julia Language|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> and Julia 1.4 in March 2020 (and with it Julia 1.3.x, 1.2.x and Julia 1.1.x releases are no longer maintained).

===Notable uses===
Julia has attracted some high-profile users, from investment manager [[BlackRock]], which uses it for [[time-series analytics]], to the British insurer [[Aviva]], which uses it for [[risk calculations]]. In 2015, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] used Julia to make models of the United States economy, noting that the language made model estimation \"about 10 times faster\" than its previous [[MATLAB]] implementation. Julia's co-founders established Julia Computing in 2015 to provide paid support, training, and consulting services to clients, though Julia remains free to use.

According to the official website, the main features of the language are:

* [[Multiple dispatch]]: providing ability to define function behavior across many combinations of argument types
* [[Dynamic type]] system: types for documentation, optimization, and dispatch
* Good performance, approaching that of [[Type system|statically-typed]] languages like C
* A built-in [[package manager]]

Multiple dispatch (also termed [[multimethod]]s in Lisp) is a [[generalization]] of [[single dispatch]]&nbsp;— the [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic mechanism]] used in common [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) languages&nbsp;— that uses [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]]. In Julia, all concrete types are [[subtyping|subtypes]] of abstract types, directly or indirectly subtypes of the ''Any'' type, which is the top of the type hierarchy. Concrete types can not themselves be subtyped the way they can in other languages; composition is used instead (see also [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)#Inheritance vs subtyping|inheritance vs subtyping]]).

Julia draws significant inspiration from various dialects of Lisp<!-- Karpinski: \"In short, I would describe it as a Lisp with Matlab-like syntax\" https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/pv3k9/why_we_created_julia_a_new_programming_language/ -->, including [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Common Lisp]], and it shares many features with [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]], also a multiple-dispatch-oriented dynamic language (which features an [[ALGOL]]-like [[Free-form language|free-form]] [[Infix notation|infix]] syntax rather than a Lisp-like prefix syntax, while in Julia \"everything\"<ref name=\"Learn Julia in Y\">{{cite web|url=https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/ |title=Learn Julia in Y Minutes |website=Learnxinyminutes.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-31}}</ref> is an [[Expression (computer science)|expression]]), and with [[Fortress (programming language)|Fortress]], another numerical programming language (which features multiple dispatch and a sophisticated parametric type system). While [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS) adds multiple dispatch to Common Lisp, not all functions are generic functions.

In Julia, Dylan, and Fortress extensibility is the default, and the system's built-in functions are all generic and extensible. In Dylan, multiple dispatch is as fundamental as it is in Julia: all user-defined functions and even basic built-in operations like <code>+</code> are generic. Dylan's type system, however, does not fully support parametric types, which are more typical of the [[Generational list of programming languages#ML based|ML lineage of languages]]. By default, CLOS does not allow for dispatch on Common Lisp's parametric types; such extended dispatch semantics can only be added as an extension through the [[Common Lisp Object System#Metaobject Protocol|CLOS Metaobject Protocol]]. By convergent design, Fortress also features multiple dispatch on parametric types; unlike Julia, however, Fortress is statically rather than dynamically typed, with separate compiling and executing phases. The language features are summarized in the following table:

{| class=\"wikitable\"
|-
! [[Programming language|Language]] !! [[Type system]] !! [[Generic function]]s !! [[Parametric polymorphism|Parametric types]]
|-
| Julia || Dynamic || Default || Yes
|-
| [[Common Lisp]] || Dynamic || Opt-in || Yes (but no dispatch)
|-
| [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]] || Dynamic || Default || Partial (no dispatch)
|-
| [[Fortress (programming language)|Fortress]] || Static || Default || Yes
|}

By default, the Julia runtime must be pre-installed as user-provided source code is run. Alternatively, a standalone [[executable]] that needs no Julia source code can be built with ''ApplicationBuilder.jl''<ref>{{Cite web|last=Daly|first=Nathan|title=GitHub - NHDaly/ApplicationBuilder.jl: Compile, bundle, and release julia software.|date=2019-02-13|url=https://github.com/NHDaly/ApplicationBuilder.jl|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> and ''PackageCompiler.jl''.<ref>{{cite web|title=GitHub - JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl: Compile your Julia Package.|date=2019-02-14|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl|publisher=The Julia Language|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref><!--

Julia's [[Macro (computer science)#Syntactic macros|syntactic macros]] (used for [[metaprogramming]]), like Lisp macros, are more powerful than [[Macro (computer science)#Text-substitution macros|text-substitution macros]] used in the [[preprocessor]] of some other languages such as C, because they work at the level of [[abstract syntax tree]]s (ASTs). Julia's macro system is [[hygienic macro|hygienic]], but also supports deliberate capture when desired (like for [[anaphoric macro]]s) using the <code>esc</code> construct.

==Interaction==
The Julia official distribution includes a \"full-featured interactive command-line REPL\" ([[read–eval–print loop]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/|title=The Julia REPL · The Julia Language|website=docs.julialang.org|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> with a searchable history, [[tab-completion]], many helpful keybindings, and dedicated help and [[shell (computing)|shell]] modes;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/The_REPL|title=Introducing Julia/The REPL - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|quote=you can install the Julia package OhMyREPL.jl (https://github.com/KristofferC/OhMyREPL.jl) which lets you customize the REPL's appearance and behaviour|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> which can be used to experiment and test code quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/|title=Getting Started · The Julia Language|website=docs.julialang.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref> The following fragment represents a sample session example where strings are concatenated automatically by println:<ref>See also: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/strings/ for string interpolation and the <code>string(greet, \", \", whom, \".\\n\")</code> example for preferred ways to concatenate strings. <!--While the <code>+</code> operator is not used for string concatenation, it could easily be defined to do so.--> Julia has the println and print functions, but also a @printf macro (i.e., not in function form) to eliminate run-time overhead of formatting (unlike the same function in C).</ref>

<source lang=\"jlcon\">
julia> p(x) = 2x^2 + 1; f(x, y) = 1 + 2p(x)y
julia> println(\"Hello world!\", \" I'm on cloud \", f(0, 4), \" as Julia supports recognizable syntax!\")
Hello world! I'm on cloud 9 as Julia supports recognizable syntax!
</source>

The REPL gives user access to the system shell and to help mode, by pressing <code>;</code> or <code>?</code> after the prompt (preceding each command), respectively. It also keeps the history of commands, including between sessions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Julia Documentation|url=https://docs.julialang.org|website=JuliaLang.org|accessdate=18 November 2014}}</ref> Code that can be tested inside the Julia's interactive section or saved into a file with a <code>.jl</code> extension and run from the command line by typing:<ref name=\"Learn Julia in Y\"/>

<source lang=\"console\">
 $ julia <filename>
</source>

Julia is supported by [[Jupyter]], an online interactive \"notebooks\" environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jupyter.org/ |title=Project Jupyter}}</ref>

=== Use with other languages ===
Julia is in practice [[interoperability|interoperable]] with many languages. Julia's <source lang=\"julia\" inline>ccall</source> keyword is used to call C-exported or Fortran shared library functions individually.

Julia has support for [[Unicode 12.1]] (support for current Unicode 13.0 has been implemented<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/JuliaStrings/utf8proc/pull/179|title=Unicode 13 support by stevengj · Pull Request #179 · JuliaStrings/utf8proc|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> for Julia 1.5), which added only one letter since Unicode 12.0,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/32002|title=support for Unicode 12.1.0 by stevengj · Pull Request #32002 · JuliaLang/julia|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref> with [[UTF-8]] used for strings (by default) and for Julia source code (only allowing legal UTF-8 in the latest version), meaning also allowing as an option common math symbols for many operators, such as ∈ for the <code>in</code> operator.

Julia has packages supporting markup languages such as [[HTML]] (and also for [[HTTP]]), [[XML]], [[JSON]] and [[BSON]], and for [[database]]s and Web use in general.

== Usage ==
Libraries such as [[Flux (machine-learning framework)|Flux]] and [[Knet (machine-learning framework)|Knet]] implement complete machine-learning frameworks written completely in Julia. [[Apache MXNet]] and [[TensorFlow]] are also available through wrapper libraries. [[Turing (probabilistic programming)|Turing]] and [[Gen (probabilistic programming)|Gen]] implement general-purpose [[probabilistic programming]] languages into Julia. [[Pharmacokinetics|Pharmacokinetic]] modeling and simulations are made available through the [[Pumas (pharmaceutical modeling)|Pumas]] suite.

==Implementation==
Julia's core is implemented in Julia and [[C (programming language)|C]]<!--C99, except for 0.4 needing C11 because of static asserts-->, together with [[C++]] for the [[LLVM]] dependency. The parsing and code-lowering are implemented in FemtoLisp, a [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] dialect.<ref name=\"JeffBezanson 2019\">{{cite web | author=JeffBezanson | title=JeffBezanson/femtolisp | website=GitHub | date=June 6, 2019 | url=https://github.com/JeffBezanson/femtolisp | access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref> The LLVM compiler infrastructure project is used as the [[Compiler#Back end|back end]] for generation of [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] or [[32-bit]] optimized [[machine code]] depending on the platform Julia runs on. With some exceptions (e.g., [[PCRE]]), the [[standard library]] is implemented in Julia. The most notable aspect of Julia's implementation is its speed, which is often within a factor of two relative to fully optimized C code (and thus often an order of magnitude faster than Python or [[R (programming language)|R]]).<ref name=\"Julia-TR\">{{cite web

===Current and future platforms===
While Julia uses JIT,<!-- Viral states \"Julia no longer uses the MCJIT in LLVM\" so this link is probably misleading:
<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/5208
|title=Support MCJIT
|website=Github.com
|accessdate=26 May 2015
}}</ref> --> Julia generates native machine code directly, before a function is first run (not [[bytecode]]s that are run on a [[virtual machine]] (VM) or translated as the bytecode is running, as with, ''e.g.'', Java; the [[JVM]] or [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] in Android).

Julia has four support tiers,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://julialang.org/downloads/#support-tiers|title=Julia Downloads|website=julialang.org|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> and currently supports all [[x86-64]] processors, that are [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] (and is more [[program optimization|optimized]] for the latest generations) and all [[IA-32]] (\"x86\") processors except for decades old ones, i.e., in [[32-bit]] mode (\"i686\", excepting CPUs from the pre-[[Pentium 4]]-era); and supports more in lower tiers, e.g., ARM has tier 2 support: Julia \"fully supports ARMv8 (AArch64) processors, and supports ARMv7 and ARMv6 (AArch32) with some caveats.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=julia/arm.md|date=2019-11-29|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/doc/build/arm.md|publisher=The Julia Language|quote=A list of [https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/labels/arm known issues] for ARM is available.|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> [[CUDA]] (i.e. Nvidia GPUs; implementing [[Parallel Thread Execution|PTX]]) has tier 1 support, with the help of an [https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDAnative.jl external package]. There are also additionally packages supporting other accelerators, such as Google's [[tensor processing unit|TPU]]s,<ref>{{Citation|title=Julia on TPUs|date=2019-11-26|url=https://github.com/JuliaTPU/XLA.jl|publisher=JuliaTPU|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> and AMD's GPUs also have support with e.g. [[OpenCL]]. Julia's downloads page provides [[executable]]s (and source) for all the officially supported platforms.

On some platforms, Julia may need to be compiled from [[source code]] (e.g., the original [[Raspberry Pi]]), with specific build options. Julia has been \"successfully built\" <!--on the following ARMv8 devices:

* [https://www.nvidia.com/object/embedded-systems-dev-kits-modules.html nVidia Jetson TX1 & TX2];
* [https://www.apm.com/products/data-center/x-gene-family/x-gene/ X-Gene 1];
* [https://softiron.com/products/overdrive-3000/ Overdrive 3000];
* [https://www.cavium.com/ThunderX_ARM_Processors.html Cavium ThunderX]-->
on several ARM platforms, up to, e.g., \"ARMv8 Data Center & Cloud Processors\", such as [https://www.cavium.com/ThunderX_ARM_Processors.html Cavium ThunderX] (first ARM with 48 cores). PowerPC (64-bit) has tier 3 support, meaning it \"may or may not build\".

==History==
Work on Julia was started in 2009, by Jeff Bezanson, [[Stefan Karpinski]], [[Viral B. Shah]], and [[Alan Edelman]], who set out to create a free language that was both high-level and fast. On 14 February 2012, the team launched a website with a blog post explaining the language's mission.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral Shah, Alan Edelman|title=Why We Created Julia|url=https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia|website=JuliaLang.org|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref>  In an interview with InfoWorld in April 2012, Karpinski said of the name \"Julia\": \"There's no good reason, really. It just seemed like a pretty name.\"<ref>[[Stefan Karpinski]], [https://www.infoworld.com/article/2616709/application-development/new-julia-language-seeks-to-be-the-c-for-scientists.html New Julia language seeks to be the C for scientists], [[InfoWorld]], 18 April 2012</ref> Bezanson said he chose the name on the recommendation of a friend.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Torre |first1=Charles |title=Stefan Karpinski and Jeff Bezanson on Julia |url=https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/Stefan-Karpinski-and-Jeff-Bezanson-Julia-Programming-Language |website=Channel 9 |publisher=MSDN |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

Since the 2012 launch, the Julia community has grown, with over 13,000,000 downloads {{as of|2020|03|lc=y}} (and is used at more than 1,500 universities),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://juliacomputing.com/|title=Julia Computing|website=juliacomputing.com||access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2019/11/07/november-newsletter.html|title=Newsletter November 2019|date=2019-11-07|website=juliacomputing.com|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2019/01/04/january-newsletter.html |title=Julia Computing Newsletter, Growth Metrics|website=juliacomputing.com|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref> The Official Julia Docker images, at [[Docker, Inc.|Docker Hub]], have seen over 4,000,000 downloads as of January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2019/01/04/january-newsletter.html|title=Newsletter January 2019|website=juliacomputing.com|date=4 January 2019|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref><ref>https://hub.docker.com/_/julia</ref> The JuliaCon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://juliacon.org/ |title=JuliaCon website |website=juliacon.org |accessdate=2018-05-10}}</ref> [[academic conference]] for Julia users and developers has been held annually since 2014.

Version 0.3 was released in August 2014, version 0.4 in October 2015, version 0.5 in October 2016,<ref>[https://julialang.org/blog/ The Julia Blog]</ref> and version 0.6 in June 2017.<ref>https://julialang.org/blog/2017/06/julia-0.6-release</ref>  Both Julia 0.7 (a useful release for testing packages, and for knowing how to upgrade them for 1.0<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://discourse.julialang.org/t/what-is-julia-0-7-how-does-it-relate-to-1-0/9994|title=What is Julia 0.7?

Work on Julia 0.7 was a \"huge undertaking\" (e.g., because of \"entirely new optimizer\"), and some changes were made to semantics, e.g. the [[iteration]] interface was simplified;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://julialang.org/blog/2018/07/iterators-in-julia-0.7 |title=Writing Iterators in Julia 0.7 |authors=Eric Davies |website=julialang.org |access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref> and the syntax changed a little (with the syntax now stable, and same for 1.x and 0.7).

The release candidate for Julia 1.0 (Julia 1.0.0-rc1) was released on 7 August 2018, and the final version a day later (and by now, Julia 1.0.x are the oldest versions still supported, having [[long-term support]]; for at least a year). Julia 1.1 was released in January 2019 with, e.g., a new \"exception stack\" language feature. Bugfix releases are expected roughly monthly, for 1.4.x and 1.0.x and Julia 1.0.1 up to 1.0.5 have followed that schedule. Julia 1.2 was released in August 2019, and it has e.g. some built-in support for web browsers (for testing if running in [[JavaScript]] VM),<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sys.isjsvm([os])|date=2019-08-20|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/75c10e435b2b9c947422ad38fa0b020595d3f747/base/sysinfo.jl#L401|quote=Predicate for testing if Julia is running in a JavaScript VM (JSVM), including e.g. a WebAssembly JavaScript embedding in a web browser.|publisher=The Julia Language|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> and Julia 1.4 in March 2020 (and with it Julia 1.3.x, 1.2.x and Julia 1.1.x releases are no longer maintained). Julia 1.3 added e.g. composable multi-threaded parallelism and a binary artifacts system for Julia packages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://julialang.org/blog/2019/11/artifacts|title=The Julia Language|others=Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral Shah, Alan Edelman, et al <!--|others=et al |authors5=et al-->|website=julialang.org|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> 

Julia 1.4 allowed better syntax for array indexing to handle e.g. [[zero-based_numbering#Usage_in_programming_languages|0-based]] arrays, with {{code|A[begin+1]}} for '''second''' element of array A.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/33946|title=support a[begin] for a[firstindex(a)] by stevengj · Pull Request #33946 · JuliaLang/julia|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> It also changed the memory model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/32448|title=For structs with all isbits or isbitsunion fields, allow them to be s<!--…-->tored inline in arrays <!--by quinnj--> · Pull Request #32448 · JuliaLang/julia|author=quinnj|quote=I still keep running into problems that this causes internally because it was a breaking change that changes assumptions made by some users and inference/codegen.|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

===Notable uses===
Julia has attracted some high-profile users, from investment manager [[BlackRock]], which uses it for [[time-series analytics]], to the British insurer [[Aviva]], which uses it for [[risk calculations]]. In 2015, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] used Julia to make models of the United States economy, noting that the language made model estimation \"about 10 times faster\" than its previous [[MATLAB]] implementation. Julia's co-founders established Julia Computing in 2015 to provide paid support, training, and consulting services to clients, though Julia remains free to use.

According to the official website, the main features of the language are:

* [[Multiple dispatch]]: providing ability to define function behavior across many combinations of argument types
* [[Dynamic type]] system: types for documentation, optimization, and dispatch
* Good performance, approaching that of [[Type system|statically-typed]] languages like C
* A built-in [[package manager]]
* [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]-like macros and other [[metaprogramming]] facilities
* Call [[Python (programming language)|Python]] functions: use the PyCall package{{Efn|For calling the newer [[Python 3]] (the older default to call Python 2, is also still supported)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl |title=PyCall.jl |work=stevengj |publisher=github.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-users/lDM7-YXT2LU |title=Using PyCall in julia on Ubuntu with python3 |work=julia-users at Google Groups|quote=to import modules (e.g., python3-numpy)}}</ref> <!--([[PyPy]] and e.g. [[PHP]] was/is supported<ref name=\"Polyglot\">{{cite web|url=https://gitlab.com/wavexx/Polyglot.jl|title=wavexx / Polyglot.jl|website=GitLab|language=en|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref> for Julia 0.5 (PyPy should work; supported by python-bond that Polyglot.jl is based on); [[Jython]] support is not confirmed, but since JavaCall.jl allows calling Java (and thus Scala) I assume also Jython.)--> and calling in the other direction, from Python to Julia, is also supported with ''pyjulia''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/JuliaPy/pyjulia |title=python interface to julia}}</ref> 
<!--
It is not like Polyglot. jl does not support this for older Julia (and also interesting project to support other languages, e.g., PHP), but it has not been upgraded for Julia 1.0: Even calling [[recursive]]ly (back and forth) between these languages is possible, without (or with) using ''Polyglot.jl'',<ref name=\"Polyglot\"/> that supports additional languages to Python. 
-->

}}
* Call [[C (programming language)|C]] functions directly: no wrappers or special [[application programming interface|APIs]]
* Powerful [[shell (computing)|shell]]-like abilities to manage other processes
* Designed for [[Parallel computing|parallel]] and [[distributed computing]]
* [[Coroutine|Coroutines]]: lightweight [[Green threads|''green'' threading]]
* User-defined types are as fast and compact as built-ins
* Automatic generation of efficient, specialized code for different argument types
* Elegant and extensible conversions and promotions for numeric and other types
* Efficient support for [[Unicode]], including but not limited to [[UTF-8]]

Multiple dispatch (also termed [[multimethod]]s in Lisp) is a [[generalization]] of [[single dispatch]]&nbsp;— the [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic mechanism]] used in common [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) languages&nbsp;— that uses [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]]. In Julia, all concrete types are [[subtyping|subtypes]] of abstract types, directly or indirectly subtypes of the ''Any'' type, which is the top of the type hierarchy. Concrete types can not themselves be subtyped the way they can in other languages; composition is used instead (see also [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)#Inheritance vs subtyping|inheritance vs subtyping]]).

Julia draws significant inspiration from various dialects of Lisp<!-- Karpinski: \"In short, I would describe it as a Lisp with Matlab-like syntax\" https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/pv3k9/why_we_created_julia_a_new_programming_language/ -->, including [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Common Lisp]], and it shares many features with [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]], also a multiple-dispatch-oriented dynamic language (which features an [[ALGOL]]-like [[Free-form language|free-form]] [[Infix notation|infix]] syntax rather than a Lisp-like prefix syntax, while in Julia \"everything\"<ref name=\"Learn Julia in Y\">{{cite web|url=https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/ |title=Learn Julia in Y Minutes |website=Learnxinyminutes.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-31}}</ref> is an [[Expression (computer science)|expression]]), and with [[Fortress (programming language)|Fortress]], another numerical programming language (which features multiple dispatch and a sophisticated parametric type system). While [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS) adds multiple dispatch to Common Lisp, not all functions are generic functions.

In Julia, Dylan, and Fortress extensibility is the default, and the system's built-in functions are all generic and extensible. In Dylan, multiple dispatch is as fundamental as it is in Julia: all user-defined functions and even basic built-in operations like <code>+</code> are generic. Dylan's type system, however, does not fully support parametric types, which are more typical of the [[Generational list of programming languages#ML based|ML lineage of languages]]. By default, CLOS does not allow for dispatch on Common Lisp's parametric types; such extended dispatch semantics can only be added as an extension through the [[Common Lisp Object System#Metaobject Protocol|CLOS Metaobject Protocol]]. By convergent design, Fortress also features multiple dispatch on parametric types; unlike Julia, however, Fortress is statically rather than dynamically typed, with separate compiling and executing phases. The language features are summarized in the following table:

{| class=\"wikitable\"
|-
! [[Programming language|Language]] !! [[Type system]] !! [[Generic function]]s !! [[Parametric polymorphism|Parametric types]]
|-
| Julia || Dynamic || Default || Yes
|-
| [[Common Lisp]] || Dynamic || Opt-in || Yes (but no dispatch)
|-
| [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]] || Dynamic || Default || Partial (no dispatch)
|-
| [[Fortress (programming language)|Fortress]] || Static || Default || Yes
|}

By default, the Julia runtime must be pre-installed as user-provided source code is run. Alternatively, a standalone [[executable]] that needs no Julia source code can be built with ''ApplicationBuilder.jl''<ref>{{Cite web|last=Daly|first=Nathan|title=GitHub - NHDaly/ApplicationBuilder.jl: Compile, bundle, and release julia software.|date=2019-02-13|url=https://github.com/NHDaly/ApplicationBuilder.jl|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> and ''PackageCompiler.jl''.<ref>{{cite web|title=GitHub - JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl: Compile your Julia Package.|date=2019-02-14|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl|publisher=The Julia Language|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref><!--

Julia's [[Macro (computer science)#Syntactic macros|syntactic macros]] (used for [[metaprogramming]]), like Lisp macros, are more powerful than [[Macro (computer science)#Text-substitution macros|text-substitution macros]] used in the [[preprocessor]] of some other languages such as C, because they work at the level of [[abstract syntax tree]]s (ASTs). Julia's macro system is [[hygienic macro|hygienic]], but also supports deliberate capture when desired (like for [[anaphoric macro]]s) using the <code>esc</code> construct.

==Interaction==
The Julia official distribution includes a \"full-featured interactive command-line REPL\" ([[read–eval–print loop]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/|title=The Julia REPL · The Julia Language|website=docs.julialang.org|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> with a searchable history, [[tab-completion]], many helpful keybindings, and dedicated help and [[shell (computing)|shell]] modes;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/The_REPL|title=Introducing Julia/The REPL - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|quote=you can install the Julia package OhMyREPL.jl (https://github.com/KristofferC/OhMyREPL.jl) which lets you customize the REPL's appearance and behaviour|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> which can be used to experiment and test code quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/|title=Getting Started · The Julia Language|website=docs.julialang.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref> The following fragment represents a sample session example where strings are concatenated automatically by println:<ref>See also: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/strings/ for string interpolation and the <code>string(greet, \", \", whom, \".\\n\")</code> example for preferred ways to concatenate strings. <!--While the <code>+</code> operator is not used for string concatenation, it could easily be defined to do so.--> Julia has the println and print functions, but also a @printf macro (i.e., not in function form) to eliminate run-time overhead of formatting (unlike the same function in C).</ref>

<source lang=\"jlcon\">
julia> p(x) = 2x^2 + 1; f(x, y) = 1 + 2p(x)y
julia> println(\"Hello world!\", \" I'm on cloud \", f(0, 4), \" as Julia supports recognizable syntax!\")
Hello world! I'm on cloud 9 as Julia supports recognizable syntax!
</source>

The REPL gives user access to the system shell and to help mode, by pressing <code>;</code> or <code>?</code> after the prompt (preceding each command), respectively. It also keeps the history of commands, including between sessions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Julia Documentation|url=https://docs.julialang.org|website=JuliaLang.org|accessdate=18 November 2014}}</ref> Code that can be tested inside the Julia's interactive section or saved into a file with a <code>.jl</code> extension and run from the command line by typing:<ref name=\"Learn Julia in Y\"/>

<source lang=\"console\">
 $ julia <filename>
</source>

Julia is supported by [[Jupyter]], an online interactive \"notebooks\" environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jupyter.org/ |title=Project Jupyter}}</ref>

=== Use with other languages ===
Julia is in practice [[interoperability|interoperable]] with many languages. Julia's <source lang=\"julia\" inline>ccall</source> keyword is used to call C-exported or Fortran shared library functions individually.

Julia has support for [[Unicode 12.1]] (support for current Unicode 13.0 has been implemented<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/JuliaStrings/utf8proc/pull/179|title=Unicode 13 support by stevengj · Pull Request #179 · JuliaStrings/utf8proc|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> for Julia 1.5), which added only one letter since Unicode 12.0,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/32002|title=support for Unicode 12.1.0 by stevengj · Pull Request #32002 · JuliaLang/julia|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref> with [[UTF-8]] used for strings (by default) and for Julia source code (only allowing legal UTF-8 in the latest version), meaning also allowing as an option common math symbols for many operators, such as ∈ for the <code>in</code> operator.

Julia has packages supporting markup languages such as [[HTML]] (and also for [[HTTP]]), [[XML]], [[JSON]] and [[BSON]], and for [[database]]s and Web use in general.

== Usage ==
Libraries such as [[Flux (machine-learning framework)|Flux]] and [[Knet (machine-learning framework)|Knet]] implement complete machine-learning frameworks written completely in Julia. [[Apache MXNet]] and [[TensorFlow]] are also available through wrapper libraries. [[Turing (probabilistic programming)|Turing]] and [[Gen (probabilistic programming)|Gen]] implement general-purpose [[probabilistic programming]] languages into Julia. [[Pharmacokinetics|Pharmacokinetic]] modeling and simulations are made available through the [[Pumas (pharmaceutical modeling)|Pumas]] suite.

==Implementation==
Julia's core is implemented in Julia and [[C (programming language)|C]]<!--C99, except for 0.4 needing C11 because of static asserts-->, together with [[C++]] for the [[LLVM]] dependency. The parsing and code-lowering are implemented in FemtoLisp, a [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] dialect.<ref name=\"JeffBezanson 2019\">{{cite web | author=JeffBezanson | title=JeffBezanson/femtolisp | website=GitHub | date=June 6, 2019 | url=https://github.com/JeffBezanson/femtolisp | access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref> The LLVM compiler infrastructure project is used as the [[Compiler#Back end|back end]] for generation of [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] or [[32-bit]] optimized [[machine code]] depending on the platform Julia runs on. With some exceptions (e.g., [[PCRE]]), the [[standard library]] is implemented in Julia. The most notable aspect of Julia's implementation is its speed, which is often within a factor of two relative to fully optimized C code (and thus often an order of magnitude faster than Python or [[R (programming language)|R]]).<ref name=\"Julia-TR\">{{cite web

===Current and future platforms===
While Julia uses JIT,<!-- Viral states \"Julia no longer uses the MCJIT in LLVM\" so this link is probably misleading:
<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/5208
|title=Support MCJIT
|website=Github.com
|accessdate=26 May 2015
}}</ref> --> Julia generates native machine code directly, before a function is first run (not [[bytecode]]s that are run on a [[virtual machine]] (VM) or translated as the bytecode is running, as with, ''e.g.'', Java; the [[JVM]] or [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] in Android).

Julia has four support tiers,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://julialang.org/downloads/#support-tiers|title=Julia Downloads|website=julialang.org|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> and currently supports all [[x86-64]] processors, that are [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] (and is more [[program optimization|optimized]] for the latest generations) and all [[IA-32]] (\"x86\") processors except for decades old ones, i.e., in [[32-bit]] mode (\"i686\", excepting CPUs from the pre-[[Pentium 4]]-era); and supports more in lower tiers, e.g., ARM has tier 2 support: Julia \"fully supports ARMv8 (AArch64) processors, and supports ARMv7 and ARMv6 (AArch32) with some caveats.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=julia/arm.md|date=2019-11-29|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/doc/build/arm.md|publisher=The Julia Language|quote=A list of [https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/labels/arm known issues] for ARM is available.|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> [[CUDA]] (i.e. Nvidia GPUs; implementing [[Parallel Thread Execution|PTX]]) has tier 1 support, with the help of an [https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDAnative.jl external package]. There are also additionally packages supporting other accelerators, such as Google's [[tensor processing unit|TPU]]s,<ref>{{Citation|title=Julia on TPUs|date=2019-11-26|url=https://github.com/JuliaTPU/XLA.jl|publisher=JuliaTPU|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> and AMD's GPUs also have support with e.g. [[OpenCL]]. Julia's downloads page provides [[executable]]s (and source) for all the officially supported platforms.

On some platforms, Julia may need to be compiled from [[source code]] (e.g., the original [[Raspberry Pi]]), with specific build options. Julia has been \"successfully built\" <!--on the following ARMv8 devices:

* [https://www.nvidia.com/object/embedded-systems-dev-kits-modules.html nVidia Jetson TX1 & TX2];

* [https://softiron.com/products/overdrive-3000/ Overdrive 3000];
* [https://www.cavium.com/ThunderX_ARM_Processors.html Cavium ThunderX]-->
on several ARM platforms, up to, e.g., \"ARMv8 Data Center & Cloud Processors\", such as [https://www.cavium.com/ThunderX_ARM_Processors.html Cavium ThunderX] (first ARM with 48 cores). PowerPC (64-bit) has tier 3 support meaning \"may or may not build\".

'''Katherine Johnson''' (August 26, 1918 – February 24, 2020) was an American mathematician whose calculations of [[orbital mechanics]] as a [[NASA]] employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/feature/katherine-johnson-the-girl-who-loved-to-count|title = Katherine Johnson: The Girl Who Loved to Count|date = November 24, 2015|access-date = February 12, 2016|publisher = [[NASA]]|last = Smith|first = Yvette|quote = Her calculations proved as critical to the success of the Apollo Moon landing program and the start of the Space Shuttle program, as they did to those first steps on the country's journey into space.|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190212013908/https://www.nasa.gov/feature/katherine-johnson-the-girl-who-loved-to-count/|archive-date = February 12, 2019|url-status = live}}</ref> During her 35-year career at NASA and its [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|predecessor]], she earned a reputation for mastering complex manual calculations and helped pioneer the use of computers to perform the tasks. The space agency noted her \"historical role as one of the first [[African-American]] women to work as a NASA scientist\".<ref name=hftmf /><!--\"African American\" should be in the lead, per Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biographies#Context; it is a part of her WP:Notability.-->

Johnson's work included calculating trajectories, [[launch window]]s, and emergency return paths for [[Project Mercury]] spaceflights, including those for astronauts [[Alan Shepard]], the first American in space, and [[John Glenn]], the first American in orbit, and rendezvous paths for the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] and [[Apollo command module|command module]] on flights to the Moon. Her calculations were also essential to  the beginning of the [[Space Shuttle program]], and she worked on plans for [[Exploration of Mars|a mission to Mars]].

In 2015, President [[Barack Obama]] awarded Johnson the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. In 2016, she was presented the [[Silver Snoopy award|Silver Snoopy Award]] by NASA astronaut [[Leland D. Melvin]] and a [[NASA Group Achievement Award]]. She was portrayed by [[Taraji P. Henson]] as a lead character in the 2016 film ''[[Hidden Figures]]''. In 2019, Johnson was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]].

==Career==
[[File:Katherine Johnson at NASA, in 1966.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Johnson sitting at a desk | Johnson working as a \"computer\" at NASA in 1966]]
Johnson decided on a career as a research mathematician, although this was a difficult field for African Americans and women to enter. The first jobs she found were in teaching. At a family gathering in 1952, a relative mentioned that the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) was hiring mathematicians.<ref name=\"NASA bio\" /> At the [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]], based in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], Virginia, near [[Langley Field]], NACA hired African-American mathematicians as well as whites for their Guidance and Navigation Department. Johnson accepted a job offer from the agency in June 1953.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />

According to an oral history archived by the National Visionary Leadership Project:

<blockquote>At first she [Johnson] worked in a pool of women performing math calculations. Katherine has referred to the women in the pool as virtual \"computers who wore skirts\". Their main job was to read the data from the black boxes of planes and carry out other precise mathematical tasks. Then one day, Katherine (and a colleague) were temporarily assigned to help the all-male flight research team. Katherine's knowledge of [[analytic geometry]] helped make quick allies of male bosses and colleagues to the extent that, \"they forgot to return me to the pool\".  While the racial and gender barriers were always there, Katherine says she ignored them. Katherine was assertive, asking to be included in editorial meetings (where no women had gone before). She simply told people she had done the work and that she belonged.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />
</blockquote>

From 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a [[Human computer|computer]],<ref name=\"Jim Hodges\">{{cite web |title=She Was a Computer When Computers Wore Skirts |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |first=Jim |last=Hodges |publisher=NASA |work=Langley Research Center |date=August 26, 2008 |access-date=December 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124545/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft. Originally assigned to the [[West Area Computers]] section supervised by mathematician [[Dorothy Vaughan]], Johnson was reassigned to the Guidance and Control Division of Langley's Flight Research Division. It was staffed by white male engineers.<ref name=\"buckley\" /> In keeping with state racial segregation laws, and federal workplace segregation introduced under President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in the early 20th&nbsp;century, Johnson and the other African-American women in the computing pool were required to work, eat, and use restrooms that were separate from those of their white peers. Their office was labeled as \"Colored Computers\". In an interview with [[WHRO-TV]], Johnson stated that she \"didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research. You had a mission and you worked on it, and it was important to you to do your job&nbsp;... and play bridge at lunch.\" She added: \"I didn't feel any segregation. I knew it was there, but I didn't feel it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/video/katherine-johnson-interview-nasa/ |title=Katherine Johnson Interview: NASA's Human Computer |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2016 |website=HistoryvsHollywood.com |publisher=CTF Media |access-date=March 2, 2017 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303050429/http://www.historyvshollywood.com/video/katherine-johnson-interview-nasa/ |archive-date=March 3, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

NACA disbanded the colored computing pool in 1958 when the agency was superseded by NASA, which adopted digital computers. Although the installation was desegregated,<ref name=\"buckley\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/books/on-being-black-female-math-whizzes-during-the-space-race.html|title=On Being a Black Female Math Whiz During the Space Race|last=Buckley|first=Cara|date=September 6, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=September 6, 2016|page=C1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906030123/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/books/on-being-black-female-math-whizzes-during-the-space-race.html|archive-date=September 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> forms of discrimination were still pervasive. Johnson recalled that era:

<blockquote>We needed to be assertive as women in those days&nbsp;– assertive and aggressive&nbsp;– and the degree to which we had to be that way depended on where you were. I had to be. In the early days of NASA women were not allowed to put their names on the reports&nbsp;– no woman in my division had had her name on a report. I was working with Ted Skopinski and he wanted to leave and go to Houston&nbsp;... but Henry Pearson, our supervisor&nbsp;– he was not a fan of women&nbsp;– kept pushing him to finish the report we were working on. Finally, Ted told him, \"Katherine should finish the report, she's done most of the work anyway.\" So Ted left Pearson with no choice; I finished the report and my name went on it, and that was the first time a woman in our division had her name on something.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Warren|first=Wini|url=https://archive.org/details/blackwomenscient00warr|url-access=registration|title=Black Women Scientists in the United States|date=1999|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-33603-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackwomenscient00warr/page/n172 143]|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>

From 1958 until her retirement in 1986, Johnson worked as an aerospace technologist, moving during her career to the Spacecraft Controls Branch. She calculated the trajectory for the May&nbsp;5, 1961 space flight of [[Alan Shepard]], the first American in space.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> She also calculated the [[launch window]] for his 1961 [[Project Mercury|Mercury mission]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/71576/black-female-mathematicians-who-sent-astronauts-space|title=The Black Female Mathematicians Who Sent Astronauts to Space|last=Whitney|first=A.

'''Katherine Johnson''' (August 26, 1918 – February 24, 2020) was an American mathematician whose calculations of [[orbital mechanics]] as a [[NASA]] employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/feature/katherine-johnson-the-girl-who-loved-to-count|title = Katherine Johnson: The Girl Who Loved to Count|date = November 24, 2015|access-date = February 12, 2016|publisher = [[NASA]]|last = Smith|first = Yvette|quote = Her calculations proved as critical to the success of the Apollo Moon landing program and the start of the Space Shuttle program, as they did to those first steps on the country's journey into space.|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190212013908/https://www.nasa.gov/feature/katherine-johnson-the-girl-who-loved-to-count/|archive-date = February 12, 2019|url-status = live}}</ref> During her 35-year career at NASA and its [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|predecessor]], she earned a reputation for mastering complex manual calculations and helped pioneer the use of computers to perform the tasks. The space agency noted her \"historical role as one of the first [[African-American]] women to work as a NASA scientist\".<ref name=hftmf /><!--\"African American\" should be in the lead, per Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biographies#Context; it is a part of her WP:Notability.-->

Johnson's work included calculating trajectories, [[launch window]]s, and emergency return paths for [[Project Mercury]] spaceflights, including those for astronauts [[Alan Shepard]], the first American in space, and [[John Glenn]], the first American in orbit, and rendezvous paths for the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] and [[Apollo command module|command module]] on flights to the Moon. Her calculations were also essential to  the beginning of the [[Space Shuttle program]], and she worked on plans for [[Exploration of Mars|a mission to Mars]].

In 2015, President [[Barack Obama]] awarded Johnson the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. In 2016, she was presented the [[Silver Snoopy award|Silver Snoopy Award]] by NASA astronaut [[Leland D. Melvin]] and a [[NASA Group Achievement Award]]. She was portrayed by [[Taraji P. Henson]] as a lead character in the 2016 film ''[[Hidden Figures]]''. In 2019, Johnson was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]].

Coleman showed strong mathematical abilities from an early age.

==Career==
[[File:Katherine Johnson at NASA, in 1966.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Johnson sitting at a desk | Johnson working as a \"computer\" at NASA in 1966]]
Johnson decided on a career as a research mathematician, although this was a difficult field for African Americans and women to enter. The first jobs she found were in teaching. At a family gathering in 1952, a relative mentioned that the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) was hiring mathematicians.<ref name=\"NASA bio\" /> At the [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]], based in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], Virginia, near [[Langley Field]], NACA hired African-American mathematicians as well as whites for their Guidance and Navigation Department. Johnson accepted a job offer from the agency in June 1953.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />

According to an oral history archived by the National Visionary Leadership Project:

<blockquote>At first she [Johnson] worked in a pool of women performing math calculations. Katherine has referred to the women in the pool as virtual \"computers who wore skirts\". Their main job was to read the data from the black boxes of planes and carry out other precise mathematical tasks. Then one day, Katherine (and a colleague) were temporarily assigned to help the all-male flight research team. Katherine's knowledge of [[analytic geometry]] helped make quick allies of male bosses and colleagues to the extent that, \"they forgot to return me to the pool\".  While the racial and gender barriers were always there, Katherine says she ignored them. Katherine was assertive, asking to be included in editorial meetings (where no women had gone before). She simply told people she had done the work and that she belonged.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />
</blockquote>

From 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a [[Human computer|computer]],<ref name=\"Jim Hodges\">{{cite web |title=She Was a Computer When Computers Wore Skirts |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |first=Jim |last=Hodges |publisher=NASA |work=Langley Research Center |date=August 26, 2008 |access-date=December 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124545/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft. Originally assigned to the [[West Area Computers]] section supervised by mathematician [[Dorothy Vaughan]], Johnson was reassigned to the Guidance and Control Division of Langley's Flight Research Division. It was staffed by white male engineers.<ref name=\"buckley\" /> In keeping with state racial segregation laws, and federal workplace segregation introduced under President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in the early 20th&nbsp;century, Johnson and the other African-American women in the computing pool were required to work, eat, and use restrooms that were separate from those of their white peers. Their office was labeled as \"Colored Computers\". In an interview with [[WHRO-TV]], Johnson stated that she \"didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research. You had a mission and you worked on it, and it was important to you to do your job&nbsp;... and play bridge at lunch.\" She added: \"I didn't feel any segregation. I knew it was there, but I didn't feel it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/video/katherine-johnson-interview-nasa/ |title=Katherine Johnson Interview: NASA's Human Computer |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2016 |website=HistoryvsHollywood.com |publisher=CTF Media |access-date=March 2, 2017 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303050429/http://www.historyvshollywood.com/video/katherine-johnson-interview-nasa/ |archive-date=March 3, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

NACA disbanded the colored computing pool in 1958 when the agency was superseded by NASA, which adopted digital computers. Although the installation was desegregated,<ref name=\"buckley\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/books/on-being-black-female-math-whizzes-during-the-space-race.html|title=On Being a Black Female Math Whiz During the Space Race|last=Buckley|first=Cara|date=September 6, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=September 6, 2016|page=C1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906030123/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/books/on-being-black-female-math-whizzes-during-the-space-race.html|archive-date=September 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> forms of discrimination were still pervasive. Johnson recalled that era:

<blockquote>We needed to be assertive as women in those days&nbsp;– assertive and aggressive&nbsp;– and the degree to which we had to be that way depended on where you were. I had to be. In the early days of NASA women were not allowed to put their names on the reports&nbsp;– no woman in my division had had her name on a report. I was working with Ted Skopinski and he wanted to leave and go to Houston&nbsp;... but Henry Pearson, our supervisor&nbsp;– he was not a fan of women&nbsp;– kept pushing him to finish the report we were working on. Finally, Ted told him, \"Katherine should finish the report, she's done most of the work anyway.\" So Ted left Pearson with no choice; I finished the report and my name went on it, and that was the first time a woman in our division had her name on something.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Warren|first=Wini|url=https://archive.org/details/blackwomenscient00warr|url-access=registration|title=Black Women Scientists in the United States|date=1999|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-33603-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackwomenscient00warr/page/n172 143]|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>

From 1958 until her retirement in 1986, Johnson worked as an aerospace technologist, moving during her career to the Spacecraft Controls Branch. She calculated the trajectory for the May&nbsp;5, 1961 space flight of [[Alan Shepard]], the first American in space.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> She also calculated the [[launch window]] for his 1961 [[Project Mercury|Mercury mission]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/71576/black-female-mathematicians-who-sent-astronauts-space|title=The Black Female Mathematicians Who Sent Astronauts to Space|last=Whitney|first=A.

Johnson later worked directly with digital [[computer]]s. Her ability and reputation for accuracy helped to establish confidence in the new technology.<ref name=\"biography.com\" /> In 1961, her work helped to ensure that Alan Shepard's ''[[Freedom 7]]'' Mercury capsule would be found quickly after landing, using the accurate trajectory that had been established.<ref name=businside />

[[File:Katherine Johnson in 2008.jpg|thumb|alt=Johnson seated in a chair looking to her right | Johnson in 2008]]
She also helped to calculate the trajectory for the 1969 [[Apollo&nbsp;11]] flight to the Moon.<ref name=\"Smith\" /><ref name=\"biography.com\" /> During the Moon landing, Johnson was at a meeting in the [[Pocono Mountains]]. She and a few others crowded around a small [[television]] screen watching the first steps on the Moon. In 1970, Johnson worked on the [[Apollo&nbsp;13]] Moon mission. When the mission was aborted, her work on backup procedures and charts helped set a safe path for the crew's return to Earth,<ref name=\"biography.com\" /> creating a one-star observation system that would allow astronauts to determine their location with accuracy.

{{nihongo|'''''Pocket Monsters Sound Anime Collection: Music Collection/Famous Scene Collection'''''|ポケットモンスター サウンドアニメコレクション ― 音楽集・名場面集|Poketto Monsutā Saundo Anime Korekushion Ongaku Shū Meibamen Shū}} is the licensed soundtrack from the anime. It was released by Pikachu Records on June 10, 1998, in [[Japan]] only. This collection consists of composer [[Shinji Miyazaki]]'s orchestrated arrangements of musical compositions from the first four Pokémon games by composer [[Junichi Masuda]] and exclusive musical cues heard throughout the first series. These instrumental tracks are categorized as sixteen chapters included with the show's first opening theme song \"Mezase Pokemon Masutā\" and second closing theme \"Poketto ni Fantajī\" (both are the TV-size edits). Each of the instrumental tracks are followed by a brief commentary featuring [[Ash Ketchum|Satoshi]]'s [[Pokédex|Pokémon Zukan]] voiced by its voice actor [[Shin-ichiro Miki]] explaining each composition's association with the story and at what point it plays. Included with the album is a hard bound picture book (the {{nihongo|''Meibamen Shū''|名場面集|famous  (impressive) scene collection}}), stickers, and a merchandise catalogue.

{{nihongo|'''''Pocket Monsters Sound Anime Collection: Music Collection/Famous Scene Collection'''''|ポケットモンスター サウンドアニメコレクション ― 音楽集・名場面集|Poketto Monsutā Saundo Anime Korekushion Ongaku Shū Meibamen Shū}} is the licensed soundtrack from the anime. It was released by Pikachu Records on June 10, 1998, in [[Japan]] only. This collection consists of composer [[Shinji Miyazaki]]'s orchestrated arrangements of musical compositions from the first four Pokémon games by composer [[Junichi Masuda]] and exclusive musical cues heard throughout the first series. These instrumental tracks are categorized as sixteen chapters included with the show's first opening theme song \"Mezase Pokemon Masutā\" and second closing theme \"Poketto ni Fantajī\" (both are the TV-size edits). Each of the instrumental tracks are followed by a brief commentary featuring [[Ash Ketchum|Satoshi]]'s [[Pokédex|Pokémon Zukan]] voiced by its voice actor [[Shin-ichiro Miki]] explaining each composition's association with the story and at what point it plays. Included with the album is a hard bound picture book (the {{nihongo|''Meibamen Shū''|名場面集|famous  (impressive) scene collection}}), stickers, and a merchandise catalogue.

'''Carnivora''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑːr|ˈ|n|ɪ|v|ə|r|ə}};{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|Carnivora}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Carnivora}}}} ; from [[Latin]] ''carō'' (stem ''carn-'') \"flesh\" and ''vorāre'' \"to devour\") is a clade of [[placental]] [[mammal]]s where most species have specialized in primarily eating flesh. However some species are omnivorous, like raccoons and bears, and quite few species like [[panda]]s are specialized herbivores. Its members are formally referred to as '''carnivorans''', whereas the word \"carnivore\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. With at least 279 extant species found on every major landmass and in a variety of habitats, ranging the cold polar regions to the hyper-arid region of the [[Sahara Desert]] to the open seas even, Carnivora is the fifth largest order of mammals and one of the more successful members of the group. They come in a huge array of different body plans in contrasting shapes and sizes.  The smallest carnivoran is the [[least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), which can weigh as little as 25 g (0.88&nbsp;oz) and 11&nbsp;cm (4.3&nbsp;in), as the largest is the [[southern elephant seal]] (''Mirounga leonina''), whose adult males weigh up to 5,000&nbsp;kg (11,000&nbsp;lb) and measure up to 6.7&nbsp;m (22&nbsp;ft) in length. All species of carnivorans are descended from a group of mammals which were related to today's [[pangolin]]s, having appeared in [[North America]] 6 million years after the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].<ref name=\"hunter2018\"/><ref name=Polly/> These early ancestors of carnivorans would have resembled small weasel or genet-like mammals, occupying a nocturnal shift on the forest floor or in the trees, as other groups of mammals like the [[mesonychian]]s and [[creodont]]s were occupying the top faunivorous niche. However, by the time [[Miocene]] epoch appeared, most if not all of the major lineages and families of carnivorans had diversified and took over this niche.

Carnivora can be divided into two subclades: the cat-like [[Feliformia]] and the dog-like [[Caniformia]] which are differentiated based on the structure of their ear bones and cranial features. The feliforms include families such as the [[cat]]s, the [[hyena]]s, the [[mongoose]]s and the [[civet]]s. Majority of feliform species are found in the [[Old World]], though the cats and [[Chasmaporthetes|one extinct genus of hyena]] have successfully diversified into the [[Americas]]. The caniforms include the [[Canidae|dog]]s, [[bear]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[weasel]]s, and [[pinniped]]s. Members of this group are found worldwide and with incredible diversity in their diet, behavior, and morphology. Despite this the two groups of carnivorans share several unique traits, one being the presence of the [[carnassial]] teeth. In carnivorans the carnassial pair is made up by the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. There is variation among the carnassial pair depending on the family. Some species are [[cursorial]] and the foot posture in terrestrial species is either [[digitigrade]] or [[plantigrade]]. In pinnipeds the feet have become flippers where the locomotion is unique in each of the pinniped families.

Carnivorans are arguably after primates the group of mammals most fascinated or of interest to humans. The [[dog]] is noteworthy for not only being the first species of carnivoran to be domesticated, but also the first species of any organism. In the last 10 to 12,000 years humans have selectively bred dogs for a variety of different tasks and today there are well over 400 breeds. The [[cat]] is another domesticated carnivoran and it is today considered one of the most successful species on the planet, due to their close proximity to humans and the popularity of cats as pets. Many other species popular, often part of the [[charismatic megafauna]] where every major civilization has incorporated a species of carnivoran into their culture such as the [[lion]], viewed as royalty. Yet many species such as [[wolves]] and the [[big cat]]s have been hunted and persecution, with some places they have been extirpated. Habitat loss and human encroachment as well as [[climate change]] have been the primary cause of many species to go into decline. Most species need large adequate amount of territory and plenty of food resources in order to survive, and the decline of both of them are the primary reasons of decline. Four species of carnivorans have gone extinct since the 1600s: [[Falkland Island Wolf]] (''Dusicyon australis'') in 1876; the [[Sea Mink]] (''Neovison macrodon'') in 1894; the [[Japanese Sea Lion]] (''Zalophus japonicus'') in 1951 and the [[Caribbean Monk Seal]] (''Neomonachus tropicalis'') in 1952.<ref name=\"hunter2018\">{{cite book | last1 = Hunter | first1 = L. | year = 2018 | title = Field Guide to Carnivores of the World.  | url = | publisher = Bloomsbury Wildlife | pages = 1–271 |isbn = 1472950798}}</ref> Some species such as the [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'') and [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') have been introduced to [[Australasia]] that have caused many native species to become endangered or even extinct.<ref>{{cite web|title= 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Species | url = http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=98&fr=1&sts=&lang=EN |publisher=Invasive Species Specialist Group}}</ref>

The order Carnivora belongs to a group of mammals known as [[Laurasiatheria]], which also includes other groups such as [[bat]]s and [[ungulate]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Waddell | first1 = Peter J.| last2 = Okada | first2 = Norihiro| last3 = Hasegawa | first3 = Masami| doi = 10.1093/sysbio/48.1.1 | title = Towards Resolving the Interordinal Relationships of Placental Mammals | journal = [[Systematic Biology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | year = 1999 | pmid = 12078634| pmc = | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=Tsagkogeorga2013>{{cite journal |last1=Tsagkogeorga |first1=G |last2=Parker |first2=J |last3=Stupka |first3=E |last4=Cotton |first4=J.A. |last5=Rossiter |first5=S.J. |year=2013 |title=Phylogenomic analyses elucidate the evolutionary relationships of bats |journal=Current Biology |volume=23 |issue=22 |pages=2262–2267 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.09.014 |pmid=24184098|doi-access=free }}</ref> Within this group the carnivorans are placed in the clade [[Ferae]].

The closest stem-carnivorans are the [[Miacoidea|miacoid]]s. The miacoids include the families [[Viverravidae]] and [[Miacidae]], and together the Carnivora and Miacoidea form the stem-clade [[Carnivoramorpha]].  The miacoids were small, gennet-like carnivoramorphs that occupy a variety of niches such as terrestrial and arboreal habitats. Recent studies have shown a supporting amount of evidence that Miacoidea is an evolutionary grade of canivoramorphs that, while viverravids are monophyletic basal group, the miacids are paraphyletic in respect to Carnivora (as shown in the phylogeny below).<ref name = Bryant2004>Bryant, H.N., and M.

===Classification of the extant carnivorans===
In 1758 the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[botanist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] placed all the carnivorans that was known at the time in the group [[Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae#Ferae|Ferae]] (not to be confused with the modern concept of Ferae which also include pangolins) in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his book ''[[Systema Naturae]]''. He recongized six genera: ''[[Canis]]'' (canids and hyaenids), ''[[Phoca]]'' (pinnipeds), ''[[Felis]]'' (felids), ''[[Viverra]]'' (viverrids, herpestids, and mephitids), ''[[Mustela]]'' (non-badger mustelids), ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]]'' (ursids, large species of mustelids, and procyonids).<ref>{{cite book | author = Linnaeus, C. | year = 1758 | title = Sistema naturae per regna tria Naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus differentiis, synonimis locis.

Laurentii Salvii, Holmia | pages = 20–32}}</ref> It wasn't until in 1821 when the English writer and traveler [[Thomas Edward Bowdich]] gave the group its modern and accepted name.<ref name=\"Bowditch, T.

Initially the modern concept of Carnivora was divided into two suborders: the terrestrial '''Fissipedia''' and the marine [[Pinnipedia]].<ref name=\"simpson1945\">{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = G.G. | year = 1945 | title = The principles of classification and a classification of mammals | journal = Bulletin of the AMNH  | volume = 85 | issue =  | pages = 1–350| hdl = 2246/1104 }}</ref> Below is the classification of how the extant families were related to each other after American paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in 1945:<ref name=\"simpson1945\"/>

*** Family [[Odobenidae]] <small>J. A. Allen, 1880</small> – walrus
*** Family [[Phocidae]] <small>J. E. Gray, 1821</small> – earless seals

Since then, however, the methods in which mammalogists use to assess the phylogenetic relationships among the carnivoran families has been improved with using more complicated and intensive incorporation of genetics, morphology and the fossil record. Research into Carnivora phylogeny since 1945 has found Fisspedia to be paraphlyetic in respect to Pinnipedia,<ref>{{Cite journal

==Anatomy and physiology==
===Craniodental region===
[[Image:Em - Cryptoprocta ferox - 2.jpg|thumb|A skull of a [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] (''Cryptoprocta ferox''), note the large and conical canine and [[carnassial]] teeth common in [[feliform]]s.]]
The canine teeth are usually large and conical. The canines are thick and incredibly stress resistant. All of the terrestrial species of carnivorans have three [[incisor]]s on the top and bottom row of the dentition (the exception being is the [[sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'') which only has two lower incisor teeth).<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/><ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> The third [[molar (tooth)|molar]] has been lost. The carnassial pair is made up by the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. Like most mammals the dentition is [[heterodont]] in nature, though in some species like the [[aardwolf]] (''Proteles cristata'') the teeth have been greatly reduced and the cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. In pinnipeds the teeth are [[homodont]] as they have evolved to grasp or to catch fish, and the cheek teeth are often lost.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> In bears and raccoons the carnassial pair is secondarily reduced.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> The skulls are heavily built with a strong [[zygomatic arch]].<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> Often a [[sagittal crest]] is present, sometimes more evident in sexual dimorphic species like [[sea lion]]s and [[fur seal]]s, though it has also been greatly reduced seen in some small carnivorans.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\">{{cite book | last1 = Vaughan | first1 = T. A. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Czaplewski | first3 = N. J. | year = 2013 | chapter = | editor1-last =  | editor1-first = | editor2-last =  | editor2-first =  | title = Mammalogy | publisher = Jones & Bartlett Learning | location = Burlington, Massachusetts | pages = 1–750 |isbn = 9781284032093}}</ref> The [[braincase]] is enlarged and the [[frontoparietal]] is position at the front of it. In most species the eyes are position at the front of the face. In caniforms the rostrum is usually longer with many teeth, where in comparison with felifoms the rostrum is shorter and have fewer teeth. The carnassial teeth in feliforms, however is more sectional.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> The [[tubinares]] are large and complex in comparison to other mammals, providing a large surface area for [[olfactory receptors]].<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/>

===Postcranial region===
[[Image:Canis mesomelas vs. Arctocephalus pusillus.jpg|thumb|A [[black-backed jackal]] (''Canis mesomelas'') trying to predate on a [[brown fur seal]] (''Arctocephalus pusillus'') pup. These two species illustrate the diversity in bodyplan seen among carnivorans, especially between pinnipeds and their terrestrial relatives.]]
Aside from an accumulation of characteristics in the dental and cranial features, not much of their overall anatomy unites them as a group.<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\">{{cite book | last1 = Nowak | first1 = R. M. | year = 2005 | chapter = | editor1-last =  | editor1-first = | editor2-last =  | editor2-first =  | title = Walker's Carnivores of the World | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location= Baltimore, Maryland | pages = 1–328 |isbn = 0801880335}}</ref>  All species of carnivorans have [[quadrupedal]] [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s with usually five digits at the front feet and four digits at the back feet. In terrestrial carnivorans the feet have soft pads. The feet can either be [[digitgrade]] seen in cats, hyenas and dogs or [[plantigrade]] seen in bears, skunks, raccoons, weasels, civets and mongooses. In pinnipeds the limbs have been modified into [[Flipper (anatomy)|flippers]]. Unlike other [[marine mammal]]s, such as [[cetacean]]s and [[sirenian]]s which have fully functional [[tail]]s to help them swim, pinnipeds use their limbs underwater for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. In [[earless seal]]s they use their back flippers; sea lions and fur seals use their front flippers, and the [[walrus]] use all of their limbs. This resulted in pinnipeds having significantly shorter tails. Aside from the pinnipeds, dogs, bears, hyenas, and cats have distinct and recognizable appearances. Dogs are usually [[cursorial]] mammals and are gracile in appearance, often relying on their teeth to hold to prey; bears are much larger and rely on their physical strength to forage for food. Cats in comparison to dogs and bears have much longer and stronger frontlimbs armed with retractable [[claws]] to hold on to prey. Hyenas are dog-like feliforms that have sloping backs due to their front legs being longer than their hindlegs. The raccoon family as well as the [[red panda]] are small, bear-like carnivorans with long tails. The other small carnivoran families [[Nandiniidae]], [[Prionodontidae]], [[Viverridae]], [[Herpestidae]], Eupleridae, [[Mephitidae]] and Mustelidae have through [[convergent evolution]] maintained the small, ancestral appearance of the miacoids, though there is some variation seen such as the robust and stout physicality of [[badger]]s and the [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo'').<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/>

Depending on the environment the species is, the length and density of their [[fur]] varies. In warm climate species the fur is often short in length and lighter. In comparison to cold climate species the fur is either dense or long, often with an oily substance to keep them warm. The pelage coloration comes in many colors, often including black, white, orange, yellow, red, and many shades of gray and brown. There can be colored patterns too, such striped, spotted, blotched, banded, or otherwise boldly patterned. There seems to be a correlation between habitat and color pattern as for example spotted or banded species tend to be found in heavily forested environments.<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/> Some species like the grey wolf is a [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species with different individual variation in colors. The [[arctic fox]] (''Vulpes lagopus'') and the [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') the fur goes from white and dense in the winter to brown and sparse in the summer. In pinnipeds, [[polar bear]]s, and sea otters have a thick insulating layer of blubber to help maintain their body temperature.

'''Carnivora''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑːr|ˈ|n|ɪ|v|ə|r|ə}};{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|Carnivora}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Carnivora}}}} ; from [[Latin]] ''carō'' (stem ''carn-'') \"flesh\" and ''vorāre'' \"to devour\") is a clade of [[placental]] [[mammal]]s where most species have specialized in primarily eating flesh. However some species are omnivorous, like raccoons and bears, and quite few species like [[panda]]s are specialized herbivores. Its members are formally referred to as '''carnivorans''', whereas the word \"carnivore\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. With at least 279 extant species found on every major landmass and in a variety of habitats, ranging the cold polar regions to the hyper-arid region of the [[Sahara Desert]] to the open seas even, Carnivora is the fifth largest order of mammals and one of the more successful members of the group. They come in a huge array of different body plans in contrasting shapes and sizes.  The smallest carnivoran is the [[least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), which can weigh as little as 25 g (0.88&nbsp;oz) and 11&nbsp;cm (4.3&nbsp;in), as the largest is the [[southern elephant seal]] (''Mirounga leonina''), whose adult males weigh up to 5,000&nbsp;kg (11,000&nbsp;lb) and measure up to 6.7&nbsp;m (22&nbsp;ft) in length. All species of carnivorans are descended from a group of mammals which were related to today's [[pangolin]]s, having appeared in [[North America]] 6 million years after the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].<ref name=\"hunter2018\"/><ref name=Polly/> These early ancestors of carnivorans would have resembled small weasel or genet-like mammals, occupying a nocturnal shift on the forest floor or in the trees, as other groups of mammals like the [[mesonychian]]s and [[creodont]]s were occupying the top faunivorous niche. However, by the time [[Miocene]] epoch appeared, most if not all of the major lineages and families of carnivorans had diversified and took over this niche.

Carnivora can be divided into two subclades: the cat-like [[Feliformia]] and the dog-like [[Caniformia]] which are differentiated based on the structure of their ear bones and cranial features. The feliforms include families such as the [[cat]]s, the [[hyena]]s, the [[mongoose]]s and the [[civet]]s. Majority of feliform species are found in the [[Old World]], though the cats and [[Chasmaporthetes|one extinct genus of hyena]] have successfully diversified into the [[Americas]]. The caniforms include the [[Canidae|dog]]s, [[bear]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[weasel]]s, and [[pinniped]]s. Members of this group are found worldwide and with incredible diversity in their diet, behavior, and morphology. Despite this the two groups of carnivorans share several unique traits, one being the presence of the [[carnassial]] teeth. In carnivorans the carnassial pair is made up by the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. There is variation among the carnassial pair depending on the family. Some species are [[cursorial]] and the foot posture in terrestrial species is either [[digitigrade]] or [[plantigrade]]. In pinnipeds the feet have become flippers where the locomotion is unique in each of the pinniped families.

Carnivorans are arguably after primates the group of mammals most fascinated or of interest to humans. The [[dog]] is noteworthy for not only being the first species of carnivoran to be domesticated, but also the first species of any organism. In the last 10 to 12,000 years humans have selectively bred dogs for a variety of different tasks and today there are well over 400 breeds. The [[cat]] is another domesticated carnivoran and it is today considered one of the most successful species on the planet, due to their close proximity to humans and the popularity of cats as pets. Many other species popular, often part of the [[charismatic megafauna]] where every major civilization has incorporated a species of carnivoran into their culture such as the [[lion]], viewed as royalty. Yet many species such as [[wolves]] and the [[big cat]]s have been hunted and persecution, with some places they have been extirpated. Habitat loss and human encroachment as well as [[climate change]] have been the primary cause of many species to go into decline. Most species need large adequate amount of territory and plenty of food resources in order to survive, and the decline of both of them are the primary reasons of decline. Four species of carnivorans have gone extinct since the 1600s: [[Falkland Island Wolf]] (''Dusicyon australis'') in 1876; the [[Sea Mink]] (''Neovison macrodon'') in 1894; the [[Japanese Sea Lion]] (''Zalophus japonicus'') in 1951 and the [[Caribbean Monk Seal]] (''Neomonachus tropicalis'') in 1952.<ref name=\"hunter2018\">{{cite book | last1 = Hunter | first1 = L. | year = 2018 | title = Field Guide to Carnivores of the World.  | url = | publisher = Bloomsbury Wildlife | pages = 1–271 |isbn = 1472950798}}</ref> Some species such as the [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'') and [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') have been introduced to [[Australasia]] that have caused many native species to become endangered or even extinct.<ref>{{cite web|title= 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Species | url = http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=98&fr=1&sts=&lang=EN |publisher=Invasive Species Specialist Group}}</ref>

The closest stem-carnivorans are the [[Miacoidea|miacoid]]s. The miacoids include the families [[Viverravidae]] and [[Miacidae]], and together the Carnivora and Miacoidea form the stem-clade [[Carnivoramorpha]].  The miacoids were small, gennet-like carnivoramorphs that occupy a variety of niches such as terrestrial and arboreal habitats. Recent studies have shown a supporting amount of evidence that Miacoidea is an evolutionary grade of canivoramorphs that, while viverravids are monophyletic basal group, the miacids are paraphyletic in respect to Carnivora (as shown in the phylogeny below).<ref name = Bryant2004>Bryant, H.N., and M.

===Classification of the extant carnivorans===
In 1758 the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[botanist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] placed all the carnivorans that was known at the time in the group [[Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae#Ferae|Ferae]] (not to be confused with the modern concept of Ferae which also include pangolins) in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his book ''[[Systema Naturae]]''. He recongized six genera: ''[[Canis]]'' (canids and hyaenids), ''[[Phoca]]'' (pinnipeds), ''[[Felis]]'' (felids), ''[[Viverra]]'' (viverrids, herpestids, and mephitids), ''[[Mustela]]'' (non-badger mustelids), ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]]'' (ursids, large species of mustelids, and procyonids).<ref>{{cite book | author = Linnaeus, C. | year = 1758 | title = Sistema naturae per regna tria Naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus differentiis, synonimis locis.

Laurentii Salvii, Holmia | pages = 20–32}}</ref> It wasn't until in 1821 when the English writer and traveler [[Thomas Edward Bowdich]] gave the group its modern and accepted name.<ref name=\"Bowditch, T.

Initially the modern concept of Carnivora was divided into two suborders: the terrestrial '''Fissipedia''' and the marine [[Pinnipedia]].<ref name=\"simpson1945\">{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = G.G. | year = 1945 | title = The principles of classification and a classification of mammals | journal = Bulletin of the AMNH  | volume = 85 | issue =  | pages = 1–350| hdl = 2246/1104 }}</ref> Below is the classification of how the extant families were related to each other after American paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in 1945:<ref name=\"simpson1945\"/>

*** Family [[Otariidae]] <small>J. E. Gray, 1825</small> – eared seals
*** Family [[Odobenidae]] <small>J. A. Allen, 1880</small> – walrus
*** Family [[Phocidae]] <small>J. E. Gray, 1821</small> – earless seals

Since then, however, the methods in which mammalogists use to assess the phylogenetic relationships among the carnivoran families has been improved with using more complicated and intensive incorporation of genetics, morphology and the fossil record. Research into Carnivora phylogeny since 1945 has found Fisspedia to be paraphlyetic in respect to Pinnipedia,<ref>{{Cite journal

==Anatomy and physiology==
===Craniodental region===
[[Image:Em - Cryptoprocta ferox - 2.jpg|thumb|A skull of a [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] (''Cryptoprocta ferox''), note the large and conical canine and [[carnassial]] teeth common in [[feliform]]s.]]
The canine teeth are usually large and conical. The canines are thick and incredibly stress resistant. All of the terrestrial species of carnivorans have three [[incisor]]s on the top and bottom row of the dentition (the exception being is the [[sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'') which only has two lower incisor teeth).<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/><ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> The third [[molar (tooth)|molar]] has been lost. The carnassial pair is made up by the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. Like most mammals the dentition is [[heterodont]] in nature, though in some species like the [[aardwolf]] (''Proteles cristata'') the teeth have been greatly reduced and the cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. In pinnipeds the teeth are [[homodont]] as they have evolved to grasp or to catch fish, and the cheek teeth are often lost.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> In bears and raccoons the carnassial pair is secondarily reduced.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> The skulls are heavily built with a strong [[zygomatic arch]].<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> Often a [[sagittal crest]] is present, sometimes more evident in sexual dimorphic species like [[sea lion]]s and [[fur seal]]s, though it has also been greatly reduced seen in some small carnivorans.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\">{{cite book | last1 = Vaughan | first1 = T. A. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Czaplewski | first3 = N. J. | year = 2013 | chapter = | editor1-last =  | editor1-first = | editor2-last =  | editor2-first =  | title = Mammalogy | publisher = Jones & Bartlett Learning | location = Burlington, Massachusetts | pages = 1–750 |isbn = 9781284032093}}</ref> The [[braincase]] is enlarged and the [[frontoparietal]] is position at the front of it. In most species the eyes are position at the front of the face. In caniforms the rostrum is usually longer with many teeth, where in comparison with felifoms the rostrum is shorter and have fewer teeth. The carnassial teeth in feliforms, however is more sectional.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> The [[tubinares]] are large and complex in comparison to other mammals, providing a large surface area for [[olfactory receptors]].<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/>

===Postcranial region===
[[Image:Canis mesomelas vs. Arctocephalus pusillus.jpg|thumb|A [[black-backed jackal]] (''Canis mesomelas'') trying to predate on a [[brown fur seal]] (''Arctocephalus pusillus'') pup. These two species illustrate the diversity in bodyplan seen among carnivorans, especially between pinnipeds and their terrestrial relatives.]]
Aside from an accumulation of characteristics in the dental and cranial features, not much of their overall anatomy unites them as a group.<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\">{{cite book | last1 = Nowak | first1 = R. M. | year = 2005 | chapter = | editor1-last =  | editor1-first = | editor2-last =  | editor2-first =  | title = Walker's Carnivores of the World | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location= Baltimore, Maryland | pages = 1–328 |isbn = 0801880335}}</ref>  All species of carnivorans have [[quadrupedal]] [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s with usually five digits at the front feet and four digits at the back feet. In terrestrial carnivorans the feet have soft pads. The feet can either be [[digitgrade]] seen in cats, hyenas and dogs or [[plantigrade]] seen in bears, skunks, raccoons, weasels, civets and mongooses. In pinnipeds the limbs have been modified into [[flippers]]. Unlike other [[marine mammal]]s, such as [[cetacean]]s and [[sirenian]]s which have fully functional [[tail]]s to help them swim, pinnipeds use their limbs underwater for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. In [[earless seal]]s they use their back flippers; sea lions and fur seals use their front flippers, and the [[walrus]] use all of their limbs. This resulted in pinnipeds having significantly shorter tails. Aside from the pinnipeds, dogs, bears, hyenas, and cats have distinct and recognizable appearances. Dogs are usually [[cursorial]] mammals and are gracile in appearance, often relying on their teeth to hold to prey; bears are much larger and rely on their physical strength to forage for food. Cats in comparison to dogs and bears have much longer and stronger frontlimbs armed with retractable [[claws]] to hold on to prey. Hyenas are dog-like feliforms that have sloping backs due to their front legs being longer than their hindlegs. The raccoon family as well as the [[red panda]] are small, bear-like carnivorans with long tails. The other small carnivoran families [[Nandiniidae]], [[Prionodontidae]], [[Viverridae]], [[Herpestidae]], Eupleridae, [[Mephitidae]] and Mustelidae have through [[convergent evolution]] maintained the small, ancestral appearance of the miacoids, though there is some variation seen such as the robust and stout physicality of [[badger]]s and the [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo'').<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/>

Depending on the environment the species is, the length and density of their [[fur]] varies. In warm climate species the fur is often short in length and lighter. In comparison to cold climate species the fur is either dense or long, often with an oily substance to keep them warm. The pelage coloration comes in many colors, often including black, white, orange, yellow, red, and many shades of gray and brown. There can be colored patterns too, such striped, spotted, blotched, banded, or otherwise boldly patterned. There seems to be a correlation between habitat and color pattern as for example spotted or banded species tend to be found in heavily forested environments.<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/> Some species like the grey wolf is a [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species with different individual variation in colors. The [[arctic fox]] (''Vulpes lagopus'') and the [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') the fur goes from white and dense in the winter to brown and sparse in the summer. In pinnipeds, [[polar bear]]s, and sea otters have a thick insulating layer of blubber to help maintain their body temperature.

'''Guayana Esequiba''' ({{IPA-es|ɡwaˈʝana eseˈkiβa|-|ES-pe - Guayana Esequiba.ogg}}) is a disputed territory of {{convert|159500|km2|abbr=on}} west of the [[Essequibo River]] that is administered and controlled by [[Guyana]] but claimed by [[Venezuela]].<ref name=\"case\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=sNkMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false British Guiana Boundary: Arbitration with the United States of Venezuela. The Case (and Appendix) on Behalf of the Government of Her Britannic Majesty] Volume 7. Printed at the Foreign office, by Harrison and sons, 1898. </ref> The boundary dispute was inherited from the colonial powers (Spain in the case of Venezuela, and the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in the case of Guyana) and is complicated by the independence of Guyana from the United Kingdom in 1966.

The status of the territory is subject to the [[Treaty of Geneva (1966)|Geneva Agreement]], which was signed by the [[United Kingdom]], Venezuela and [[British Guiana]] on 17 February 1966. This treaty stipulates that the parties will agree to find a practical, peaceful and satisfactory solution to the dispute.<ref name=Geneva>[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20561/volume-561-I-8192-English.pdf Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana (Treaty of Geneva, 1966)] from UN</ref> Despite the treaty, Venezuela has used diplomatic, economic and military actions against Guyana, such as threatening [[economic sanctions]] against nations seeking to assist Guyana developing the territory.<ref name=\":56\">{{Cite journal|last=Ince|first=Basil A.|date=1970|title=The Venezuela-Guyana Boundary Dispute in the United Nations|url=|journal=[[Caribbean Studies]]|volume=9|issue=4|pages=5-26|via=}}</ref> Loss of the resource rich area, which constitutes about two-thirds of Guyana's territory, would do irreversible damage to the economic development of Guyana.<ref name=\":56\" />

The territory is divided by Guyana into six administrative regions: [[Barima-Waini]], [[Cuyuni-Mazaruni]], [[Pomeroon-Supenaam]], [[Potaro-Siparuni]], [[Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo]] and [[Essequibo Islands-West Demerara]]. Venezuela treats it as a single entity ''Guayana Esequiba'' or ''Zone in Reclamation'' ({{lang-es|Zona en Reclamación}}). 

==History==

=== 16th century ===

==== Dutch settlement ====
[[File:Guaiana ofte de Provincien tusschen Rio de las Amazonas ende Rio de Yuiapari ofte Orinoque.jpg|thumb|A 1625 map by [[Hessel Gerritsz]], showing Dutch territory (in yellow) ranging from the [[Orinoco River]] to the [[Amazon River]]]]
[[Dutch colonisation of the Guianas]] occurred primarily between the mouths of the [[Orinoco River]] in the west and the [[Amazon River]] to the east.<ref name=\":10\" /> By the late 1500s, Dutch presence in [[the Guianas]] is noted, though many documents of early Dutch discoveries in the region were destroyed.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|title=The Dutch in the Caribbean and on the Wild Coast|last=Goslinga|first=Cornelis|publisher=[[University of Florida Press]]|year=1971|isbn=|location=[[Gainesville, Florida]]|pages=}}</ref> The Dutch were present as far west as the [[Araya Peninsula]] in Venezuela utilizing [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pans]] in the area.<ref name=\":10\" /> By the 1570s, it was reported that the Dutch were commencing trade in the Guinanas, but little evidence exists.<ref name=\":10\" /> At the time, both the Portuguese and Spanish had not made any establishments in the area.<ref name=\":10\" /> A Dutch fort was built in 1596 at the mouth of the [[Essequibo River]] on an island, though the fort was destroyed by the Spanish later that year.<ref name=\":10\" />

In 1597, Dutch interest in traveling to the Guianas became common following the publication of ''[[The Discovery of Guiana]]'' by [[Sir Walter Raleigh]].<ref name=\":10\" /> On 3 December 1597, a Dutch expedition left [[Brielle]] and travelled the coasts between the Amazon and Orinoco.<ref name=\":10\" /> The report, written by A. Cabeljau and described as having \"more realistic information about the region\" than that of Raleigh, showed how the Dutch had travelled the Orinoco and [[Caroní River]], discovering dozens of rivers and other land previously unknown.<ref name=\":10\" /> Cabeljau wrote of good relations with the natives and that the Spanish were friendly when they encountered them in [[San Tomé, Venezuela|San Tomé]].<ref name=\":10\" /> By 1598, Dutch ships frequented the Guiana to establish settlements.<ref name=\":10\" />

=== 17th century ===
[[File:Map_of_Essequibo_and_Demerara,_1798.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Dutch colonies of Essequibo and Demerara in 1798. The Dutch map map recognizes the [[Barima River]] near the opening of the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]] as its boundary with the Spanish.]]
Another Dutch fort supported by indigenous groups was established at the mouth of the Essequibo River in 1613, though this was destroyed by the Spanish in November 1613.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 1616, Dutch ship captain Aert Adriaenszoon Groenewegen established [[Fort Kyk-Over-Al]] located {{Convert|20|mi|km|abbr=}} down the Essequibo River, where he married the daughter of an indigenous chief, controlling the Dutch colony for nearly fifty years until his death in 1664.<ref name=\":10\" />

By 1637, the Spanish wrote that the Dutch \"In those three settlements of [[Amacuro River|Amacuro]], Essequibo and [[Berbice|Berbis]] the [Dutch] have many people... all the [[Arawak|Aruacs]] and [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] are allied with him\", with later reports of the Dutch building forts from Cape North at the Amazon River to the opening of the Orinoco River.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 1639, the Spanish stated that the Dutch in Essequibo \"were further protected by 10,000 to 12,000 Caribs in the vicinity of which they frequent, and who are their allies\".<ref name=\":10\" /> Captain Groenewegen was recognized as keeping both the Spanish and Portuguese from settling in the area.<ref name=\":10\" />

In a speeches to the [[Parliament of England]] that took place on 21 January 1644, English settlers who had explored the Guianas stated that the Dutch, English and Spanish had long sought to find [[El Dorado]] in the region.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=A Collection of Voyages and Travels: Consisting of Authentic Writers in Our Own Tongue|last=Osborne|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1747|isbn=|location=|pages=749-755}}</ref> The English said that the Dutch were experienced with traveling the Orinoco River for many years.<ref name=\":11\" /> Due to their skillful travel of the Dutch on the Orinoco, the Spanish would later encounter the Dutch and prohibit them from traveling the river.<ref name=\":11\" />

In 1648, Spain signed the [[Peace of Münster]] with the [[Dutch Republic]], whereby Spain recognized the Republic's independence and also small Dutch possessions located east of the Essequibo River, which had been founded by the Dutch Republic before it was recognised by Spain. However, few decades after the Peace of Münster, the Dutch began to spread gradually west of the Essequibo River. These new settlements were regularly contested and destroyed by the Spanish authorities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Serious Dutch colonization west of the Essequibo began in the early 1650s, with the colony of [[Pomeroon (colony)|Pomeroon]] being established between the [[Moruka River]] and [[Pomeroon River]].<ref name=\":10\" /> Many of these colonists were Dutch-Brazilian Jews who had left [[Pernambuco]].<ref name=\":10\" /> In 1673, Dutch settlements were established as far as the [[Barima River]].<ref name=\":10\" />

=== 18th century ===
The French [[Encyclopédie]], published in 1757, noted that Spanish Guyana was located between the Orinoco and Essequibo River while Dutch Guyana was located between the [[Essequibo River]] and [[Maroni (river)|Maroni River]].<ref>Denis Diderot, Jean le Rond D'Alembert, Charles Marie de la Condamine (1757): \"Guiane\" in ''L'Encyclopédie'', Vol. VII, Page 7:1004 [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/ENC_7-1004.jpg See the original page on Commons] [http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.6:1672.encyclopedie0513.9958154 and the Transcription from the University of Chicago]</ref>

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Gran Colombia map.jpg|thumb|270px|An 1840 map of [[Gran Colombia]] including the Esequibo region.]]No boundary between the Spanish and Dutch possessions was ever defined.<ref name=\"Humphreys\" /> Under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], Dutch colonies of [[Demerara]], [[Berbice]] and [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] were transferred to Great Britain. In 1831, Britain merged Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo into [[British Guiana]].

In 1822 [[José Rafael Revenga]], Minister Plenipotentiary of [[Gran Colombia]] to Britain, complained to the British government at the direction of [[Simón Bolívar]] about the presence of British settlers in territory claimed by Venezuela: \"The colonists of Demerara and Berbice have usurped a large portion of land, which according to recent treaties between Spain and Holland, belongs to our country at the west of Essequibo River. It is absolutely essential that these settlers be put under the jurisdiction and obedience to our laws, or be withdrawn to their former possessions.\"

In 1824 [[Venezuela]] appointed [[José Manuel Hurtado]] as its new Ambassador to Britain. Hurtado officially presented to the British government Venezuela's claim to the border at the Essequibo River. However, the British government continued to promote colonization of territory west of the Essequibo River in succeeding years.
====Schomburgk Line====
[[File:Boundary lines of British Guiana 1896.jpg|thumb|270px|1896 map detailing British Guiana and the disputes surrounding the Schomburgk Line ]]
In 1835, under the aegis of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], the German-born explorer and [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk]] conducted [[Botany|botanical]] and [[Geography|geographical]] exploration of British Guiana. This resulted in a sketch of the territory with a line marking what he believed to be the western boundary claimed by the Dutch. As a result of this, he was commissioned in 1840 by the British government to survey Guiana's boundaries. This survey resulted in what came to be known as the \"Schomburgk Line\".<ref name=Humphreys/><ref name=\"GUYANA-VENEZUELA-BORDER\">{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter52.html|title = THE BEGINNING OF THE GUYANA-VENEZUELA BORDER DISPUTE|publisher = guyana.org| accessdate = 1 May 2009 }}</ref> Schomburgk's initial sketch, which had been published in 1840, was the only version of the \"Schomburgk Line\" published until 1886, which led to later accusations by US President [[Grover Cleveland]] that the line had been extended \"in some mysterious way\".<ref name=Humphreys>[[Robert Arthur Humphreys|Humphreys, R.

The Line went well beyond the area of British occupation, and gave British Guiana control of the mouth of the [[Orinoco]] River.<ref name=\":0\">King, Willard L.

Venezuela disputed Schomburgk's placing of border markers at the Orinoco river, and in 1844 claimed all of Guiana west of the [[Essequibo River]]. Also in 1844, a British proposal to Venezuela to modify the border to give Venezuela full control of the Orinoco river mouth and adjacent territory was ignored. In 1850 both Britain and Venezuela reached an agreement whereby they accepted not to colonize the disputed territory, although where this territory began and ended was not established.<ref name=Humphreys/>

==== Gold discoveries ====

On 21 February 1881, Venezuela proposed a frontier line starting from a point one mile to the north of the [[Moruka River]], drawn from there westward to the [[60th meridian west|60th meridian]] and running south along that meridian. This would have granted the [[Barima District]] to Venezuela.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In October 1886 Britain declared the Schomburgk Line to be the provisional frontier of British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. In 1894, Venezuela appealed to the United States to intervene, citing the [[Monroe Doctrine]] as justification. The United States did not want to get involved, only going as far as suggesting the possibility of arbitration.<ref name=\"Humphreys\" />

The longstanding dispute became a diplomatic crisis in 1895. Venezuela hired [[William Lindsay Scruggs]] as its lobbyist in Washington, D.C. Scruggs took up Venezuela's argument that British action violated the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Scruggs used his influence to get the US government to accept this claim and get involved. President [[Grover Cleveland]] adopted a broad interpretation of the Doctrine that did not just simply forbid new European colonies but declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere.<ref name=wealth2>[[Fareed Zakaria|Zakaria, Fareed]], ''From Wealth to Power'' (1999).

Ultimately Britain backed down and tacitly accepted the US right to intervene under the Monroe Doctrine. This US intervention forced Britain to accept arbitration of the entire disputed territory.<ref>http://cartografialaguayanaesequiba.blogspot.com/2014/10/la-evidencia-cartografica-de-los.html</ref>

====Treaty of Washington====

The Treaty of Arbitration between Great Britain and Venezuela was signed in Washington on 2 February 1897. This treaty specifically stipulated the legal framework for the arbitration, and its first article stated that'' \"An arbitral Tribunal shall be immediately appointed to determine the boundary line between the United States of Venezuela and the Colony of British Guiana\".''

The Treaty provided the legal framework, procedures and conditions for the Tribunal in order to solve the issue and reach to determinate a border. Its third article established that ''\"The Tribunal shall investigate and ascertain the extent of the territories belonging to, or that might lawfully be claimed by the United Netherlands or by the Kingdom of Spain respectively at the time of the acquisition by Great Britain of the Colony of British Guiana, and shall determine the boundary line between the Colony of British Guiana and the United States of Venezuela\"''. The Treaty also established the rules and principles to be followed by the Tribunal in order to draw the borderline.<ref>[http://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/GB-VE_970202_Treaty%20of%20Arbitration.pdf Treaty of arbitration between Venezuela and Great Britain, signed at Washington and dated the second day of February, 1897]</ref>

Venezuela argued that Spain–whose territory they had acquired–controlled land from the [[Orinoco River]] to the [[Amazon River]] in present day [[Brazil]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Spain, according to Venezuela, only designated its claimed Guiana territory to the Dutch, which did not include much land within the disputed territory.<ref name=\":0\" /> Meanwhile, Britain, who had acquired the Dutch territory, stated that the disputed Guiana region was not Spanish because it was so remote and uncontrolled, explaining that the original natives in the land had shared the territory's land with the Dutch instead of the Spanish and were thus under Dutch and British influence.<ref name=\":0\" />

The rival claims were presented to a tribunal of five arbitrators: two from Britain, two from the US (representing Venezuela's interest) and one from Russia, who were presumed neutral. Venezuela reiterated its claim to the district immediately west of the Essequibo, and claimed that the boundary should run from the mouth of the Moruka River southwards to the Cuyuni River, near its junction with the [[Mazaruni River]], and then along the east bank of the Essequibo to the Brazilian border. 

On 3 October 1899 the Tribunal [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895#Arbitration|ruled largely in favour of Britain]]. The Schomburgk Line was, with two deviations, established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela.<ref name=\"Humphreys\" /> One deviation was that Venezuela received [[Barima Point]] at the mouth of the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second placed the border at the [[Wenamu River]] rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela substantial territory east of the line. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory, and all of the gold mines.<ref>King (2007:260)</ref>

The Venezuelan representatives, claiming that Britain had unduly influenced the decision of the Russian member of the tribunal, protested the outcome. Periodic protests, however, were confined to the domestic political arena and international diplomatic forums.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/venezuela/forrel-guyana.htm Globalsecurity.org, \"Venezuela – Guyana Relations\"]</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:Essequiborivermap.png|thumb|250px|right|Map of Guyana, showing the [[Essequibo River]] and (shaded dark) the river's drainage basin. Venezuela claims territory up to the western bank of the river. The historical claim by the UK included the river basin well into current-day Venezuela.]]

=== Immediate reactions ===
In 1899, immediately after the arbitration ruling, the US counsel for Venezuela were interviewed jointly, and pointed out their first claims against the ruling:

<blockquote>\"Great Britain, up to the time of the intervention of the United States, distinctly refused to arbitrate any portion of the territory east of the Schomburgk line, alleging that its title was unassailable. This territory included the Attacuri river and Point Barima, which is of the greatest value strategically and commercially. The award  gives Point Barima, with a strip of land fifty miles long, to Venezuela, which thereby obtains entire control of the River Orinoco. Three thousand square miles in the interior are also awarded to Venezuela. Thus, by a decision in which the British arbitrators concurred, the position taken by Great Britain in 1895 is shown to be unfounded [...] The President of the tribunal in his closing address today had commented upon the unanimity of the present judgment and had referred to it as a proof of the success of the arbitration, but it did not require much intelligence to penetrate behind this superficial statement and to see that the line drawn is a line of compromise and not a line of right. If the British contention was right, the line should have been drawn further west; if it were wrong, the line should have been drawn much further east. There was nothing in the history of the controversy, nor in the legal principle involved, which could adequately explain why the line should be drawn where it had been. So long as arbitration was conducted on such principles, it could not be regarded as a success, at least by those who believe that arbitration should result in the admission of legal rights and not in compromises really diplomatic in character. Venezuela had gained much, but was entitled to much more, and if the arbitrators were unanimous, it must be because their failure to agree would have confirmed Great Britain in the possession of even more territory\".''<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=37&dat=18991004&id=tV0DAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tigDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3846,6830090 \"Venezuelan Award: the decision of the Commission regarded as a Compromise\"], in ''Saint John Daily Sun'', Canada. October 4, 1899. p. 8</ref></blockquote>

The Venezuelan government showed almost immediate disapproval with the 1899 Arbitral Award. As early as 7 October 1899 Venezuela voiced her condemnation of the Award, and demanded the renegotiation of her eastern border with British Guiana: that day, Venezuelan Foreign Minister José Andrade made clear that the Arbitral Award was the product of political collusion and it should not be adhered to by Venezuela..<ref name=\":6\">Kissler, Betty Jane, ''Venezuela-Guyana boundary dispute :1899–1966'', University of Texas (USA, 1972). pages 166, 172</ref><ref name=\":7\">Kaiyan Homi Kaikobad, ''Interpretation and Revision of International Boundary Decisions'', Cambridge Studies in International and Comparative Law (Cambridge University, U.K., 2007). p. 43</ref>

==== Renewed dispute ====
On 26 October 1899 in a letter to a colleague, [[Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle|Severo Mallet-Prevost]], the Official Secretary of the US–Venezuela delegation in the Tribunal of Arbitration, stated that the Arbitral Award was the result of pressures brought on the judges by the President of the Tribunal, [[Friedrich Martens]].

After numerous bilateral diplomatic attempts failed to convince Great Britain of her seriousness to nullify the award, Venezuela denounced it before the first assembly of the United Nations, in 1945.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" />

In 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government a memorandum written by Mallet-Prevost, which was written in 1944 to be published only after his death. Mallet-Prevost surmised from the private behavior of the judges that there had a political deal between Russia and Britain,<ref name=\"Schoenrich\">Schoenrich, Otto, \"The Venezuela-British Guiana Boundary Dispute\", July 1949, ''American Journal of International Law''. Vol. 43, No. 3. p. 523. Washington, DC. (USA).</ref> and said that the Russian chair of the panel, Friedrich Martens, had visited Britain with the two British arbitrators in the summer of 1899, and subsequently had offered the two American judges a choice between accepting a unanimous award along the lines ultimately agreed, or a 3 to 2 majority opinion even more favourable to the British. The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely, and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3 to 2 option with a strongly worded minority opinion, but ultimately went along with Martens to avoid depriving Venezuela of even more territory.<ref name=\"Schoenrich\" /> This memorandum provided a motive for Venezuela's contentions that there had in fact been a political deal between the British judges and the Russian judge at the Arbitral Tribunal, and led to Venezuela's revival of its claim to the disputed territory.<ref>Isidro Morales Paúl, ''Análisis Crítico del Problema Fronterizo \"Venezuela-Gran Bretaña\"'', in La Reclamación Venezolana sobre la Guayana Esequiba, Biblioteca de la Academia de Ciencias Económicas y Sociales.

==== United Nations General Assembly complaint ====
In 1962, Venezuela renewed the territorial dispute.<ref name=\":5\" /> On 12 November 1962, Venezuelan foreign minister {{ill|Marcos Falcón Briceño|es}} gave an exposition in the [[United Nations General Assembly Fourth Committee|Special Political and Decolonization Committee]] of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to denounce the [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895|1899 Paris Tribunal Arbitration]], whose ruling was favorable to the United Kingdom, citing the {{ill|Mallet-Prevost Memorandum|es|Severo Mallet-Prevost}}. Briceño argued that [[collusion]] and nullity vices led to the favorable ruling, and his exposition he stressed that Venezuela considered the Paris Arbitration as null and void because to \"acts contrary to good faith\" of the British government and the Tribunal members. Said complaints led to the [[Geneva Agreement (1966)|1966 Geneva Agreement]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lucena|first1=Anais|title=Venezuela conmemora 54 aniversario de la intervención de Marcos Falcón Briceño en la ONU|url=http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/article/venezuela-conmemora-54-aniversario-de-la-intervención-de-marcos-falcón-briceño-en-la-onu|accessdate=30 September 2017|agency=Ministerio del Poder Popular para las Relaciones Exteriores|publisher=Radio Mundial|date=12 November 2016}}</ref> Venezuela also cited as several improprieties and vices in the ruling, especially ''[[Ultra Vires]]'', due to the fact that the referees drew the border between British Guiana, Brazil and [[Suriname]], and also decreed freedom of navigation in the [[Amacuro River|Amacuro]] and [[Barima River|Barima]] rivers, exceeding the scope of powers granted by the arbitration treaty in 1897.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The Venezuelan claim of the nullity of the 1899 ruling has been acknowledged by several foreign scholars and jurists, such as J. Gillis Wetter of [[Sweden]], in his work ''The International Arbitral Process'' (1979), awarded by the [[American Society of International Law]]. By searching on the British official archives, Wetter provided further evidence of the deal between Britain and Russia, what made him conclude that the ruling was marred by serious procedural and substantive defects, evidence that it was more a political compromise than a court ruling. Uruguayan jurist Eduardo Jiménez de Aréchaga, former President of the [[International Court of Justice]], came to similar conclusions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

====Geneva Agreement====
At a meeting in [[Geneva]] on 17 February 1966, the governments of British Guiana, the United Kingdom and Venezuela signed the \"Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana\", best known thereafter as the [[Geneva Agreement (1966)]]. This agreement established the regulatory framework to be followed by the parties in order to resolve the issue. According to the agreement a Mixed Commission was installed with the purpose of seeking satisfactory solutions for the practical settlement of the border controversy,<ref>[http://peacemaker.un.org/guyana-venezuela-border66 Treaty of Geneva 1966], Document Retrieval, UN Department of Political Affairs</ref> but the parties never agreed to implement a solution within this Commission due to different interpretations of the agreement.

*Guyana argued that prior to starting the negotiations over the border issue, Venezuela should prove that the Arbitral Award of 1899 was null and void. Guyana did not accept that the 1899 decision was invalid, and held that its participation on the commission was only to resolve Venezuela's assertions. 
*Rather than that, the Venezuelan counterparts argued that the Commission did not have a juridical nature or purpose but a deal-making one, so it should go ahead to find \"a practical and satisfactory solution\", as agreed in the treaty. Venezuela also claimed that the nullity of the Arbitral Award of 1899 was implicit, or otherwise the existence of the agreement would be meaningless.

The fifth article of the Geneva Agreement established the status of the disputed territories. The provisions state that no acts or activities taking place on the disputed territories while the Agreement is in force \"shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty\". The agreement also has a provision prohibiting both nations from pursuing the issue except through official inter-government channels.

In its note of recognition of the independence of Guyana on 26 May 1966, Venezuela stated:

<blockquote>Venezuela recognises as territory of the new State the one which is located on the east of the right bank of the Essequibo River, and reiterates before the new State, and before the international community, that it expressly reserves its rights of territorial sovereignty over all the zone located on the west bank of the above-mentioned river. Therefore, the Guyana-Essequibo territory over which Venezuela expressly reserves its sovereign rights, limits on the east by the new State of Guyana, through the middle line of the Essequibo River, beginning from its source and on to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.</blockquote>

====Annexation of Ankoko Island====
Five months after Guyana's independence from the United Kingdom, Venezuelan troops began their occupation of [[Ankoko Island]] in October 1966. Venezuelan troops quickly constructed military installations and an airstrip.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Latin America and Caribbean Contemporary Record: 1982-1983, Volume 2|last=Hopkins|first=Jack W.|publisher=Holmes & Meier Publishers|year=1984|isbn=9780841909618|location=|pages=}}</ref> 

Subsequently, on the morning of the 14 October 1966, [[Forbes Burnham]], as Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs of Guyana, dispatched a protest to the Foreign Minister of Venezuela, [[Ignacio Iribarren Borges]], demanding the immediate withdrawal of Venezuelan troops and the removal of installations they had established.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2011/09/26/raul-leoni-paro-en-seco-a-guyana-en-la-isla-anacoco-documento/|title=Raúl Leoni paró en seco a Guyana en la Isla Anacoco (documento)|last=|first=|date=26 September 2011|website=[[La Patilla]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202054932/http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2011/09/26/raul-leoni-paro-en-seco-a-guyana-en-la-isla-anacoco-documento/|archive-date=2011-12-02|access-date=17 January 2020}}</ref> Venezuelan minister Ignacio Iribarren Borges replied stating \"the Government of Venezuela rejects the aforementioned protest, because Anacoco Island is Venezuelan territory in its entirety and the Republic of Venezuela has always been in possession of it\".<ref name=\":12\" /> Modern Venezuelan news outlet ''[[La Patilla]]'' stated in 2011 that Venezuelan president [[Raúl Leoni]]'s response \"was of such forcefulness, that until today Anacoco Island is Venezuelan territory and from that moment operates a Venezuelan airport and a military base there\".<ref name=\":12\" />

After the uprising, Venezuela President [[Rafael Caldera]] and [[Forbes Burnham|Burnham]] were concerned with the reclamation of [[Guayana Esequiba]]. Their concern led to the Port of Spain Protocol in 1970.

====Port of Spain Protocol====
In 1970, after the expiration of the Mixed Commission established according to the Geneva Agreement, Presidents [[Rafael Caldera]] and [[Forbes Burnham]] signed the Port of Spain Protocol, which declared a 12-year moratorium on Venezuela's reclamation of Guayana Esequiba, with the purpose of allowing both governments to promote cooperation and understanding while the border claim was in abeyance. Venezuelan maps produced since 1970 show the entire area from the eastern bank of the Essequibo, including the islands in the river, as Venezuelan territory. On some maps, the western Essequibo region is called the \"Zone in Reclamation\".<ref>[http://www.guyana.org/features/trail_diplomacy.html Ishmael, Dr. Odeen. \"The Trail of Diplomacy – A Documentary History of the Guyana-Venezuela Border Issue\"]</ref>

In 1983 the deadline of the Port of Spain Protocol expired, and the Venezuelan President [[Luis Herrera Campins]] decided not to extend it anymore and resume the effective claim over the territory. Since then, the contacts between Venezuela and Guyana within the provisions of the Treaty of Geneva are under the recommendations of a [[UN Secretary General]]'s representative, who can be changed from time to time under agreement by both parties.<ref name=Geneva/> Diplomatic contacts between the two countries and the Secretary General's representative continue, but there have been some clashes. The Norwegian [[Dag Nylander]] appointed in March 2017, is the latest personal representative in these efforts selected by the UN Secretary General [[António Guterres]]. It was stated that if by December 2017 the UN understood that there was no \"significant progress\" in resolving the dispute, Guterres would refer the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, unless the two countries explicitly requested it not to do so. In January 2018, the UN referred the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/sgsm18879.doc.htm|publisher=UN|title=Secretary-General Chooses International Court of Justice as Means for Peacefully Settling Long-Standing Guyana-Venezuela Border Controversy|date=30 January 2018}}</ref>

President [[Hugo Chávez]] eased border tensions with Guyana under advice of his mentor [[Fidel Castro]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.elnacional.com/asamblea-nacional/asamblea-nacional-ratifico-la-soberania-de-venezuela-sobre-el-esequibo/|title=Asamblea Nacional ratificó la soberanía de Venezuela sobre el Esequibo|last=|first=|date=2019-10-01|website=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]|language=es|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In 2004, Chávez said during a visit in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], Guyana that he considered the dispute to be finished.<ref name=\":1\" />[[File:Localizador Politico Venezuela.svg|thumb|Map of Venezuela, showing the maritime areas in blue and Guayana Esequiba in gray.]]

In September 2011, Guyana made an application before the United Nations' [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] in order to extend its continental shelf by a further {{convert|150|NM}}. Since the Commission requests that the areas to be considered cannot be subject to any kind of territorial disputes, the Guyanese application disregarded the Venezuelan claim over Guayana Esequiba, by saying that \"there are no disputes in the region relevant to this submission of data and information relating to the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond {{convert|200|NM|disp=sqbr}}.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minfor.gov.gy/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=37&Itemid=50|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Guyana|title=Press Release in Response to Venezuela's Objection to Guyana's Submission to the CLCS|date=15 March 2012}}</ref> Venezuela sent an objection to the Commission, rejecting the Guyanese application and warning that Guyana had proposed a limit for its continental shelf including \"the territory west of the Essequibo river, which is the subject of a territorial sovereignty dispute under the Geneva Agreement of 1966 and, within this framework, a matter for the good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations\". Venezuela also said that Guyana consulted its neighbors [[Barbados]], [[Suriname]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] before making the application, but did not do the same with Venezuela. \"Such a lack of consultation with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, serious in itself in that it violates the relevant rules, is inexplicable in so far as the coast whose projection is used by the Republic of Guyana in its attempt to extend the limits forms part of the disputed territory over which Venezuela demands and reiterates its claim to sovereignty rights\", said the Venezuelan communiqué.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/guy57_11/clcs57_2011_ven_e.pdf|publisher=UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS)|title=Communication received with regard to the submission made by Guyana to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf|date=9 March 2012}}</ref>

==== Oil discovery in Guyana ====
On 10 October 2013, the [[Bolivarian Navy of Venezuela|Venezuelan Navy]] detained an oil exploration vessel conducting seafloor surveys on behalf of the government of Guyana. The ship and its crew were escorted to the Venezuelan [[Margarita Island]] to be prosecuted. The Guyanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the vessel was in Guyanese waters,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2013/news/stories/10/12/govt-protests-after-venezuela-holds-oil-research-boat/|title=Gov't protests after Venezuela holds oil research boat|newspaper=Stabroek News|date=12 October 2013}}</ref> but its Venezuelan counterpart sent a diplomatic note to Guyana stating that the ship was conducting oil research in Venezuelan waters with no authorization from the country, and demanded an explanation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/131011/venezuela-deplores-incursion-of-vessel-under-guyanas-authorization|title=Venezuela deplores incursion of vessel under Guyana's authorization|newspaper=El Universal|date=11 October 2013|access-date=12 October 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131012101543/http://english.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/131011/venezuela-deplores-incursion-of-vessel-under-guyanas-authorization|archive-date=12 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The vessel, ''Teknik Perdana'', together with its crew, was released the next week, but its captain was charged with violating the Venezuelan exclusive economic zone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24536713#TWEET923493 |title=Venezuela frees seized US-operated ship Teknik Perdana |date=15 October 2013 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=15 October 2013}}</ref>

Despite diplomatic protests from Venezuela, the government of Guyana awarded the American oil corporation [[Exxon]] a license to drill for oil in the disputed maritime area in early 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guyana says Exxon to begin offshore drilling, Venezuela irked|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/05/guyana-exxon-mobil-idUSL1N0W72RE20150305|agency=Reuters|accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref> In May the government of Guyana announced that Exxon had indeed found promising results in their first round of drilling on the so-called Stabroek Block, an area offshore the Guayana Esequiba territory with a size of {{convert|26800|km2|abbr=on}}.

'''Guayana Esequiba''' ({{IPA-es|ɡwaˈʝana eseˈkiβa|-|ES-pe - Guayana Esequiba.ogg}}) is a disputed territory of {{convert|159500|km2|abbr=on}} west of the [[Essequibo River]] that is administered and controlled by [[Guyana]] but claimed by [[Venezuela]].<ref name=\"case\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=sNkMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false British Guiana Boundary: Arbitration with the United States of Venezuela.

Printed at the Foreign office, by Harrison and sons, 1898. </ref> The boundary dispute was inherited from the colonial powers (Spain in the case of Venezuela, and the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in the case of Guyana) and is complicated by the independence of Guyana from the United Kingdom in 1966.

The status of the territory is subject to the [[Treaty of Geneva (1966)|Geneva Agreement]], which was signed by the [[United Kingdom]], Venezuela and [[British Guiana]] on 17 February 1966. This treaty stipulates that the parties will agree to find a practical, peaceful and satisfactory solution to the dispute.<ref name=Geneva>[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20561/volume-561-I-8192-English.pdf Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana (Treaty of Geneva, 1966)] from UN</ref> Despite the treaty, Venezuela has used diplomatic, economic and military actions against Guyana, such as threatening [[economic sanctions]] against nations seeking to assist Guyana developing the territory.<ref name=\":56\">{{Cite journal|last=Ince|first=Basil A.|date=1970|title=The Venezuela-Guyana Boundary Dispute in the United Nations|url=|journal=[[Caribbean Studies]]|volume=9|issue=4|pages=5-26|via=}}</ref> Loss of the resource rich area, which constitutes about two-thirds of Guyana's territory, would do irreversible damage to the economic development of Guyana.<ref name=\":56\" />

The territory is divided by Guyana into six administrative regions: [[Barima-Waini]], [[Cuyuni-Mazaruni]], [[Pomeroon-Supenaam]], [[Potaro-Siparuni]], [[Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo]] and [[Essequibo Islands-West Demerara]]. Venezuela treats it as a single entity ''Guayana Esequiba'' or ''Zone in Reclamation'' ({{lang-es|Zona en Reclamación}}).

Another Dutch fort supported by indigenous groups was established at the mouth of the Essequibo River in 1613, though this was destroyed by the Spanish in November 1613.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 1616, Dutch ship captain Aert Adriaenszoon Groenewegen established [[Fort Kyk-Over-Al]] located {{Convert|20|mi|km|abbr=}} down the Essequibo River, where he married the daughter of an indigenous chief, controlling the Dutch colony for nearly fifty years until his death in 1664.<ref name=\":10\" />

By 1637, the Spanish wrote that the Dutch \"In those three settlements of [[Amacuro River|Amacuro]], Essequibo and [[Berbice|Berbis]] the [Dutch] have many people... all the [[Arawak|Aruacs]] and [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] are allied with him\", with later reports of the Dutch building forts from Cape North at the Amazon River to the opening of the Orinoco River.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 1639, the Spanish stated that the Dutch in Essequibo \"were further protected by 10,000 to 12,000 Caribs in the vicinity of which they frequent, and who are their allies\".<ref name=\":10\" /> Captain Groenewegen was recognized as keeping both the Spanish and Portuguese from settling in the area.<ref name=\":10\" />

In a speeches to the [[Parliament of England]] that took place on 21 January 1644, English settlers who had explored the The Guianas stated that the Dutch, English and Spanish had long sought to find [[El Dorado]] in the region.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=A Collection of Voyages and Travels: Consisting of Authentic Writers in Our Own Tongue|last=Osborne|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1747|isbn=|location=|pages=749-755}}</ref> The English said that the Dutch were experienced with traveling the Orinoco River for many years.<ref name=\":11\" /> Due to their skillful travel of the Dutch on the Orinoco, the Spanish would later encounter the Dutch and prohibit them from traveling the river.<ref name=\":11\" />

In 1648, Spain signed the [[Peace of Münster]] with the [[Dutch Republic]], whereby Spain recognized the Republic's independence and also small Dutch possessions located east of the Essequibo River, which had been founded by the Dutch Republic before it was recognised by Spain. However, few decades after the Peace of Münster, the Dutch began to spread gradually west of the Essequibo River. These new settlements were regularly contested and destroyed by the Spanish authorities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Serious Dutch colonization west of the Essequibo began in the early 1650s, with the colony of [[Pomeroon (colony)|Pomeroon]] being established between the [[Moruka River]] and [[Pomeroon River]].<ref name=\":10\" /> Many of these colonists were Dutch-Brazilian Jews who had left [[Pernambuco]].<ref name=\":10\" /> In 1673, Dutch settlements were established as far as the [[Barima River]].<ref name=\":10\" />

=== 18th century ===
The French [[Encyclopédie]], published in 1757, noted that Spanish Guyana was located between the Orinoco and Essequibo River while Dutch Guyana was located between the [[Essequibo River]] and [[Maroni (river)|Maroni River]].<ref>Denis Diderot, Jean le Rond D'Alembert, Charles Marie de la Condamine (1757): \"Guiane\" in ''L'Encyclopédie'', Vol. VII, Page 7:1004 [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/ENC_7-1004.jpg See the original page on Commons] [http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.6:1672.encyclopedie0513.9958154 and the Transcription from the University of Chicago]</ref>

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Gran Colombia map.jpg|thumb|270px|An 1840 map of [[Gran Colombia]] including the Esequibo region.]]No boundary between the Spanish and Dutch possessions was ever defined.<ref name=\"Humphreys\" /> Under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], Dutch colonies of [[Demerara]], [[Berbice]] and [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] were transferred to Great Britain. In 1831, Britain merged Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo into [[British Guiana]].

In 1822 [[José Rafael Revenga]], Minister Plenipotentiary of [[Gran Colombia]] to Britain, complained to the British government at the direction of [[Simón Bolívar]] about the presence of British settlers in territory claimed by Venezuela: \"The colonists of Demerara and Berbice have usurped a large portion of land, which according to recent treaties between Spain and Holland, belongs to our country at the west of Essequibo River. It is absolutely essential that these settlers be put under the jurisdiction and obedience to our laws, or be withdrawn to their former possessions.\"

In 1824 [[Venezuela]] appointed [[José Manuel Hurtado]] as its new Ambassador to Britain. Hurtado officially presented to the British government Venezuela's claim to the border at the Essequibo River. However, the British government continued to promote colonization of territory west of the Essequibo River in succeeding years.
====Schomburgk Line====
[[File:Boundary lines of British Guiana 1896.jpg|thumb|270px|1896 map detailing British Guiana and the disputes surrounding the Schomburgk Line ]]
In 1835, under the aegis of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], the German-born explorer and [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk]] conducted [[Botany|botanical]] and [[Geography|geographical]] exploration of British Guiana. This resulted in a sketch of the territory with a line marking what he believed to be the western boundary claimed by the Dutch. As a result of this, he was commissioned in 1840 by the British government to survey Guiana's boundaries. This survey resulted in what came to be known as the \"Schomburgk Line\".<ref name=Humphreys/><ref name=\"GUYANA-VENEZUELA-BORDER\">{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter52.html|title = THE BEGINNING OF THE GUYANA-VENEZUELA BORDER DISPUTE|publisher = guyana.org| accessdate = 1 May 2009 }}</ref> Schomburgk's initial sketch, which had been published in 1840, was the only version of the \"Schomburgk Line\" published until 1886, which led to later accusations by US President [[Grover Cleveland]] that the line had been extended \"in some mysterious way\".<ref name=Humphreys>[[Robert Arthur Humphreys|Humphreys, R.

The Line went well beyond the area of British occupation, and gave British Guiana control of the mouth of the [[Orinoco]] River.<ref name=\":0\">King, Willard L.

Venezuela disputed Schomburgk's placing of border markers at the Orinoco river, and in 1844 claimed all of Guiana west of the [[Essequibo River]]. Also in 1844, a British proposal to Venezuela to modify the border to give Venezuela full control of the Orinoco river mouth and adjacent territory was ignored. In 1850 both Britain and Venezuela reached an agreement whereby they accepted not to colonize the disputed territory, although where this territory began and ended was not established.<ref name=Humphreys/>

==== Gold discoveries ====

The dispute went unmentioned for many years until gold was discovered in the region, which disrupted relations between the United Kingdom and Venezuela.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Ince|first=Basil A.|date=1970|title=The Venezuela-Guyana Boundary Dispute in the United Nations|url=|journal=[[Caribbean Studies]]|volume=9|issue=4|pages=5-26|via=}}</ref> In 1876, gold mines inhabited mainly by English-speaking people had been established in the [[Cuyuni River|Cuyuni basin]], which was Venezuelan territory beyond the Schomburgk line but within the area Schomburgk thought Britain could claim.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} That year, Venezuela reiterated its claim up to the Essequibo River, to which the British responded with a counterclaim including the entire Cuyuni basin, although this was a paper claim which the British never intended to pursue.<ref name=\"Humphreys\" /> 

On 21 February 1881, Venezuela proposed a frontier line starting from a point one mile to the north of the [[Moruka River]], drawn from there westward to the [[60th meridian west|60th meridian]] and running south along that meridian. This would have granted the [[Barima District]] to Venezuela.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In October 1886 Britain declared the Schomburgk Line to be the provisional frontier of British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. In 1894, Venezuela appealed to the United States to intervene, citing the [[Monroe Doctrine]] as justification. The United States did not want to get involved, only going as far as suggesting the possibility of arbitration.<ref name=\"Humphreys\" />

The longstanding dispute became a diplomatic crisis in 1895. Venezuela hired [[William Lindsay Scruggs]] as its lobbyist in Washington, D.C. Scruggs took up Venezuela's argument that British action violated the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Scruggs used his influence to get the US government to accept this claim and get involved. President [[Grover Cleveland]] adopted a broad interpretation of the Doctrine that did not just simply forbid new European colonies but declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere.<ref name=wealth2>[[Fareed Zakaria|Zakaria, Fareed]], ''From Wealth to Power'' (1999).

Ultimately Britain backed down and tacitly accepted the US right to intervene under the Monroe Doctrine. This US intervention forced Britain to accept arbitration of the entire disputed territory.<ref>http://cartografialaguayanaesequiba.blogspot.com/2014/10/la-evidencia-cartografica-de-los.html</ref>

====Treaty of Washington====

The Treaty of Arbitration between Great Britain and Venezuela was signed in Washington on 2 February 1897. This treaty specifically stipulated the legal framework for the arbitration, and its first article stated that'' \"An arbitral Tribunal shall be immediately appointed to determine the boundary line between the United States of Venezuela and the Colony of British Guiana\".''

The Treaty provided the legal framework, procedures and conditions for the Tribunal in order to solve the issue and reach to determinate a border. Its third article established that ''\"The Tribunal shall investigate and ascertain the extent of the territories belonging to, or that might lawfully be claimed by the United Netherlands or by the Kingdom of Spain respectively at the time of the acquisition by Great Britain of the Colony of British Guiana, and shall determine the boundary line between the Colony of British Guiana and the United States of Venezuela\"''. The Treaty also established the rules and principles to be followed by the Tribunal in order to draw the borderline.<ref>[http://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/GB-VE_970202_Treaty%20of%20Arbitration.pdf Treaty of arbitration between Venezuela and Great Britain, signed at Washington and dated the second day of February, 1897]</ref>

Venezuela argued that Spain–whose territory they had acquired–controlled land from the [[Orinoco River]] to the [[Amazon River]] in present day [[Brazil]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Spain, according to Venezuela, only designated its claimed Guiana territory to the Dutch, which did not include much land within the disputed territory.<ref name=\":0\" /> Meanwhile, Britain, who had acquired the Dutch territory, stated that the disputed Guiana region was not Spanish because it was so remote and uncontrolled, explaining that the original natives in the land had shared the territory's land with the Dutch instead of the Spanish and were thus under Dutch and British influence.<ref name=\":0\" />

The rival claims were presented to a tribunal of five arbitrators: two from Britain, two from the US (representing Venezuela's interest) and one from Russia, who were presumed neutral. Venezuela reiterated its claim to the district immediately west of the Essequibo, and claimed that the boundary should run from the mouth of the Moruka River southwards to the Cuyuni River, near its junction with the [[Mazaruni River]], and then along the east bank of the Essequibo to the Brazilian border. 

On 3 October 1899 the Tribunal [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895#Arbitration|ruled largely in favour of Britain]]. The Schomburgk Line was, with two deviations, established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela.<ref name=\"Humphreys\" /> One deviation was that Venezuela received [[Barima Point]] at the mouth of the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second placed the border at the [[Wenamu River]] rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela substantial territory east of the line. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory, and all of the gold mines.<ref>King (2007:260)</ref>

The Venezuelan representatives, claiming that Britain had unduly influenced the decision of the Russian member of the tribunal, protested the outcome. Periodic protests, however, were confined to the domestic political arena and international diplomatic forums.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/venezuela/forrel-guyana.htm Globalsecurity.org, \"Venezuela – Guyana Relations\"]</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:Essequiborivermap.png|thumb|250px|right|Map of Guyana, showing the [[Essequibo River]] and (shaded dark) the river's drainage basin. Venezuela claims territory up to the western bank of the river. The historical claim by the UK included the river basin well into current-day Venezuela.]]

=== Immediate reactions ===
In 1899, immediately after the arbitration ruling, the US counsel for Venezuela were interviewed jointly, and pointed out their first claims against the ruling:

<blockquote>\"Great Britain, up to the time of the intervention of the United States, distinctly refused to arbitrate any portion of the territory east of the Schomburgk line, alleging that its title was unassailable. This territory included the Attacuri river and Point Barima, which is of the greatest value strategically and commercially. The award  gives Point Barima, with a strip of land fifty miles long, to Venezuela, which thereby obtains entire control of the River Orinoco. Three thousand square miles in the interior are also awarded to Venezuela. Thus, by a decision in which the British arbitrators concurred, the position taken by Great Britain in 1895 is shown to be unfounded [...] The President of the tribunal in his closing address today had commented upon the unanimity of the present judgment and had referred to it as a proof of the success of the arbitration, but it did not require much intelligence to penetrate behind this superficial statement and to see that the line drawn is a line of compromise and not a line of right. If the British contention was right, the line should have been drawn further west; if it were wrong, the line should have been drawn much further east. There was nothing in the history of the controversy, nor in the legal principle involved, which could adequately explain why the line should be drawn where it had been. So long as arbitration was conducted on such principles, it could not be regarded as a success, at least by those who believe that arbitration should result in the admission of legal rights and not in compromises really diplomatic in character. Venezuela had gained much, but was entitled to much more, and if the arbitrators were unanimous, it must be because their failure to agree would have confirmed Great Britain in the possession of even more territory\".''<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=37&dat=18991004&id=tV0DAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tigDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3846,6830090 \"Venezuelan Award: the decision of the Commission regarded as a Compromise\"], in ''Saint John Daily Sun'', Canada. October 4, 1899. p. 8</ref></blockquote>

The Venezuelan government showed almost immediate disapproval with the 1899 Arbitral Award. As early as 7 October 1899 Venezuela voiced her condemnation of the Award, and demanded the renegotiation of her eastern border with British Guiana: that day, Venezuelan Foreign Minister José Andrade made clear that the Arbitral Award was the product of political collusion and it should not be adhered to by Venezuela..<ref name=\":6\">Kissler, Betty Jane, ''Venezuela-Guyana boundary dispute :1899–1966'', University of Texas (USA, 1972). pages 166, 172</ref><ref name=\":7\">Kaiyan Homi Kaikobad, ''Interpretation and Revision of International Boundary Decisions'', Cambridge Studies in International and Comparative Law (Cambridge University, U.K., 2007). p. 43</ref>

==== Renewed dispute ====
On 26 October 1899 in a letter to a colleague, [[Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle|Severo Mallet-Prevost]], the Official Secretary of the US–Venezuela delegation in the Tribunal of Arbitration, stated that the Arbitral Award was the result of pressures brought on the judges by the President of the Tribunal, [[Friedrich Martens]].

After numerous bilateral diplomatic attempts failed to convince Great Britain of her seriousness to nullify the award, Venezuela denounced it before the first assembly of the United Nations, in 1945.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" />

In 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government a memorandum written by Mallet-Prevost, which was written in 1944 to be published only after his death. Mallet-Prevost surmised from the private behavior of the judges that there had a political deal between Russia and Britain,<ref name=\"Schoenrich\">Schoenrich, Otto, \"The Venezuela-British Guiana Boundary Dispute\", July 1949, ''American Journal of International Law''. Vol. 43, No. 3. p. 523. Washington, DC. (USA).</ref> and said that the Russian chair of the panel, Friedrich Martens, had visited Britain with the two British arbitrators in the summer of 1899, and subsequently had offered the two American judges a choice between accepting a unanimous award along the lines ultimately agreed, or a 3 to 2 majority opinion even more favourable to the British. The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely, and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3 to 2 option with a strongly worded minority opinion, but ultimately went along with Martens to avoid depriving Venezuela of even more territory.<ref name=\"Schoenrich\" /> This memorandum provided a motive for Venezuela's contentions that there had in fact been a political deal between the British judges and the Russian judge at the Arbitral Tribunal, and led to Venezuela's revival of its claim to the disputed territory.<ref>Isidro Morales Paúl, ''Análisis Crítico del Problema Fronterizo \"Venezuela-Gran Bretaña\"'', in La Reclamación Venezolana sobre la Guayana Esequiba, Biblioteca de la Academia de Ciencias Económicas y Sociales.

==== United Nations General Assembly complaint ====
In 1962, Venezuela renewed the territorial dispute.<ref name=\":5\" /> On 12 November 1962, Venezuelan foreign minister {{ill|Marcos Falcón Briceño|es}} gave an exposition in the [[United Nations General Assembly Fourth Committee|Special Political and Decolonization Committee]] of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to denounce the [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895|1899 Paris Tribunal Arbitration]], whose ruling was favorable to the United Kingdom, citing the {{ill|Mallet-Prevost Memorandum|es|Severo Mallet-Prevost}}. Briceño argued that [[collusion]] and nullity vices led to the favorable ruling, and his exposition he stressed that Venezuela considered the Paris Arbitration as null and void because to \"acts contrary to good faith\" of the British government and the Tribunal members. Said complaints led to the [[Geneva Agreement (1966)|1966 Geneva Agreement]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lucena|first1=Anais|title=Venezuela conmemora 54 aniversario de la intervención de Marcos Falcón Briceño en la ONU|url=http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/article/venezuela-conmemora-54-aniversario-de-la-intervención-de-marcos-falcón-briceño-en-la-onu|accessdate=30 September 2017|agency=Ministerio del Poder Popular para las Relaciones Exteriores|publisher=Radio Mundial|date=12 November 2016}}</ref> Venezuela also cited as several improprieties and vices in the ruling, especially ''[[Ultra Vires]]'', due to the fact that the referees drew the border between British Guiana, Brazil and [[Suriname]], and also decreed freedom of navigation in the [[Amacuro River|Amacuro]] and [[Barima River|Barima]] rivers, exceeding the scope of powers granted by the arbitration treaty in 1897.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The Venezuelan claim of the nullity of the 1899 ruling has been acknowledged by several foreign scholars and jurists, such as J. Gillis Wetter of [[Sweden]], in his work ''The International Arbitral Process'' (1979), awarded by the [[American Society of International Law]]. By searching on the British official archives, Wetter provided further evidence of the deal between Britain and Russia, what made him conclude that the ruling was marred by serious procedural and substantive defects, evidence that it was more a political compromise than a court ruling. Uruguayan jurist Eduardo Jiménez de Aréchaga, former President of the [[International Court of Justice]], came to similar conclusions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

====Geneva Agreement====
At a meeting in [[Geneva]] on 17 February 1966, the governments of British Guiana, the United Kingdom and Venezuela signed the \"Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana\", best known thereafter as the [[Geneva Agreement (1966)]]. This agreement established the regulatory framework to be followed by the parties in order to resolve the issue. According to the agreement a Mixed Commission was installed with the purpose of seeking satisfactory solutions for the practical settlement of the border controversy,<ref>[http://peacemaker.un.org/guyana-venezuela-border66 Treaty of Geneva 1966], Document Retrieval, UN Department of Political Affairs</ref> but the parties never agreed to implement a solution within this Commission due to different interpretations of the agreement.

*Guyana argued that prior to starting the negotiations over the border issue, Venezuela should prove that the Arbitral Award of 1899 was null and void. Guyana did not accept that the 1899 decision was invalid, and held that its participation on the commission was only to resolve Venezuela's assertions. 
*Rather than that, the Venezuelan counterparts argued that the Commission did not have a juridical nature or purpose but a deal-making one, so it should go ahead to find \"a practical and satisfactory solution\", as agreed in the treaty. Venezuela also claimed that the nullity of the Arbitral Award of 1899 was implicit, or otherwise the existence of the agreement would be meaningless.

The fifth article of the Geneva Agreement established the status of the disputed territories. The provisions state that no acts or activities taking place on the disputed territories while the Agreement is in force \"shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty\". The agreement also has a provision prohibiting both nations from pursuing the issue except through official inter-government channels.

In its note of recognition of the independence of Guyana on 26 May 1966, Venezuela stated:

<blockquote>Venezuela recognises as territory of the new State the one which is located on the east of the right bank of the Essequibo River, and reiterates before the new State, and before the international community, that it expressly reserves its rights of territorial sovereignty over all the zone located on the west bank of the above-mentioned river. Therefore, the Guyana-Essequibo territory over which Venezuela expressly reserves its sovereign rights, limits on the east by the new State of Guyana, through the middle line of the Essequibo River, beginning from its source and on to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.</blockquote>

====Annexation of Ankoko Island====
Five months after Guyana's independence from the United Kingdom, Venezuelan troops began their occupation of [[Ankoko Island]] in October 1966. Venezuelan troops quickly constructed military installations and an airstrip.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Latin America and Caribbean Contemporary Record: 1982-1983, Volume 2|last=Hopkins|first=Jack W.|publisher=Holmes & Meier Publishers|year=1984|isbn=9780841909618|location=|pages=}}</ref> 

Subsequently, on the morning of the 14 October 1966, [[Forbes Burnham]], as Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs of Guyana, dispatched a protest to the Foreign Minister of Venezuela, [[Ignacio Iribarren Borges]], demanding the immediate withdrawal of Venezuelan troops and the removal of installations they had established.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2011/09/26/raul-leoni-paro-en-seco-a-guyana-en-la-isla-anacoco-documento/|title=Raúl Leoni paró en seco a Guyana en la Isla Anacoco (documento)|last=|first=|date=26 September 2011|website=[[La Patilla]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202054932/http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2011/09/26/raul-leoni-paro-en-seco-a-guyana-en-la-isla-anacoco-documento/|archive-date=2011-12-02|access-date=17 January 2020}}</ref> Venezuelan minister Ignacio Iribarren Borges replied stating \"the Government of Venezuela rejects the aforementioned protest, because Anacoco Island is Venezuelan territory in its entirety and the Republic of Venezuela has always been in possession of it\".<ref name=\":12\" /> Modern Venezuelan news outlet ''[[La Patilla]]'' stated in 2011 that Venezuelan president [[Raúl Leoni]]'s response \"was of such forcefulness, that until today Anacoco Island is Venezuelan territory and from that moment operates a Venezuelan airport and a military base there\".<ref name=\":12\" />

After the uprising, Venezuela President [[Rafael Caldera]] and [[Forbes Burnham|Burnham]] were concerned with the reclamation of [[Guayana Esequiba]]. Their concern led to the Port of Spain Protocol in 1970.

====Port of Spain Protocol====
In 1970, after the expiration of the Mixed Commission established according to the Geneva Agreement, Presidents [[Rafael Caldera]] and [[Forbes Burnham]] signed the Port of Spain Protocol, which declared a 12-year moratorium on Venezuela's reclamation of Guayana Esequiba, with the purpose of allowing both governments to promote cooperation and understanding while the border claim was in abeyance. Venezuelan maps produced since 1970 show the entire area from the eastern bank of the Essequibo, including the islands in the river, as Venezuelan territory. On some maps, the western Essequibo region is called the \"Zone in Reclamation\".<ref>[http://www.guyana.org/features/trail_diplomacy.html Ishmael, Dr. Odeen. \"The Trail of Diplomacy – A Documentary History of the Guyana-Venezuela Border Issue\"]</ref>

In 1983 the deadline of the Port of Spain Protocol expired, and the Venezuelan President [[Luis Herrera Campins]] decided not to extend it anymore and resume the effective claim over the territory. Since then, the contacts between Venezuela and Guyana within the provisions of the Treaty of Geneva are under the recommendations of a [[UN Secretary General]]'s representative, who can be changed from time to time under agreement by both parties.<ref name=Geneva/> Diplomatic contacts between the two countries and the Secretary General's representative continue, but there have been some clashes. The Norwegian [[Dag Nylander]] appointed in March 2017, is the latest personal representative in these efforts selected by the UN Secretary General [[António Guterres]]. It was stated that if by December 2017 the UN understood that there was no \"significant progress\" in resolving the dispute, Guterres would refer the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, unless the two countries explicitly requested it not to do so. In January 2018, the UN referred the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/sgsm18879.doc.htm|publisher=UN|title=Secretary-General Chooses International Court of Justice as Means for Peacefully Settling Long-Standing Guyana-Venezuela Border Controversy|date=30 January 2018}}</ref>

President [[Hugo Chávez]] eased border tensions with Guyana under advice of his mentor [[Fidel Castro]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.elnacional.com/asamblea-nacional/asamblea-nacional-ratifico-la-soberania-de-venezuela-sobre-el-esequibo/|title=Asamblea Nacional ratificó la soberanía de Venezuela sobre el Esequibo|last=|first=|date=2019-10-01|website=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]|language=es|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In 2004, Chávez said during a visit in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], Guyana that he considered the dispute to be finished.<ref name=\":1\" />[[File:Localizador Politico Venezuela.svg|thumb|Map of Venezuela, showing the maritime areas in blue and Guayana Esequiba in gray.]]

In September 2011, Guyana made an application before the United Nations' [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] in order to extend its continental shelf by a further {{convert|150|NM}}. Since the Commission requests that the areas to be considered cannot be subject to any kind of territorial disputes, the Guyanese application disregarded the Venezuelan claim over Guayana Esequiba, by saying that \"there are no disputes in the region relevant to this submission of data and information relating to the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond {{convert|200|NM|disp=sqbr}}.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minfor.gov.gy/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=37&Itemid=50|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Guyana|title=Press Release in Response to Venezuela's Objection to Guyana's Submission to the CLCS|date=15 March 2012}}</ref> Venezuela sent an objection to the Commission, rejecting the Guyanese application and warning that Guyana had proposed a limit for its continental shelf including \"the territory west of the Essequibo river, which is the subject of a territorial sovereignty dispute under the Geneva Agreement of 1966 and, within this framework, a matter for the good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations\". Venezuela also said that Guyana consulted its neighbors [[Barbados]], [[Suriname]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] before making the application, but did not do the same with Venezuela. \"Such a lack of consultation with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, serious in itself in that it violates the relevant rules, is inexplicable in so far as the coast whose projection is used by the Republic of Guyana in its attempt to extend the limits forms part of the disputed territory over which Venezuela demands and reiterates its claim to sovereignty rights\", said the Venezuelan communiqué.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/guy57_11/clcs57_2011_ven_e.pdf|publisher=UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS)|title=Communication received with regard to the submission made by Guyana to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf|date=9 March 2012}}</ref>

==== Oil discovery in Guyana ====
On 10 October 2013, the [[Bolivarian Navy of Venezuela|Venezuelan Navy]] detained an oil exploration vessel conducting seafloor surveys on behalf of the government of Guyana. The ship and its crew were escorted to the Venezuelan [[Margarita Island]] to be prosecuted. The Guyanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the vessel was in Guyanese waters,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2013/news/stories/10/12/govt-protests-after-venezuela-holds-oil-research-boat/|title=Gov't protests after Venezuela holds oil research boat|newspaper=Stabroek News|date=12 October 2013}}</ref> but its Venezuelan counterpart sent a diplomatic note to Guyana stating that the ship was conducting oil research in Venezuelan waters with no authorization from the country, and demanded an explanation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/131011/venezuela-deplores-incursion-of-vessel-under-guyanas-authorization|title=Venezuela deplores incursion of vessel under Guyana's authorization|newspaper=El Universal|date=11 October 2013|access-date=12 October 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131012101543/http://english.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/131011/venezuela-deplores-incursion-of-vessel-under-guyanas-authorization|archive-date=12 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The vessel, ''Teknik Perdana'', together with its crew, was released the next week, but its captain was charged with violating the Venezuelan exclusive economic zone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24536713#TWEET923493 |title=Venezuela frees seized US-operated ship Teknik Perdana |date=15 October 2013 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=15 October 2013}}</ref>

Despite diplomatic protests from Venezuela, the government of Guyana awarded the American oil corporation [[Exxon]] a license to drill for oil in the disputed maritime area in early 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guyana says Exxon to begin offshore drilling, Venezuela irked|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/05/guyana-exxon-mobil-idUSL1N0W72RE20150305|agency=Reuters|accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref> In May the government of Guyana announced that Exxon had indeed found promising results in their first round of drilling on the so-called Stabroek Block, an area offshore the Guayana Esequiba territory with a size of {{convert|26800|km2|abbr=on}}.

Aeneas Francon Williams was born in [[Liscard]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], Cheshire, the second son of four to [[John Francon Williams]] [[FRGS]], and Barbara Balmain Dougall. Aeneas had three brothers, John Balmain, [[David Dougal Williams]] [[FRSA]] and George Stanley, and a sister, Margaret Mary Ann Williams. Aeneas was baptized at St. Peter's Church, [[Liverpool]], on 20 July 1886.<ref>http://www.ancestry.com – Liverpool F.C., Lancashire, England, Baptisms 1813–1906 – Aeneas Francon Williams, son of John and Barbara Williams, St. Peter’s Church, Liverpool F.C., 20 July 1886.</ref> During Aeneas's formative years he was educated privately. From 1900 to 1906 Aeneas attended the Technical Institute and Student Teacher Centre in [[Walthamstow]], and from 1906 to 1908 he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[Moray House Training College]]. In 1932 Aeneas returned to [[Edinburgh]] where he studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]] New College for a further two years. 
Aeneas's father [[John Francon Williams]], who was born in 1854 in the village of [[Llanllechid]] in Caernarvonshire, [[North Wales]], was a published writer, newspaper editor, [[geographer]], inventor, historian and [[cartographer]].<ref>John Francon Williams World Catalogue:http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=John+Francon+Williams&qt=results_page</ref><ref>John Francon Williams, (inventions) reference BT 51/4/5500, registered design No 5500, 1884 April 21, and, registered design reference BT 51/4/5499, 1884 April 21, The National Archives, Kew</ref><ref>A Class-Book of Modern Geography by J.

===Kalimpong===

At the age of twenty-four, Aeneas Williams attended the [[1910 World Missionary Conference]] hosted at the [[Assembly Hall of the United Free Church of Scotland|Assembly Hall]] in Edinburgh from 14 to 23 June. The Conference is a marker for the beginning of the modern Protestant Christian ecumenical movement. The [[Church of Scotland]] missionary [[John Anderson Graham]] appeared at the conference both as a guest speaker and as a member of the audience. He was also there to encourage donations to aid his mission [[Dr. Graham's Homes|St Andrew's Colonial Home]] in [[Kalimpong]], West Bengal. The spirit of the Conference was driven by the Protestant Christian Missionary community slogan: ‘The Evangelization of the World in this Generation.’ Whether Aeneas attended one conference, or several is undocumented, but it was during the event he got his calling to become a [[missionary]]. Later that same year Aeneas arrived in [[India]] and was stationed in [[Kalimpong]] at St Andrew's Colonial Home (later renamed [[Dr. Graham's Homes]]) – an orphanage/school – where he was assistant schoolmaster and taught Geography and Science.<ref>Dr. Graham's Kalimpong Homes – [[National Library of Scotland]] Blog with original photographs from [[Kalimpong]] during early 1900s: http://blog.nls.uk/dr-grahams-kalimpong-homes/</ref><ref>Marriage Certificate for Aeneas Francon Williams and Clara Anne Rendall, 2 December 1914: Findmypast.co.uk – Williams rank of profession is registered as ‘Assistant School Master.’</ref> As the school expanded, Williams took on the role of Bursar.

Williams’ first book, ''A Pronouncement of the Public Conscience'', was published in 1921. At the beginning of January 1921, Aeneas, his wife, and their two young offspring (aged 4) sailed from [[Calcutta]] on board the ([[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company]] Line) SS ''Soudan''<ref>Incoming Passenger List: SS Soudan, port of arrival London, 18 January 1921: passengers A. Francon Williams (schoolmaster), Clara A Williams, Alfred F. and Beatrice C.</ref> en route to the UK. The family arrived in the [[Port of London]] on 18 January from where they travelled up to [[Scotland]]. It was the first time the two young children Alfred and Beatrice had visited [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. During the trip, Aeneas undertook a short fundraising tour in aid of [[Dr. Graham's Homes|St Andrew's Colonial Home]] in Kalimpong, during which he gave lantern shows with spoken commentary. His shows were performed on variety bills and in Church Halls. The photographic slides were projected upon a large screen and depicted life at St Andrew's Colonial Home, views of the [[Eastern Himalayas]], and life as a missionary in [[India]]. One of Williams’ presentations was given at a variety concert at [[Elie]] in [[Fife]] held on 23 September at which Major-General Sir [[George Kenneth Scott-Moncrieff]] introduced the acts.<ref>''Dundee Courier'', 24 September 1921, p.3 – Variety Concert at Elie (review) – A variety concert gave a successful entertainment in the Parish Church Hall Elie in aid of the St Andrew's Colonial Home, Kalimpong.</ref> Williams shared the bill with various vocal and instrumental performers, as well as a young dancer.

In late March/early April 1922, [[Dr. Graham's Homes|St Andrew's Colonial Home]] played host to the first [[1922 British Mount Everest expedition|Mount Everest expedition]]. There had been a [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|reconnaissance expedition]] the previous year but the 1922 expedition was the first attempt to conquer the summit. The main team members were [[Charles Granville Bruce|General Charles Granville Bruce]], [[Edward Lisle Strutt]], [[George Mallory]], [[George Ingle Finch]], [[Edward Felix Norton]], [[Henry Treise Morshead]], [[Howard Somervell]], Arthur Wakefield, and the photographer and movie maker [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]]. Making up the rest of the team was a large group of Tibetan and Nepalese Sherpa's and porters who tendered the pace of donkey's laden with food and equipment. The party arrived by steam train at [[Kalimpong]] Road Station from where they trekked the short distance up the hillside to St Andrew's Colonial Home for three days relaxation. There was much excitement among the staff and children at St Andrew's, with football games, golf, and group evening sing-alongs taking place in the main school hall. Aeneas, his wife Clara, and their two 6-year-old children were at the centre of the hospitality, with Wolseley House (among other houses in the school compound) providing temporary accommodation for the lead mountaineers.<ref>[[National Library of Scotland]], Level 15 Special Archives, Kalimpong Papers: Files ACC 6039, Box 15 (1) ‘Everest Climbers’ 1922, pages 37–40, documents the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition visit to St Andrew’s Colonial Home (within the hand-typed biography of St Andrew’s Colonial Home). Mr Williams' enthusiasm is mentioned in the account. :https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/19dd2070-a22d-389b-91c8-a144960371bc</ref> At the end of their stay the expedition headed off to [[Phari Dzong]] and further on to [[Kampa Dzong]], which they reached on 11 April. They reached their base camp at [[Rongbuk Glacier]] on 1 May. Sadly, the expedition's attempt to ascent [[Everest]] turned out to be unsuccessful. John Noel produced a movie of the expedition titled ''Climbing Mount Everest (1922)''.<ref>''Climbing Mount Everest'' (1922) – Directed by [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]] – housed at the [[British Film Institute]]: https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-climbing-mt-everest-1922-online</ref> The movie shows the team arriving in a steam train at [[Kalimpong]] Road Station and at St. Andrew's Colonial Home, although footage taken within the school compound is not included in the movie. The 1922 expedition did establish a new world record climbing height of 8,326 metres (27,320 ft). The teams next attempt to conquer [[Everest]] took place in 1924. It was during this expedition that [[George Mallory]] and his companion [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Andrew Irvine]] made an attempt to reach the summit together but at some point died in a fall, although until this day it is still unsure whether or not the pair did actually reach the summit? Mallory's body was only retrieved in 1999; Irvine's body has never been found.

On 5 February 1924, Aeneas and Clara with their two young children (aged seven) sailed from [[Calcutta]] aboard SS ''Hosang'' (Indo-China Steam Navigation Company) to Shanghai, China, where, upon arrival they then caught a steamer and sailed 1,000 miles up the [[River Yangtze]] (Cháng Jiāng)<ref>Photograph of the Yangtze River at Yichang, Sichuan, China, in 1927, showing a passenger steamer and other small boats used on the river: International Mission Photography Archive, ca.1860-ca.1960: Yale Divinity Library Special Collections:  http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15799coll123/id/82992/rec/1</ref> to the [[Church of Scotland]] (Training Institution) in [[Ichang]].<ref>[[National Library of Scotland]], Catalogue of MSS.

Aeneas and Clara immediately took Chinese language lessons and both became fluent in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. The port of [[Ichang]] was one of four ports open to foreign trade, and the highest reached by steamers. The city of [[Ichang]] was situated right in the center of China, on a low promontory on the North bank of the [[River Yangtze]]. It was a prefectural city of considerable importance in the province of [[Hupeh]], and conveniently situated as a mart for the tea trade of Hoh-fung-chow. [[Opium]] was also grown in the district as was the [[tung tree]], from which tung oil is extracted. ‘The China Inland Mission possessed a number of unique features which set it apart from established missionary societies and gave it an intensity and, perhaps, a glamour, which other more conventional organisations must have envied.’<ref>Dr. Rosemary Seton, former Archivist, School of Oriental and African Studies: China Inland Mission, 1865–1951 from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London: http://www.ampltd.co.uk/collections_az/CIM-2/highlights.aspx</ref> During his stay in China, Aeneas wrote the poem ''Voice of an Oracle (in Old China)''.<ref>''Voice of an Oracle (in Old China)'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, ''Let Poets Sing'', p. 46-48</ref> In December 1926, Aeneas received a worrying letter from the [[Church of Scotland]] offices in [[Edinburgh]] talking of anxious happenings in [[Hankow]] and the possibility of a General Strike in China.<ref>Letter to Aeneas Francon Williams from the [[Church of Scotland]] office in [[Edinburgh]] dated 30 November 1926 stored in the Dr. Graham Kalimpong Archive held at the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh.</ref> In the [[House of Commons]] the [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Austen Chamberlain]] intimated that the British Government were talking of taking immediate steps for the protection of U.K. nationals stationed in [[China]].

In October 1927, while in the U.K., Aeneas was invited to attend the annual [[Church of Scotland]] Young Men's Guild Conference held in [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]], over the weekend commencing Friday 21 October. The main objectives of the conference were to revive the interest of the churches in the work of the Guild, and to demonstrate anew the value and usefulness of such an organization as auxiliary of Church life. Two halls had been booked for the occasion, the Beveridge and Adam Smith Halls, and on Friday evening Aeneas gave a missionary address at the Beveridge Hall about his work in [[Kalimpong]], [[India]], and in [[Ichang]], [[China]].<ref>''Fife Free Press & Kirkcaldy Guardian'', Saturday 15 October 1927, page 7 – Church of Scotland Young Men's Guild Conference in Kirkcaldy (1927) report (retrieved 6 March 2018)</ref> It was at the 1888 meeting of the Guild held in the same town of Kirkcaldy that Dr. [[John Anderson Graham]] made the momentous decision and choice to establish a charitable school for destitute children in [[India]], and was thus ordained as the first missionary supported by the Guild.<ref>''The Meaning of White: Race, Class, and the 'Domiciled Community' in British India 1858–1930'' by Satoshi Mizutani, publ.

The Central Committee of Management of the Guild headed by the chairman Rev. T.B. Stewart Thomson had compiled an interesting program of events throughout the weekend. The conference opened with a civic reception by the Provost and Magistrates at the Beveridge Hall on the Friday, followed by a welcoming tea, after which Aeneas gave his missionary address at Beveridge Hall. The conference concluded on the Sunday evening with a public meeting at the Adam Smith Hall with guest speakers the Right Hon. [[William Murdoch Adamson]] M.P. and the Very Rev Dr. [[John White (minister)|John White]] DD LLD, ex-[[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]].

===Mahakalguri, West Bengal===
In late 1927, Aeneas and Clara returned to [[India]] where they were stationed at Mahakalguri, Eastern [[Dooars]] (Duars). Here Aeneas took on the role of missionary Pastor. Their two children Alfred and Clara remained in [[Edinburgh]] in order to continue their studies at [[George Watson's College]]. The [[Church of Scotland]] ran a children’s home in the little country village of [[Duddingston]], near [[Edinburgh]], which was founded specifically for children of foreign missionaries, where the parents were unable to take their children abroad with them. The home was called Home House and was under the care of Miss Paterson (a Deaconess of the [[Church of Scotland]]) and her sister Minnie. The two sisters were referred to as ‘Aunty’ by the children.<ref>''Alice Maxwell Deaconess'' by Mrs. Horatio Macrae, published by Hodder & Stoughton, 1920 – pages 180-181</ref> The house in Old Church Lane had a large rear garden and was close enough to [[Edinburgh]] for the children to attend school there, yet surrounded by the bracing fresh air of the open countryside.<ref>Home-House, Old Church Lane, Duddingston – Category B Listed building: http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB29462</ref> It was at Home House that Alfred and Beatrice boarded during part of their education at [[George Watson’s College]]. 
[[File:The former Home House, Old Church Lane, Duddingston, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The former '''Home House''', Old Church Lane, [[Duddingston]], [[Edinburgh]]]]

In 1928, Aeneas Francon Williams was licensed by the Presbytery of [[Eastern Himalaya]] and in November of that same year he took his holy orders and was ordained by the Presbytery at [[Siliguri]], in [[North Bengal]]. The Presbytery of Edinburgh admitted Williams to the [[Church of Scotland]] on 28 May 1932.

===Matelli, West Bengal===
In 1929, Aeneas was stationed at the [[Church of Scotland]] Guild Mission in [[Matelli]] in the [[Jalpaiguri]] district of [[West Bengal]] where he was the Minister of the [[Jalpaiguri]] Parish. At the Mission compound in Matelli, Aeneas and his family resided at the Manse. Through its schools – St. Ninian's 'Middle' school, St. Margaret's 'High' school, and its boys and girls Day Schools in Calcutta, boys school in Chinsura, the Abbey School, and various primary schools in Budge Budge, and its College – the Church of Scotland Mission offered Christian education from the kindergarten to the University stage.

In 1930, ''Hymn Book in Jalpaiguri Mech'' by Aeneas Francon Williams was published. The book was intended for the use of Christians of the [[Mech Tribe]]s living at the foot of the [[Himalayas]] in the [[Jalpaiguri]] district and was the first Hymn Book to be published in this regional dialect of [[Hindi]].<ref>The One Hundred and First Report of the Calcutta Christian Tract and Book Society (Incorporated) 1930/1931, page 7 & 10:(retrieved document 16 July 2017): The document mentions 2,000 copies of Hymn Book in Jalpaiguri Mech by Aeneas Francon Williams were purchased by the Book Society for distribution: http://images.library.yale.edu/divinitycontent/dayrep/Calcutta%20Christian%20Tract%20and%20Book%20Society%201930-1931%20v101.pdf</ref>
While Aeneas was living in [[Matelli]] he owned a [[Cinchona]] ([[quinine]]) plantation.

On 7 March 1930, Clara, being the only female along with two Babu's, was appointed under the provisions of rule 63(2), Chapter IV of the Bengal Jail Code, as a non-official visitor of the Alipur Duar Suli Jail in the [[Jalpaiguri district]] of [[West Bengal]] for a period of two years.<ref>''The Calcultta Gazette'', 13 March 1930 page 390, No. 886J: Babu Manish Chandra Roy, Babu Lalit Behari Ghosh, and Mrs. Francon Williams are appointed as non-official visitors of the Alipur Duar Suli Jail: https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.45159/2015.45159.The-Calcutta-Gazette-1930-January---June#page/n873/mode/2up/search/Francon+williams</ref> The appointment of the three non-official visitors was to help in the rehabilitation of the inmates by helping to change the offender's values, motivations, and attitudes, so that they could become contributing members of society upon their release. The non-official visitors would visit the jail periodically and attend to requests from the inmates pertaining to their care and welfare. At the end of their visits they would enter any observations about their time at the jail in the visitor's book.<ref>The State Governments framed rules regarding appointments and visits by official and non official visitors in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section 25 of section 59 of the Prisons Act. 1894:  http://ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/PSI/Prison2012/CHAPTER-10.pdf</ref>

In 1932, Williams visited [[Scotland]], during which he supported as many church events and meetings as he could comfortably fit into his schedule. In late-September, Williams showed his support for the ‘Forward Movement’ campaign launched by [[West Lothian]] Churches. At the campaign he gave a powerful speech detailing his all-absorbing work in [[India]] as a missionary.<ref>''Edinburgh Evening News'', Friday 23 September 1932, page 7 – Forward Movement (report) Campaign by West Lothian Churches</ref> On 3 October, Williams attended the Young Men's Guild of the Linlithgow and Falkirk Council at which he addressed the large attendance with more stories of his work and adventures as a missionary in [[North Bengal]]. ‘Mr. Williams’ address brought out in a wonderful way the romance of the mission fields, and the speaker dealt in a most interesting manner with his own particular work among the depressed races in the Eastern Duars.’<ref>''Linlithgowshire Gazette'', Friday 7 October 1932, page 5 – Young Men's Guild (report)</ref> In 1934, Aeneas and Clara's son Alfred at the age of eighteen enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he would study medicine for the next six years.

In the summer of 1937, Aeneas and Clara, accompanied by their two offspring, Alfred (a medical student) and Beatrice (a nurse), sailed from [[Dooars]], [[India]], to America where they arrived in [[New York City]] on 16 August 1937 aboard SS ''Caledonia'' II.<ref>http://www.ancestry.com – New York Passenger Lists, 1820–1957 – Aeneas Francon Williams arrived New York on 16 August 1937 aboard SS Caledonia II.

Williams’ first volume of poems ''Dream Drift, by a Young Lover'' was published in 1938. The book was dedicated to his wife Clara. The suggestion of a priest being perceived as a ‘young lover’ was a bold move on both Williams and the publisher's part. It was certainly uncommon for a member of the cloth to reveal a poetic side that included talk of lovemaking. ''The Dundee Courier'' in their appraisal of the work noted that, ‘Mr. Williams' poems reveal their author in many moods, as a nature lover, sportsman, and lover. Only an angler could have written his poems on ''Fishing'' and ''Wound Up''. There is a whimsical, almost ‘Barriesque’ ([[James M.

Aeneas would find small nuggets of inspiration obscured in the noise of life. In his poem, ''To A Dead Bird,'' Williams immortalizes a solitary dead bulbul; an Indian nightingale he found lying near a bush in the Manse in Bengal where he lived. He explains; 'I put it in my pocket handkerchief and with a little burial service I laid it to rest in our consecrated burial ground opposite Manse Gate.<ref>''Let Poet's Sing'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, page 41 – ''To A Dead Bird''.</ref>

On 13 May 1942, Aeneas and Clara's daughter Beatrice married Dr. Stephen Ian Pugh of [[Builth Wells]], [[Breconshire]], [[Wales]].<ref>Northern Isles Family History: https://www.bayanne.info/Shetland/getperson.php?personID=I390221&tree=ID1</ref> The couple later emigrated to [[Tasmania]] where they lived their entire lives in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]].

In 1945, Aeneas and Clara spent a summer vacation at [[Kodaikanal]], a resort in the [[Cardamom Hills]] (Yela Mala), a mountain range in [[South India]], where their son Alfred, who was now a Captain in the RAMC ([[Royal Army Medical Corps]]) and stationed in [[Burma]], joined them. It was while Aeneas was in the [[Cardamom Hills]] that he wrote his poem ''Flowers''.<ref>''Flowers'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, ''Let Poets Sing'' p. 34</ref>

On 1 January 1946, in the New Year Indian Honours List, Clara (Mrs. Francon Williams) was awarded the [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal]] (Emperor of India) Bronze Medal for her work during [[WWII]] being in-charge of [[Red Cross]] work in [[Dooars]], [[Bengal]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Medical News |journal=The Indian Medical Gazette |date=December 1945 |volume=80 |issue=12 |pages=629–632 |pmc=5218119 |pmid=29015760 }}</ref>

In 1947, when [[India]] was granted Independence, Clara returned to [[Scotland]] to set up home in [[Edinburgh]]. Aeneas remained in India at the Mission during the handover. 
After the inauguration of [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]] on 15 August 1947, Aeneas wrote 'Report 1947, The Work of the Church of Scotland Mission in Bengal During a Momentous Year', documenting what he saw and encountered in [[India]] during and after the handover. Much rejoicing took place in all the Mission institutions. The new Constitution (not yet fully adopted) guaranteed freedom 'to profess, practice and propagate' any religion. When pupils were asked, now that India was free would they rather there was no teaching about Christianity in school, the answer was always the same, that it was because of such teachings that they wished to study at the Mission. In fact, the Mission had since Independence Day been besieged with new applications for admission. However, Aeneas noted the College was experiencing a communal 'low' in staffing levels, with the shortage of Christian professors becoming an 'anxiety.' The Mission staffing levels had also fallen (to eight women and four men) and the Foreign Mission Committee was doing everything in its power to find new recruits.
Looking ahead, Aeneas spoke of a 'partnership,' a 'Home Mission,' uniting the Mission of the [[Church of Scotland]] in India with the Church in India, and in his Report 1947 Aeneas stated: ''The Indian Church is now alive to her missionary responsibilities in this land and is heartily in favor of the new proposals, but the task is out of all proportion to her present resources, and it is only if the Church of Scotland continues her support in personnel and in finances that it can be accomplished. For the Church as for the nation it may be that a new day is dawning.''<ref>Report 1947: The Work of the Church of Scotland Mission in Bengal During A Momentous Year (1947), pamphlet, published Church of Scotland, 1947 – Centre for the Study of World Christianity Library, University of Edinburgh, Pamphlet – Reference: Pamphlet BV3280. B4. Chu</ref>

In 1948 after the handover, Aeneas sold his [[Cinchona]] plantation and other personal property and returned to the U.K. to join his wife in [[Edinburgh]], where they resided at 46 Belgrave Road. When Aeneas and Clara returned to Edinburgh for good they brought with them their pet chimpanzee named ‘Glyris’, which lived with them at their home at Belgrave Road.

Aeneas and Clara's son Alfred married Jane Warhurst (née Smith) on 29 March 1950 at St. Aidan's Church, [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]].<ref>Marriage announcement in ''The Scotsman'' newspaper, Thursday 30 March 1950, page 10.</ref> Jane is a second cousin once removed of the author [[David Herbert Lawrence]] through her mother Lillian's sister Aunt Ada (née Rex) who married George Beardsall.

==Later life==
Aeneas and Clara were both bilingual; Aeneas spoke eight languages fluently including [[Hindi]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. In Edinburgh, Aeneas was Chaplain of Edinburgh Social Services Department from 1952 and was affiliated with several churches including the former Stockbridge Free Church and [[St. Giles Cathedral]]. He was assistant Chaplain of [[HMP Edinburgh]] (Saughton) from 1948 to 1954. 
As a youngster, Aeneas grew up in a literary household (his father John Francon Williams was a newspaper and journal editor and a published writer of many books) and as such Aeneas was encouraged by his father to pursue writing. Throughout Aeneas's life he had many books published in various fields of knowledge and was also a published poet. In 1942, upon the death of Dr [[John Anderson Graham]], Aeneas was commissioned by [[Oxford University Press]] to write Dr Graham's biography for inclusion in their ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]].''

Clara Anne Williams died in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 January 1959 and is buried at [[Dean Cemetery]], Edinburgh.

After Clara passed away, Aeneas sold their house at Belgrave Road and spent time travelling the world, circumnavigating it several times. There is evidence contained in correspondence between Aeneas and the London publishing house [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan & Co. Ltd.]] that he wrote two books during these travels. His regular visits to Australia and [[New Zealand]], and especially [[Tasmania]] – where his daughter Beatrice lived in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] with her husband Dr. Stephen Pugh and their daughter Andrea<ref>Dr. Stephen Ian Pugh & family: North Isles Family History archive:
https://www.bayanne.info/Shetland/getperson.php?personID=I390221&tree=ID1</ref> – appear to have sparked his imagination. Original correspondence from Aeneas to [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]] held at The Museum of English Rural Life and Special Collections at the [[University of Reading]], mentions two new manuscripts he had written relating to his travels that he’d submitted to the publishing house. Whether MacMillan or another company published these books is unclear from the letters, as the books identify with [[Australasia]] and may only have been published in that territory, or could have remained unpublished. The two books in question are ''Tasmanian Apples'' and ''Kiwiland''. The later work is possibly associated with the flightless [[Kiwi]] bird, which Aeneas had grown particularly fond of during his visits to [[New Zealand]]. ‘I fed these interesting flightless birds in Wellington Zoo,’ Aeneas writes keenly to MacMillan. He also fed the [[tuatara]], courtesy of his friend ‘the Superintendent Mr. Curtis,’ who told him where he could see the ‘pre-historic little tuatara, the only true Saurian left on this earth, whose ancestors were at least 3,000,000 years on this planet, long before we were.’<ref>Letters: Williams, Aeneas Francon ~ 1960–1961 ~ former ref: Second series: The Museum of English Rural Life and Special Collections at the [[University of Reading]], Redlands Road, Reading, RG1 5EX: https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/special-collections/MAC_W.pdf</ref> Aeneas also mentions to his publisher that his friend Henry Kelly of the New Zealand Wildlife Department was arranging ‘to send us a live [[Kiwi]], the very first Kiwi to be in Scotland.’<ref>''i-Newspaper'', 15 June 2018, page 18 – Manuscripts and Kiwis Scarce (Reader's Grandfather helped bring first Kiwi to Scotland) (retrieved 16 June 2018): https://www.pressreader.com/uk/i-newspaper/20180615</ref> After returning from his travels abroad, Aeneas moved into 10 Carlton Street, [[Stockbridge, Edinburgh|Stockbridge]], Edinburgh, where he lived until his early-80s, before moving to [[Sheffield]], Yorkshire, to live with his son Alfred.

Aeneas died in [[Sheffield]] in 1971 and is buried with his wife Clara in [[Dean Cemetery]], Edinburgh.

Aeneas Francon Williams is the brother of artist [[David Dougal Williams]] and the grandfather of writer Iain Cameron Williams.<ref>Iain Cameron Williams: http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4751.Iain_Cameron_Williams</ref><ref>Iain Cameron Williams World Catalogue: http://www.worldcat.org/title/underneath-a-harlem-moon-the-harlem-to-paris-years-of-adelaide-hall/oclc/51780394&referer=brief_results</ref>

A cousin of Aeneas's named Jane Williams married American [[Edward Burton Hughes]]. In 1967, Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] appointed Edward Burton Hughes as Executive Deputy Commissioner of [[New York State Department of Transportation]]. In 1970, Edward Burton Hughes founded the ''E. Burton Hughes Achievement Award'' given annually to an outstanding Department employee of the [[New York State Department of Transportation]].<ref>''Spotlight Magazine'', 27 December 1973, page 16 – The ''E.

Aeneas Francon Williams was born in [[Liscard]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], Cheshire, the second son of four to [[John Francon Williams]] [[FRGS]], and Barbara Balmain Dougall. Aeneas had three brothers, John Balmain, [[David Dougal Williams]] [[FRSA]] and George Stanley, and a sister, Margaret Mary Ann Williams. Aeneas was baptized at St. Peter's Church, [[Liverpool]], on 20 July 1886.<ref>http://www.ancestry.com – Liverpool F.C., Lancashire, England, Baptisms 1813–1906 – Aeneas Francon Williams, son of John and Barbara Williams, St. Peter’s Church, Liverpool F.C., 20 July 1886.</ref> During Aeneas's formative years he was educated privately. From 1900 to 1906 Aeneas attended the Technical Institute and Student Teacher Centre in [[Walthamstow]], and from 1906 to 1908 he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[Moray House Training College]]. In 1932 Aeneas returned to [[Edinburgh]] where he studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]] New College for a further two years. 
Aeneas's father [[John Francon Williams]], who was born in 1854 in the village of [[Llanllechid]] in Caernarvonshire, [[North Wales]], was a published writer, newspaper editor, [[geographer]], inventor, historian and [[cartographer]].<ref>John Francon Williams World Catalogue:http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=John+Francon+Williams&qt=results_page</ref><ref>John Francon Williams, (inventions) reference BT 51/4/5500, registered design No 5500, 1884 April 21, and, registered design reference BT 51/4/5499, 1884 April 21, The National Archives, Kew</ref><ref>A Class-Book of Modern Geography by J.

==Missionary work==

===Kalimpong===

At the age of twenty-four, Aeneas Williams attended the [[1910 World Missionary Conference]] hosted at the [[Assembly Hall of the United Free Church of Scotland|Assembly Hall]] in Edinburgh from 14 to 23 June. The Conference is a marker for the beginning of the modern Protestant Christian ecumenical movement. The [[Church of Scotland]] missionary [[John Anderson Graham]] appeared at the conference both as a guest speaker and as a member of the audience. He was also there to encourage donations to aid his mission [[Dr. Graham's Homes|St Andrew's Colonial Home]] in [[Kalimpong]], West Bengal. The spirit of the Conference was driven by the Protestant Christian Missionary community slogan: ‘The Evangelization of the World in this Generation.’ Whether Aeneas attended one conference, or several is undocumented, but it was during the event he got his calling to become a [[missionary]]. Later that same year Aeneas arrived in [[India]] and was stationed in [[Kalimpong]] at St Andrew's Colonial Home (later renamed [[Dr. Graham's Homes]]) – an orphanage/school – where he was assistant schoolmaster and taught Geography and Science.<ref>Dr. Graham's Kalimpong Homes – [[National Library of Scotland]] Blog with original photographs from [[Kalimpong]] during early 1900s: http://blog.nls.uk/dr-grahams-kalimpong-homes/</ref><ref>Marriage Certificate for Aeneas Francon Williams and Clara Anne Rendall, 2 December 1914: Findmypast.co.uk – Williams rank of profession is registered as ‘Assistant School Master.’</ref> As the school expanded, Williams took on the role of Bursar.

Williams’ first book, ''A Pronouncement of the Public Conscience'', was published in 1921. At the beginning of January 1921, Aeneas, his wife, and their two young offspring (aged 4) sailed from [[Calcutta]] on board the ([[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company]] Line) SS ''Soudan''<ref>Incoming Passenger List: SS Soudan, port of arrival London, 18 January 1921: passengers A. Francon Williams (schoolmaster), Clara A Williams, Alfred F. and Beatrice C.</ref> en route to the UK. The family arrived in the [[Port of London]] on 18 January from where they travelled up to [[Scotland]]. It was the first time the two young children Alfred and Beatrice had visited [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. During the trip, Aeneas undertook a short fundraising tour in aid of [[Dr. Graham's Homes|St Andrew's Colonial Home]] in Kalimpong, during which he gave lantern shows with spoken commentary. His shows were performed on variety bills and in Church Halls. The photographic slides were projected upon a large screen and depicted life at St Andrew's Colonial Home, views of the [[Eastern Himalayas]], and life as a missionary in [[India]]. One of Williams’ presentations was given at a variety concert at [[Elie]] in [[Fife]] held on 23 September at which Major-General Sir [[George Kenneth Scott-Moncrieff]] introduced the acts.<ref>''Dundee Courier'', 24 September 1921, p.3 – Variety Concert at Elie (review) – A variety concert gave a successful entertainment in the Parish Church Hall Elie in aid of the St Andrew's Colonial Home, Kalimpong.</ref> Williams shared the bill with various vocal and instrumental performers, as well as a young dancer.

In late March/early April 1922, [[Dr. Graham's Homes|St Andrew's Colonial Home]] played host to the first [[1922 British Mount Everest expedition|Mount Everest expedition]]. There had been a [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|reconnaissance expedition]] the previous year but the 1922 expedition was the first attempt to conquer the summit. The main team members were [[Charles Granville Bruce|General Charles Granville Bruce]], [[Edward Lisle Strutt]], [[George Mallory]], [[George Ingle Finch]], [[Edward Felix Norton]], [[Henry Treise Morshead]], [[Howard Somervell]], Arthur Wakefield, and the photographer and movie maker [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]]. Making up the rest of the team was a large group of Tibetan and Nepalese Sherpa's and porters who tendered the pace of donkey's laden with food and equipment. The party arrived by steam train at [[Kalimpong]] Road Station from where they trekked the short distance up the hillside to St Andrew's Colonial Home for three days relaxation. There was much excitement among the staff and children at St Andrew's, with football games, golf, and group evening sing-alongs taking place in the main school hall. Aeneas, his wife Clara, and their two 6-year-old children were at the centre of the hospitality, with Wolseley House (among other houses in the school compound) providing temporary accommodation for the lead mountaineers.<ref>[[National Library of Scotland]], Level 15 Special Archives, Kalimpong Papers: Files ACC 6039, Box 15 (1) ‘Everest Climbers’ 1922, pages 37–40, documents the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition visit to St Andrew’s Colonial Home (within the hand-typed biography of St Andrew’s Colonial Home). Mr Williams' enthusiasm is mentioned in the account. :https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/19dd2070-a22d-389b-91c8-a144960371bc</ref> At the end of their stay the expedition headed off to [[Phari Dzong]] and further on to [[Kampa Dzong]], which they reached on 11 April. They reached their base camp at [[Rongbuk Glacier]] on 1 May. Sadly, the expedition's attempt to ascent [[Everest]] turned out to be unsuccessful. John Noel produced a movie of the expedition titled ''Climbing Mount Everest (1922)''.<ref>''Climbing Mount Everest'' (1922) – Directed by [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]] – housed at the [[British Film Institute]]: https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-climbing-mt-everest-1922-online</ref> The movie shows the team arriving in a steam train at [[Kalimpong]] Road Station and at St. Andrew's Colonial Home, although footage taken within the school compound is not included in the movie. The 1922 expedition did establish a new world record climbing height of 8,326 metres (27,320 ft). The teams next attempt to conquer [[Everest]] took place in 1924. It was during this expedition that [[George Mallory]] and his companion [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Andrew Irvine]] made an attempt to reach the summit together but at some point died in a fall, although until this day it is still unsure whether or not the pair did actually reach the summit? Mallory's body was only retrieved in 1999; Irvine's body has never been found.

On 5 February 1924, Aeneas and Clara with their two young children (aged seven) sailed from [[Calcutta]] aboard SS ''Hosang'' (Indo-China Steam Navigation Company) to Shanghai, China, where, upon arrival they then caught a steamer and sailed 1,000 miles up the [[River Yangtze]] (Cháng Jiāng)<ref>Photograph of the Yangtze River at Yichang, Sichuan, China, in 1927, showing a passenger steamer and other small boats used on the river: International Mission Photography Archive, ca.1860-ca.1960: Yale Divinity Library Special Collections:  http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15799coll123/id/82992/rec/1</ref> to the [[Church of Scotland]] (Training Institution) in [[Ichang]].<ref>[[National Library of Scotland]], Catalogue of MSS.

Aeneas and Clara immediately took Chinese language lessons and both became fluent in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. The port of [[Ichang]] was one of four ports open to foreign trade, and the highest reached by steamers. The city of [[Ichang]] was situated right in the center of China, on a low promontory on the North bank of the [[River Yangtze]]. It was a prefectural city of considerable importance in the province of [[Hupeh]], and conveniently situated as a mart for the tea trade of Hoh-fung-chow. [[Opium]] was also grown in the district as was the [[tung tree]], from which tung oil is extracted. ‘The China Inland Mission possessed a number of unique features which set it apart from established missionary societies and gave it an intensity and, perhaps, a glamour, which other more conventional organisations must have envied.’<ref>Dr. Rosemary Seton, former Archivist, School of Oriental and African Studies: China Inland Mission, 1865–1951 from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London: http://www.ampltd.co.uk/collections_az/CIM-2/highlights.aspx</ref> During his stay in China, Aeneas wrote the poem ''Voice of an Oracle (in Old China)''.<ref>''Voice of an Oracle (in Old China)'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, ''Let Poets Sing'', p. 46-48</ref> In December 1926, Aeneas received a worrying letter from the [[Church of Scotland]] offices in [[Edinburgh]] talking of anxious happenings in [[Hankow]] and the possibility of a General Strike in China.<ref>Letter to Aeneas Francon Williams from the [[Church of Scotland]] office in [[Edinburgh]] dated 30 November 1926 stored in the Dr. Graham Kalimpong Archive held at the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh.</ref> In the [[House of Commons]] the [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Austen Chamberlain]] intimated that the British Government were talking of taking immediate steps for the protection of U.K. nationals stationed in [[China]].

In October 1927, while in the U.K., Aeneas was invited to attend the annual [[Church of Scotland]] Young Men's Guild Conference held in [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]], over the weekend commencing Friday 21 October. The main objectives of the conference were to revive the interest of the churches in the work of the Guild, and to demonstrate anew the value and usefulness of such an organization as auxiliary of Church life. Two halls had been booked for the occasion, the Beveridge and Adam Smith Halls, and on Friday evening Aeneas gave a missionary address at the Beveridge Hall about his work in [[Kalimpong]], [[India]], and in [[Ichang]], [[China]].<ref>''Fife Free Press & Kirkcaldy Guardian'', Saturday 15 October 1927, page 7 – Church of Scotland Young Men's Guild Conference in Kirkcaldy (1927) report (retrieved 6 March 2018)</ref> It was at the 1888 meeting of the Guild held in the same town of Kirkcaldy that Dr. [[John Anderson Graham]] made the momentous decision and choice to establish a charitable school for destitute children in [[India]], and was thus ordained as the first missionary supported by the Guild.<ref>''The Meaning of White: Race, Class, and the 'Domiciled Community' in British India 1858–1930'' by Satoshi Mizutani, publ.

The Central Committee of Management of the Guild headed by the chairman Rev. T.B. Stewart Thomson had compiled an interesting program of events throughout the weekend. The conference opened with a civic reception by the Provost and Magistrates at the Beveridge Hall on the Friday, followed by a welcoming tea, after which Aeneas gave his missionary address at Beveridge Hall. The conference concluded on the Sunday evening with a public meeting at the Adam Smith Hall with guest speakers the Right Hon. [[William Murdoch Adamson]] M.P. and the Very Rev Dr. [[John White (minister)|John White]] DD LLD, ex-[[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]].

===Mahakalguri, West Bengal===
In late 1927, Aeneas and Clara returned to [[India]] where they were stationed at Mahakalguri, Eastern [[Dooars]] (Duars). Here Aeneas took on the role of missionary Pastor. Their two children Alfred and Clara remained in [[Edinburgh]] in order to continue their studies at [[George Watson's College]]. The [[Church of Scotland]] ran a children’s home in the little country village of [[Duddingston]], near [[Edinburgh]], which was founded specifically for children of foreign missionaries, where the parents were unable to take their children abroad with them. The home was called Home House and was under the care of Miss Paterson (a Deaconess of the [[Church of Scotland]]) and her sister Minnie. The two sisters were referred to as ‘Aunty’ by the children.<ref>''Alice Maxwell Deaconess'' by Mrs. Horatio Macrae, published by Hodder & Stoughton, 1920 – pages 180-181</ref> The house in Old Church Lane had a large rear garden and was close enough to [[Edinburgh]] for the children to attend school there, yet surrounded by the bracing fresh air of the open countryside.<ref>Home-House, Old Church Lane, Duddingston – Category B Listed building: http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB29462</ref> It was at Home House that Alfred and Beatrice boarded during part of their education at [[George Watson’s College]].

In 1928, Aeneas Francon Williams was licensed by the Presbytery of [[Eastern Himalaya]] and in November of that same year he was ordained by the Presbytery at [[Siliguri]], in [[North Bengal]]. The Presbytery of Edinburgh admitted Williams to the [[Church of Scotland]] on 28 May 1932.

===Matelli, West Bengal===
In 1929, Aeneas was stationed at the [[Church of Scotland]] Guild Mission in [[Matelli]] in the [[Jalpaiguri]] district of [[West Bengal]] where he was the Minister of the [[Jalpaiguri]] Parish. At the Mission compound in Matelli, Aeneas and his family resided at the Manse. Through its schools – St. Ninian's 'Middle' school, St. Margaret's 'High' school, and its boys and girls Day Schools in Calcutta, boys school in Chinsura, the Abbey School, and various primary schools in Budge Budge, and its College – the Church of Scotland Mission offered Christian education from the kindergarten to the University stage.

In 1930, ''Hymn Book in Jalpaiguri Mech'' by Aeneas Francon Williams was published. The book was intended for the use of Christians of the [[Mech Tribe]]s living at the foot of the [[Himalayas]] in the [[Jalpaiguri]] district and was the first Hymn Book to be published in this regional dialect of [[Hindi]].<ref>The One Hundred and First Report of the Calcutta Christian Tract and Book Society (Incorporated) 1930/1931, page 7 & 10:(retrieved document 16 July 2017): The document mentions 2,000 copies of Hymn Book in Jalpaiguri Mech by Aeneas Francon Williams were purchased by the Book Society for distribution: http://images.library.yale.edu/divinitycontent/dayrep/Calcutta%20Christian%20Tract%20and%20Book%20Society%201930-1931%20v101.pdf</ref>
While Aeneas was living in [[Matelli]] he owned a [[Cinchona]] ([[quinine]]) plantation.

On 7 March 1930, Clara, being the only female along with two Babu's, was appointed under the provisions of rule 63(2), Chapter IV of the Bengal Jail Code, as a non-official visitor of the Alipur Duar Suli Jail in the [[Jalpaiguri district]] of [[West Bengal]] for a period of two years.<ref>''The Calcultta Gazette'', 13 March 1930 page 390, No. 886J: Babu Manish Chandra Roy, Babu Lalit Behari Ghosh, and Mrs. Francon Williams are appointed as non-official visitors of the Alipur Duar Suli Jail: https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.45159/2015.45159.The-Calcutta-Gazette-1930-January---June#page/n873/mode/2up/search/Francon+williams</ref> The appointment of the three non-official visitors was to help in the rehabilitation of the inmates by helping to change the offender's values, motivations, and attitudes, so that they could become contributing members of society upon their release. The non-official visitors would visit the jail periodically and attend to requests from the inmates pertaining to their care and welfare. At the end of their visits they would enter any observations about their time at the jail in the visitor's book.<ref>The State Governments framed rules regarding appointments and visits by official and non official visitors in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section 25 of section 59 of the Prisons Act. 1894:  http://ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/PSI/Prison2012/CHAPTER-10.pdf</ref>

In 1932, Williams visited [[Scotland]], during which he supported as many church events and meetings as he could comfortably fit into his schedule. In late-September, Williams showed his support for the ‘Forward Movement’ campaign launched by [[West Lothian]] Churches. At the campaign he gave a powerful speech detailing his all-absorbing work in [[India]] as a missionary.<ref>''Edinburgh Evening News'', Friday 23 September 1932, page 7 – Forward Movement (report) Campaign by West Lothian Churches</ref> On 3 October, Williams attended the Young Men's Guild of the Linlithgow and Falkirk Council at which he addressed the large attendance with more stories of his work and adventures as a missionary in [[North Bengal]]. ‘Mr. Williams’ address brought out in a wonderful way the romance of the mission fields, and the speaker dealt in a most interesting manner with his own particular work among the depressed races in the Eastern Duars.’<ref>''Linlithgowshire Gazette'', Friday 7 October 1932, page 5 – Young Men's Guild (report)</ref> In 1934, Aeneas and Clara's son Alfred at the age of eighteen enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he would study medicine for the next six years.

In the summer of 1937, Aeneas and Clara, accompanied by their two offspring, Alfred (a medical student) and Beatrice (a nurse), sailed from [[Dooars]], [[India]], to America where they arrived in [[New York City]] on 16 August 1937 aboard SS ''Caledonia'' II.<ref>http://www.ancestry.com – New York Passenger Lists, 1820–1957 – Aeneas Francon Williams arrived New York on 16 August 1937 aboard SS Caledonia II.

Williams’ first volume of poems ''Dream Drift, by a Young Lover'' was published in 1938. The book was dedicated to his wife Clara. The suggestion of a priest being perceived as a ‘young lover’ was a bold move on both Williams and the publisher's part. It was certainly uncommon for a member of the cloth to reveal a poetic side that included talk of lovemaking. ''The Dundee Courier'' in their appraisal of the work noted that, ‘Mr. Williams' poems reveal their author in many moods, as a nature lover, sportsman, and lover. Only an angler could have written his poems on ''Fishing'' and ''Wound Up''. There is a whimsical, almost ‘Barriesque’ ([[James M.

Aeneas would find small nuggets of inspiration obscured in the noise of life. In his poem, ''To A Dead Bird,'' Williams immortalizes a solitary dead bulbul; an Indian nightingale he found lying near a bush in the Manse in Bengal where he lived. He explains; 'I put it in my pocket handkerchief and with a little burial service I laid it to rest in our consecrated burial ground opposite Manse Gate.<ref>''Let Poet's Sing'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, page 41 – ''To A Dead Bird''.</ref>

On 13 May 1942, Aeneas and Clara's daughter Beatrice married Dr. Stephen Ian Pugh of [[Builth Wells]], [[Breconshire]], [[Wales]].<ref>Northern Isles Family History: https://www.bayanne.info/Shetland/getperson.php?personID=I390221&tree=ID1</ref> The couple later emigrated to [[Tasmania]] where they lived their entire lives in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]].

In 1945, Aeneas and Clara spent a summer vacation at [[Kodaikanal]], a resort in the [[Cardamom Hills]] (Yela Mala), a mountain range in [[South India]], where their son Alfred, who was now a Captain in the RAMC ([[Royal Army Medical Corps]]) and stationed in [[Burma]], joined them. It was while Aeneas was in the [[Cardamom Hills]] that he wrote his poem ''Flowers''.<ref>''Flowers'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, ''Let Poets Sing'' p. 34</ref>

On 1 January 1946, in the New Year Indian Honours List, Clara (Mrs. Francon Williams) was awarded the [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal]] (Emperor of India) Bronze Medal for her work during [[WWII]] being in-charge of [[Red Cross]] work in [[Dooars]], [[Bengal]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Medical News |journal=The Indian Medical Gazette |date=December 1945 |volume=80 |issue=12 |pages=629–632 |pmc=5218119 |pmid=29015760 }}</ref>

In 1947, when [[India]] was granted Independence, Clara returned to [[Scotland]] to set up home in [[Edinburgh]]. Aeneas remained in India at the Mission during the handover. 
After the inauguration of [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]] on 15 August 1947, Aeneas wrote 'Report 1947, The Work of the Church of Scotland Mission in Bengal During a Momentous Year', documenting what he saw and encountered in [[India]] during and after the handover. Much rejoicing took place in all the Mission institutions. The new Constitution (not yet fully adopted) guaranteed freedom 'to profess, practice and propagate' any religion. When pupils were asked, now that India was free would they rather there was no teaching about Christianity in school, the answer was always the same, that it was because of such teachings that they wished to study at the Mission. In fact, the Mission had since Independence Day been besieged with new applications for admission. However, Aeneas noted the College was experiencing a communal 'low' in staffing levels, with the shortage of Christian professors becoming an 'anxiety.' The Mission staffing levels had also fallen (to eight women and four men) and the Foreign Mission Committee was doing everything in its power to find new recruits.
Looking ahead, Aeneas spoke of a 'partnership,' a 'Home Mission,' uniting the Mission of the [[Church of Scotland]] in India with the Church in India, and in his Report 1947 Aeneas stated: ''The Indian Church is now alive to her missionary responsibilities in this land and is heartily in favor of the new proposals, but the task is out of all proportion to her present resources, and it is only if the Church of Scotland continues her support in personnel and in finances that it can be accomplished. For the Church as for the nation it may be that a new day is dawning.''<ref>Report 1947: The Work of the Church of Scotland Mission in Bengal During A Momentous Year (1947), pamphlet, published Church of Scotland, 1947 – Centre for the Study of World Christianity Library, University of Edinburgh, Pamphlet – Reference: Pamphlet BV3280. B4. Chu</ref>

In 1948 after the handover, Aeneas sold his [[Cinchona]] plantation and other personal property and returned to the U.K. to join his wife in [[Edinburgh]], where they resided at 46 Belgrave Road. When Aeneas and Clara returned to Edinburgh for good they brought with them their pet chimpanzee named ‘Glyris’, which lived with them at their home at Belgrave Road.

Aeneas and Clara's son Alfred married Jane Warhurst (née Smith) on 29 March 1950 at St. Aidan's Church, [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]].<ref>Marriage announcement in ''The Scotsman'' newspaper, Thursday 30 March 1950, page 10.</ref> Jane is a second cousin once removed of the author [[David Herbert Lawrence]] through her mother Lillian's sister Aunt Ada (née Rex) who married George Beardsall.

==Later life==
Aeneas and Clara were both bilingual; Aeneas spoke eight languages fluently including [[Hindi]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. In Edinburgh, Aeneas was Chaplain of Edinburgh Social Services Department from 1952 and was affiliated with several churches including the former Stockbridge Free Church and [[St. Giles Cathedral]]. He was assistant Chaplain of [[HMP Edinburgh]] (Saughton) from 1948 to 1954. 
As a youngster, Aeneas grew up in a literary household (his father John Francon Williams was a newspaper and journal editor and a published writer of many books) and as such Aeneas was encouraged by his father to pursue writing. Throughout Aeneas's life he had many books published in various fields of knowledge and was also a published poet. In 1942, upon the death of Dr [[John Anderson Graham]], Aeneas was commissioned by [[Oxford University Press]] to write Dr Graham's biography for inclusion in their ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]].''

Clara Anne Williams died in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 January 1959 and is buried at [[Dean Cemetery]], Edinburgh.

After Clara passed away, Aeneas sold their house at Belgrave Road and spent time travelling the world, circumnavigating it several times. There is evidence contained in correspondence between Aeneas and the London publishing house [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan & Co. Ltd.]] that he wrote two books during these travels. His regular visits to Australia and [[New Zealand]], and especially [[Tasmania]] – where his daughter Beatrice lived in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] with her husband Dr. Stephen Pugh and their daughter Andrea<ref>Dr. Stephen Ian Pugh & family: North Isles Family History archive:
https://www.bayanne.info/Shetland/getperson.php?personID=I390221&tree=ID1</ref> – appear to have sparked his imagination. Original correspondence from Aeneas to [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]] held at The Museum of English Rural Life and Special Collections at the [[University of Reading]], mentions two new manuscripts he had written relating to his travels that he’d submitted to the publishing house. Whether MacMillan or another company published these books is unclear from the letters, as the books identify with [[Australasia]] and may only have been published in that territory, or could have remained unpublished. The two books in question are ''Tasmanian Apples'' and ''Kiwiland''. The later work is possibly associated with the flightless [[Kiwi]] bird, which Aeneas had grown particularly fond of during his visits to [[New Zealand]]. ‘I fed these interesting flightless birds in Wellington Zoo,’ Aeneas writes keenly to MacMillan. He also fed the [[tuatara]], courtesy of his friend ‘the Superintendent Mr. Curtis,’ who told him where he could see the ‘pre-historic little tuatara, the only true Saurian left on this earth, whose ancestors were at least 3,000,000 years on this planet, long before we were.’<ref>Letters: Williams, Aeneas Francon ~ 1960–1961 ~ former ref: Second series: The Museum of English Rural Life and Special Collections at the [[University of Reading]], Redlands Road, Reading, RG1 5EX: https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/special-collections/MAC_W.pdf</ref> Aeneas also mentions to his publisher that his friend Henry Kelly of the New Zealand Wildlife Department was arranging ‘to send us a live [[Kiwi]], the very first Kiwi to be in Scotland.’<ref>''i-Newspaper'', 15 June 2018, page 18 – Manuscripts and Kiwis Scarce (Reader's Grandfather helped bring first Kiwi to Scotland) (retrieved 16 June 2018): https://www.pressreader.com/uk/i-newspaper/20180615</ref> After returning from his travels abroad, Aeneas moved into 10 Carlton Street, [[Stockbridge, Edinburgh|Stockbridge]], Edinburgh, where he lived until his early-80s, before moving to [[Sheffield]], Yorkshire, to live with his son Alfred.
[[File:Clara Anne Rendall and Aeneas Francon Williams gravestone Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Clara Anne Rendall and Aeneas Francon Williams' gravestone at [[Dean Cemetery]], [[Edinburgh]]]]
Aeneas died in [[Sheffield]] in 1971 and is buried with his wife Clara in [[Dean Cemetery]], Edinburgh.

Aeneas Francon Williams is the brother of artist [[David Dougal Williams]] and the grandfather of writer Iain Cameron Williams.<ref>Iain Cameron Williams: http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4751.Iain_Cameron_Williams</ref><ref>Iain Cameron Williams World Catalogue: http://www.worldcat.org/title/underneath-a-harlem-moon-the-harlem-to-paris-years-of-adelaide-hall/oclc/51780394&referer=brief_results</ref>

A cousin of Aeneas's named Jane Williams married American [[Edward Burton Hughes]]. In 1967, Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] appointed Edward Burton Hughes as Executive Deputy Commissioner of [[New York State Department of Transportation]]. In 1970, Edward Burton Hughes founded the ''E. Burton Hughes Achievement Award'' given annually to an outstanding Department employee of the [[New York State Department of Transportation]].<ref>''Spotlight Magazine'', 27 December 1973, page 16 – The ''E.

'''Lithuanian cuisine''' features products suited to the cool and moist northern climate of [[Lithuania]]: [[barley]], [[potato]]es, [[rye]], [[beet]]s, [[Leaf vegetable|greens]], [[Berry|berries]], and [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]] are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Various ways of [[pickling]] were used to preserve food for winter. Soups are extremely popular, and are widely regarded as the key to good health. Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with [[Northern Europe]], Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with its Baltic neighbors and, in general, northern countries. 
Longlasting agricultural and foraging traditions along with a variety of influences during the country's history formed Lithuanian cuisine.

German traditions have had an influence on Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (''kugelis'' or [[kugel]]) and intestines stuffed with mashed potato (''vėdarai''), as well as the baroque tree cake known as ''[[Šakotis]]''. Lithuanian noblemen usually hired French chefs - [[French cuisine]] influence came to Lithuania in this way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kokią įtaką Lietuvos virtuvei padarė prancūzai?|url=https://www.15min.lt/maistas/naujiena/virtuve/kokia-itaka-lietuvos-virtuvei-padare-prancuzai-1044-719414|website=www.15min.lt|accessdate=26 March 2018|language=lt}}</ref> The most exotic influence is Eastern ([[Crimean Karaites|Karaite]]) cuisine, and the dish ''[[kibinai]]'' which became popular in Lithuania. Lithuanians and other nations which lived in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] also share some dishes and beverages. Lithuanian cuisine also influenced Polish and Ruthenian cuisines.

Despite the apparent richness of the cuisine, Lithuania has a very low prevalence of obesity.<ref>Lissau, I., et al., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=14706954 Body mass index and overweight in adolescents in 13 European countries, Israel, and the United States] (Abstract), ''Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine'', 2004 January; 158(1):27-33.</ref> 8 Lithuanian restaurants are listed in White Guide Baltic Top 30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteguide-nordic.com/nyheter/there-is-no-better-time-than-now-to-visit-baltic-restaurants|website=www.whiteguide-nordic.com|title=The best restaurants in the Nordics|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>

In the hillfort of [[Maišiagala]] in the layer of 13-14 century about 20 sorts of various cereals and legume were found - winter and summer rye, wheat, barley, oat, [[millet]], buckwheat, lentil, [[Vicia|vetches]], peas, broad beans.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ką sėdavo ir pjaudavo žemdirbiai XIII–XIV amžiuje |url=http://m.ldkistorija.lt/index.php/istoriniai-faktai/ka-sedavo-ir-pjaudavo-zemdirbiai-xiiixiv-amziuje/1519 |website=m.ldkistorija.lt |accessdate=29 September 2019 |language=LT}}</ref> 

In the Middle Ages, hunting was the main way to provide oneself with meat. It is known that [[Vytautas]] The Great before the [[Battle of Žalgiris]] organized a big hunting in the [[Białowieża Forest|Baltvyžis forest]] and prepared barrels of salt-cured meat for the army. Game was also a staple of noblemen: [[European bison|wisents]], [[aurochs]], and deer were hunted. Lithuania had long-lasting wars (about 200 years) with Teutonic Order. It also kept diplomatic relationships with it, during which various presents were exchanged - it is known what Teutonic Order sent a rare wine to [[Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania]], wife of [[Vytautas the Great]], in 1416. At this time Lithuanian nobleman already imported saffron, cinnamon, rice, pepper, raisins for their needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukininkopatarejas.lt/istorike-jolanta-karpaviciene-valdovu-sutuoktines-buvo-tikros-europietes/|title=Istorikė Jolanta Karpavičienė: \"Valdovų sutuoktinės buvo tikros europietės\"|website=ukininkopatarejas.lt|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>

The [[Congress of Lutsk]], hosted by Vytautas the Great, was another example of medieval Lithuanian cuisine. Chronicles report that seven hundred barrels of honey, wine, 700 oxen, 1,400 sheep, hundreds of elk, wild boar, and other dishes were consumed daily.

Traditional Lithuanian hunting and landscape, still existing conflicts between paganism and Christianity was described by [[Mikołaj Hussowczyk|Nicolaus Hussovianus]] in his Latin poem ''Carmen de statura, feritate ac venatione bisontis'' (''A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison'', 1523).

Many culinary innovations came from Italy with [[Bona Sforza]], [[Grand Duchess consort of Lithuania]]. Bona Sforza introduced the fork and traditional Italian food - olives, olive oil; made wine and wheat flour more popular. Parsnips, cauliflowers, spinach and even artichokes were introduced and grown. It is assumed that [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] had their own [[kitchen garden]].
Daughter of Bona Sforza, [[Catherine Jagiellon]] after marying [[John III of Sweden]] introduced the fork and other cultural habits to Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sunkus Kotrynos Jogailaitės kelias į laimę|url=https://www.lzinios.lt/lzinios/istorija/sunkus-kotrynos-jogailaites-kelias-i-laime-foto/60957|quote=Kaip jau žinoma, Kotrynos Jogailaitės valdymo metais Karalių rūmai Stokholme buvo perstatyti renesanso stiliumi, būtent ši karalienė švedus išmokė naudotis šakute, jai atvykus protestantas vyras žmonai pastatė katalikų koplyčią.|website=www.lzinios.lt|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>
In XVI rulers and nobleman of Lithuania consumed grapes, oranges, melons, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, and plums.

In the sale contract made in 1623 by [[Elisabeth Sophie von Brandenburg]], wife of [[Janusz Radziwiłł (1579–1620)|Jonušas Radvila]] and [[Janusz Kiszka|Jonušas Kiška]], she sold a garden in Vilnius. The text of the treaty has very detailed mentionings of the garden plants such as grafted apple trees, pears, [[Prunus domestica|plums]] (''prunus domestica''), cherries, [[Prunus avium|wild cherries]], [[vitis]], [[Crataegus|hawthorns]], [[Rosa canina|dog roses]]. A garden for Italian vegetables (as they called back then) is also very detailed. That is potatoes, [[artichoke]]s, [[asparagus]], [[Valerianella locusta|lamb's lettuce]], [[Eruca sativa|rucola]], [[garden cress]], spinatch, melones, beets, [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[Chervil|French parsley]], Italian onions, lettuce, chicory. And spices and decorative shrubs: anise, peppermints, [[Tarragon|estragon]], dill, [[Indigofera tinctoria|true indigo]] and junipers. Wooden [[Orangery|orangerie]] is also mentioned which was used to grow [[Syconium|fig-trees]] and [[Juglans regia|common walnuts]].<ref name=\"RL-IstorinėLTVirtuvė\">{{cite book |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=Istorinė Lietuvos virtuvė: Maistas ir gėrimai Lietuvos Didžiojoje Kunigaikštystėje |date=2014 |publisher=Briedis |location=Vilnius |isbn=978-9955-26-463-7 |pages=81–82}}</ref>

The growing of potatoes in Lithuania is known from the 17th century, but it became more widespread only in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.ldkistorija.lt/index.php/istoriniai-faktai/kada-lietuvoje-atsirado-bulves/1313|title=Kada Lietuvoje atsirado bulvės?|website=m.ldkistorija.lt|accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref>

Archeological finds at the place of the [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] revealed a lot of information about the food eaten, cutlery and serving of the rulers of Lithuania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valdovurumai.lt/en/activities/collections/erika-striskiene-archaeological-finds-at-the-palace-of-the-grand-dukes-of-lithuania#.Wx9BFUjRC70|title=Archaeological Finds at the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania|website=www.valdovurumai.lt|quote=During the archaeological digs many serving knives were found.

First explorer of the Lithuanian flora, botanist {{ill|Jurgis Pabrėža|lt}} described spicery growing in Lithuania.

In 18th century and 19th century recipes ''à la Lithuanienne'' appeared in the French culinary books. Romantic image of Lithuania associated with lush forests and game - no wonder the recipes ''à la Lithuanienne'' were mostly dishes prepared from moose, bear or [[grey partridge]]. ''La Cuisine classique'' by [[Urbain Dubois]] and [[Émile Bernard (chef)|Émile Bernard]], published in 1856 contained Lithuanian recipes of goose soup and souce. A culinary book by Alphonse Petit ''La gastronomie en Russie'', published in 1900 included eight Lithuanian recipes. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=Lietuviški vardai užsienio kulinarijos knygose II |url=http://kulinarinispaveldas.blogspot.com/2014/05/lietuviski-vardai-uzsienio-kulinarijos.html |website=http://kulinarinispaveldas.blogspot.com/ |accessdate=6 April 2020 |language=LT}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=11.09.

==Bread==
[[File:Juoda duona.JPG|thumb|''Ruginė duona'', dark [[rye]] bread]]
One of the oldest and most fundamental Lithuanian food products was and is rye bread. Rye bread is eaten every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bread played an important role in family rituals and agrarian ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|title=LITHUANIAN TRADITIONAL FOODS - BREAD|url=http://www.lnkc.lt/eknygos/eka/food/bread.html|website=www.lnkc.lt|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>
Traditionally, the centerpiece of Lithuanian cuisine is dark [[rye]] [[bread]] (''ruginė duona'') which is used more often than light [[wheat]] breads. The archeological finds reveal that bread in the 9th - 14th centuries in Lithuania was very similar to the current rye bread.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ką lietuviai valgė IX–XIV amžiuje: VU archeologės ištyrė pirmą lietuvišką duoną|url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/ka-lietuviai-valge-ix-xiv-amziuje-vu-archeologes-istyre-pirma-lietuviska-duona-56-986676|website=www.15min.lt|accessdate=14 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> The dough is usually based on a [[sourdough]] [[Pre-ferment|starter]], and includes some wheat flour to lighten the finished product. Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast - ''raugas'', which also had symbolical meaning of the home.  [[Rye bread]] is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, [[butter]]ed or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with [[caraway]], or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on [[sweet flag]] leaves. Lithuanian proverb says - ''Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne'' (''One can manage without gold, but not without bread'').

Some varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as ''grūdėtoji'', i.e. \"seeded\" bread.

==Vegetables and spices==

[[File:Illustration_Heracleum_sphondylium0.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Heracleum sphondylium]]'' (''Lankinis barštis'') was used since prehistory up to the 18th century to make an archaic version of ''barščiai'' soup]]

[[File:Brassica rapa (watercolor).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (ropė) was a popular root vegetable before the prevalence of potatoes in the 18th century.]]

The most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the [[potato]]; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with [[dill]], but a tremendous{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.

[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''balandėliai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior.

Lithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back after independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.

Pickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.

==Foraging: berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants==

One of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.

Mushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dzūkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:
* ''Baravykas'' – [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];
* ''Voveraitė'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepeška'' (in [[Dzūkija]] region) – [[chanterelle]];
* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vištelė'' – [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].

''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voveraitė'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voveraitė'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lepšė'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonviršis'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''šilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.

Wild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''mėlynės'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''bruknės'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguolės'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[Čepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''žemuogės'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.

</gallery>

==Fruit==
[[Apple]]s, [[plum]]s, and [[pear]]s, which grow well in Lithuania, are the most commonly used fruit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Because they cannot tolerate frost, tropical fruit such as citrus, bananas and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed. During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews ([[kompot]]s). [[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwiłł family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century.

==Meat==
[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|A small slab of ''lašiniai'' with an onion]]
[[File:Skilandis2.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' is a Lithuanian matured sausage made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic. PDO.]]
[[File:Kindziukas (1).JPG|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' and ''dešros'' (sausages)]]
The most frequently used meat is [[pork]], followed by [[beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Turkey as food|turkey]], and [[Duck (food)|duck]];{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to [[schnitzel]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying, and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.

==Fish==

Freshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]]. Since the 19th century, herring was imported to Lithuania from Norway, [[Stavanger]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grinčinaitis |first1=Sigitas |title=Kaip jūros sidabras - silkės - atkeliavo į Lietuvą? |url=http://www.silutesnaujienos.lt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16082:kaip-jros-sidabras-silks-atkeliavo-lietuv&catid=57:istorija&Itemid=102 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> [[Salmon]] is also a popular dish often served with a cream sauce, vegetables, and rice. Before building dams after Soviet occupation, salmon was quite abundant fish in Lithuanian rivers.

Smoked fish such as [[eel]] or [[bream]] are popular entrees and appetizers in areas near the [[Baltic Sea]], especially in [[Neringa Municipality|Neringa]].

[[Crayfish]] are also popular and are usually eaten in the summertime as a delicacy and a side dish served with beer.

==Dairy products==

Lithuania is known for quality dairy products. Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called ''sūreliai'' are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though some people still prefer making their own soured milk.

===Cheese===

Traditional Lithuanian curd cheese has a [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Geographical Indication]] (PGI) label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luksiupienine.lt/en/prod/curd-cheese-tradicional-liethuanian/|title= Traditional \"Senolių Lietuviškas\"|website=www.luksiupienine.lt|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea. Food historians estimate that the curd cheese was known for 4-6 thousands of years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kodėl baltas varškės, o ne brandintas sūris tapo lietuvišku kulinariniu paveldu?|url=https://www.15min.lt/maistas/naujiena/virtuve/kodel-baltas-varskes-o-ne-brandintas-suris-tapo-lietuvisku-kulinariniu-paveldu-1044-1074646 |website=www.15min.lt |accessdate=15 December 2018}}</ref>
Lithuanians started fermenting hard cheese around the 16th century in the region of [[Samogitia]]. Across Samogitian borders, this cheese was known as Lithuanian cheese.
Historically there were not much cheese sorts in Lithuania, due to low levels of [[lactose intolerance]]. Milk products were usually consumed fresh, or slightly fermented.
Semi-hard cheese ''Liliputas'' in 2015 was included in EU [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Designation of Origin]] and [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Geographical Indication]] product lists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curioustovisit.com/authentic-lithuanian-cuisine-supermarket/|title=Authentic Lithuanian Cuisine You Can Find In Any Supermarket|website=curioustovisit.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> Hard cheese ''Džiugas'' ripens for at least 12 months, is popular among gourmet and being used as dish flavour. ''Džiugas'' in 2019 included in the EU Protected Designation of Origin list. In the interwar period [[Šėta]] was famous for its cheese, which was made in ''sūrinė'' (''cheese house'').

An example of this is [[Zrazy|zrazai]], which are Lithuanian beef rolls.<ref>Food.com [http://www.food.com/recipe/zrazai-lithuanian-beef-rolls-438226 Zrazai (Lithuanian Beef Rolls)] by duonyte</ref> See image at right.

===Desserts===

Lithuanian-style [[cake]]s (''pyragas'') are often baked in a rectangular pan and sometimes have an apple, plum, [[apricot]], or other fruit baked in; they are less frequently iced than is customary in the United States. These cakes are cut into squares for serving. [[Poppy seed]] is sometimes used as a swirl filling in dessert bread ([[Poppy seed roll]] and [[šimtalapis]]) and as a flavoring in other pastries.

For special occasions, [[torte]] may be prepared; they often consist of 10 to 20 layers, filled with jam and vanilla, chocolate, [[Cafe mocha|mocha]], or rum [[buttercream]]s; they are lavishly decorated. Lithuanian coffeehouses (''kavinė'') serve a variety of tortes and pastries to attract evening strollers.

Desserts include:
*''Žagarėliai'' (also known as krustai or chrustai) - Twisted, thin deep-fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar; identical to Scandinavian [[Klejner]] cookies, similar to Mexican [[buñuelo]].
*''Kūčiukai'' or ''šližikai'' - very small rolls are baked and served with [[opium poppy|poppy]]seed milk; this is a traditional [[Kūčios|Kūčios']] ([[Christmas Eve]]) dish.
*''Ledai'' - [[ice cream]] is served everywhere in the summer.
*''[[Doughnut|Spurgos]]'' - a Lithuanian variant of doughnuts, sometimes filled with preserves. The main difference from doughnuts or berliners is that the Lithuanian version uses curd as a basis. Therefore, they often called ''varškės spurgos'' - ''curd doughnuts''.
*''[[Šakotis]]'' (also called ''raguotis'') - is essentially a pound cake grilled layer by layer, with a very distinctive branching form. It is a Lithuanian variant of a spit cake which is a distant cousin of the German [[Baumkuchen]], the French [[gâteau à la broche]], the Swedish [[Spettekaka|spättekaka]]. Some sources attribute its invention to [[Yotvingians]] - ancient, now extinct [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Polish Food 101 ‒ Sękacz |url=https://culture.pl/en/article/polish-food-101-sekacz |accessdate=22 April 2019 |quote=It's possible that Lithuanians, who allegedly ate sękacz on their way to Grunwald before the great battle of 1410, got the idea from the Germans. It's also possible they got it first, since the cake is often attributed to the Yotvingians, a [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe of who settled in Podlasie during the Middle Ages.}}</ref> Šakotis is a frequent accent of Lithuanian weddings and bigger festivities.
*''Šimtalapis (one hundred sheets)'' - introduced to Lithuania with Tatars brought by [[Vytautas the Great]] and modified locally, is made from laminated dough which is separated with layer of melted butter - the principle is very similar to that of [[croissant]].

[[File:Perpjautas šimtalapis.JPG|thumb|left|Šimtalapis]]
[[File:Biržų Šakotis-Lithuania.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Šakotis]]'', a [[spit cake]]. One of the main attributes of the Lithuanian feast.]]

*''[[Tinginys]]'' - prepared with biscuits or crackers, cocoa, butter, sugar and solidified milk
*''Skruzdėlynas (anthill)'' - consists of individual pastries stacked on top of one another, sprinkled with poppy seeds and glazed with honey and nuts.

==Special occasions==
[[File:Kūčios.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''Kūčios'' ''(Christmas Eve)'' table]]
Easter and Christmas (Christmas Eve) are festives which have their own table presentations and type of dishes in Lithuania. Easter tables being decorated with juniper or sallow twigs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Velykos tarpukario Lietuvoje: net naktį gatvės būdavo pilnos žmonių |url=https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/kultura/12/1161433/velykos-tarpukario-lietuvoje-net-nakti-gatves-budavo-pilnos-zmoniu |website=lrt.lt |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=LT}}</ref>

*Easter - The intricately painted [[Easter egg]]s that were prepared earlier in the week are eaten for breakfast. The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.
*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Joninės]]), June 23.
*Christmas Eve ([[Kūčios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.
*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[šakotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.
*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.
*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth. Flavored vodkas, which may have been concocted with fruits and herbs according to the host's or hostess's own family recipe, may be served.

''Alus ([[beer]])'' is extremely popular throughout the country, especially again since the restoration of the Independence in 1990. Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic [[Festival|festivities]] and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|website=www.llti.lt|page=18|title=Alus – apeiginis baltų gėrimas|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808021048/http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was ''Ragutis'' or ''Rūgutis''. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.

Farmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>

The microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.

===Midus===

''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey. [[Baltic people]] were making ''midus'' for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who visited [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].  Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kublickas |first1=Rimantas |title=Traditional Foods |pages=339–343 |chapter=Midus: A Traditional Lithuanian Mead |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7648-2_27 |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4899-7646-8 }}</ref>
Oldest recipe of Lithuanian ''midus'' was recorded in a book by [[Olaus Magnus]] ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'', published in Rome in 1555.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Laužikas R. |author2=Astrauskas A. |title=How the Future King of England Ate Peacock in Vilnius: the Shared Cultural, Political and Culinary History of Britain and Lithuania |date=2018 |publisher=Lietuvos kultūros institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=9786098015652 |pages=135}}</ref>  ''Midus'' was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry. Since 16th century ''midus'' started to compete with imported vine, but it was known and was still very popular in [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vaitkevičienė |first1=Daiva |title=Midus baltų visuomenėje: nuo bitininkų iki diduomenės |url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/TD51%20internetui-22-55.pdf |publisher=Lietuvių literatūros ir tautosakos institutas |accessdate=31 March 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref>  Today ''Midus'' is produced by several companies and is to be found in the majority of liquor shops. Craft mead producing is also becoming popular. Traditional Lithuanian ''midus'' ''[[Stakliškės]]'', fermented up to 90 days has a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) label.<ref>{{cite web |title=Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1196/2013 of 22 November 2013 entering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications [Stakliškės (PGI)] |url=https://euroalert.net/oj/33604/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-no-1196-2013-of-22-november-2013-entering-a-name-in-the-register-of-protected-designations-of-origin-and-protected-geographical-indications-stakliskes-pgi |accessdate=3 May 2019}}</ref>

===Fruit and berry wines===

[[Fruit wine|Fruit and berry]] wines being made in Lithuania by several companies. Industrial production of fruit and berry wines was started by Balys Karazija in 1926 in [[Anykščiai]]. His wines have won international awards in 1938. Initiatives of B.Karazija made a fruit wine a traditional drink in Lithuania. Currently blueberry, apple, apple ice wine, black currant, aronia, cherry wines being produced by smaller and bigger companies.

===Other===
*''Arbata ([[tea]])'' - [[chamomile]], [[rosehip]], [[thyme]] and other herbal teas are popular as well as black tea. Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes.
*''Gira ([[kvass]])'' is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian [[kvass]]. Those brewed from rye [[bread]] and from [[caraway]] seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.
*''Degtinė (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-[[Distilled beverage|distilled]].
*''Kava ([[coffee]])'' is brewed in [[espresso]] makers or [[Moka pot|moka pots]] at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavinė'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gilių kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee. The first coffeehouses appeared in Lithuania in the 18th century and in 1814 there were 49 coffeehouses in Vilnius.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balsevičiūtė-Šlekienė |first1=Virginija |title=Vilniaus kavinės istoriniuose šaltiniuose ir memuaruose |url=http://www.su.lt/bylos/fakultetai/humanitarinis/ml/acta/acta-h-15/slekiene.pdf |accessdate=2 May 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref> Journalist Rapolas Mackonis was explorer of cafe life and wrote about culture of cafes in Vilnius and Kaunas. 
*''[[Starka]]'', an aged vodka, as well as [[Krupnikas]], a honey liqueur, are traditional drinks dating from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 16th - 18th centuries.
*''[[Bitters|Trauktinė]]'' (a bitter) is a strong herbal vodka; there are many varieties. It is also used as traditional medicine. ''Trejos devynerios'' (\"999\"), steeped with 27 different herbs, is one of the best known.
* ''Vynas'' ([[wine]]) culture is firmly growing in Lithuania - wineries and specialised wine shops for Italian, French, New World wines operate in biggest cities. The wine exhibition ''Vyno dienos'' (''Days of Wine'') taking place in May, is the largest wine exhibition in Northern Europe. Lithuania historically is a wine importer, since its climate isn't very friendly for growing grapevines.

'''Lithuanian cuisine''' features products suited to the cool and moist northern climate of [[Lithuania]]: [[barley]], [[potato]]es, [[rye]], [[beet]]s, [[Leaf vegetable|greens]], [[Berry|berries]], and [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]] are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Various ways of [[pickling]] were used to preserve food for winter. Soups are extremely popular, and are widely regarded as the key to good health. Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with [[Northern Europe]], Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with its Baltic neighbors and, in general, northern countries. 
Longlasting agricultural and foraging traditions along with a variety of influences during the country's history formed Lithuanian cuisine.

German traditions have had an influence on Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (''kugelis'' or [[kugel]]) and intestines stuffed with mashed potato (''vėdarai''), as well as the baroque tree cake known as ''[[Šakotis]]''. Lithuanian noblemen usually hired French chefs - [[French cuisine]] influence came to Lithuania in this way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kokią įtaką Lietuvos virtuvei padarė prancūzai?|url=https://www.15min.lt/maistas/naujiena/virtuve/kokia-itaka-lietuvos-virtuvei-padare-prancuzai-1044-719414|website=www.15min.lt|accessdate=26 March 2018|language=lt}}</ref> The most exotic influence is Eastern ([[Crimean Karaites|Karaite]]) cuisine, and the dish ''[[kibinai]]'' which became popular in Lithuania. Lithuanians and other nations which lived in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] also share some dishes and beverages. Lithuanian cuisine also influenced Polish and Ruthenian cuisines.

Despite the apparent richness of the cuisine, Lithuania has a very low prevalence of obesity.<ref>Lissau, I., et al., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=14706954 Body mass index and overweight in adolescents in 13 European countries, Israel, and the United States] (Abstract), ''Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine'', 2004 January; 158(1):27-33.</ref> 8 Lithuanian restaurants are listed in White Guide Baltic Top 30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteguide-nordic.com/nyheter/there-is-no-better-time-than-now-to-visit-baltic-restaurants|website=www.whiteguide-nordic.com|title=The best restaurants in the Nordics|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>

The 9th-century traveler [[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] attested usage of mead among West Balts: \"There is a great deal of honey and fishing.

In 14th century Lithuania almost all today known [[Cereal|cereals]] and [[Fabaceae|legume]] were grown, but rye being the most popular. In the hillfort of [[Maišiagala]] in the layer of 13-14 century about 20 sorts of various cereals and legume were found - winter and summer rye, wheat, barley, oat, [[millet]], buckwheat, lentil, [[Vicia|vetches]], peas, broad beans.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ką sėdavo ir pjaudavo žemdirbiai XIII–XIV amžiuje |url=http://m.ldkistorija.lt/index.php/istoriniai-faktai/ka-sedavo-ir-pjaudavo-zemdirbiai-xiiixiv-amziuje/1519 |website=m.ldkistorija.lt |accessdate=29 September 2019 |language=LT}}</ref> 

In the Middle Ages, hunting was the main way to provide oneself with meat. It is known that [[Vytautas]] The Great before the [[Battle of Žalgiris]] organized a big hunting in the [[Białowieża Forest|Baltvyžis forest]] and prepared barrels of salt-cured meat for the army. Game was also a staple of noblemen: [[European bison|wisents]], [[aurochs]], and deer were hunted. Lithuania had long-lasting wars (about 200 years) with Teutonic Order. It also kept diplomatic relationships with it, during which various presents were exchanged - it is known what Teutonic Order sent a rare wine to [[Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania]], wife of [[Vytautas the Great]], in 1416. At this time Lithuanian nobleman already imported saffron, cinnamon, rice, pepper, raisins for their needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukininkopatarejas.lt/istorike-jolanta-karpaviciene-valdovu-sutuoktines-buvo-tikros-europietes/|title=Istorikė Jolanta Karpavičienė: \"Valdovų sutuoktinės buvo tikros europietės\"|website=ukininkopatarejas.lt|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>

The [[Congress of Lutsk]], hosted by Vytautas the Great, was another example of medieval Lithuanian cuisine. Chronicles report that seven hundred barrels of honey, wine, 700 oxen, 1,400 sheep, hundreds of elk, wild boar, and other dishes were consumed daily.

Traditional Lithuanian hunting and landscape, still existing conflicts between paganism and Christianity was described by [[Mikołaj Hussowczyk|Nicolaus Hussovianus]] in his Latin poem ''Carmen de statura, feritate ac venatione bisontis'' (''A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison'', 1523).

Many culinary innovations came from Italy with [[Bona Sforza]], [[Grand Duchess consort of Lithuania]]. Bona Sforza introduced the fork and traditional Italian food - olives, olive oil; made wine and wheat flour more popular. Parsnips, cauliflowers, spinach and even artichokes were introduced and grown. It is assumed that [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] had their own [[kitchen garden]].
Daughter of Bona Sforza, [[Catherine Jagiellon]] after marying [[John III of Sweden]] introduced the fork and other cultural habits to Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sunkus Kotrynos Jogailaitės kelias į laimę|url=https://www.lzinios.lt/lzinios/istorija/sunkus-kotrynos-jogailaites-kelias-i-laime-foto/60957|quote=Kaip jau žinoma, Kotrynos Jogailaitės valdymo metais Karalių rūmai Stokholme buvo perstatyti renesanso stiliumi, būtent ši karalienė švedus išmokė naudotis šakute, jai atvykus protestantas vyras žmonai pastatė katalikų koplyčią.|website=www.lzinios.lt|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>
In XVI rulers and nobleman of Lithuania consumed grapes, oranges, melons, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, and plums.

In the sale contract made in 1623 by [[Elisabeth Sophie von Brandenburg]], wife of [[Janusz Radziwiłł (1579–1620)|Jonušas Radvila]] and [[Janusz Kiszka|Jonušas Kiška]], she sold a garden in Vilnius. The text of the treaty has very detailed mentionings of the garden plants such as grafted apple trees, pears, [[Prunus domestica|plums]] (''prunus domestica''), cherries, [[Prunus avium|wild cherries]], [[vitis]], [[Crataegus|hawthorns]], [[Rosa canina|dog roses]]. A garden for Italian vegetables (as they called back then) is also very detailed. That is potatoes, [[artichoke]]s, [[asparagus]], [[Valerianella locusta|lamb's lettuce]], [[Eruca sativa|rucola]], [[garden cress]], spinatch, melones, beets, [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[Chervil|French parsley]], Italian onions, lettuce, chicory. And spices and decorative shrubs: anise, peppermints, [[Tarragon|estragon]], dill, [[Indigofera tinctoria|true indigo]] and junipers. Wooden [[Orangery|orangerie]] is also mentioned which was used to grow [[Syconium|fig-trees]] and [[Juglans regia|common walnuts]].<ref name=\"RL-IstorinėLTVirtuvė\">{{cite book |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=Istorinė Lietuvos virtuvė: Maistas ir gėrimai Lietuvos Didžiojoje Kunigaikštystėje |date=2014 |publisher=Briedis |location=Vilnius |isbn=978-9955-26-463-7 |pages=81–82}}</ref>

The growing of potatoes in Lithuania is known from the 17th century, but it became more widespread only in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.ldkistorija.lt/index.php/istoriniai-faktai/kada-lietuvoje-atsirado-bulves/1313|title=Kada Lietuvoje atsirado bulvės?|website=m.ldkistorija.lt|accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref>

First explorer of the Lithuanian flora, botanist {{ill|Jurgis Pabrėža|lt}} described spicery growing in Lithuania.

In 18th century and 19th century recipes ''à la Lithuanienne'' appeared in the French culinary books. Romantic image of Lithuania associated with lush forests and game - no wonder the recipes ''à la Lithuanienne'' were mostly dishes prepared from moose, bear or [[grey partridge]]. ''La Cuisine classique'' by [[Urbain Dubois]] and [[Émile Bernard (chef)|Émile Bernard]], published in 1856 contained Lithuanian recipes of goose soup and souce. A culinary book by Alphonse Petit ''La gastronomie en Russie'', published in 1900 included eight Lithuanian recipes. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=Lietuviški vardai užsienio kulinarijos knygose II |url=http://kulinarinispaveldas.blogspot.com/2014/05/lietuviski-vardai-uzsienio-kulinarijos.html |website=http://kulinarinispaveldas.blogspot.com/ |accessdate=6 April 2020 |language=LT}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=11.09.

==Bread==
[[File:Juoda duona.JPG|thumb|''Ruginė duona'', dark [[rye]] bread]]
One of the oldest and most fundamental Lithuanian food products was and is rye bread. Rye bread is eaten every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bread played an important role in family rituals and agrarian ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|title=LITHUANIAN TRADITIONAL FOODS - BREAD|url=http://www.lnkc.lt/eknygos/eka/food/bread.html|website=www.lnkc.lt|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>
Traditionally, the centerpiece of Lithuanian cuisine is dark [[rye]] [[bread]] (''ruginė duona'') which is used more often than light [[wheat]] breads. The archeological finds reveal that bread in the 9th - 14th centuries in Lithuania was very similar to the current rye bread.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ką lietuviai valgė IX–XIV amžiuje: VU archeologės ištyrė pirmą lietuvišką duoną|url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/ka-lietuviai-valge-ix-xiv-amziuje-vu-archeologes-istyre-pirma-lietuviska-duona-56-986676|website=www.15min.lt|accessdate=14 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> The dough is usually based on a [[sourdough]] [[Pre-ferment|starter]], and includes some wheat flour to lighten the finished product. Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast - ''raugas'', which also had symbolical meaning of the home.  [[Rye bread]] is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, [[butter]]ed or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with [[caraway]], or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on [[sweet flag]] leaves. Lithuanian proverb says - ''Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne'' (''One can manage without gold, but not without bread'').

Some varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as ''grūdėtoji'', i.e. \"seeded\" bread.

==Vegetables and spices==

[[File:Illustration_Heracleum_sphondylium0.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Heracleum sphondylium]]'' (''Lankinis barštis'') was used since prehistory up to the 18th century to make an archaic version of ''barščiai'' soup]]

[[File:Brassica rapa (watercolor).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (ropė) was a popular root vegetable before the prevalence of potatoes in the 18th century.]]

The most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the [[potato]]; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with [[dill]], but a tremendous{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.

[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''balandėliai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior.

Lithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back after independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.

Pickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.

==Foraging: berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants==

One of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.

Mushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dzūkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:
* ''Baravykas'' – [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];
* ''Voveraitė'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepeška'' (in [[Dzūkija]] region) – [[chanterelle]];
* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vištelė'' – [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].

''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voveraitė'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voveraitė'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lepšė'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonviršis'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''šilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.

Wild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''mėlynės'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''bruknės'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguolės'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[Čepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''žemuogės'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.

</gallery>

==Fruit==
[[Apple]]s, [[plum]]s, and [[pear]]s, which grow well in Lithuania, are the most commonly used fruit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Because they cannot tolerate frost, tropical fruit such as citrus, bananas and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed. During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews ([[kompot]]s). [[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwiłł family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century.

==Meat==
[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|A small slab of ''lašiniai'' with an onion]]
[[File:Skilandis2.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' is a Lithuanian matured sausage made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic. PDO.]]
[[File:Kindziukas (1).JPG|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' and ''dešros'' (sausages)]]
The most frequently used meat is [[pork]], followed by [[beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Turkey as food|turkey]], and [[Duck (food)|duck]];{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to [[schnitzel]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying, and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.

==Fish==

Freshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]]. Since the 19th century, herring was imported to Lithuania from Norway, [[Stavanger]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grinčinaitis |first1=Sigitas |title=Kaip jūros sidabras - silkės - atkeliavo į Lietuvą? |url=http://www.silutesnaujienos.lt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16082:kaip-jros-sidabras-silks-atkeliavo-lietuv&catid=57:istorija&Itemid=102 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> [[Salmon]] is also a popular dish often served with a cream sauce, vegetables, and rice. Before building dams after Soviet occupation, salmon was quite abundant fish in Lithuanian rivers.

Smoked fish such as [[eel]] or [[bream]] are popular entrees and appetizers in areas near the [[Baltic Sea]], especially in [[Neringa Municipality|Neringa]].

[[Crayfish]] are also popular and are usually eaten in the summertime as a delicacy and a side dish served with beer.

==Dairy products==

Lithuania is known for quality dairy products. Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called ''sūreliai'' are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though some people still prefer making their own soured milk.

===Cheese===

Traditional Lithuanian curd cheese has a [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Geographical Indication]] (PGI) label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luksiupienine.lt/en/prod/curd-cheese-tradicional-liethuanian/|title= Traditional \"Senolių Lietuviškas\"|website=www.luksiupienine.lt|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea. Food historians estimate that the curd cheese was known for 4-6 thousands of years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kodėl baltas varškės, o ne brandintas sūris tapo lietuvišku kulinariniu paveldu?|url=https://www.15min.lt/maistas/naujiena/virtuve/kodel-baltas-varskes-o-ne-brandintas-suris-tapo-lietuvisku-kulinariniu-paveldu-1044-1074646 |website=www.15min.lt |accessdate=15 December 2018}}</ref>
Lithuanians started fermenting hard cheese around the 16th century in the region of [[Samogitia]]. Across Samogitian borders, this cheese was known as Lithuanian cheese.
Historically there were not much cheese sorts in Lithuania, due to low levels of [[lactose intolerance]]. Milk products were usually consumed fresh, or slightly fermented.
Semi-hard cheese ''Liliputas'' in 2015 was included in EU [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Designation of Origin]] and [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Geographical Indication]] product lists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curioustovisit.com/authentic-lithuanian-cuisine-supermarket/|title=Authentic Lithuanian Cuisine You Can Find In Any Supermarket|website=curioustovisit.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> Hard cheese ''Džiugas'' ripens for at least 12 months, is popular among gourmet and being used as dish flavour. ''Džiugas'' in 2019 included in the EU Protected Designation of Origin list. In the interwar period [[Šėta]] was famous for its cheese, which was made in ''sūrinė'' (''cheese house'').

These cakes are cut into squares for serving. [[Poppy seed]] is sometimes used as a swirl filling in dessert bread ([[Poppy seed roll]] and [[šimtalapis]]) and as a flavoring in other pastries.

For special occasions, [[torte]] may be prepared; they often consist of 10 to 20 layers, filled with jam and vanilla, chocolate, [[Cafe mocha|mocha]], or rum [[buttercream]]s; they are lavishly decorated. Lithuanian coffeehouses (''kavinė'') serve a variety of tortes and pastries to attract evening strollers.

Desserts include:
*''Žagarėliai'' (also known as krustai or chrustai) - Twisted, thin deep-fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar; identical to Scandinavian [[Klejner]] cookies, similar to Mexican [[buñuelo]].
*''Kūčiukai'' or ''šližikai'' - very small rolls are baked and served with [[opium poppy|poppy]]seed milk; this is a traditional [[Kūčios|Kūčios']] ([[Christmas Eve]]) dish.
*''Ledai'' - [[ice cream]] is served everywhere in the summer.
*''[[Doughnut|Spurgos]]'' - a Lithuanian variant of doughnuts, sometimes filled with preserves. The main difference from doughnuts or berliners is that the Lithuanian version uses curd as a basis. Therefore, they often called ''varškės spurgos'' - ''curd doughnuts''.
*''[[Šakotis]]'' (also called ''raguotis'') - is essentially a pound cake grilled layer by layer, with a very distinctive branching form. It is a Lithuanian variant of a spit cake which is a distant cousin of the German [[Baumkuchen]], the French [[gâteau à la broche]], the Swedish [[Spettekaka|spättekaka]]. Some sources attribute its invention to [[Yotvingians]] - ancient, now extinct [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Polish Food 101 ‒ Sękacz |url=https://culture.pl/en/article/polish-food-101-sekacz |accessdate=22 April 2019 |quote=It's possible that Lithuanians, who allegedly ate sękacz on their way to Grunwald before the great battle of 1410, got the idea from the Germans. It's also possible they got it first, since the cake is often attributed to the Yotvingians, a [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe of who settled in Podlasie during the Middle Ages.}}</ref> Šakotis is a frequent accent of Lithuanian weddings and bigger festivities.
*''Šimtalapis (one hundred sheets)'' - introduced to Lithuania with Tatars brought by [[Vytautas the Great]] and modified locally, is made from laminated dough which is separated with layer of melted butter - the principle is very similar to that of [[croissant]].

[[File:Biržų Šakotis-Lithuania.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Šakotis]]'', a [[spit cake]]. One of the main attributes of the Lithuanian feast.]]

*''[[Tinginys]]'' - prepared with biscuits or crackers, cocoa, butter, sugar and solidified milk
*''Skruzdėlynas (anthill)'' - consists of individual pastries stacked on top of one another, sprinkled with poppy seeds and glazed with honey and nuts.

==Special occasions==
[[File:Kūčios.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''Kūčios'' ''(Christmas Eve)'' table]]
Easter and Christmas (Christmas Eve) are festives which have their own table presentations and type of dishes in Lithuania. Easter tables being decorated with juniper or sallow twigs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Velykos tarpukario Lietuvoje: net naktį gatvės būdavo pilnos žmonių |url=https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/kultura/12/1161433/velykos-tarpukario-lietuvoje-net-nakti-gatves-budavo-pilnos-zmoniu |website=lrt.lt |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=LT}}</ref>

*Easter - The intricately painted [[Easter egg]]s that were prepared earlier in the week are eaten for breakfast. The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.
*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Joninės]]), June 23.
*Christmas Eve ([[Kūčios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.
*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[šakotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.
*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.
*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth. Flavored vodkas, which may have been concocted with fruits and herbs according to the host's or hostess's own family recipe, may be served.

''Alus ([[beer]])'' is extremely popular throughout the country, especially again since the restoration of the Independence in 1990. Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic [[Festival|festivities]] and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|website=www.llti.lt|page=18|title=Alus – apeiginis baltų gėrimas|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808021048/http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was ''Ragutis'' or ''Rūgutis''. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.

Farmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>

The microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.

===Midus===

''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey. [[Baltic people]] were making ''midus'' for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who visited [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].  Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kublickas |first1=Rimantas |title=Traditional Foods |pages=339–343 |chapter=Midus: A Traditional Lithuanian Mead |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7648-2_27 |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4899-7646-8 }}</ref>
Oldest recipe of Lithuanian ''midus'' was recorded in a book by [[Olaus Magnus]] ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'', published in Rome in 1555.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Laužikas R. |author2=Astrauskas A. |title=How the Future King of England Ate Peacock in Vilnius: the Shared Cultural, Political and Culinary History of Britain and Lithuania |date=2018 |publisher=Lietuvos kultūros institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=9786098015652 |pages=135}}</ref>  ''Midus'' was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry. Since 16th century ''midus'' started to compete with imported vine, but it was known and was still very popular in [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vaitkevičienė |first1=Daiva |title=Midus baltų visuomenėje: nuo bitininkų iki diduomenės |url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/TD51%20internetui-22-55.pdf |publisher=Lietuvių literatūros ir tautosakos institutas |accessdate=31 March 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref>  Today ''Midus'' is produced by several companies and is to be found in the majority of liquor shops. Craft mead producing is also becoming popular. Traditional Lithuanian ''midus'' ''[[Stakliškės]]'', fermented up to 90 days has a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) label.<ref>{{cite web |title=Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1196/2013 of 22 November 2013 entering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications [Stakliškės (PGI)] |url=https://euroalert.net/oj/33604/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-no-1196-2013-of-22-november-2013-entering-a-name-in-the-register-of-protected-designations-of-origin-and-protected-geographical-indications-stakliskes-pgi |accessdate=3 May 2019}}</ref>

===Fruit and berry wines===

[[Fruit wine|Fruit and berry]] wines being made in Lithuania by several companies. Industrial production of fruit and berry wines was started by Balys Karazija in 1926 in [[Anykščiai]]. His wines have won international awards in 1938. Initiatives of B.Karazija made a fruit wine a traditional drink in Lithuania. Currently blueberry, apple, apple ice wine, black currant, aronia, cherry wines being produced by smaller and bigger companies.

===Other===
*''Arbata ([[tea]])'' - [[chamomile]], [[rosehip]], [[thyme]] and other herbal teas are popular as well as black tea. Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes.
*''Gira ([[kvass]])'' is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian [[kvass]]. Those brewed from rye [[bread]] and from [[caraway]] seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.
*''Degtinė (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-[[Distilled beverage|distilled]].
*''Kava ([[coffee]])'' is brewed in [[espresso]] makers or [[Moka pot|moka pots]] at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavinė'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gilių kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee. The first coffeehouses appeared in Lithuania in the 18th century and in 1814 there were 49 coffeehouses in Vilnius.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balsevičiūtė-Šlekienė |first1=Virginija |title=Vilniaus kavinės istoriniuose šaltiniuose ir memuaruose |url=http://www.su.lt/bylos/fakultetai/humanitarinis/ml/acta/acta-h-15/slekiene.pdf |accessdate=2 May 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref> Journalist Rapolas Mackonis was explorer of cafe life and wrote about culture of cafes in Vilnius and Kaunas. 
*''[[Starka]]'', an aged vodka, as well as [[Krupnikas]], a honey liqueur, are traditional drinks dating from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 16th - 18th centuries.
*''[[Bitters|Trauktinė]]'' (a bitter) is a strong herbal vodka; there are many varieties. It is also used as traditional medicine. ''Trejos devynerios'' (\"999\"), steeped with 27 different herbs, is one of the best known.
* ''Vynas'' ([[wine]]) culture is firmly growing in Lithuania - wineries and specialised wine shops for Italian, French, New World wines operate in biggest cities. The wine exhibition ''Vyno dienos'' (''Days of Wine'') taking place in May, is the largest wine exhibition in Northern Europe. Lithuania historically is a wine importer, since its climate isn't very friendly for growing grapevines.

'''Lithuanian cuisine''' features products suited to the cool and moist northern climate of [[Lithuania]]: [[barley]], [[potato]]es, [[rye]], [[beet]]s, [[Leaf vegetable|greens]], [[Berry|berries]], and [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]] are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Various ways of [[pickling]] were used to preserve food for winter. Soups are extremely popular, and are widely regarded as the key to good health. Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with [[Northern Europe]], Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with its Baltic neighbors and, in general, northern countries. 
Longlasting agricultural and foraging traditions along with a variety of influences during the country's history formed Lithuanian cuisine.

German traditions have had an influence on Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (''kugelis'' or [[kugel]]) and intestines stuffed with mashed potato (''vėdarai''), as well as the baroque tree cake known as ''[[Šakotis]]''. Lithuanian noblemen usually hired French chefs - [[French cuisine]] influence came to Lithuania in this way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kokią įtaką Lietuvos virtuvei padarė prancūzai?|url=https://www.15min.lt/maistas/naujiena/virtuve/kokia-itaka-lietuvos-virtuvei-padare-prancuzai-1044-719414|website=www.15min.lt|accessdate=26 March 2018|language=lt}}</ref> The most exotic influence is Eastern ([[Crimean Karaites|Karaite]]) cuisine, and the dish ''[[kibinai]]'' which became popular in Lithuania. Lithuanians and other nations which lived in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] also share some dishes and beverages. Lithuanian cuisine also influenced Polish and Ruthenian cuisines.

The 9th-century traveler [[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] attested usage of mead among West Balts: \"There is a great deal of honey and fishing.

In 14th century Lithuania almost all today known [[Cereal|cereals]] and [[Fabaceae|legume]] were grown, but rye being the most popular. In the hillfort of [[Maišiagala]] in the layer of 13-14 century about 20 sorts of various cereals and legume were found - winter and summer rye, wheat, barley, oat, [[millet]], buckwheat, lentil, [[Vicia|vetches]], peas, broad beans.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ką sėdavo ir pjaudavo žemdirbiai XIII–XIV amžiuje |url=http://m.ldkistorija.lt/index.php/istoriniai-faktai/ka-sedavo-ir-pjaudavo-zemdirbiai-xiiixiv-amziuje/1519 |website=m.ldkistorija.lt |accessdate=29 September 2019 |language=LT}}</ref> 

In the Middle Ages, hunting was the main way to provide oneself with meat. It is known that [[Vytautas]] The Great before the [[Battle of Žalgiris]] organized a big hunting in the [[Białowieża Forest|Baltvyžis forest]] and prepared barrels of salt-cured meat for the army. Game was also a staple of noblemen: [[European bison|wisents]], [[aurochs]], and deer were hunted. Lithuania had long-lasting wars (about 200 years) with Teutonic Order. It also kept diplomatic relationships with it, during which various presents were exchanged - it is known what Teutonic Order sent a rare wine to [[Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania]], wife of [[Vytautas the Great]], in 1416. At this time Lithuanian nobleman already imported saffron, cinnamon, rice, pepper, raisins for their needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukininkopatarejas.lt/istorike-jolanta-karpaviciene-valdovu-sutuoktines-buvo-tikros-europietes/|title=Istorikė Jolanta Karpavičienė: \"Valdovų sutuoktinės buvo tikros europietės\"|website=ukininkopatarejas.lt|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>

The [[Congress of Lutsk]], hosted by Vytautas the Great, was another example of medieval Lithuanian cuisine. Chronicles report that seven hundred barrels of honey, wine, 700 oxen, 1,400 sheep, hundreds of elk, wild boar, and other dishes were consumed daily.

Traditional Lithuanian hunting and landscape, still existing conflicts between paganism and Christianity was described by [[Mikołaj Hussowczyk|Nicolaus Hussovianus]] in his Latin poem ''Carmen de statura, feritate ac venatione bisontis'' (''A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison'', 1523).

Many culinary innovations came from Italy with [[Bona Sforza]], [[Grand Duchess consort of Lithuania]]. Bona Sforza introduced the fork and traditional Italian food - olives, olive oil; made wine and wheat flour more popular. Parsnips, cauliflowers, spinach and even artichokes were introduced and grown. It is assumed that [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] had their own [[kitchen garden]].
Daughter of Bona Sforza, [[Catherine Jagiellon]] after marying [[John III of Sweden]] introduced the fork and other cultural habits to Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sunkus Kotrynos Jogailaitės kelias į laimę|url=https://www.lzinios.lt/lzinios/istorija/sunkus-kotrynos-jogailaites-kelias-i-laime-foto/60957|quote=Kaip jau žinoma, Kotrynos Jogailaitės valdymo metais Karalių rūmai Stokholme buvo perstatyti renesanso stiliumi, būtent ši karalienė švedus išmokė naudotis šakute, jai atvykus protestantas vyras žmonai pastatė katalikų koplyčią.|website=www.lzinios.lt|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>
In XVI rulers and nobleman of Lithuania consumed grapes, oranges, melons, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, and plums.

In the sale contract made in 1623 by [[Elisabeth Sophie von Brandenburg]], wife of [[Janusz Radziwiłł (1579–1620)|Jonušas Radvila]] and [[Janusz Kiszka|Jonušas Kiška]], she sold a garden in Vilnius. The text of the treaty has very detailed mentionings of the garden plants such as grafted apple trees, pears, [[Prunus domestica|plums]] (''prunus domestica''), cherries, [[Prunus avium|wild cherries]], [[vitis]], [[Crataegus|hawthorns]], [[Rosa canina|dog roses]]. A garden for Italian vegetables (as they called back then) is also very detailed. That is potatoes, [[artichoke]]s, [[asparagus]], [[Valerianella locusta|lamb's lettuce]], [[Eruca sativa|rucola]], [[garden cress]], spinatch, melones, beets, [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[Chervil|French parsley]], Italian onions, lettuce, chicory. And spices and decorative shrubs: anise, peppermints, [[Tarragon|estragon]], dill, [[Indigofera tinctoria|true indigo]] and junipers. Wooden [[Orangery|orangerie]] is also mentioned which was used to grow [[Syconium|fig-trees]] and [[Juglans regia|common walnuts]].<ref name=\"RL-IstorinėLTVirtuvė\">{{cite book |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=Istorinė Lietuvos virtuvė: Maistas ir gėrimai Lietuvos Didžiojoje Kunigaikštystėje |date=2014 |publisher=Briedis |location=Vilnius |isbn=978-9955-26-463-7 |pages=81–82}}</ref>

The growing of potatoes in Lithuania is known from the 17th century, but it became more widespread only in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.ldkistorija.lt/index.php/istoriniai-faktai/kada-lietuvoje-atsirado-bulves/1313|title=Kada Lietuvoje atsirado bulvės?|website=m.ldkistorija.lt|accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref>

First explorer of the Lithuanian flora, botanist {{ill|Jurgis Pabrėža|lt}} described spicery growing in Lithuania.

In 18th century and 19th century recipes ''à la Lithuanienne'' appeared in the French culinary books. Romantic image of Lithuania associated with lush forests and game - no wonder the recipes ''à la Lithuanienne'' were mostly dishes prepared from moose, bear or [[grey partridge]]. ''La Cuisine classique'' by [[Urbain Dubois]] and [[Émile Bernard (chef)|Émile Bernard]], published in 1856 contained Lithuanian recipes of goose soup and souce. A culinary book by Alphonse Petit ''La gastronomie en Russie'', published in 1900 included eight Lithuanian recipes. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=Lietuviški vardai užsienio kulinarijos knygose II |url=http://kulinarinispaveldas.blogspot.com/2014/05/lietuviski-vardai-uzsienio-kulinarijos.html |website=http://kulinarinispaveldas.blogspot.com/ |accessdate=6 April 2020 |language=LT}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=11.09.

==Bread==
[[File:Juoda duona.JPG|thumb|''Ruginė duona'', dark [[rye]] bread]]
One of the oldest and most fundamental Lithuanian food products was and is rye bread. Rye bread is eaten every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bread played an important role in family rituals and agrarian ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|title=LITHUANIAN TRADITIONAL FOODS - BREAD|url=http://www.lnkc.lt/eknygos/eka/food/bread.html|website=www.lnkc.lt|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>
Traditionally, the centerpiece of Lithuanian cuisine is dark [[rye]] [[bread]] (''ruginė duona'') which is used more often than light [[wheat]] breads. The archeological finds reveal that bread in the 9th - 14th centuries in Lithuania was very similar to the current rye bread.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ką lietuviai valgė IX–XIV amžiuje: VU archeologės ištyrė pirmą lietuvišką duoną|url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/ka-lietuviai-valge-ix-xiv-amziuje-vu-archeologes-istyre-pirma-lietuviska-duona-56-986676|website=www.15min.lt|accessdate=14 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> The dough is usually based on a [[sourdough]] [[Pre-ferment|starter]], and includes some wheat flour to lighten the finished product. Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast - ''raugas'', which also had symbolical meaning of the home.  [[Rye bread]] is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, [[butter]]ed or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with [[caraway]], or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on [[sweet flag]] leaves. Lithuanian proverb says - ''Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne'' (''One can manage without gold, but not without bread'').

Some varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as ''grūdėtoji'', i.e. \"seeded\" bread.

==Vegetables and spices==

[[File:Illustration_Heracleum_sphondylium0.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Heracleum sphondylium]]'' (''Lankinis barštis'') was used since prehistory up to the 18th century to make an archaic version of ''barščiai'' soup]]

[[File:Brassica rapa (watercolor).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (ropė) was a popular root vegetable before the prevalence of potatoes in the 18th century.]]

The most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the [[potato]]; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with [[dill]], but a tremendous{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.

[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''balandėliai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior.

Lithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back after independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.

Pickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.

==Foraging: berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants==

One of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.

Mushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dzūkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:
* ''Baravykas'' – [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];
* ''Voveraitė'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepeška'' (in [[Dzūkija]] region) – [[chanterelle]];
* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vištelė'' – [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].

''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voveraitė'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voveraitė'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lepšė'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonviršis'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''šilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.

Wild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''mėlynės'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''bruknės'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguolės'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[Čepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''žemuogės'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.

</gallery>

==Fruit==
[[Apple]]s, [[plum]]s, and [[pear]]s, which grow well in Lithuania, are the most commonly used fruit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Because they cannot tolerate frost, tropical fruit such as citrus, bananas and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed. During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews ([[kompot]]s). [[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwiłł family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century.

==Meat==
[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|A small slab of ''lašiniai'' with an onion]]
[[File:Skilandis2.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' is a Lithuanian matured sausage made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic. PDO.]]
[[File:Kindziukas (1).JPG|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' and ''dešros'' (sausages)]]
The most frequently used meat is [[pork]], followed by [[beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Turkey as food|turkey]], and [[Duck (food)|duck]];{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to [[schnitzel]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying, and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.

==Fish==

Freshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]]. Since the 19th century, herring was imported to Lithuania from Norway, [[Stavanger]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grinčinaitis |first1=Sigitas |title=Kaip jūros sidabras - silkės - atkeliavo į Lietuvą? |url=http://www.silutesnaujienos.lt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16082:kaip-jros-sidabras-silks-atkeliavo-lietuv&catid=57:istorija&Itemid=102 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> [[Salmon]] is also a popular dish often served with a cream sauce, vegetables, and rice. Before building dams after Soviet occupation, salmon was quite abundant fish in Lithuanian rivers.

Smoked fish such as [[eel]] or [[bream]] are popular entrees and appetizers in areas near the [[Baltic Sea]], especially in [[Neringa Municipality|Neringa]].

[[Crayfish]] are also popular and are usually eaten in the summertime as a delicacy and a side dish served with beer.

==Dairy products==

Lithuania is known for quality dairy products. Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called ''sūreliai'' are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though some people still prefer making their own soured milk.

===Cheese===

Traditional Lithuanian curd cheese has a [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Geographical Indication]] (PGI) label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luksiupienine.lt/en/prod/curd-cheese-tradicional-liethuanian/|title= Traditional \"Senolių Lietuviškas\"|website=www.luksiupienine.lt|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea. Food historians estimate that the curd cheese was known for 4-6 thousands of years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kodėl baltas varškės, o ne brandintas sūris tapo lietuvišku kulinariniu paveldu?|url=https://www.15min.lt/maistas/naujiena/virtuve/kodel-baltas-varskes-o-ne-brandintas-suris-tapo-lietuvisku-kulinariniu-paveldu-1044-1074646 |website=www.15min.lt |accessdate=15 December 2018}}</ref>
Lithuanians started fermenting hard cheese around the 16th century in the region of [[Samogitia]]. Across Samogitian borders, this cheese was known as Lithuanian cheese.
Historically there were not much cheese sorts in Lithuania, due to low levels of [[lactose intolerance]]. Milk products were usually consumed fresh, or slightly fermented.
Semi-hard cheese ''Liliputas'' in 2015 was included in EU [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Designation of Origin]] and [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Geographical Indication]] product lists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curioustovisit.com/authentic-lithuanian-cuisine-supermarket/|title=Authentic Lithuanian Cuisine You Can Find In Any Supermarket|website=curioustovisit.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> Hard cheese ''Džiugas'' ripens for at least 12 months, is popular among gourmet and being used as dish flavour. ''Džiugas'' in 2019 included in the EU Protected Designation of Origin list. In the interwar period [[Šėta]] was famous for its cheese, which was made in ''sūrinė'' (''cheese house'').

*''[[Doughnut|Spurgos]]'' - a Lithuanian variant of doughnuts, sometimes filled with preserves. The main difference from doughnuts or berliners is that the Lithuanian version uses curd as a basis. Therefore, they often called ''varškės spurgos'' - ''curd doughnuts''.
*''[[Šakotis]]'' (also called ''raguotis'') - is essentially a pound cake grilled layer by layer, with a very distinctive branching form. It is a Lithuanian variant of a spit cake which is a distant cousin of the German [[Baumkuchen]], the French [[gâteau à la broche]], the Swedish [[Spettekaka|spättekaka]]. Some sources attribute its invention to [[Yotvingians]] - ancient, now extinct [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Polish Food 101 ‒ Sękacz |url=https://culture.pl/en/article/polish-food-101-sekacz |accessdate=22 April 2019 |quote=It's possible that Lithuanians, who allegedly ate sękacz on their way to Grunwald before the great battle of 1410, got the idea from the Germans. It's also possible they got it first, since the cake is often attributed to the Yotvingians, a [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe of who settled in Podlasie during the Middle Ages.}}</ref> Šakotis is a frequent accent of Lithuanian weddings and bigger festivities.
*''Šimtalapis (one hundred sheets)'' - introduced to Lithuania with Tatars brought by [[Vytautas the Great]] and modified locally, is made from laminated dough which is separated with layer of melted butter - the principle is very similar to that of [[croissant]].

*''Skruzdėlynas (anthill)'' - consists of individual pastries stacked on top of one another, sprinkled with poppy seeds and glazed with honey and nuts.

==Special occasions==
[[File:Kūčios.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''Kūčios'' ''(Christmas Eve)'' table]]
Easter and Christmas (Christmas Eve) are festives which have their own table presentations and type of dishes in Lithuania. Easter tables being decorated with juniper or sallow twigs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Velykos tarpukario Lietuvoje: net naktį gatvės būdavo pilnos žmonių |url=https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/kultura/12/1161433/velykos-tarpukario-lietuvoje-net-nakti-gatves-budavo-pilnos-zmoniu |website=lrt.lt |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=LT}}</ref>

*Easter - The intricately painted [[Easter egg]]s that were prepared earlier in the week are eaten for breakfast. The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.
*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Joninės]]), June 23.
*Christmas Eve ([[Kūčios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.
*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[šakotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.
*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.
*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth. Flavored vodkas, which may have been concocted with fruits and herbs according to the host's or hostess's own family recipe, may be served.

''Alus ([[beer]])'' is extremely popular throughout the country, especially again since the restoration of the Independence in 1990. Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic [[Festival|festivities]] and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|website=www.llti.lt|page=18|title=Alus – apeiginis baltų gėrimas|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808021048/http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was ''Ragutis'' or ''Rūgutis''. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.

Farmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>

The microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.

===Midus===

''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey. [[Baltic people]] were making ''midus'' for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who visited [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].  Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kublickas |first1=Rimantas |title=Traditional Foods |pages=339–343 |chapter=Midus: A Traditional Lithuanian Mead |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7648-2_27 |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4899-7646-8 }}</ref>
Oldest recipe of Lithuanian ''midus'' was recorded in a book by [[Olaus Magnus]] ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'', published in Rome in 1555.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Laužikas R. |author2=Astrauskas A. |title=How the Future King of England Ate Peacock in Vilnius: the Shared Cultural, Political and Culinary History of Britain and Lithuania |date=2018 |publisher=Lietuvos kultūros institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=9786098015652 |pages=135}}</ref>  ''Midus'' was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry. Since 16th century ''midus'' started to compete with imported vine, but it was known and was still very popular in [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vaitkevičienė |first1=Daiva |title=Midus baltų visuomenėje: nuo bitininkų iki diduomenės |url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/TD51%20internetui-22-55.pdf |publisher=Lietuvių literatūros ir tautosakos institutas |accessdate=31 March 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref>  Today ''Midus'' is produced by several companies and is to be found in the majority of liquor shops. Craft mead producing is also becoming popular. Traditional Lithuanian ''midus'' ''[[Stakliškės]]'', fermented up to 90 days has a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) label.<ref>{{cite web |title=Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1196/2013 of 22 November 2013 entering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications [Stakliškės (PGI)] |url=https://euroalert.net/oj/33604/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-no-1196-2013-of-22-november-2013-entering-a-name-in-the-register-of-protected-designations-of-origin-and-protected-geographical-indications-stakliskes-pgi |accessdate=3 May 2019}}</ref>

===Fruit and berry wines===

[[Fruit wine|Fruit and berry]] wines being made in Lithuania by several companies. Industrial production of fruit and berry wines was started by Balys Karazija in 1926 in [[Anykščiai]]. His wines have won international awards in 1938. Initiatives of B.Karazija made a fruit wine a traditional drink in Lithuania. Currently blueberry, apple, apple ice wine, black currant, aronia, cherry wines being produced by smaller and bigger companies.

===Other===
*''Arbata ([[tea]])'' - [[chamomile]], [[rosehip]], [[thyme]] and other herbal teas are popular as well as black tea. Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes.
*''Gira ([[kvass]])'' is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian [[kvass]]. Those brewed from rye [[bread]] and from [[caraway]] seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.
*''Degtinė (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-[[Distilled beverage|distilled]].
*''Kava ([[coffee]])'' is brewed in [[espresso]] makers or [[Moka pot|moka pots]] at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavinė'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gilių kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee. The first coffeehouses appeared in Lithuania in the 18th century and in 1814 there were 49 coffeehouses in Vilnius.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balsevičiūtė-Šlekienė |first1=Virginija |title=Vilniaus kavinės istoriniuose šaltiniuose ir memuaruose |url=http://www.su.lt/bylos/fakultetai/humanitarinis/ml/acta/acta-h-15/slekiene.pdf |accessdate=2 May 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref> Journalist Rapolas Mackonis was explorer of cafe life and wrote about culture of cafes in Vilnius and Kaunas. 
*''[[Starka]]'', an aged vodka, as well as [[Krupnikas]], a honey liqueur, are traditional drinks dating from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 16th - 18th centuries.
*''[[Bitters|Trauktinė]]'' (a bitter) is a strong herbal vodka; there are many varieties. It is also used as traditional medicine. ''Trejos devynerios'' (\"999\"), steeped with 27 different herbs, is one of the best known.
* ''Vynas'' ([[wine]]) culture is firmly growing in Lithuania - wineries and specialised wine shops for Italian, French, New World wines operate in biggest cities. The wine exhibition ''Vyno dienos'' (''Days of Wine'') taking place in May, is the largest wine exhibition in Northern Europe. Lithuania historically is a wine importer, since its climate isn't very friendly for growing grapevines.

'''Lithuanian cuisine''' features products suited to the cool and moist northern climate of [[Lithuania]]: [[barley]], [[potato]]es, [[rye]], [[beet]]s, [[Leaf vegetable|greens]], [[Berry|berries]], and [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]] are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Various ways of [[pickling]] were used to preserve food for winter. Soups are extremely popular, and are widely regarded as the key to good health. Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with [[Northern Europe]], Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with its Baltic neighbors and, in general, northern countries. 
Longlasting agricultural and foraging traditions along with a variety of influences during the country's history formed Lithuanian cuisine.

German traditions have had an influence on Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (''kugelis'' or [[kugel]]) and intestines stuffed with mashed potato (''vėdarai''), as well as the baroque tree cake known as ''[[Šakotis]]''. Lithuanian noblemen usually hired French chefs - [[French cuisine]] influence came to Lithuania in this way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kokią įtaką Lietuvos virtuvei padarė prancūzai?|url=https://www.15min.lt/maistas/naujiena/virtuve/kokia-itaka-lietuvos-virtuvei-padare-prancuzai-1044-719414|website=www.15min.lt|accessdate=26 March 2018|language=lt}}</ref> The most exotic influence is Eastern ([[Crimean Karaites|Karaite]]) cuisine, and the dish ''[[kibinai]]'' which became popular in Lithuania. Lithuanians and other nations which lived in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] also share some dishes and beverages. Lithuanian cuisine also influenced Polish and Ruthenian cuisines.

Despite the apparent richness of the cuisine, Lithuania has a very low prevalence of obesity.<ref>Lissau, I., et al., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=14706954 Body mass index and overweight in adolescents in 13 European countries, Israel, and the United States] (Abstract), ''Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine'', 2004 January; 158(1):27-33.</ref> 8 Lithuanian restaurants are listed in White Guide Baltic Top 30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteguide-nordic.com/nyheter/there-is-no-better-time-than-now-to-visit-baltic-restaurants|website=www.whiteguide-nordic.com|title=The best restaurants in the Nordics|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>

==History of Lithuanian cuisine==
The earliest mentions of food and agriculture of the Baltic people ([[Aestii]]) and related customs comes from [[Tacitus]] circa 98 AD: \"they cultivate grain and other crops with a perseverance unusual among the indolent Germans.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=P.

The 9th-century traveler [[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] attested usage of mead among West Balts: \"There is a great deal of honey and fishing. The king and the most powerful men drink mare's milk, the poor men and the slaves drink mead. ...

In 14th century Lithuania almost all today known [[Cereal|cereals]] and [[Fabaceae|legume]] were grown, but rye being the most popular. In the hillfort of [[Maišiagala]] in the layer of 13-14 century about 20 sorts of various cereals and legume were found - winter and summer rye, wheat, barley, oat, [[millet]], buckwheat, lentil, [[Vicia|vetches]], peas, broad beans.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ką sėdavo ir pjaudavo žemdirbiai XIII–XIV amžiuje |url=http://m.ldkistorija.lt/index.php/istoriniai-faktai/ka-sedavo-ir-pjaudavo-zemdirbiai-xiiixiv-amziuje/1519 |website=m.ldkistorija.lt |accessdate=29 September 2019 |language=LT}}</ref> 

In the Middle Ages, hunting was the main way to provide oneself with meat. It is known that [[Vytautas]] The Great before the [[Battle of Žalgiris]] organized a big hunting in the [[Białowieża Forest|Baltvyžis forest]] and prepared barrels of salt-cured meat for the army. Game was also a staple of noblemen: [[European bison|wisents]], [[aurochs]], and deer were hunted. Lithuania had long-lasting wars (about 200 years) with Teutonic Order. It also kept diplomatic relationships with it, during which various presents were exchanged - it is known what Teutonic Order sent a rare wine to [[Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania]], wife of [[Vytautas the Great]], in 1416. At this time Lithuanian nobleman already imported saffron, cinnamon, rice, pepper, raisins for their needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukininkopatarejas.lt/istorike-jolanta-karpaviciene-valdovu-sutuoktines-buvo-tikros-europietes/|title=Istorikė Jolanta Karpavičienė: \"Valdovų sutuoktinės buvo tikros europietės\"|website=ukininkopatarejas.lt|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>

The [[Congress of Lutsk]], hosted by Vytautas the Great, was another example of medieval Lithuanian cuisine. Chronicles report that seven hundred barrels of honey, wine, 700 oxen, 1,400 sheep, hundreds of elk, wild boar, and other dishes were consumed daily.

Traditional Lithuanian hunting and landscape, still existing conflicts between paganism and Christianity was described by [[Mikołaj Hussowczyk|Nicolaus Hussovianus]] in his Latin poem ''Carmen de statura, feritate ac venatione bisontis'' (''A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison'', 1523).

Many culinary innovations came from Italy with [[Bona Sforza]], [[Grand Duchess consort of Lithuania]]. Bona Sforza introduced the fork and traditional Italian food - olives, olive oil; made wine and wheat flour more popular. Parsnips, cauliflowers, spinach and even artichokes were introduced and grown. It is assumed that [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] had their own [[kitchen garden]].
Daughter of Bona Sforza, [[Catherine Jagiellon]] after marying [[John III of Sweden]] introduced the fork and other cultural habits to Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sunkus Kotrynos Jogailaitės kelias į laimę|url=https://www.lzinios.lt/lzinios/istorija/sunkus-kotrynos-jogailaites-kelias-i-laime-foto/60957|quote=Kaip jau žinoma, Kotrynos Jogailaitės valdymo metais Karalių rūmai Stokholme buvo perstatyti renesanso stiliumi, būtent ši karalienė švedus išmokė naudotis šakute, jai atvykus protestantas vyras žmonai pastatė katalikų koplyčią.|website=www.lzinios.lt|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>
In XVI rulers and nobleman of Lithuania consumed grapes, oranges, melons, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, and plums.

In the sale contract made in 1623 by [[Elisabeth Sophie von Brandenburg]], wife of [[Janusz Radziwiłł (1579–1620)|Jonušas Radvila]] and [[Janusz Kiszka|Jonušas Kiška]], she sold a garden in Vilnius. The text of the treaty has very detailed mentionings of the garden plants such as grafted apple trees, pears, [[Prunus domestica|plums]] (''prunus domestica''), cherries, [[Prunus avium|wild cherries]], [[vitis]], [[Crataegus|hawthorns]], [[Rosa canina|dog roses]]. A garden for Italian vegetables (as they called back then) is also very detailed. That is potatoes, [[artichoke]]s, [[asparagus]], [[Valerianella locusta|lamb's lettuce]], [[Eruca sativa|rucola]], [[garden cress]], spinatch, melones, beets, [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[Chervil|French parsley]], Italian onions, lettuce, chicory. And spices and decorative shrubs: anise, peppermints, [[Tarragon|estragon]], dill, [[Indigofera tinctoria|true indigo]] and junipers. Wooden [[Orangery|orangerie]] is also mentioned which was used to grow [[Syconium|fig-trees]] and [[Juglans regia|common walnuts]].<ref name=\"RL-IstorinėLTVirtuvė\">{{cite book |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=Istorinė Lietuvos virtuvė: Maistas ir gėrimai Lietuvos Didžiojoje Kunigaikštystėje |date=2014 |publisher=Briedis |location=Vilnius |isbn=978-9955-26-463-7 |pages=81–82}}</ref>

The growing of potatoes in Lithuania is known from the 17th century, but it became more widespread only in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.ldkistorija.lt/index.php/istoriniai-faktai/kada-lietuvoje-atsirado-bulves/1313|title=Kada Lietuvoje atsirado bulvės?|website=m.ldkistorija.lt|accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref>

Archeological finds at the place of the [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] revealed a lot of information about the food eaten, cutlery and serving of the rulers of Lithuania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valdovurumai.lt/en/activities/collections/erika-striskiene-archaeological-finds-at-the-palace-of-the-grand-dukes-of-lithuania#.Wx9BFUjRC70|title=Archaeological Finds at the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania|website=www.valdovurumai.lt|quote=During the archaeological digs many serving knives were found.

First explorer of the Lithuanian flora, botanist {{ill|Jurgis Pabrėža|lt}} described spicery growing in Lithuania.

In 18th century and 19th century recipes ''à la Lithuanienne'' appeared in the French culinary books. Romantic image of Lithuania associated with lush forests and game - no wonder the recipes ''à la Lithuanienne'' were mostly dishes prepared from moose, bear or [[grey partridge]]. ''La Cuisine classique'' by [[Urbain Dubois]] and [[Émile Bernard (chef)|Émile Bernard]], published in 1856 contained Lithuanian recipes of goose soup and souce. A culinary book by Alphonse Petit ''La gastronomie en Russie'', published in 1900 included eight Lithuanian recipes. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=Lietuviški vardai užsienio kulinarijos knygose II |url=http://kulinarinispaveldas.blogspot.com/2014/05/lietuviski-vardai-uzsienio-kulinarijos.html |website=http://kulinarinispaveldas.blogspot.com/ |accessdate=6 April 2020 |language=LT}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Laužikas |first1=Rimvydas |title=11.09.

==Bread==
[[File:Juoda duona.JPG|thumb|''Ruginė duona'', dark [[rye]] bread]]
One of the oldest and most fundamental Lithuanian food products was and is rye bread. Rye bread is eaten every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bread played an important role in family rituals and agrarian ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|title=LITHUANIAN TRADITIONAL FOODS - BREAD|url=http://www.lnkc.lt/eknygos/eka/food/bread.html|website=www.lnkc.lt|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>
Traditionally, the centerpiece of Lithuanian cuisine is dark [[rye]] [[bread]] (''ruginė duona'') which is used more often than light [[wheat]] breads. The archeological finds reveal that bread in the 9th - 14th centuries in Lithuania was very similar to the current rye bread.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ką lietuviai valgė IX–XIV amžiuje: VU archeologės ištyrė pirmą lietuvišką duoną|url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/ka-lietuviai-valge-ix-xiv-amziuje-vu-archeologes-istyre-pirma-lietuviska-duona-56-986676|website=www.15min.lt|accessdate=14 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> The dough is usually based on a [[sourdough]] [[Pre-ferment|starter]], and includes some wheat flour to lighten the finished product. Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast - ''raugas'', which also had symbolical meaning of the home.  [[Rye bread]] is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, [[butter]]ed or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with [[caraway]], or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on [[sweet flag]] leaves. Lithuanian proverb says - ''Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne'' (''One can manage without gold, but not without bread'').

Some varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as ''grūdėtoji'', i.e. \"seeded\" bread.

==Vegetables and spices==

[[File:Illustration_Heracleum_sphondylium0.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Heracleum sphondylium]]'' (''Lankinis barštis'') was used since prehistory up to the 18th century to make an archaic version of ''barščiai'' soup]]

[[File:Brassica rapa (watercolor).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (ropė) was a popular root vegetable before the prevalence of potatoes in the 18th century.]]

The most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the [[potato]]; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with [[dill]], but a tremendous{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.

[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''balandėliai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior.

Lithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back after independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.

Pickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.

==Foraging: berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants==

One of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.

Mushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dzūkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:
* ''Baravykas'' – [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];
* ''Voveraitė'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepeška'' (in [[Dzūkija]] region) – [[chanterelle]];
* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vištelė'' – [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].

''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voveraitė'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voveraitė'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lepšė'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonviršis'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''šilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.

Wild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''mėlynės'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''bruknės'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguolės'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[Čepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''žemuogės'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.

</gallery>

==Fruit==
[[Apple]]s, [[plum]]s, and [[pear]]s, which grow well in Lithuania, are the most commonly used fruit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Because they cannot tolerate frost, tropical fruit such as citrus, bananas and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed. During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews ([[kompot]]s). [[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwiłł family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century.

==Meat==
[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|A small slab of ''lašiniai'' with an onion]]
[[File:Skilandis2.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' is a Lithuanian matured sausage made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic. PDO.]]
[[File:Kindziukas (1).JPG|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' and ''dešros'' (sausages)]]
The most frequently used meat is [[pork]], followed by [[beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Turkey as food|turkey]], and [[Duck (food)|duck]];{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to [[schnitzel]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying, and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.

==Fish==

Freshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]]. Since the 19th century, herring was imported to Lithuania from Norway, [[Stavanger]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grinčinaitis |first1=Sigitas |title=Kaip jūros sidabras - silkės - atkeliavo į Lietuvą? |url=http://www.silutesnaujienos.lt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16082:kaip-jros-sidabras-silks-atkeliavo-lietuv&catid=57:istorija&Itemid=102 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> [[Salmon]] is also a popular dish often served with a cream sauce, vegetables, and rice. Before building dams after Soviet occupation, salmon was quite abundant fish in Lithuanian rivers.

Smoked fish such as [[eel]] or [[bream]] are popular entrees and appetizers in areas near the [[Baltic Sea]], especially in [[Neringa Municipality|Neringa]].

[[Crayfish]] are also popular and are usually eaten in the summertime as a delicacy and a side dish served with beer.

==Dairy products==

Lithuania is known for quality dairy products. Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called ''sūreliai'' are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though many people still prefer making their own soured milk.

===Cheese===

Traditional Lithuanian curd cheese has a [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Geographical Indication]] (PGI) label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luksiupienine.lt/en/prod/curd-cheese-tradicional-liethuanian/|title= Traditional \"Senolių Lietuviškas\"|website=www.luksiupienine.lt|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea. Food historians estimate that the curd cheese was known for 4-6 thousands of years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kodėl baltas varškės, o ne brandintas sūris tapo lietuvišku kulinariniu paveldu?|url=https://www.15min.lt/maistas/naujiena/virtuve/kodel-baltas-varskes-o-ne-brandintas-suris-tapo-lietuvisku-kulinariniu-paveldu-1044-1074646 |website=www.15min.lt |accessdate=15 December 2018}}</ref>
Lithuanians started fermenting hard cheese around the 16th century in the region of [[Samogitia]]. Across Samogitian borders, this cheese was known as Lithuanian cheese.
Historically there were not much cheese sorts in Lithuania, due to low levels of [[lactose intolerance]]. Milk products were usually consumed fresh, or slightly fermented.
Semi-hard cheese ''Liliputas'' in 2015 was included in EU [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Designation of Origin]] and [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Geographical Indication]] product lists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curioustovisit.com/authentic-lithuanian-cuisine-supermarket/|title=Authentic Lithuanian Cuisine You Can Find In Any Supermarket|website=curioustovisit.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> Hard cheese ''Džiugas'' ripens for at least 12 months, is popular among gourmet and being used as dish flavour. ''Džiugas'' in 2019 included in the EU Protected Designation of Origin list. In the interwar period [[Šėta]] was famous for its cheese, which was made in ''sūrinė'' (''cheese house'').

[[File:Varškinės spurgos.JPG|thumb|left|Lithuanian curd doughnuts - ''spurgos'']]

===Desserts===

Lithuanian-style [[cake]]s (''pyragas'') are often baked in a rectangular pan and sometimes have an apple, plum, [[apricot]], or other fruit baked in; they are less frequently iced than is customary in the United States. These cakes are cut into squares for serving. [[Poppy seed]] is sometimes used as a swirl filling in dessert bread ([[Poppy seed roll]] and [[šimtalapis]]) and as a flavoring in other pastries.

For special occasions, [[torte]] may be prepared; they often consist of 10 to 20 layers, filled with jam and vanilla, chocolate, [[Cafe mocha|mocha]], or rum [[buttercream]]s; they are lavishly decorated. Lithuanian coffeehouses (''kavinė'') serve a variety of tortes and pastries to attract evening strollers.

Desserts include:
*''Žagarėliai'' (also known as krustai or chrustai) - Twisted, thin deep-fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar; identical to Scandinavian [[Klejner]] cookies, similar to Mexican [[buñuelo]].
*''Kūčiukai'' or ''šližikai'' - very small rolls are baked and served with [[opium poppy|poppy]]seed milk; this is a traditional [[Kūčios|Kūčios']] ([[Christmas Eve]]) dish.
*''Ledai'' - [[ice cream]] is served everywhere in the summer.
*''[[Doughnut|Spurgos]]'' - a Lithuanian variant of doughnuts, sometimes filled with preserves. The main difference from doughnuts or berliners is that the Lithuanian version uses curd as a basis. Therefore, they often called ''varškės spurgos'' - ''curd doughnuts''.

It's also possible they got it first, since the cake is often attributed to the Yotvingians, a [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe of who settled in Podlasie during the Middle Ages.}}</ref> Šakotis is a frequent accent of Lithuanian weddings and bigger festivities.
*''Šimtalapis (one hundred sheets)'' - introduced to Lithuania with Tatars brought by [[Vytautas the Great]] and modified locally, is made from laminated dough which is separated with layer of melted butter - the principle is very similar to that of [[croissant]].

==Special occasions==
[[File:Kūčios.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''Kūčios'' ''(Christmas Eve)'' table]]
Easter and Christmas (Christmas Eve) are festives which have their own table presentations and type of dishes in Lithuania. Easter tables being decorated with juniper or sallow twigs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Velykos tarpukario Lietuvoje: net naktį gatvės būdavo pilnos žmonių |url=https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/kultura/12/1161433/velykos-tarpukario-lietuvoje-net-nakti-gatves-budavo-pilnos-zmoniu |website=lrt.lt |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=LT}}</ref>

*Easter - The intricately painted [[Easter egg]]s that were prepared earlier in the week are eaten for breakfast. The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.
*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Joninės]]), June 23.
*Christmas Eve ([[Kūčios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.
*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[šakotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.
*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.
*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth. Flavored vodkas, which may have been concocted with fruits and herbs according to the host's or hostess's own family recipe, may be served.

''Alus ([[beer]])'' is extremely popular throughout the country, especially again since the restoration of the Independence in 1990. Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic [[Festival|festivities]] and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|website=www.llti.lt|page=18|title=Alus – apeiginis baltų gėrimas|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808021048/http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was ''Ragutis'' or ''Rūgutis''. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.

Farmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>

The microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.

===Midus===

''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey. [[Baltic people]] were making ''midus'' for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who visited [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].  Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kublickas |first1=Rimantas |title=Traditional Foods |pages=339–343 |chapter=Midus: A Traditional Lithuanian Mead |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7648-2_27 |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4899-7646-8 }}</ref>
Oldest recipe of Lithuanian ''midus'' was recorded in a book by [[Olaus Magnus]] ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'', published in Rome in 1555.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Laužikas R. |author2=Astrauskas A. |title=How the Future King of England Ate Peacock in Vilnius: the Shared Cultural, Political and Culinary History of Britain and Lithuania |date=2018 |publisher=Lietuvos kultūros institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=9786098015652 |pages=135}}</ref>  ''Midus'' was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry. Since 16th century ''midus'' started to compete with imported vine, but it was known and was still very popular in [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vaitkevičienė |first1=Daiva |title=Midus baltų visuomenėje: nuo bitininkų iki diduomenės |url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/TD51%20internetui-22-55.pdf |publisher=Lietuvių literatūros ir tautosakos institutas |accessdate=31 March 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref>  Today ''Midus'' is produced by several companies and is to be found in the majority of liquor shops. Craft mead producing is also becoming popular. Traditional Lithuanian ''midus'' ''[[Stakliškės]]'', fermented up to 90 days has a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) label.<ref>{{cite web |title=Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1196/2013 of 22 November 2013 entering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications [Stakliškės (PGI)] |url=https://euroalert.net/oj/33604/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-no-1196-2013-of-22-november-2013-entering-a-name-in-the-register-of-protected-designations-of-origin-and-protected-geographical-indications-stakliskes-pgi |accessdate=3 May 2019}}</ref>

===Fruit and berry wines===

[[Fruit wine|Fruit and berry]] wines being made in Lithuania by several companies. Industrial production of fruit and berry wines was started by Balys Karazija in 1926 in [[Anykščiai]]. His wines have won international awards in 1938. Initiatives of B.Karazija made a fruit wine a traditional drink in Lithuania. Currently blueberry, apple, apple ice wine, black currant, aronia, cherry wines being produced by smaller and bigger companies.

===Other===
*''Arbata ([[tea]])'' - [[chamomile]], [[rosehip]], [[thyme]] and other herbal teas are popular as well as black tea. Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes.
*''Gira ([[kvass]])'' is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian [[kvass]]. Those brewed from rye [[bread]] and from [[caraway]] seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.
*''Degtinė (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-[[Distilled beverage|distilled]].
*''Kava ([[coffee]])'' is brewed in [[espresso]] makers or [[Moka pot|moka pots]] at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavinė'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gilių kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee. The first coffeehouses appeared in Lithuania in the 18th century and in 1814 there were 49 coffeehouses in Vilnius.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balsevičiūtė-Šlekienė |first1=Virginija |title=Vilniaus kavinės istoriniuose šaltiniuose ir memuaruose |url=http://www.su.lt/bylos/fakultetai/humanitarinis/ml/acta/acta-h-15/slekiene.pdf |accessdate=2 May 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref> Journalist Rapolas Mackonis was explorer of cafe life and wrote about culture of cafes in Vilnius and Kaunas. 
*''[[Starka]]'', an aged vodka, as well as [[Krupnikas]], a honey liqueur, are traditional drinks dating from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 16th - 18th centuries.
*''[[Bitters|Trauktinė]]'' (a bitter) is a strong herbal vodka; there are many varieties. It is also used as traditional medicine. ''Trejos devynerios'' (\"999\"), steeped with 27 different herbs, is one of the best known.
* ''Vynas'' ([[wine]]) culture is firmly growing in Lithuania - wineries and specialised wine shops for Italian, French, New World wines operate in biggest cities. The wine exhibition ''Vyno dienos'' (''Days of Wine'') taking place in May, is the largest wine exhibition in Northern Europe. Lithuania historically is a wine importer, since its climate isn't very friendly for growing grapevines.

'''Mequon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|k|w|ɒ|n}}) is a city in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], [[Wisconsin]], United States. Located on [[Interstate 43]], the community is a [[suburb]] in the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]].

==History==
[[File:Isham Day House Mequon WI May09.jpg|thumb|left|The 1839 [[Isham Day House]] is now a museum located in Settlers Park.]]

The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Sauk people]]. In the early 19th century, the   Potawatomi had a village in present-day [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road. In 1831, The Menominee surrendered the land between the [[Milwaukee River]] and [[Lake Michigan]] to the United States Federal Government through the [[Treaty of Washington, with Menominee (1831)|Treaty of Washington]].<ref name= \"corrigan\">Walter D.

White trappers, explorers, and traders used the Milwaukee River through the middle of what is now Mequon as a means of transportation. The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

===Freistadt===
In October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were [[Old Lutherans]] who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].<ref>Ozaukee County. [http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/777/Trinity-Evangelical-Lutheran-Church---Fr Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church - Freistadt]</ref> In German, \"Freistadt\" means \"Free City\".<ref>*[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=5544 Freistadt] in ''Dictionary of Wisconsin History''</ref>

In 1840, they built a log cabin church, which they named Trinity Lutheran Church. It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the [[Lutheran Synod of Buffalo]] was organized in Freistadt. However, the Freistadt church became a part of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&entity=WI.OzEarlyHist.p0103&id=WI.OzEarlyHist&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref> The wooden church was replaced with a limestone building in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|title=Property Record: 10729 W Freistadt Rd.|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Property/HI13485|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

===Thiensville===
Joachim Heinrich Thien moved to the area in 1842 from [[Oldenburg]], [[Prussia]], and helped design a plan for the settlement that would become [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]]. A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.

Thien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

Thiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.

In 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A. Nieman Canning Company in the village to make up for the loss of labor due to local men fighting in [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD-kby0LiuEC&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123|title=Stalag Wisconsin: Inside WW II Prisoner-of-war Camps|last=Cowley|first=Betty|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Badger Books Inc.|isbn=9781878569837|pages=120–25|language=en}}</ref> German prisoners from Camp Rockfield in [[Rockfield, Wisconsin]], (located in present-day [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Germantown]]) also worked at the Fromm Bros., Nieman & Co.

===City of Mequon===
The Town of Mequon experienced significant population growth during the [[suburbanization]] that followed World War II. Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

The city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier. Despite being a city, much of Mequon remains rural, and nearly half of the land in the community in undeveloped.

==Geography==
Mequon is located at {{coord|43|13|27|N|87|57|36|W|type:city}} (43.224243, &minus;87.960094), about {{convert|15|mi}} north of Milwaukee and is part of the [[Milwaukee–Racine–Waukesha Metropolitan Area|Milwaukee metropolitan area]].<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|48.77|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|46.28|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64vfLAeJ2?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-24}}</ref> As of 2005, Mequon was the third-largest city in terms of land area in the state of [[Wisconsin]].<ref>[http://www.lwm-info.org/vertical/Sites/%7B92F7D640-E25A-4317-90AD-4976378A8F8D%7D/uploads/%7B3468C14F-4B58-4594-9571-E14499B23DD9%7D.PDF Estimated Population per Square Mile of Land Area, Wisconsin Municipalities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005025257/http://www.lwm-info.org/vertical/Sites/%7B92F7D640-E25A-4317-90AD-4976378A8F8D%7D/uploads/%7B3468C14F-4B58-4594-9571-E14499B23DD9%7D.PDF |date=2011-10-05 }}. The cities of [[Milwaukee]] (96.14 sq mi) and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] (75.40 sq mi) are larger. Green Bay (45.53 sq mi) is the next largest city. The village of [[Kronenwetter, Wisconsin|Kronenwetter]] is also larger, as are more than 200 [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Town|towns]].</ref> Though much of the population lives in residential areas, approximately half of the land within the city's boundaries is undeveloped or farmed.<ref name=Citywebsite>{{cite web|title=Home - City of Mequon website|url=http://www.ci.mequon.wi.us/|work=City of Mequon website|publisher=City of Mequon|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>

The [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Village of Thiensville]] is an [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] in central Mequon. The city is also bordered by the [[Cedarburg (town), Wisconsin|Town of Cedarburg]], [[Cedarburg, Wisconsin|City of Cedarburg]], and [[Grafton (town), Wisconsin|Town of Grafton]] to the north; [[Lake Michigan]] to the east; the [[Bayside, Wisconsin|Village of Bayside]], [[River Hills, Wisconsin|Village of River Hills]], [[Brown Deer, Wisconsin|Village of Brown Deer]], and [[Milwaukee|City of Milwaukee]] to the south; and the [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Village of Germantown]] to the west.

[[File:MequonLakeMichigan.jpg|thumb|The clay bluffs in Virmond Park along Lake Michigan]]

The city is located on the western shore of [[Lake Michigan]], and the coastline is characterized by clay [[Cliff|bluffs]] ranging from 80 feet (24 meters) to 140 feet (43 meters) in height with deep [[ravine]]s where streams flow into the lake. Clay bluffs are a geological formation characteristic of the Lake Michigan shoreline, and are found in few other areas of the world. Much of the coast has mixed gravel and sand beaches.<ref name=\"Resources\">{{cite web|title=Inventory of Agricultural, Natural, and Cultural Resources|url=https://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/DocumentCenter/View/813/Comprehensive-Plan-2035-Chapter-3?bidId=|publisher=Ozaukee County|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Coastal\">{{cite web|title=Central Lake Michigan Coastal Ecological Landscape|url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Landscapes/documents/1805Ch8.pdf#view=Fit|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>

The city is located in the [[Southeastern Wisconsin Till Plains (ecoregion)|Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains]] that were created by the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] during the most recent ice age. The soil is clayey glacial [[till]] with a thin layer of [[loess]] on the surface. The town has some [[limestone]] deposits, including the [[Devonian]] Thiensville formation in north-central Mequon and the [[Silurian]] Little Menomonee River Reef District, which contains [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] marine fossils. The [[Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources]] considers the eastern part of the city along the lake to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape, while the western part of the city is in the Southern Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape.<ref name=\"Resources\"/>

The [[Milwaukee River]] and its [[tributary]] Pigeon Creek flow through the eastern part of the city. Little Menomonee Creek and the Little Menomonee River, which are tributaries of the [[Menomonee River]], flow through western Mequon.<ref name=\"GR3\"/>

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Mequon was an upland forest dominated by [[Fagus grandifolia|American beech]] and [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]] trees. There is also a large [[Larix laricina|tamarack]] swamp along the Little Menomonee River. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture.<ref name=Resources />

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Grafton. Large mammals, including [[white-tailed deer]], [[coyotes]], and [[red fox]]es can be seen in the city. Many birds, including [[great blue heron]]s and [[wild turkey]]s are found in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ecological Landscapes of Wisconsin |url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Landscapes/documents/1805Ch18.pdf#view=Fit |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=February 13, 2020}}</ref> The city is also home to many rare and notable species, including the state-designated endangered [[Pterospora|pinedrops]] and [[Plantago cordata|heartleaf plantain]]; threatened [[Eurybia furcata|forked aster]], [[Trillium nivale|snow trillium]], and [[Gentiana alba|yellow gentian]]; as well as [[Lithospermum latifolium|American gromwell]] and [[Jeffersonia|twinleaf]], which are state-designated special concern plant species.<ref name=Resources />

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the [[emerald ash borer]], [[common carp]], [[Phalaris arundinacea|reed canary grass]], the [[Phragmites|common reed]], [[Lythrum salicaria|purple loosestrife]], [[Alliaria petiolata|garlic mustard]], [[Rhamnus (plant)|Eurasian buckthorns]], and [[honeysuckle]]s.<ref name=\"Coastal\"/>

===Climate===
Mequon experiences four distinct [[season]]s, with variation in precipitation and temperature being very wide. The overall climate of the city is moderated by nearby [[Lake Michigan]], which causes temperatures to be cooler in summer and especially spring, and which keeps overnight temperatures warmer in winter. In March and April, the temperature in Mequon can be 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 8 degrees Celsius) cooler than temperatures in towns just 15 miles (25 kilometers) farther from the lake.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} In December and January, the effect is reversed, with temperatures in inland towns falling much lower.

In Mequon, the warmest month of the year is July, when the high temperature averages 81&nbsp;°F (27&nbsp;°C), with low temperatures of approximately 59&nbsp;°F (15&nbsp;°C). June and July are the wettest months of the year, with the majority of [[rain]] falling in short-lived [[thunderstorm]]s. January is the coldest month in Mequon, with average high temperatures averaging only 27&nbsp;°F (-3&nbsp;°C), and lows averaging 11&nbsp;°F (-12&nbsp;°C).<ref name=TWC>{{cite web|title=Average Weather for Mequon, WI - Temperature and Precipitation|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USWI0443|work=weather.com|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> February is the driest month, with almost all precipitation falling in the form of [[snow]]. In an average winter, 47.0 in (1.3m) of snow falls. The city's proximity to Lake Michigan often [[lake-effect snow|increases]] the snow received by the city. Most of the city's snowfall comes from systems such as [[Alberta clipper]]s and [[Panhandle hook]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The highest temperature ever recorded in Mequon was 105&nbsp;°F (41&nbsp;°C) on July 24, 1935, and again on July 17, 1995. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was -40&nbsp;°F (-40&nbsp;°C), on January 17, 1982, also known as [[Cold Sunday]].<ref name=TWC/>

[[File:O'Brien-Peuschel Farmstead Mequon WI May-09.jpg|thumb|Located in rural northwest Mequon, the [[O'Brien-Peuschel Farmstead]] was settled in 1846 and has extant buildings dating to as early as 1850. It is [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|listed]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]]

Mequon's economy was primarily agricultural. Some farmsteads from as early as the 1840s and 1850s still stand in the community and are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The first major businesses were hydropowered mills on the Milwaukee River and other businesses that served local farmers, many of which concentrated in Thiensville.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schnell|first1=Traci E.|last2=Faltinson|first2=Brian J.|title=Main Street Historic District|url={{NRHP url|id=04001279}}|accessdate=2017-02-03|work=[[NRHP]] Inventory-Nomination Form|publisher=National Park Service|date=May 2003}}</ref>

Beginning in the 1920s, the Nieman and Fromm families began [[fur farming]] [[Silver fox (animal)|silver foxes]] in Mequon. Several companies, including Fromm Bros., Nieman & Co.; Federal Silver Fox Farms, Inc.; Ozaukee Fur Farms Co.; Herbert A. Nieman & Co.; and Cedarburg Fox Farms, Inc. all began operating in Mequon and southern Cedarburg in the 1920s. In 1928, 6600 of the 8841 pelts sold by the New York Auction Co. came from the Fromm and Nieman operations in Wisconsin for a record-breaking sum of $1,021,000. In 1929, the Nieman and Fromm operations broke their own record with auction sales of $1,331,679, making them a leader in the national fur industry. By 1937, the farms were selling 30,000 pelts per year. After World War II, changing consumer tastes caused the farms to begin breeding [[mink]] in addition to silver fox. Fur sales declined later in the 20th century, and farms sold their last pelts in 1985.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Heggland|first1=Timothy F.|title=Nieman, Edwin J. Sr., House|url={{NRHP url|id=96000418}}|accessdate=2017-02-11|work=[[NRHP]] Inventory-Nomination Form|publisher=National Park Service|date=1995-01-05}}</ref>

The mid-to-late 20th century saw diversification in Mequon's economy. Retail stores opened to serve the increasingly suburban community, and manufacturers opened plants. In 1983, [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] moved from its campus in Milwaukee to a newly acquired campus in Mequon. In 1994, St. Mary's Hospital Ozaukee opened. As of 2015, the two institutions—both located in close proximity to [[Interstate 43]]—were among the largest employers in Ozaukee County. Despite the growth of new industries, half of Mequon's land remains undeveloped and agriculture continues to play a significant role in the local economy.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/>

'''Mequon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|k|w|ɒ|n}}) is a city in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], [[Wisconsin]], United States. Located on [[Interstate 43]], the community is a [[suburb]] in the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]]. It [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of Wisconsin#City|city]] in 1957 to avoid annexation by the City of [[Milwaukee]]. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 23,132.

==Toponymy==
\"Mequon\" may have come from the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word \"Emikwaan\" or \"Miguan\", meaning ladle, referring to the shape of the river in the area.<ref>\"[http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm \"Yankee Settler's Cottage.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420074506/http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm |date=2006-04-20}} [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin]] website</ref> Alternatively, the name may come from an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquin]] word meaning \"feather\", as suggested by the current [[Menominee]] name of the town: ''Mēkon''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www4.uwsp.edu/museum/menomineeClans/places/chart.aspx|title=Menominee Place Names in Wisconsin|last=Hoffman|first=Mike|website=The Menominee Clans Story|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Isham Day House Mequon WI May09.jpg|thumb|left|The 1839 [[Isham Day House]] is now a museum located in Settlers Park.]]

The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Sauk people]]. In the early 19th century, the   Potawatomi had a village in present-day [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road. In 1831, The Menominee surrendered the land between the [[Milwaukee River]] and [[Lake Michigan]] to the United States Federal Government through the [[Treaty of Washington, with Menominee (1831)|Treaty of Washington]].<ref name= \"corrigan\">Walter D. Corrigan, ''History of the Town of Mequon, Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, Brought Down to about 1870''. Mequon: Mequon Club, 1950.</ref> The Potawatomi surrendered the area of Mequon west of the Milwaukee River in 1833 through the [[Treaty of Chicago]], which required them to leave the area by 1838.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=article&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&id=WI.OzEarlyHist&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref> While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to [[Kansas]], some chose to remain, and were known as \"strolling Potawatomi\" because they were migrant [[Squatting|squatters]]. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the [[Forest County Potawatomi Community]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Potawatomi History|url=https://www.mpm.edu/content/wirp/ICW-152|publisher=Milwaukee Public Museum|accessdate=February 20, 2020}}</ref>

White trappers, explorers, and traders used the Milwaukee River through the middle of what is now Mequon as a means of transportation. The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

===Freistadt===
In October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were [[Old Lutherans]] who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].<ref>Ozaukee County. [http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/777/Trinity-Evangelical-Lutheran-Church---Fr Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church - Freistadt]</ref> In German, \"Freistadt\" means \"Free City\".<ref>*[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=5544 Freistadt] in ''Dictionary of Wisconsin History''</ref>

In 1840, they built a log cabin church, which they named Trinity Lutheran Church. It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the [[Lutheran Synod of Buffalo]] was organized in Freistadt. However, the Freistadt church became a part of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&entity=WI.OzEarlyHist.p0103&id=WI.OzEarlyHist&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref> The wooden church was replaced with a limestone building in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|title=Property Record: 10729 W Freistadt Rd.|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Property/HI13485|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

===Thiensville===
Joachim Heinrich Thien moved to the area in 1842 from [[Oldenburg]], [[Prussia]], and helped design a plan for the settlement that would become [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]]. A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.

Thien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

Thiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.

In 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A. Nieman Canning Company in the village to make up for the loss of labor due to local men fighting in [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD-kby0LiuEC&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123|title=Stalag Wisconsin: Inside WW II Prisoner-of-war Camps|last=Cowley|first=Betty|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Badger Books Inc.|isbn=9781878569837|pages=120–25|language=en}}</ref> German prisoners from Camp Rockfield in [[Rockfield, Wisconsin]], (located in present-day [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Germantown]]) also worked at the Fromm Bros., Nieman & Co.

In the 20th century, Mequon and the village of Theinsville developed a close relationship,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ci.mequon.wi.us/econdev/page/city-mequon-and-village-thiensville-community-gateway-features|title=City of Mequon and Village of Thiensville Community Gateway Features {{!}} Mequon Wisconsin|website=www.ci.mequon.wi.us|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> with shared schools,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtsd.k12.wi.us/|title=Mequon-Thiensville School District {{!}} The Launchpad to Success|website=www.mtsd.k12.wi.us|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> animal clinics,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thiensvillemequonsac.com/|title=Homepage {{!}} Thiensville-Mequon Small Animal Clinic|website=www.thiensvillemequonsac.com|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> libraries,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flwlib.org/|title=Frank L.

===City of Mequon===
The Town of Mequon experienced significant population growth during the [[suburbanization]] that followed World War II. Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

The city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier. Despite being a city, much of Mequon remains rural, and nearly half of the land in the community in undeveloped.

==Geography==
Mequon is located at {{coord|43|13|27|N|87|57|36|W|type:city}} (43.224243, &minus;87.960094), about {{convert|15|mi}} north of Milwaukee and is part of the [[Milwaukee–Racine–Waukesha Metropolitan Area|Milwaukee metropolitan area]].<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|48.77|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|46.28|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64vfLAeJ2?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-24}}</ref> As of 2005, Mequon was the third-largest city in terms of land area in the state of [[Wisconsin]].<ref>[http://www.lwm-info.org/vertical/Sites/%7B92F7D640-E25A-4317-90AD-4976378A8F8D%7D/uploads/%7B3468C14F-4B58-4594-9571-E14499B23DD9%7D.PDF Estimated Population per Square Mile of Land Area, Wisconsin Municipalities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005025257/http://www.lwm-info.org/vertical/Sites/%7B92F7D640-E25A-4317-90AD-4976378A8F8D%7D/uploads/%7B3468C14F-4B58-4594-9571-E14499B23DD9%7D.PDF |date=2011-10-05 }}. The cities of [[Milwaukee]] (96.14 sq mi) and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] (75.40 sq mi) are larger. Green Bay (45.53 sq mi) is the next largest city. The village of [[Kronenwetter, Wisconsin|Kronenwetter]] is also larger, as are more than 200 [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Town|towns]].</ref> Though much of the population lives in residential areas, approximately half of the land within the city's boundaries is undeveloped or farmed.<ref name=Citywebsite>{{cite web|title=Home - City of Mequon website|url=http://www.ci.mequon.wi.us/|work=City of Mequon website|publisher=City of Mequon|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>

The [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Village of Thiensville]] is an [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] in central Mequon. The city is also bordered by the [[Cedarburg (town), Wisconsin|Town of Cedarburg]], [[Cedarburg, Wisconsin|City of Cedarburg]], and [[Grafton (town), Wisconsin|Town of Grafton]] to the north; [[Lake Michigan]] to the east; the [[Bayside, Wisconsin|Village of Bayside]], [[River Hills, Wisconsin|Village of River Hills]], [[Brown Deer, Wisconsin|Village of Brown Deer]], and [[Milwaukee|City of Milwaukee]] to the south; and the [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Village of Germantown]] to the west.

[[File:MequonLakeMichigan.jpg|thumb|The clay bluffs in Virmond Park along Lake Michigan]]

The city is located on the western shore of [[Lake Michigan]], and the coastline is characterized by clay [[Cliff|bluffs]] ranging from 80 feet (24 meters) to 140 feet (43 meters) in height with deep [[ravine]]s where streams flow into the lake. Clay bluffs are a geological formation characteristic of the Lake Michigan shoreline, and are found in few other areas of the world. Much of the coast has mixed gravel and sand beaches.<ref name=\"Resources\">{{cite web|title=Inventory of Agricultural, Natural, and Cultural Resources|url=https://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/DocumentCenter/View/813/Comprehensive-Plan-2035-Chapter-3?bidId=|publisher=Ozaukee County|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Coastal\">{{cite web|title=Central Lake Michigan Coastal Ecological Landscape|url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Landscapes/documents/1805Ch8.pdf#view=Fit|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>

The city is located in the [[Southeastern Wisconsin Till Plains (ecoregion)|Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains]] that were created by the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] during the most recent ice age. The soil is clayey glacial [[till]] with a thin layer of [[loess]] on the surface. The town has some [[limestone]] deposits, including the [[Devonian]] Thiensville formation in north-central Mequon and the [[Silurian]] Little Menomonee River Reef District, which contains [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] marine fossils. The [[Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources]] considers the eastern part of the city along the lake to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape, while the western part of the city is in the Southern Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape.<ref name=\"Resources\"/>

The [[Milwaukee River]] and its [[tributary]] Pigeon Creek flow through the eastern part of the city. Little Menomonee Creek and the Little Menomonee River, which are tributaries of the [[Menomonee River]], flow through western Mequon.<ref name=\"GR3\"/>

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Mequon was an upland forest dominated by [[Fagus grandifolia|American beech]] and [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]] trees. There is also a large [[Larix laricina|tamarack]] swamp along the Little Menomonee River. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture.<ref name=Resources />

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Grafton. Large mammals, including [[white-tailed deer]], [[coyotes]], and [[red fox]]es can be seen in the city. Many birds, including [[great blue heron]]s and [[wild turkey]]s are found in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ecological Landscapes of Wisconsin |url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Landscapes/documents/1805Ch18.pdf#view=Fit |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=February 13, 2020}}</ref> The city is also home to many rare and notable species, including the state-designated endangered [[Pterospora|pinedrops]] and [[Plantago cordata|heartleaf plantain]]; threatened [[Eurybia furcata|forked aster]], [[Trillium nivale|snow trillium]], and [[Gentiana alba|yellow gentian]]; as well as [[Lithospermum latifolium|American gromwell]] and [[Jeffersonia|twinleaf]], which are state-designated special concern plant species.<ref name=Resources />

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the [[emerald ash borer]], [[common carp]], [[Phalaris arundinacea|reed canary grass]], the [[Phragmites|common reed]], [[Lythrum salicaria|purple loosestrife]], [[Alliaria petiolata|garlic mustard]], [[Rhamnus (plant)|Eurasian buckthorns]], and [[honeysuckle]]s.<ref name=\"Coastal\"/>

===Climate===
Mequon experiences four distinct [[season]]s, with variation in precipitation and temperature being very wide. The overall climate of the city is moderated by nearby [[Lake Michigan]], which causes temperatures to be cooler in summer and especially spring, and which keeps overnight temperatures warmer in winter. In March and April, the temperature in Mequon can be 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 8 degrees Celsius) cooler than temperatures in towns just 15 miles (25 kilometers) farther from the lake.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} In December and January, the effect is reversed, with temperatures in inland towns falling much lower.

In Mequon, the warmest month of the year is July, when the high temperature averages 81&nbsp;°F (27&nbsp;°C), with low temperatures of approximately 59&nbsp;°F (15&nbsp;°C). June and July are the wettest months of the year, with the majority of [[rain]] falling in short-lived [[thunderstorm]]s. January is the coldest month in Mequon, with average high temperatures averaging only 27&nbsp;°F (-3&nbsp;°C), and lows averaging 11&nbsp;°F (-12&nbsp;°C).<ref name=TWC>{{cite web|title=Average Weather for Mequon, WI - Temperature and Precipitation|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USWI0443|work=weather.com|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> February is the driest month, with almost all precipitation falling in the form of [[snow]]. In an average winter, 47.0 in (1.3m) of snow falls. The city's proximity to Lake Michigan often [[lake-effect snow|increases]] the snow received by the city. Most of the city's snowfall comes from systems such as [[Alberta clipper]]s and [[Panhandle hook]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The highest temperature ever recorded in Mequon was 105&nbsp;°F (41&nbsp;°C) on July 24, 1935, and again on July 17, 1995. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was -40&nbsp;°F (-40&nbsp;°C), on January 17, 1982, also known as [[Cold Sunday]].<ref name=TWC/>

==Economy==
[[File:O'Brien-Peuschel Farmstead Mequon WI May-09.jpg|thumb|Located in rural northwest Mequon, the [[O'Brien-Peuschel Farmstead]] was settled in 1846 and has extant buildings dating to as early as 1850. It is [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|listed]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]]

[[File:Frank Vocke Octagonal Barn.jpg|thumb|Farmers in eastern Mequon built [[Round barn#Octagonal|octagonal barns]], believing the shape to be better suited to the winds coming off nearby Lake Michigan.

Mequon's economy was primarily agricultural. Some farmsteads from as early as the 1840s and 1850s still stand in the community and are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The first major businesses were hydropowered mills on the Milwaukee River and other businesses that served local farmers, many of which concentrated in Thiensville.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schnell|first1=Traci E.|last2=Faltinson|first2=Brian J.|title=Main Street Historic District|url={{NRHP url|id=04001279}}|accessdate=2017-02-03|work=[[NRHP]] Inventory-Nomination Form|publisher=National Park Service|date=May 2003}}</ref>

Beginning in the 1920s, the Nieman and Fromm families began [[fur farming]] [[Silver fox (animal)|silver foxes]] in Mequon. Several companies, including Fromm Bros., Nieman & Co.; Federal Silver Fox Farms, Inc.; Ozaukee Fur Farms Co.; Herbert A. Nieman & Co.; and Cedarburg Fox Farms, Inc. all began operating in Mequon and southern Cedarburg in the 1920s. In 1928, 6600 of the 8841 pelts sold by the New York Auction Co. came from the Fromm and Nieman operations in Wisconsin for a record-breaking sum of $1,021,000. In 1929, the Nieman and Fromm operations broke their own record with auction sales of $1,331,679, making them a leader in the national fur industry. By 1937, the farms were selling 30,000 pelts per year. After World War II, changing consumer tastes caused the farms to begin breeding [[mink]] in addition to silver fox. Fur sales declined later in the 20th century, and farms sold their last pelts in 1985.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Heggland|first1=Timothy F.|title=Nieman, Edwin J. Sr., House|url={{NRHP url|id=96000418}}|accessdate=2017-02-11|work=[[NRHP]] Inventory-Nomination Form|publisher=National Park Service|date=1995-01-05}}</ref>

The mid-to-late 20th century saw diversification in Mequon's economy. Retail stores opened to serve the increasingly suburban community, and manufacturers opened plants. In 1983, [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] moved from its campus in Milwaukee to a newly acquired campus in Mequon. In 1994, St. Mary's Hospital Ozaukee opened. As of 2015, the two institutions—both located in close proximity to [[Interstate 43]]—were among the largest employers in Ozaukee County. Despite the growth of new industries, half of Mequon's land remains undeveloped and agriculture continues to play a significant role in the local economy.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/>

(←Removed redirect toGreek–Turkish relations),unsafe,88.230.99.104,"{{Short description|1=Diplomatic relations between Greece and Turkey}}
{{Unreliable sources|date=January 2015}}
{{Infobox bilateral relations|Greece–Turkey|Greece|Turkey|map=Greece Turkey Locator.svg|mission1 = Embassy of Greece, Ankara|mission2 =  Embassy of Turkey, Athens}}

The relations between the [[Greece]] and the [[Turkey]] states have been marked by alternating periods of mutual hostility and reconciliation ever since Greece won its [[Greek War of Independence|independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|1832]]. Since then the two countries have faced each other in four major wars—the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]], the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912 to 1913, the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914 to 1918) and finally the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)]], which were followed by the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]] and a period of friendly relations in the 1930s and 1940s. Both countries entered [[NATO]] in 1952. Relations deteriorated again in the 1950s due to the [[Cyprus issue]], the [[1955 Istanbul pogrom]] and the expulsion of the Istanbul Greeks in the 1960s, the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, and subsequent military confrontations over the [[Aegean dispute]]. A period of relative normalization began after 1999 with the so-called \"[[Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy|earthquake diplomacy]]\", which notably led to a change in the previously firmly negative stance of the Greek government on the issue of the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]].

==Diplomatic missions==
*Turkey has an embassy in [[Athens]] and consulates general in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Komotini]] and [[Rhodes]].
*Greece has an embassy in [[Ankara]] and consulates general in [[Istanbul]], [[İzmir]] and [[Edirne]].

In 1453, Ottomans [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered Constantinople]], the capital city of the Byzantine Empire. In 1460 they conquered the [[Despotate of the Morea]], in 1461 the [[Empire of Trebizond]], in 1475 the [[Principality of Theodoro]] and by 1500 most of the plains and islands were in Ottoman hands. Holdouts included [[Rhodes]], conquered in 1522, [[Cyprus]] in 1571, [[Crete]], retained by the Venetians until 1669, and the [[Ionian islands]] which remained primarily under the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]].

===Ottoman era until 1820===

During the [[Ottoman–Venetian Wars]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–74)]] Greece provided aid to Ottoman rivals. [[Dionysius the Philosopher]] additionally organised several uprisings. In addition, the [[Lambros Katsonis]] fleet began harassing the Ottoman fleet in the Aegean Sea.

In 1770, the Ottoman army [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1770)|invaded the Mani]].

In the [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1803)|1803]], [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1807)|1807]] and [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1815)|1815]] the Ottoman army invaded Mani. Also during this period, in 1803 there was a [[Souliote War (1803)|final fight]] between the [[Souliotes]] and the [[Pashalik of Yanina|local Ottoman]] ruler, [[Ali Pasha of Yanina|Ali Pasha]], which ended the many years of conflicts between them.

===Ottoman era and the Greek state until 1913===

[[File:The Ottoman ambassador and his page at a ball at the royal residence in Athens, 1838.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first Ottoman ambassador to the Greek Kingdom, the [[Phanariote]] [[Konstantinos Mousouros]], at a ball in the royal palace in Athens]]

In March 1821, the [[Greek War of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] began. The Greeks formally declared their independence in January 1822, and after the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827, the establishment of a Greek state was recognized in the [[London Protocol (1828)|London Protocol]] of 1828. The first borders of the Greek state consisted of the Greek mainland south of a line from [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] to [[Volos]] plus [[Euboea]] and the [[Cyclades]] islands in the Aegean Sea. The rest of the Greek-speaking lands, including [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and the rest of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands, [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], remained under Ottoman rule. Over one million Greeks also lived in what is now [[Turkey]], mainly in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region of [[Asia Minor]], especially around [[Smyrna]], in the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] region on the [[Black Sea]] coast, in the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], in [[Cappadocia]], in [[Istanbul]], in [[Imbros]] and in [[Tenedos]].

Greek politicians of the 19th century were determined to include all these territories within a greatly enlarged single Greek state, based on the [[Byzantine]] model and with [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) as its capital. This policy was called the Great Idea (''[[Megali Idea]]''). Constantinople had been the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern half of the Roman Empire]] until its fall to the Turks in 1453. The Ottomans naturally opposed these plans for a larger Greek state. The Empire was considered by the European powers as 'the [[sick man of Europe]]', but since these powers were irreconcilably divided over the fate of the Ottoman lands, the conflicts both reduced its territorial hold but also kept delaying its collapse.

During the [[Crimean War]] (1854 to 1856), [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] restrained Greece from attacking the Ottomans by occupying [[Piraeus]]. They were again prevented from taking military action during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877, in which the Greeks were keen to join in with the objective of territorial expansion, but Greece was unable to take any effective part in the war. Nevertheless, after the [[Congress of Berlin]], in 1881 Greece was given most of [[Thessaly]] and part of Epirus. Also, in 1854-1896, there were revolts in the Ottoman Empire by the Greek population in Thessaly, Macedonia, [[Epirus Revolt of 1854|Epirus]].

In 1858-1896 there were many revolts in Crete, Thessaly [[1878 Greek Macedonian rebellion|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus Revolt of 1878|Epirus]] against the Ottoman Empire by the Greek population.

[[File:AsiaMinor1910.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Asia Minor depicting the [[Ottoman Greeks]] (blue) in 1910]]
In 1897, a new revolt in [[Crete]] led to the first [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]]. An unprepared Greek army was unable to dislodge the Ottoman troops from their fortifications along the northern border, and with the resulting Ottoman counter-attack, the war resulted in minor territorial losses for Greece.

The [[Young Turks]], who seized power in the Ottoman Empire in 1908, were Turkish nationalists whose objective was to create a strong, centrally governed state. The Christian minorities of the Empire, including Greeks, saw their position in the Empire deteriorate.

The [[First Balkan War]] of 1912–1913 was a direct consequence of the mounting tension, as a result of which Greece seized Crete, the islands, the rest of Thessaly and Epirus, and coastal Macedonia from the Ottomans, in alliance with [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Crete was once again the flashpoint for tension between the two nations.

===The First World War and after (1914-1927)===
{{Main|Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)}}

In 1913 an organized persecution of the Christian population of the Ottoman Empire, including the [[Greek genocide|Greeks]], was started. Greece entered the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1917 with the intention of seizing [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and [[Smyrna]] ([[İzmir]]) from the Ottomans, with the encouragement of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]], who also promised the Greeks [[Cyprus]] at a certain stage. The ongoing [[Greek genocide|genocide of Pontic Greeks]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} in the Ottoman Empire also played a factor in this decision{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Although there was little direct fighting between Greeks and Turks{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, when the Ottoman Empire collapsed in 1918 the Greeks were quick to claim the lands the Allies had promised them. The 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]] gave Greece eastern [[Thrace]] and an area of about 17,000&nbsp;km² in western [[Anatolia]] around Smyrna. This Treaty was signed by the Ottoman government but never went into force, not having been ratified by Parliament.

[[Occupation of Smyrna|Greece occupied Smyrna/İzmir]] on 15 May 1919, while [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] (later [[Atatürk]]), who was to become the leader of the Turkish opposition to the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], landed in [[Samsun]] on May 19, 1919, an action that is regarded as the beginning of the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. He united the protesting voices in Anatolia and set in motion a nationalist movement to repel the armies that had occupied Turkey (including Italy, France and Britain) and establish new borders for a sovereign Turkish nation. Having created a separate government in [[Ankara]], Kemal's government did not recognise the abortive Treaty of Sèvres and fought to have it revoked. The Greek advances into Anatolia were eventually checked and the Greek army was forced into retreat.


[[File:Asia Minor massacres.jpg|thumb|Overcrowded boats with refugees fleeing the [[Great fire of Smyrna]]. The photo was taken from the launch boat of a US warship.]]
The Turkish army entered Smyrna/İzmir on 9 September 1922, effectively ending the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] in the field. The Greek army and administration had already left by sea. The war was put to an end by the [[Armistice of Mudanya]], and the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] replaced previous treaties to constitute modern [[Turkey]].

The [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] also provided for a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] that had begun before the final signature of the treaty in July 1923. About one and a half million Greeks had to leave Turkey for Greece and about half a million Turks had to leave Greece for Turkey (note that the population exchange was on religious grounds, thus the exchange was officially that of [[Christians]] for [[Muslims]]). The exceptions to the population exchange were Istanbul (Constantinople) and the islands of [[Gökçeada]] ([[Imbros]]) and [[Bozcaada]] ([[Tenedos]]), where the Greek minority (including the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]) was allowed to stay, and [[Western Thrace]], whose Muslim minority was also allowed to stay.

Due to the defeat of the Greek army and the events following which terminated 3,000 years of Greek presence in Anatolia, Greece refers to it as the Asia Minor Catastrophe/Disaster. The alleged atrocities committed by the Greek army during the Greek occupation of Western Anatolia (1919–1922) left a lasting impression on the Turkish mind. Greek accusations, on the other hand, were focused on the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], especially in view of the account provided by [[George Horton]], the U.S. Consul General in the city from 1919 to 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/Horton/HortonBook.htm|title=THE BLIGHT OF ASIA|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> Horton's account remains as controversial as the fire itself.<ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/byz/2006/00000030/00000001/art00005] In an article published in [http://www.maney.co.uk/search?fwaction=show&fwid=466 Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110742/http://www.maney.co.uk/search?fwaction=show&fwid=466 |date=2007-09-29 }} (\"George Horton: The literary diplomat)\", [[Brian Coleman]] describes his subject matter as follows: \"George Horton was a man of letters and United States Consul in Greece and Turkey at a time of social and political change.

His account, however, goes beyond the blame and events to a demonization of Muslims, in general, and of Turks, in particular. In several of his novels, written more than two decades before the events of September 1922, he had already identified the Turk as the stock-in-trade [[villain]] of Western civilization. In his account of Smyrna, he writes not as a historian, but as a publicist.\"</ref><ref>[http://www.kapatel.gr/matrix/science/eemet/patakis.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218070032/http://www.kapatel.gr/matrix/science/eemet/patakis.htm |date=2005-12-18 }} Proclamation issued by the [[New York State]] Governor [[George E. Pataki]] on \"The Commemoration of the Burning of Smyrna and the Persecution of the Greeks of Asia Minor\" citing [[George Horton]].</ref>

The [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] awarded the islands of [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]] to Turkey, under special provisions for the Greeks living there. Tenedos population was overwhelmingly Greek, and Imbros population was entirely Greek. However, after the legislation of \"Civil Law\" on 26 June 1927, the rights accorded to the Greek population of Imbros and Tenedos were revoked, in violation of the Lausanne Treaty. Thus, the island was demoted from an administrative district to a sub-district which resulted that the island was to be stripped of its local tribunals. Moreover, the members of the local council were obliged to have adequate knowledge of the Turkish language, which meant that the vast majority of the islanders were excluded. Furthermore, according to this law, the Turkish government retained the right to dissolve this council and in certain circumstances, to introduce police force and other officials who were non-islanders. This law also violated the educational rights of the local community and imposed an educational system similar to that followed by ordinary Turkish schools.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexandris|first=Alexis|title=Imbros and Tenedos:: A Study of Turkish Attitudes Toward Two Ethnic Greek Island Communities Since 1923|year=1980|publisher=Pella Publishing Company|page=21|url=http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/13027/07_1_1980.pdf?sequence=1.}}</ref>

The post-war leaders of Turkey and Greece, [[Kemal Atatürk]] and [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] respectively, were determined to establish normal relations between the two states. After years of negotiations, a treaty was concluded in 1930, and Venizelos made a successful visit to Istanbul and Ankara. Greece renounced all its claims over Turkish territory. This was followed by the [[Balkan Pact]] of 1934, in which Greece and Turkey joined [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]] in a treaty of mutual assistance and settled outstanding issues (Bulgaria refused to join). Both leaders, recognising the need for peace resulted in more friendly relations, with Venizelos even nominating Atatürk for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1934.<ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Mangoe|title=Atatürk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey|publisher=John Murray|year=1999|page=487}}</ref>

In 1941, Turkey was the first country to send humanitarian aid to Greece to relieve the [[Great Famine (Greece)|great famine in Athens]] during the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]]. Turkish president [[İsmet İnönü]] signed a decision to help the people whose army he had personally fought during the [[Turkish War of Independence]] 19 years earlier. Foodstuffs were collected by a nationwide campaign of Kızılay ([[Turkish Red Crescent]])and sent to the port of İstanbul to be shipped to Greece. The aid was shipped on board the vessel ''[[SS Kurtuluş]]'' with big symbols of the [[Red Crescent]] painted on both sides. (''See [[SS Kurtuluş]] for more information.'')

At the same time, Turkey signed a \"[[German–Turkish Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Friendship and cooperation]]\" with Nazi Germany in June 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/assets1.html|title=New Supplement to the State Department Report on Holocaust Assets - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> The following year, 1942, Turkey imposed the [[Varlık Vergisi]], a special tax, which taxed the non-Muslim minorities of Turkey, including Greek minority. Also, during the WWII there was the incident of [[the Twenty Classes]], this was the conscription of non-Muslims males who were sent in labour battalions.

The early [[Cold War]] brought closer the international policies of the two countries, in 1950 both fought at the [[Korean War]] at the side of the [[UN]] forces. In 1952, both countries joined [[NATO]]. In 1953 Greece, Turkey and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] formed [[Balkan Pact (1953)|a new Balkan Pact]] for mutual defence against the [[Soviet Union]].

=== {{anchor|Istanbul_Pogrom}} Istanbul Pogrom, Cyprus crisis, Turkish invasion and the collapse of the Greek military junta (1955-1975)===
{{Further|Istanbul Pogrom|Cyprus dispute|Cypriot intercommunal violence|1974 Cypriot coup d'état|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}

A serious matter of conflict in Turkish-Greek relations since the 1950s has been [[Cyprus]]; at the time, it was a British colony with a Greek-Cypriot population share of 82% of the island's total. Some of the Greek Cypriots wanted unity (''enosis'') with Greece and, as early as 1931, there were nationalist riots in [[Nicosia]]. The Greek government was, due to its financial and diplomatic dependence on Britain, forced to disavow any aims for unification with Cyprus.

In the 1950s, the Cyprus issue flared up again when the Greek Cypriots, under [[Archbishop Makarios]], claimed union with Greece, and the [[EOKA]] group launched a paramilitary movement on the island - mainly against the British, but also inflicting collateral damage to other parties and civilians. Eventually, Greek Prime Minister [[Alexander Papagos]] took the Cyprus issue to the [[United Nations]].

Turkish nationalist sentiment, angered by the discrimination against the Turkish Cypriots, became inflamed at the idea that Cyprus would be ceded to Greece. This led to the Greek community of Istanbul becoming the target in the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] of 1955. In response, Greece withdrew from all co-operation with Turkey, which caused the Balkan Pact to collapse.

In 1960, a compromise solution to the Cyprus issue was agreed on: Britain granted independence to Cyprus, and a constitution was hammered out. Greek and Turkish troops were stationed on the island to protect their respective communities. Greek Prime Minister [[Constantine Karamanlis]] was the main architect of this plan, which led to an immediate improvement in relations with Turkey, particularly once [[Adnan Menderes]] was removed from power in Turkey.

During the period of [[Cyprus crisis of 1963–64|intercommunal strife in 1963 and 1964]], Greek and Turkish Cypriots were displaced and many were massacred on both sides.

On 30 December 1964, Makarios declared his proposal for a constitutional amendment that included 13 articles. Turkey, however, restated that she was against this and threatened war if Cyprus tried to achieve unity with Greece. In August, Turkish aircraft bombed Greek troops that surrounded a Turkish village (Erenkoy) and war seemed imminent. Once again, the Greek minority in Turkey suffered from the crisis, causing many Greeks to flee the country, and there were even threats to expel the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]. Eventually, intervention by the [[United Nations]] led to another compromise solution.

The Cyprus dispute weakened the Greek government of [[George Papandreou, senior|George Papandreou]] and triggered, in April 1967, a [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military coup]] in Greece. Under the diplomacy of the military regime, there were periodic crises with Turkey, which suspected that the Greek regime was planning a pro-unification coup in Cyprus.

[[File:Grenspost.jpg|thumb|[[Northern Cyprus]] in 2009]]
A 1971 Turkish law nationalized religious high schools and closed the [[Halki seminary]] on Istanbul's [[Heybeli]] Island which had trained [[Greek Orthodox]] clergy since 1844.

On July 15, 1974, a band of Greek Cypriot nationalists formed [[EOKA B]], advocating [[Enosis]] (Union) with Greece and, backed by the [[Greek military junta]] in Athens, staged a coup against the Cypriot President and [[Archbishop Makarios]]. An ex-[[EOKA]] man, [[Nikos Sampson]] was appointed President. On July 20, Turkey—using its guarantor status arising from the trilateral accords of the 1959–1960 [[Zürich and London Agreement]]—[[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded Cyprus]] without any resistance from the British forces based on the island, occupied 37% of the northern part and expelled the Greek population. Once again, war between Greece and Turkey seemed imminent, but actual war was averted when Sampson's coup collapsed a few days later and Makarios returned to power. Also, the [[Greek military junta]] in Athens, which failed to confront the Turkish invasion, fell from power on 24 July. The damage to Turkish-Greek relations was done, and the occupation of [[Northern Cyprus]] by Turkish troops would be a sticking point in Greco-Turkish relations for decades to come.

In 2018, declassified documents of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Bulgaria]] revealed a plan to foment crisis between [[Turkey]] and Greece in 1971. The operation codenamed \"Cross\" and the plan was that Bulgarian secret agents would set fire to the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] and make it look like the work of Turks. The declassified documents state that “An intervention” in the religious entity would have “significantly damage[d] Turkish-Greek relations and force[d] the United States to choose one side in the ensuing crisis,”. In addition, the Bulgarians also planned to boost the effectiveness of its operation against Greece and Turkey by conducting “active measures\" “for putting the enemy in a position of delusion.\" The plan was developed by the 7th Department of the First Main Directorate of the [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|DS]] (intelligence and secret police services of communist Bulgaria) and was affirmed by Deputy Head of the Directorate on November 16, 1970, and approved by its Head. The operation was supposed to be prepared by the middle of 1971 and then executed, but it was abandoned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2018/02/28/communist-bulgarias-intelligence-plotted-greece-turkey-conflict-setting-fire-ecumenical-patriarchate-constantinople-secret-files-reveal/|title=Communist Bulgaria’s Intelligence Plotted Greece – Turkey Conflict by Setting on Fire Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Secret Files Reveal|first1=Ivan Dikov · in Modern|last1=Era|first2=Other|last2=History|date=February 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2018/02/22/report-communist-era-bulgaria-plotted-to-burn-greek-patriarchate|title=Report: Communist-era Bulgaria plotted to burn Greek patriarchate|website=DailySabah}}</ref>

==Aegean Sea==
[[File:Andreas Papandreou and Turgut Özal 1986.jpg|thumb|Greek Prime Minister [[Andreas Papandreou]] meeting with Turkish Prime Minister [[Turgut Özal]] in Davos, February 1986]]
{{Main|Aegean dispute}}
Since the 1970s further issues arose between the two countries over sovereignty rights in the [[Aegean Sea]]. The [[Balkan Wars]] of 1913 had given Greece all the Aegean islands except [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]], some of them only a few kilometres (barely more than three nautical miles) off the Turkish coast. Since the end of [[World War II]], Turkish officials insisted that this led to questions regarding the [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of territorial waters, air space and other related zones of control. The conflict was motivated both by considerations of military tactical advantages and by questions of economic exploitation of the Aegean. The latter issue became particularly significant as after 1970 there were expectations of finding oil in the Aegean. This was highlighted during the [[1987 Aegean crisis|crisis]] in 1987, when a Turkish ship was about to enter disputed waters to conduct an oil survey. The Greek Prime Minister of the time, [[Andreas Papandreou]], ordered the ship to be sunk if found within disputed waters claimed by Greece. Consultations about this issue were held in [[Davos]] between the Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers.

Issues unresolved to this day concern the mutual delimitation of several zones of control:
*The width of the [[territorial waters]]. Both sides currently possess 6 nautical miles (11&nbsp;km) off their shores in the Aegean Sea. Greece claims a right to unilateral expansion to 12 nautical miles, based on the International [[Law of the Sea]]. Turkey, which already has expanded its own territorial waters to 12 miles on its other coasts, denies the applicability of the 12-miles rule in the Aegean and has threatened Greece with war in the case it should try to apply it unilaterally.
*The width of the national airspace. Greece currently claims 10 miles, while Turkey only acknowledges 6 miles.
*The future delimitation of the [[continental shelf]] zone in the international parts of the Aegean, which would give the states exclusive rights to economic exploitation.
*The right of Greece to exercise flight control over Turkish military flight activities within the international parts of the Aegean, based on conflicting interpretations of the rules about [[Flight Information Region]]s (FIR) set by the [[ICAO]].
*Since 1996, the sovereignty over some small uninhabited islets, most notably [[Imia/Kardak]]

The conflict over military flight activities has led to a practice of continuous tactical military provocations. Turkish aircraft regularly fly in the zones over which Greece claims control (i.e., the outer four miles of the claimed Greek airspace and the international parts of Athens FIR), while Greek aircraft constantly intercept them. Aircraft from both countries frequently engage in mock dogfights. These operations often cause casualties and losses for both the Greek and Turkish Air Forces.

* On 22 July 1974, during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], a pair of Greek [[Northrop F-5|F-5Α]]s intercepted a pair of Turkish [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]] near [[Agios Efstratios]]. The aircraft engaged in a dogfight, during which one of the Turkish pilots fired a [[AIM-4 Falcon|Falcon]] missile against one of the F-5s piloted by Thomas Skampardonis. Skampardonis managed to evade the missile and then the other Greek pilot Ioannis Dinopoulos, who up to that point was undetected by the Turks, fired two [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9B]] missiles. The first AIM-9 missed its target but the second shot down one of the F-102s. The pilot of the remaining F-102 became disoriented and fled westwards. When he realized his mistake, he turned east towards the Turkish coast but ran out of fuel. This forced him to ditch his aircraft and crash, suffering fatal injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.info/CMS/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=107 |title=The Shooting Down of the Turkish F-102s |publisher=acig.info |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6lncnxMFT?url=https://electrical-greece.blogspot.gr/2016/05/the-shooting-down-of-turkish-f-102s-1974.html |archive-date=5 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

* On 16 February 2016, Turkey prevented the Greek PM's aircraft carrying a Greek PM and Greece's delegation from landing on the island of [[Rhodes]] for refueling during their trip to [[Iran]], arguing that the island is a demilitarized zone. Turkey also refused to accept the flight plan submitted by the Greeks, mentioned that the plane will not be allowed to enter Turkish airspace.

==Evros River incident==

In 1986, Turkish and Greek soldiers suffered casualties at the [[Evros River incident]], due to fire exchange. Turkish and Greek soldiers have exchanged fire in the past, as Greeks have tried to stop Iranian refugees from entering the country illegally from Turkey, but this incident was the first in which there have been casualties. During this period, Greek soldiers along the border with Turkey were on alert after receiving reports that Turkey planned to help thousands of refugees slip into Greece illegally.<ref>United Press International - Greeks, Turks exchange fire, no casualties</ref><ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-12-20-mn-4429-story.html Three Killed in Greece-Turkey Border Clas]</ref> After the incident, top military and civilian authorities from both countries met to discuss a border protocol aimed at preventing future confrontations.<ref>The Associated Press - Three Killed in Border Clash</ref>

==Sismik incident==

In 1987, the [[Sismik incident]] nearly started a war between Greece and Turkey.

==Cyprus Missile Crisis==

During the [[Cyprus Missile Crisis]], between early 1997 and late 1998, tensions continued between Greece and Turkey, due to Greece's support of the Cypriot position.

==Capture of Öcalan and the resignation of Greek ministers==
In 1999, [[Abdullah Öcalan]], the leader of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]], was captured by the [[Milli İstihbarat Teşkilatı|Turkish Intelligence Service]] agents in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], while leaving the Greek Embassy. Öcalan was carrying both [[Greek passport|Greek]] and [[Cyprus passport|Cypriot passport]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6a/Cypruspassportofocalan.jpg|title=Greek Cypriot passport of Abdullah Öcalan|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> Fearing a hostile Turkish reaction, three Greek ministers resigned: Foreign Minister [[Theodoros Pangalos (politician)|Theodoros Pangalos]], in charge of the attempt to hide Öcalan at the Greek Ambassador's residence in Kenya and to find him asylum; Interior Minister [[Alekos Papadopoulos]], in charge of the Greek Intelligence Service involved in the operation; and Public Order Minister [[Philippos Petsalnikos]], in charge of the Greek security forces which failed to stop the smuggling of Öcalan into Greece in January 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/281816.stm|title=BBC News - Europe - Greek ministers resign over Ocalan|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref>

==Earthquake diplomacy==

{{Main|Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy}}
Relations between Greece and neighbouring Turkey improved after successive earthquakes hit both countries in the summer of 1999. The so-called \"earthquake diplomacy\" generated an outpouring of sympathy and generous assistance provided by ordinary Greeks and Turks in both cases. These acts were encouraged from the top and took many foreigners by surprise, preparing the public for a breakthrough in bilateral relations, which had been marred by decades of hostility over anti-Greek [[pogrom]]s, territorial disputes and the situation in the divided island of Cyprus.

Ten years later, Greece has become one of the key supporters of Turkey's struggle to enter the [[European Union]]. Yet, despite the confidence Greece and Cyprus have shown, voting YES for Turkey in order to begin its entry negotiations with the European Union in October 2005, many key issues remain unresolved. Furthermore, Turkey still denies access to Cypriot vessels to its territory, an obligation towards the EU with a 2006 deadline. The Turkish government counters that this restriction regarding Cypriot vessels was taken after the trade embargo decision against the portion of Cyprus illegally occupied by Turkey. The issue remains deadlocked, despite UN and EU attempts to mediate. Other unfulfilled obligations include Christian minority rights, acknowledgement of the [[Orthodox Church]] of Constantinople and the role of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]].

In 2002, Turkey and Greece made an unsuccessful attempt to jointly host the 2008 UEFA European Football Championship. The bid was one of the four candidacies that was recommended to the UEFA Executive Committee, the joint Austria/Switzerland bid winning the right to host the tournament.

A sign of improved relations was visible in the response to a mid-air collision by Greek and Turkish fighter jets in the southern Aegean in May 2006. While the Turkish pilot ejected safely, the Greek pilot lost his life. However, both countries agreed that the event should not affect their bilateral relations<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5008178.stm BBC News Online] May 23, 2006</ref> and made a strong effort to maintain them by agreeing to a set of confidence-building measures in the aftermath of the accident.

==Forest arson==
In December 2011, the Turkish newspaper ''Birgun'' reported on an interview with former Turkish prime minister [[Mesut Yilmaz]] saying that Turkey was behind a number of large [[forest fires]] in Greece in the 1990s. Yilmaz later denied the statements, saying he had been misquoted by the newspaper and that he had been actually referring to unsubstantiated reports of Greek involvement in Turkish forest fires.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Turkish PM's arson admission fuels anger|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/137956/article/ekathimerini/news/former-turkish-pms-arson-admission-fuels-anger|date=December 28, 2011|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Outrage As Former Turkish Prime Minister Says The Country Secretly Started Huge Forest Fires In Greece|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/turkey-greece-yilmaz-2011-12|date=December 28, 2011|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}</ref>
However, despite Yilmaz's denial, the allegations strained the relations between the two countries. Also, former head of Greek intelligence service said they had intelligence that Turkish agencies were involved in the arsons in the 1990s but had no proof. He said they had received information from their agents in Turkey that Turkish agents or others were involved in the forest fires on Greek islands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Turk-Greek ties strained by arson row|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turk-greek-ties-strained-by-arson-row.aspx?pageID=238&nID=10324&NewsCatID=338|date=December 30, 2011|publisher=[[Hurriyet Daily News]]}}</ref>

Ιn August 2017, a Turkish citizen was arrested after trying to set a fire near a Greek highway in [[Xanthi]]. He had applied for political asylum in Greece.<ref>{{cite web|title=Συνέλαβαν Τούρκο την ώρα που έβαζε φωτιά δίπλα στην Εγνατία οδό|url=http://www.xanthipress.gr/sinelavan-tourko-tin-ora-pou-evaze-fotia-dipla-stin-egnatia-odo/|date=August 17, 2017|publisher=xanthipress}}</ref>

==Illegal immigration==
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}
Turkey is a transit point for [[illegal immigrants]] trying to reach Europe (as well as being a destination itself; see [[Immigration to Turkey]] for details). As a result of bilateral negotiations, a readmission agreement was signed between Turkey and Greece in November 2001 and went into effect in April 2002. For third-country nationals, this protocol gives the parties 14 days to inform each other of the number of persons to be returned after the date of [[illegal entry]]. For nationals of the two countries the authorities can make use of simplified procedures. But the strict application of the agreement is reported to have retrograded as of 2003. Incidents concerning illegal immigration are frequent on the border of the two countries. Turkey, which is a transit point for illegal immigrants trying to reach Europe, has been accused of not being able to secure its borders with Greece. Since 1996 40 illegal immigrants have been killed by mines, after entering Greek territory in [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3149744.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Landmine deaths on Greek border|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> In 2001, about 800 illegal immigrants were rescued by the Greek coast guard after a fire broke out on board the Turkish-flagged Brelner, believed to have set sail from the Turkish port of İzmir, probably en route to Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1639933.stm|title=BBC News - EUROPE - Greece rescues immigrant ship|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> According to Greek sources the Turkish authorities are tolerant of smugglers trafficking illegal immigrants into Greece; a notable such incident is the one of a trafficking boat, filmed in September 14, 2009 by the [[Latvia]]n helicopter crew of [[Frontex]] patrolling near [[Farmakonisi]] island, during which \"it is clear that the Turkish coastguard, at best, does not prevent the \"slavetrade\" vessels to sail from its shores.

In June 2018, Turkey suspended its bilateral migrant readmission deal with Greece in response to the decision by the Greeks to release the [[July 2016 Turkish military asylum incident in Greece|eight Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece after the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-suspends-refugee-readmission-deal-with-greece-132955|title=Turkey suspends ‘migrant readmission’ deal with Greece - Turkey News|website=Hürriyet Daily News}}</ref>

==Cyber attacks==

In early 2020, western security officials reported a pattern of [[cyber attacks]] against governments and other organizations in Greece and other European and Middle Eastern countries in late 2018 and early 2019, which they described as resembling a \"state-backed cyber espionage operation conducted to advance Turkish interests\". Turkey’s officials declined to comment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-hijack-exclusive/exclusive-hackers-acting-in-turkeys-interests-believed-to-be-behind-recent-cyberattacks-sources-idUSKBN1ZQ10X|title=Exclusive: Hackers acting in Turkey's interests believed to be behind recent cyberattacks - sources|date=27 January 2020|website=www.reuters.com|publisher=reuters|accessdate=27 January 2020}}</ref>

Official relations between Greece and Turkey had improved, mainly due to the Greek government's supportive attitude towards Turkey's efforts to join the [[European Union|EU]], although various issues have never been fully resolved and remain constant sources of conflict. An attempt at rapprochement, dubbed the [[Davos process]], was made in 1988. The retirement of Greek Prime Minister [[Andreas Papandreou]] contributed to this improvement. His son, a foreign minister [[George Andreas Papandreou|George Papandreou]], made considerable progress in improving relations. He found a willing partner in [[Ismail Cem]] and later in the Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].

What will now happen with the continental shelf? What will happen with the airspace and land? We’re still fighting for all of these\". This caused displeasure in Athens. A Greek Foreign Ministry source remarked that “everyone should respect the Treaty of Lausanne,” noting that it is “a reality in the civilized world which no one, including Ankara, can ignore.”, added that the Turkish leader's comments were likely geared for domestic consumption.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1153625/erdogan-turkey-gave-away-aegean-islands-in-1923|title=Erdogan: Turkey gave away Aegean islands in 1923|publisher=naftemporiki}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/212433/article/ekathimerini/news/erdogan-disputes-treaty-of-lausanne-prompting-response-from-athens|title=Erdogan disputes Treaty of Lausanne, prompting response from Athens|publisher=ekathimerini}}</ref><ref name=\"baser view\"/>

Greek Foreign Ministry said, on October 17, that \"Thrace is Greek, democratic and European.

The relations between the [[Greece|Greek]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish]] states have been marked by alternating periods of mutual hostility and reconciliation ever since Greece won its [[Greek War of Independence|independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|1832]]. Since then the two countries have faced each other in four major wars—the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]], the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912 to 1913, the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914 to 1918) and finally the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)]], which were followed by the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]] and a period of friendly relations in the 1930s and 1940s. Both countries entered [[NATO]] in 1952. Relations deteriorated again in the 1950s due to the [[Cyprus issue]], the [[1955 Istanbul pogrom]] and the expulsion of the Istanbul Greeks in the 1960s, the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, and subsequent military confrontations over the [[Aegean dispute]]. A period of relative normalization began after 1999 with the so-called \"[[Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy|earthquake diplomacy]]\", which notably led to a change in the previously firmly negative stance of the Greek government on the issue of the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]].

==History==

===Byzantine against Seljuq and Ottoman===
{{Main|Byzantine–Ottoman Wars|Byzantine–Seljuq wars}}
[[File:Byzantium vs Seljuk c 1071 cropped.png|thumb|[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine territory]] (purple), Byzantine campaigns (red) and [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] campaigns (green).]]
In 1048 conflicts between [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] (Greeks were dominant nation of the Byzantine Empire and the Empire was Hellenized) started. Many [[Byzantine–Seljuq wars|wars and battles]] were fought between the Byzantine and the Seljuq armies. Also, in 1300 conflicts between [[Ottomans]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] started too.

In 1453, Ottomans [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered Constantinople]], the capital city of the Byzantine Empire. In 1460 they conquered the [[Despotate of the Morea]], in 1461 the [[Empire of Trebizond]], in 1475 the [[Principality of Theodoro]] and by 1500 most of the plains and islands were in Ottoman hands. Holdouts included [[Rhodes]], conquered in 1522, [[Cyprus]] in 1571, [[Crete]], retained by the Venetians until 1669, and the [[Ionian islands]] which remained primarily under the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]].

===Ottoman era until 1820===

During the [[Ottoman–Venetian Wars]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–74)]] Greece provided aid to Ottoman rivals. [[Dionysius the Philosopher]] additionally organised several uprisings. In addition, the [[Lambros Katsonis]] fleet began harassing the Ottoman fleet in the Aegean Sea.

In 1770, the Ottoman army [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1770)|invaded the Mani]].

In the [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1803)|1803]], [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1807)|1807]] and [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1815)|1815]] the Ottoman army invaded Mani. Also during this period, in 1803 there was a [[Souliote War (1803)|final fight]] between the [[Souliotes]] and the [[Pashalik of Yanina|local Ottoman]] ruler, [[Ali Pasha of Yanina|Ali Pasha]], which ended the many years of conflicts between them.

===Ottoman era and the Greek state until 1913===

In March 1821, the [[Greek War of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] began. The Greeks formally declared their independence in January 1822, and after the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827, the establishment of a Greek state was recognized in the [[London Protocol (1828)|London Protocol]] of 1828. The first borders of the Greek state consisted of the Greek mainland south of a line from [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] to [[Volos]] plus [[Euboea]] and the [[Cyclades]] islands in the Aegean Sea. The rest of the Greek-speaking lands, including [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and the rest of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands, [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], remained under Ottoman rule. Over one million Greeks also lived in what is now [[Turkey]], mainly in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region of [[Asia Minor]], especially around [[Smyrna]], in the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] region on the [[Black Sea]] coast, in the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], in [[Cappadocia]], in [[Istanbul]], in [[Imbros]] and in [[Tenedos]].

Greek politicians of the 19th century were determined to include all these territories within a greatly enlarged single Greek state, based on the [[Byzantine]] model and with [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) as its capital. This policy was called the Great Idea (''[[Megali Idea]]''). Constantinople had been the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern half of the Roman Empire]] until its fall to the Turks in 1453. The Ottomans naturally opposed these plans for a larger Greek state. The Empire was considered by the European powers as 'the [[sick man of Europe]]', but since these powers were irreconcilably divided over the fate of the Ottoman lands, the conflicts both reduced its territorial hold but also kept delaying its collapse.

During the [[Crimean War]] (1854 to 1856), [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] restrained Greece from attacking the Ottomans by occupying [[Piraeus]]. They were again prevented from taking military action during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877, in which the Greeks were keen to join in with the objective of territorial expansion, but Greece was unable to take any effective part in the war. Nevertheless, after the [[Congress of Berlin]], in 1881 Greece was given most of [[Thessaly]] and part of Epirus. Also, in 1854-1896, there were revolts in the Ottoman Empire by the Greek population in Thessaly, Macedonia, [[Epirus Revolt of 1854|Epirus]].

In 1858-1896 there were many revolts in Crete, Thessaly [[1878 Greek Macedonian rebellion|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus Revolt of 1878|Epirus]] against the Ottoman Empire by the Greek population.

[[File:AsiaMinor1910.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Asia Minor depicting the [[Ottoman Greeks]] (blue) in 1910]]
In 1897, a new revolt in [[Crete]] led to the first [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]]. An unprepared Greek army was unable to dislodge the Ottoman troops from their fortifications along the northern border, and with the resulting Ottoman counter-attack, the war resulted in minor territorial losses for Greece.

The [[Young Turks]], who seized power in the Ottoman Empire in 1908, were Turkish nationalists whose objective was to create a strong, centrally governed state. The Christian minorities of the Empire, including Greeks, saw their position in the Empire deteriorate.

The [[First Balkan War]] of 1912–1913 was a direct consequence of the mounting tension, as a result of which Greece seized Crete, the islands, the rest of Thessaly and Epirus, and coastal Macedonia from the Ottomans, in alliance with [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Crete was once again the flashpoint for tension between the two nations.

===The First World War and after (1914-1927)===
{{Main|Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)}}

In 1913 an organized persecution of the Christian population of the Ottoman Empire, including the [[Greek genocide|Greeks]], was started. Greece entered the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1917 with the intention of seizing [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and [[Smyrna]] ([[İzmir]]) from the Ottomans, with the encouragement of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]], who also promised the Greeks [[Cyprus]] at a certain stage. The ongoing [[Greek genocide|genocide of Pontic Greeks]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} in the Ottoman Empire also played a factor in this decision{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Although there was little direct fighting between Greeks and Turks{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, when the Ottoman Empire collapsed in 1918 the Greeks were quick to claim the lands the Allies had promised them. The 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]] gave Greece eastern [[Thrace]] and an area of about 17,000&nbsp;km² in western [[Anatolia]] around Smyrna. This Treaty was signed by the Ottoman government but never went into force, not having been ratified by Parliament.

[[Occupation of Smyrna|Greece occupied Smyrna/İzmir]] on 15 May 1919, while [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] (later [[Atatürk]]), who was to become the leader of the Turkish opposition to the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], landed in [[Samsun]] on May 19, 1919, an action that is regarded as the beginning of the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. He united the protesting voices in Anatolia and set in motion a nationalist movement to repel the armies that had occupied Turkey (including Italy, France and Britain) and establish new borders for a sovereign Turkish nation. Having created a separate government in [[Ankara]], Kemal's government did not recognise the abortive Treaty of Sèvres and fought to have it revoked. The Greek advances into Anatolia were eventually checked and the Greek army was forced into retreat.


[[File:Asia Minor massacres.jpg|thumb|Overcrowded boats with refugees fleeing the [[Great fire of Smyrna]]. The photo was taken from the launch boat of a US warship.]]
The Turkish army entered Smyrna/İzmir on 9 September 1922, effectively ending the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] in the field. The Greek army and administration had already left by sea. The war was put to an end by the [[Armistice of Mudanya]], and the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] replaced previous treaties to constitute modern [[Turkey]].

The [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] also provided for a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] that had begun before the final signature of the treaty in July 1923. About one and a half million Greeks had to leave Turkey for Greece and about half a million Turks had to leave Greece for Turkey (note that the population exchange was on religious grounds, thus the exchange was officially that of [[Christians]] for [[Muslims]]). The exceptions to the population exchange were Istanbul (Constantinople) and the islands of [[Gökçeada]] ([[Imbros]]) and [[Bozcaada]] ([[Tenedos]]), where the Greek minority (including the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]) was allowed to stay, and [[Western Thrace]], whose Muslim minority was also allowed to stay.

Due to the defeat of the Greek army and the events following which terminated 3,000 years of Greek presence in Anatolia, Greece refers to it as the Asia Minor Catastrophe/Disaster. The alleged atrocities committed by the Greek army during the Greek occupation of Western Anatolia (1919–1922) left a lasting impression on the Turkish mind. Greek accusations, on the other hand, were focused on the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], especially in view of the account provided by [[George Horton]], the U.S. Consul General in the city from 1919 to 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/Horton/HortonBook.htm|title=THE BLIGHT OF ASIA|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> Horton's account remains as controversial as the fire itself.<ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/byz/2006/00000030/00000001/art00005] In an article published in [http://www.maney.co.uk/search?fwaction=show&fwid=466 Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110742/http://www.maney.co.uk/search?fwaction=show&fwid=466 |date=2007-09-29 }} (\"George Horton: The literary diplomat)\", [[Brian Coleman]] describes his subject matter as follows: \"George Horton was a man of letters and United States Consul in Greece and Turkey at a time of social and political change.

His account, however, goes beyond the blame and events to a demonization of Muslims, in general, and of Turks, in particular. In several of his novels, written more than two decades before the events of September 1922, he had already identified the Turk as the stock-in-trade [[villain]] of Western civilization. In his account of Smyrna, he writes not as a historian, but as a publicist.\"</ref><ref>[http://www.kapatel.gr/matrix/science/eemet/patakis.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218070032/http://www.kapatel.gr/matrix/science/eemet/patakis.htm |date=2005-12-18 }} Proclamation issued by the [[New York State]] Governor [[George E.

The [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] awarded the islands of [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]] to Turkey, under special provisions for the Greeks living there. Tenedos population was overwhelmingly Greek, and Imbros population was entirely Greek. However, after the legislation of \"Civil Law\" on 26 June 1927, the rights accorded to the Greek population of Imbros and Tenedos were revoked, in violation of the Lausanne Treaty. Thus, the island was demoted from an administrative district to a sub-district which resulted that the island was to be stripped of its local tribunals. Moreover, the members of the local council were obliged to have adequate knowledge of the Turkish language, which meant that the vast majority of the islanders were excluded. Furthermore, according to this law, the Turkish government retained the right to dissolve this council and in certain circumstances, to introduce police force and other officials who were non-islanders. This law also violated the educational rights of the local community and imposed an educational system similar to that followed by ordinary Turkish schools.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexandris|first=Alexis|title=Imbros and Tenedos:: A Study of Turkish Attitudes Toward Two Ethnic Greek Island Communities Since 1923|year=1980|publisher=Pella Publishing Company|page=21|url=http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/13027/07_1_1980.pdf?sequence=1.}}</ref>

The post-war leaders of Turkey and Greece, [[Kemal Atatürk]] and [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] respectively, were determined to establish normal relations between the two states. After years of negotiations, a treaty was concluded in 1930, and Venizelos made a successful visit to Istanbul and Ankara. Greece renounced all its claims over Turkish territory. This was followed by the [[Balkan Pact]] of 1934, in which Greece and Turkey joined [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]] in a treaty of mutual assistance and settled outstanding issues (Bulgaria refused to join). Both leaders, recognising the need for peace resulted in more friendly relations, with Venizelos even nominating Atatürk for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1934.<ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Mangoe|title=Atatürk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey|publisher=John Murray|year=1999|page=487}}</ref>

In 1941, Turkey was the first country to send humanitarian aid to Greece to relieve the [[Great Famine (Greece)|great famine in Athens]] during the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]]. Turkish president [[İsmet İnönü]] signed a decision to help the people whose army he had personally fought during the [[Turkish War of Independence]] 19 years earlier. Foodstuffs were collected by a nationwide campaign of Kızılay ([[Turkish Red Crescent]])and sent to the port of İstanbul to be shipped to Greece. The aid was shipped on board the vessel ''[[SS Kurtuluş]]'' with big symbols of the [[Red Crescent]] painted on both sides. (''See [[SS Kurtuluş]] for more information.'')

At the same time, Turkey signed a \"[[German–Turkish Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Friendship and cooperation]]\" with Nazi Germany in June 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/assets1.html|title=New Supplement to the State Department Report on Holocaust Assets - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> The following year, 1942, Turkey imposed the [[Varlık Vergisi]], a special tax, which taxed the non-Muslim minorities of Turkey, including Greek minority. Also, during the WWII there was the incident of [[the Twenty Classes]], this was the conscription of non-Muslims males who were sent in labour battalions.

The early [[Cold War]] brought closer the international policies of the two countries, in 1950 both fought at the [[Korean War]] at the side of the [[UN]] forces. In 1952, both countries joined [[NATO]]. In 1953 Greece, Turkey and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] formed [[Balkan Pact (1953)|a new Balkan Pact]] for mutual defence against the [[Soviet Union]].

=== {{anchor|Istanbul_Pogrom}} Istanbul Pogrom, Cyprus crisis, Turkish invasion and the collapse of the Greek military junta (1955-1975)===
{{Further|Istanbul Pogrom|Cyprus dispute|Cypriot intercommunal violence|1974 Cypriot coup d'état|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}

A serious matter of conflict in Turkish-Greek relations since the 1950s has been [[Cyprus]]; at the time, it was a British colony with a Greek-Cypriot population share of 82% of the island's total. Some of the Greek Cypriots wanted unity (''enosis'') with Greece and, as early as 1931, there were nationalist riots in [[Nicosia]]. The Greek government was, due to its financial and diplomatic dependence on Britain, forced to disavow any aims for unification with Cyprus.

In the 1950s, the Cyprus issue flared up again when the Greek Cypriots, under [[Archbishop Makarios]], claimed union with Greece, and the [[EOKA]] group launched a paramilitary movement on the island - mainly against the British, but also inflicting collateral damage to other parties and civilians. Eventually, Greek Prime Minister [[Alexander Papagos]] took the Cyprus issue to the [[United Nations]].

Turkish nationalist sentiment, angered by the discrimination against the Turkish Cypriots, became inflamed at the idea that Cyprus would be ceded to Greece. This led to the Greek community of Istanbul becoming the target in the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] of 1955. In response, Greece withdrew from all co-operation with Turkey, which caused the Balkan Pact to collapse.

In 1960, a compromise solution to the Cyprus issue was agreed on: Britain granted independence to Cyprus, and a constitution was hammered out. Greek and Turkish troops were stationed on the island to protect their respective communities. Greek Prime Minister [[Constantine Karamanlis]] was the main architect of this plan, which led to an immediate improvement in relations with Turkey, particularly once [[Adnan Menderes]] was removed from power in Turkey.

During the period of [[Cyprus crisis of 1963–64|intercommunal strife in 1963 and 1964]], Greek and Turkish Cypriots were displaced and many were massacred on both sides.

On 30 December 1964, Makarios declared his proposal for a constitutional amendment that included 13 articles. Turkey, however, restated that she was against this and threatened war if Cyprus tried to achieve unity with Greece. In August, Turkish aircraft bombed Greek troops that surrounded a Turkish village (Erenkoy) and war seemed imminent. Once again, the Greek minority in Turkey suffered from the crisis, causing many Greeks to flee the country, and there were even threats to expel the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]. Eventually, intervention by the [[United Nations]] led to another compromise solution.

The Cyprus dispute weakened the Greek government of [[George Papandreou, senior|George Papandreou]] and triggered, in April 1967, a [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military coup]] in Greece. Under the diplomacy of the military regime, there were periodic crises with Turkey, which suspected that the Greek regime was planning a pro-unification coup in Cyprus.

[[File:Grenspost.jpg|thumb|[[Northern Cyprus]] in 2009]]
A 1971 Turkish law nationalized religious high schools and closed the [[Halki seminary]] on Istanbul's [[Heybeli]] Island which had trained [[Greek Orthodox]] clergy since 1844.

On July 15, 1974, a band of Greek Cypriot nationalists formed [[EOKA B]], advocating [[Enosis]] (Union) with Greece and, backed by the [[Greek military junta]] in Athens, staged a coup against the Cypriot President and [[Archbishop Makarios]]. An ex-[[EOKA]] man, [[Nikos Sampson]] was appointed President. On July 20, Turkey—using its guarantor status arising from the trilateral accords of the 1959–1960 [[Zürich and London Agreement]]—[[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded Cyprus]] without any resistance from the British forces based on the island, occupied 37% of the northern part and expelled the Greek population. Once again, war between Greece and Turkey seemed imminent, but actual war was averted when Sampson's coup collapsed a few days later and Makarios returned to power. Also, the [[Greek military junta]] in Athens, which failed to confront the Turkish invasion, fell from power on 24 July. The damage to Turkish-Greek relations was done, and the occupation of [[Northern Cyprus]] by Turkish troops would be a sticking point in Greco-Turkish relations for decades to come.

In 2018, declassified documents of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Bulgaria]] revealed a plan to foment crisis between [[Turkey]] and Greece in 1971. The operation codenamed \"Cross\" and the plan was that Bulgarian secret agents would set fire to the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] and make it look like the work of Turks. The declassified documents state that “An intervention” in the religious entity would have “significantly damage[d] Turkish-Greek relations and force[d] the United States to choose one side in the ensuing crisis,”. In addition, the Bulgarians also planned to boost the effectiveness of its operation against Greece and Turkey by conducting “active measures\" “for putting the enemy in a position of delusion.\" The plan was developed by the 7th Department of the First Main Directorate of the [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|DS]] (intelligence and secret police services of communist Bulgaria) and was affirmed by Deputy Head of the Directorate on November 16, 1970, and approved by its Head. The operation was supposed to be prepared by the middle of 1971 and then executed, but it was abandoned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2018/02/28/communist-bulgarias-intelligence-plotted-greece-turkey-conflict-setting-fire-ecumenical-patriarchate-constantinople-secret-files-reveal/|title=Communist Bulgaria’s Intelligence Plotted Greece – Turkey Conflict by Setting on Fire Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Secret Files Reveal|first1=Ivan Dikov · in Modern|last1=Era|first2=Other|last2=History|date=February 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2018/02/22/report-communist-era-bulgaria-plotted-to-burn-greek-patriarchate|title=Report: Communist-era Bulgaria plotted to burn Greek patriarchate|website=DailySabah}}</ref>

==Aegean Sea==
[[File:Andreas Papandreou and Turgut Özal 1986.jpg|thumb|Greek Prime Minister [[Andreas Papandreou]] meeting with Turkish Prime Minister [[Turgut Özal]] in Davos, February 1986]]
{{Main|Aegean dispute}}
Since the 1970s further issues arose between the two countries over sovereignty rights in the [[Aegean Sea]]. The [[Balkan Wars]] of 1913 had given Greece all the Aegean islands except [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]], some of them only a few kilometres (barely more than three nautical miles) off the Turkish coast. Since the end of [[World War II]], Turkish officials insisted that this led to questions regarding the [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of territorial waters, air space and other related zones of control. The conflict was motivated both by considerations of military tactical advantages and by questions of economic exploitation of the Aegean. The latter issue became particularly significant as after 1970 there were expectations of finding oil in the Aegean. This was highlighted during the [[1987 Aegean crisis|crisis]] in 1987, when a Turkish ship was about to enter disputed waters to conduct an oil survey. The Greek Prime Minister of the time, [[Andreas Papandreou]], ordered the ship to be sunk if found within disputed waters claimed by Greece. Consultations about this issue were held in [[Davos]] between the Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers.

Issues unresolved to this day concern the mutual delimitation of several zones of control:
*The width of the [[territorial waters]]. Both sides currently possess 6 nautical miles (11&nbsp;km) off their shores in the Aegean Sea. Greece claims a right to unilateral expansion to 12 nautical miles, based on the International [[Law of the Sea]]. Turkey, which already has expanded its own territorial waters to 12 miles on its other coasts, denies the applicability of the 12-miles rule in the Aegean and has threatened Greece with war in the case it should try to apply it unilaterally.
*The width of the national airspace. Greece currently claims 10 miles, while Turkey only acknowledges 6 miles.
*The future delimitation of the [[continental shelf]] zone in the international parts of the Aegean, which would give the states exclusive rights to economic exploitation.
*The right of Greece to exercise flight control over Turkish military flight activities within the international parts of the Aegean, based on conflicting interpretations of the rules about [[Flight Information Region]]s (FIR) set by the [[ICAO]].
*Since 1996, the sovereignty over some small uninhabited islets, most notably [[Imia/Kardak]]

The conflict over military flight activities has led to a practice of continuous tactical military provocations. Turkish aircraft regularly fly in the zones over which Greece claims control (i.e., the outer four miles of the claimed Greek airspace and the international parts of Athens FIR), while Greek aircraft constantly intercept them. Aircraft from both countries frequently engage in mock dogfights. These operations often cause casualties and losses for both the Greek and Turkish Air Forces.

===Incidents===
* On 22 July 1974, during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], a pair of Greek [[Northrop F-5|F-5Α]]s intercepted a pair of Turkish [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]] near [[Agios Efstratios]]. The aircraft engaged in a dogfight, during which one of the Turkish pilots fired a [[AIM-4 Falcon|Falcon]] missile against one of the F-5s piloted by Thomas Skampardonis. Skampardonis managed to evade the missile and then the other Greek pilot Ioannis Dinopoulos, who up to that point was undetected by the Turks, fired two [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9B]] missiles. The first AIM-9 missed its target but the second shot down one of the F-102s. The pilot of the remaining F-102 became disoriented and fled westwards. When he realized his mistake, he turned east towards the Turkish coast but ran out of fuel.

==Evros River incident==

In 1986, Turkish and Greek soldiers suffered casualties at the [[Evros River incident]], due to fire exchange. Turkish and Greek soldiers have exchanged fire in the past, as Greeks have tried to stop Iranian refugees from entering the country illegally from Turkey, but this incident was the first in which there have been casualties. During this period, Greek soldiers along the border with Turkey were on alert after receiving reports that Turkey planned to help thousands of refugees slip into Greece illegally.<ref>United Press International - Greeks, Turks exchange fire, no casualties</ref><ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-12-20-mn-4429-story.html Three Killed in Greece-Turkey Border Clas]</ref> After the incident, top military and civilian authorities from both countries met to discuss a border protocol aimed at preventing future confrontations.<ref>The Associated Press - Three Killed in Border Clash</ref>

==Sismik incident==

In 1987, the [[Sismik incident]] nearly started a war between Greece and Turkey.

During the [[Cyprus Missile Crisis]], between early 1997 and late 1998, tensions continued between Greece and Turkey, due to Greece's support of the Cypriot position.

In 1999, [[Abdullah Öcalan]], the leader of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]], was captured by the [[Milli İstihbarat Teşkilatı|Turkish Intelligence Service]] agents in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], while leaving the Greek Embassy.

==Earthquake diplomacy==

{{Main|Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy}}
Relations between Greece and neighbouring Turkey improved after successive earthquakes hit both countries in the summer of 1999. The so-called \"earthquake diplomacy\" generated an outpouring of sympathy and generous assistance provided by ordinary Greeks and Turks in both cases. These acts were encouraged from the top and took many foreigners by surprise, preparing the public for a breakthrough in bilateral relations, which had been marred by decades of hostility over anti-Greek [[pogrom]]s, territorial disputes and the situation in the divided island of Cyprus.

Ten years later, Greece has become one of the key supporters of Turkey's struggle to enter the [[European Union]]. Yet, despite the confidence Greece and Cyprus have shown, voting YES for Turkey in order to begin its entry negotiations with the European Union in October 2005, many key issues remain unresolved. Furthermore, Turkey still denies access to Cypriot vessels to its territory, an obligation towards the EU with a 2006 deadline. The Turkish government counters that this restriction regarding Cypriot vessels was taken after the trade embargo decision against the portion of Cyprus illegally occupied by Turkey. The issue remains deadlocked, despite UN and EU attempts to mediate. Other unfulfilled obligations include Christian minority rights, acknowledgement of the [[Orthodox Church]] of Constantinople and the role of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]].

In 2002, Turkey and Greece made an unsuccessful attempt to jointly host the 2008 UEFA European Football Championship. The bid was one of the four candidacies that was recommended to the UEFA Executive Committee, the joint Austria/Switzerland bid winning the right to host the tournament.

A sign of improved relations was visible in the response to a mid-air collision by Greek and Turkish fighter jets in the southern Aegean in May 2006. While the Turkish pilot ejected safely, the Greek pilot lost his life. However, both countries agreed that the event should not affect their bilateral relations<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5008178.stm BBC News Online] May 23, 2006</ref> and made a strong effort to maintain them by agreeing to a set of confidence-building measures in the aftermath of the accident.

==Forest arson==
In December 2011, the Turkish newspaper ''Birgun'' reported on an interview with former Turkish prime minister [[Mesut Yilmaz]] saying that Turkey was behind a number of large [[forest fires]] in Greece in the 1990s. Yilmaz later denied the statements, saying he had been misquoted by the newspaper and that he had been actually referring to unsubstantiated reports of Greek involvement in Turkish forest fires.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Turkish PM's arson admission fuels anger|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/137956/article/ekathimerini/news/former-turkish-pms-arson-admission-fuels-anger|date=December 28, 2011|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Outrage As Former Turkish Prime Minister Says The Country Secretly Started Huge Forest Fires In Greece|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/turkey-greece-yilmaz-2011-12|date=December 28, 2011|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}</ref>
However, despite Yilmaz's denial, the allegations strained the relations between the two countries. Also, former head of Greek intelligence service said they had intelligence that Turkish agencies were involved in the arsons in the 1990s but had no proof. He said they had received information from their agents in Turkey that Turkish agents or others were involved in the forest fires on Greek islands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Turk-Greek ties strained by arson row|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turk-greek-ties-strained-by-arson-row.aspx?pageID=238&nID=10324&NewsCatID=338|date=December 30, 2011|publisher=[[Hurriyet Daily News]]}}</ref>

==Illegal immigration==
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}
Turkey is a transit point for [[illegal immigrants]] trying to reach Europe (as well as being a destination itself; see [[Immigration to Turkey]] for details). As a result of bilateral negotiations, a readmission agreement was signed between Turkey and Greece in November 2001 and went into effect in April 2002. For third-country nationals, this protocol gives the parties 14 days to inform each other of the number of persons to be returned after the date of [[illegal entry]]. For nationals of the two countries the authorities can make use of simplified procedures. But the strict application of the agreement is reported to have retrograded as of 2003. Incidents concerning illegal immigration are frequent on the border of the two countries. Turkey, which is a transit point for illegal immigrants trying to reach Europe, has been accused of not being able to secure its borders with Greece. Since 1996 40 illegal immigrants have been killed by mines, after entering Greek territory in [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3149744.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Landmine deaths on Greek border|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> In 2001, about 800 illegal immigrants were rescued by the Greek coast guard after a fire broke out on board the Turkish-flagged Brelner, believed to have set sail from the Turkish port of İzmir, probably en route to Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1639933.stm|title=BBC News - EUROPE - Greece rescues immigrant ship|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> According to Greek sources the Turkish authorities are tolerant of smugglers trafficking illegal immigrants into Greece; a notable such incident is the one of a trafficking boat, filmed in September 14, 2009 by the [[Latvia]]n helicopter crew of [[Frontex]] patrolling near [[Farmakonisi]] island, during which \"it is clear that the Turkish coastguard, at best, does not prevent the \"slavetrade\" vessels to sail from its shores.

In March 2018, Turkey detained two Greek military officers who crossed into Turkey, by mistake, while following the trail of suspected illegal migrants.

==Cyber attacks==

In early 2020, western security officials reported a pattern of [[cyber attacks]] against governments and other organizations in Greece and other European and Middle Eastern countries in late 2018 and early 2019, which they described as resembling a \"state-backed cyber espionage operation conducted to advance Turkish interests\". Turkey’s officials declined to comment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-hijack-exclusive/exclusive-hackers-acting-in-turkeys-interests-believed-to-be-behind-recent-cyberattacks-sources-idUSKBN1ZQ10X|title=Exclusive: Hackers acting in Turkey's interests believed to be behind recent cyberattacks - sources|date=27 January 2020|website=www.reuters.com|publisher=reuters|accessdate=27 January 2020}}</ref>

Official relations between Greece and Turkey had improved, mainly due to the Greek government's supportive attitude towards Turkey's efforts to join the [[European Union|EU]], although various issues have never been fully resolved and remain constant sources of conflict. An attempt at rapprochement, dubbed the [[Davos process]], was made in 1988. The retirement of Greek Prime Minister [[Andreas Papandreou]] contributed to this improvement. His son, a foreign minister [[George Andreas Papandreou|George Papandreou]], made considerable progress in improving relations. He found a willing partner in [[Ismail Cem]] and later in the Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].

'''Photo manipulation''' involves [[image editing|transforming or altering]] a [[photograph]] using various methods and techniques to achieve desired results.  Some photo manipulations are considered skillful artwork while others are frowned upon as unethical practices, especially when used to deceive the public.  Other examples include being used for political [[propaganda]], or to make a product or person look better, or simply for entertainment purposes or harmless pranks.

Depending on the application and intent, some photo manipulations are considered an [[art form]] because it involves the creation of unique images and in some instances, signature expressions of art by photographic artists.  For example, [[Ansel Adams]] employed some of the more common manipulations using [[Burning and dodging|darkroom exposure techniques]], burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) a photograph.<ref name=Dziamba>{{cite web | url = https://whitherthebook.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/ansel-adams-and-photography-before-photoshop/ | title = Ansel Adams, and Photography Before Photoshop | author = Jack Dziamba | date = February 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite interview | title=Artbeat | date=November 29, 2012 | accessdate=January 30, 2016 | author=Mia Fineman | interviewer=Tom Legro | work=PBS Newshour | publisher=WPBT2 | location=South Florida | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/slide-show-what-did-we-do-before-photoshop/}}</ref>  Other examples of photo manipulation include retouching photographs using ink or paint, [[airbrushing]], [[double exposure (photography)|double exposure]], piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom, scratching [[instant film]]s, or through the use of software-based manipulation tools applied to digital images.  There are a number of software applications available for digital image manipulation, ranging from professional applications to very basic imaging software for casual users.

Photo manipulation dates back to some of the earliest photographs captured on [[ambrotype|glass]] and [[tintype|tin plates]] during the 19th century.  The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by [[Joseph Nicéphore Niépce]] who developed [[heliography]] and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1885093.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 21 March 2002 | title = World's oldest photo sold to library | quote = The image of an engraving depicting a man leading a horse was made in 1825 by Nicephore Niepce, who invented a technique known as heliogravure. | accessdate = 2011-11-17}}</ref><ref name=Farid>{{cite web | url = http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/history.pdf/ | title = Photo Tampering Throughout History | first = Hany | last = Farid | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150908155915/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/history.pdf | archivedate = September 8, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, [[airbrush]]ing, or scratching [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroids]] during developing.<ref name=Scratch>{{cite web | url=http://www.pola-art.de/technique/ | title=How to manipulate SX-70? | work = Polaroid SX-70 Art | publisher = Skylab Portfolio | editor = Klaus Wolfer | accessdate = February 2, 2016}}</ref>  Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the [[darkroom]] by piecing photos or negatives together.

In the early 19th century, photography and the technology that made it possible were rather crude and cumbersome. While the equipment and technology progressed over time, it was not until the late 20th century that photography evolved into the digital realm. At the onset, digital photography was considered by some to be a radical new approach and was initially rejected by photographers because of its substandard quality.<ref name=\"Peres\">{{cite book|last=Peres|first=Michael|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Fourth Edition|year=2007|publisher=Focal Press; 4 edition|isbn=978-0-240-80740-9|page= Preface, 24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYyldcYfq3MC&pg=PR23#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}</ref> The transition from film to digital has been an ongoing process although great strides were made in the early 21st century as a result of [[innovation]] that has greatly improved digital image quality while reducing the bulk and weight of cameras and equipment.<ref name=Adobe>{{cite web | url = https://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_filmtodig.pdf | publisher = Adobe Systems Incorporated | title = Making The Transition From Film To Digital |author-first=Michael |author-last=Reichmann |author-link=Michael Reichmann | date = 2006}}</ref>

===Early===
An early example of tampering was in the early 1860s, when a photo was altered using the body from a portrait of [[John C. Calhoun]] and the head of Lincoln from a famous seated portrait by [[Mathew Brady]] – the [[United States five-dollar bill#The redesigned .245 bill|same portrait]] which was the basis for the [[United States five-dollar bill#Small size note history|original]] Lincoln [[United States five-dollar bill|five-dollar bill]].<ref name=Farid/>  Another is exampled in the [[Library of Congress]] ''Prints and Photographs Online Catalogue'' wherein it exposes a manipulated [[American Civil War]] photograph of [[General Ulysses S. Grant]] posing horseback in front of his troops at [[City Point, Virginia]].<ref name=LOC>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/cwp/mystery.html | title=Civil War Glass Negatives and Related Prints – Solving a Civil War Photograph Mystery | publisher = [[Library of Congress]] | accessdate=January 30, 2016}}</ref>  Close observation of the photograph raises questions and brings to light certain details in the photograph that simply do not add up. For example, Grant's head is set at a strange angle to his body, his uniform is of a different time period, and his favorite horse [[Cincinnati (horse)|Cincinnati]] did not have a left hind sock like the horse in the photograph, although his other horse Egypt did have a sock but on a different foot. With further research, three different photographs were discovered that explained the composite using Grant's head from one photograph, the body of [[Alexander McDowell McCook|Major General Alexander McDowell McCook]] atop his horse from another photograph, and for the background, and 1864 photograph of [[Confederate Army of the Shenandoah|Confederate prisoners]] captured at the [[Battle of Fisher's Hill]].<ref name=LOC/> Queen Victoria herself once scratched out her own face on the negative of a family picture made in 1852, as she found herself 'horrid' looking. After this picture, she became more aware of how she looks in pictures and made sure to look a certain way. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/3806764/magnificent-obsession-how-queen-victoria-influenced-photography/|title=Magnificent Obsession: How Queen Victoria Influenced Photography|last=Tramz|first=Mia|website=Time|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> In the 20th century, digital retouching became available with [[Quantel]] computers running [[Quantel Paintbox|Paintbox]] in professional environments,<ref name=Sasso>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q-I2M80f7KwC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=digital+retouching+with+Quantel+computers#v=onepage | title = Abduzeedo Inspiration Guide for Designers | author = Fabio Sasso | publisher = Pearson Education | page = 124 | isbn = 9780132684729|date=July 2011}}</ref> which, alongside other contemporary packages, were effectively replaced in the market by [[Adobe Photoshop]] and other editing software for [[Graphic image developer|graphic imaging]].

==Political and ethical issues==

Photo manipulation has been used to deceive or persuade viewers or improve storytelling and self-expression.<ref name=\"Rotman\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qQE0OLSIXsEC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=photograph+has+an+inherent+verisimilitude#v=onepage | title=Becoming Beside Ourselves: The Alphabet, Ghosts, and Distributed Human Being | publisher=Duke University Press | author=Rotman, Brian | year=2008 | pages=96–97 | isbn=978-0822341833}}</ref> Often even subtle and discreet changes can have a profound impact on how we interpret or judge a photograph, making it all the more important to know when or if manipulation has occurred.  As early as the American Civil War, photographs were published as engravings based on more than one negative.<ref name=\"Palmquist\">{{cite book | title=Pioneer Photographers from the Mississippi to the Continental Divide: A Biographical Dictionary, 1839-1865 | publisher=Stanford University Press | author=Peter E.

[[Joseph Stalin]] made use of photo retouching for propaganda purposes.<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=D. |year=1997 |title=The Commissar Vanishes: the falsification of photographs and art in Stalin's Russia |publisher=Metropolitan Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-5294-1 }}</ref>  On May 5, 1920 his predecessor [[Vladimir Lenin]] held a speech for Soviet troops that [[Leon Trotsky]] attended.

The pioneer among journalists distorting photographic images for news value was [[Bernarr Macfadden]]: in the mid-1920s, his \"[[composograph]]\" process involved reenacting real news events with costumed [[body double]]s and then photographing the dramatized scenes—then pasting faces of the real news-personalities (gathered from unrelated photos) onto his staged images. In the 1930s, artist [[John Heartfield]] used a type of photo manipulation known as the [[photomontage]] to critique [[propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]].

Some ethical theories have been applied to image manipulation. During a panel on the topic of ethics in image manipulation<ref>{{cite conference | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1179176 | title = Ethics in image manipulation | conference = International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-59593-364-6 | first1 = Kathryn | last1 = Carlson | first2 = Brian | last2 = DeLevie | first3 = Aude | last3 = Oliva | doi = 10.1145/1179171.1179176 | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] | booktitle = ACM SIGGRAPH 2006}}</ref> [[Aude Oliva]] theorized that categorical shifts are necessary in order for an edited image to be viewed as a manipulation.

=== Use in journalism ===
{{see also|Photojournalism#Ethical, legal, and social considerations}}
A notable incident of controversial photo manipulation occurred over a photograph that was altered to fit the vertical orientation of a 1982 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine cover.  The altered image made two [[Egyptian pyramids]] appear closer together than they actually were in the original photograph.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/04/magazine/photography-s-new-bag-of-tricks.html?pagewanted=4|publisher=The New York Times Company | date=November 4, 1984 | author=Fred Ritchin | title=Photography's New Bag Of Tricks | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}</ref> The incident triggered a debate about the appropriateness of falsifying an image,<ref name=BRONXDOC>{{cite web|url=http://www.alteredimagesbdc.org/national-geographic/ | title=National Geographic — Altered Images | publisher=Bronx Documentary Center | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}</ref> and raised questions regarding the magazine's credibility.  Shortly after the incident, Tom Kennedy, director of photography for ''National Geographic'' stated,  \"We no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply to achieve a more compelling graphic effect. We regarded that afterwards as a mistake, and we wouldn’t repeat that mistake today.\"<ref name=BRONXDOC/>

There are other incidents of questionable photo manipulation in journalism.  One such incident arose in early 2005 after [[Martha Stewart]] was released from prison. ''[[Newsweek]]'' used a photograph of Stewart's face on the body of a much slimmer woman for their cover, suggesting that Stewart had lost weight while in prison.<ref name= NYT2005>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/03/business/media/martha-stewart-gets-new-body-in-newsweek.html?_r=0 | title = Martha Stewart Gets New Body In Newsweek | work=New York Times | author =  Jonathan D. Glater | date=March 3, 2005 | accessdate=January 6, 2015}}</ref> Speaking about the incident in an interview, Lynn Staley, assistant managing editor at ''Newsweek'' said, \"The piece that we commissioned was intended to show Martha as she would be, not necessarily as she is.\" Staley also explained that ''Newsweek'' disclosed on page 3 that the cover image of Martha Stewart was a composite.<ref name=NYT2005/>

Image manipulation software has affected the level of trust many viewers once had in the aphorism, the camera never lies.<ref name=IntlNYT2004>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/11/technology/the-camera-never-lies-but-the-software-can.html | title=The Camera Never Lies, But The Software Can | publisher= The New York Times Company | author = Katie Hefner | date=March 11, 2004}}</ref> Images may be manipulated for fun, aesthetic reasons, or to improve the appearance of a subject<ref name=Photo>{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|title=Code/Space: Software and Everyday Life|year=2011|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-04248-2|chapter=6 | page=120|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHez2BXgIeQC&pg=PA120}}</ref> but not all image manipulation is innocuous as evidenced by the [[Kerry Fonda 2004 election photo controversy]]. The image in question was a fraudulent composite image of [[John Kerry]] taken on June 13, 1971 and [[Jane Fonda]] taken in August, 1972 sharing the same platform at a 1971 antiwar rally; the latter of which carried a fake [[Associated Press]] credit with the intent to change the public's perspective of reality.<ref name=\"IntlNYT2004\"/>

There is a growing body of writings devoted to the ethical use of digital editing in [[photojournalism]]. In the United States, for example, the [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) established a Code of Ethics which promotes the accuracy of published images, advising that photographers \"do not manipulate images [...] that can mislead viewers or misrepresent subjects.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://nppa.org/code_of_ethics | title = NPPA Code of Ethics | date = January 28, 2017 | publisher=[[National Press Photographers Association]]}}</ref> Infringements of the Code are taken very seriously, especially regarding digital alteration of published photographs, as evidenced by a case in which [[Pulitzer prize]]-nominated photographer [[Allan Detrich]] resigned his post following the revelation that a number of his photographs had been manipulated.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571795 | title = Blade Editor: Detrich Submitted 79 Altered Photos This Year | work=[[Photo District News]] | date = April 15, 2007 | first = Daryl | last = Lang}}</ref>

In 2010, a Ukrainian photographer Stepan Rudik, winner of the 3rd prize story in Sports Features, has been disqualified due to violation of the rules of the [[World Press Photo of the Year|World Press Photo]] contest. \"After requesting [[Raw image format|RAW-files]] of the series from him, it became clear that an element had been removed from one of the original photographs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Announcement of disqualification|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/news/2010-03-03/announcement-disqualification|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> As of 2015, up to 20%<ref>{{Cite web|title = World Press Photo Organizer: 20% of Finalists Disqualified|url = http://time.com/3706626/world-press-photo-processing-manipulation-disqualified/|website = TIME.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> of World Press Photo entries that made it to the penultimate round of the contest were disqualified after they were found to have been manipulated or post-processed with rules violations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What counts as manipulation?|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/activities/photo-contest/verification-process/what-counts-as-manipulation|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref>

=== Use in fashion ===
The photo manipulation industry has often been accused of promoting or inciting a distorted and unrealistic image of self; most specifically in younger people. The world of [[glamour photography]] is one specific industry which has been heavily involved with the use of photo manipulation (what many consider to be a concerning element as many people look up to celebrities in search of embodying the 'ideal figure').<ref name=photo/>  Manipulation of a photo to alter a model's appearance can be used to change features such as skin complexion, hair color, body shape, and other features.  Many of the alterations to skin involve removing blemishes through the use of the healing tool in Photoshop.  Photo editors may also alter the color of hair to remove roots or add shine.  Additionally, the model's teeth and eyes may be made to look whiter than they are in reality. [[Cosmetics|Make up]] and [[body piercing|piercings]] can even be edited into pictures to look as though the model was wearing them when the photo was taken.  Through photo editing, the appearance of a model may be drastically changed to mask imperfections.<ref>Metzmacher, Dirk. \"Smashing Magazine.\" Smashing Magazine. N.p., n.d. Web. April 16, 2014.</ref>

In an article entitled, Confessions of a Retoucher: how the modeling industry is harming women, a professional retoucher who has worked for mega-fashion brands shares the industry's secrets.<ref name=\"Cage\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/confessions-of-a-retoucher-how-the-modelling-industry-is-harming-women-20171006-gyvqf2.html|title=Confessions of a retoucher: how the modelling industry is harming women|last=Cage|first=Carolyn|date=2017-10-06|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>  Along with fixing imperfections like skin wrinkles and smoothing features, the size of the model is manipulated by either adding or subtracting visible weight. Reverse retouching is just as common as making models skinnier, “distorting the bodies of very thin models to make them appear more robust in a process called reverse retouching. It is almost worse than making someone slimmer because the image claims you can be at an unhealthy weight but still look healthy. In reality, you can't, you have to Photoshop it\".<ref name=\"Cage\"/>  Reverse retouching includes eliminating shadows from protruding bones, adding flesh over body parts, color correcting, and removing hair generated for warmth from extreme weight loss. Professionals are saying that if an image is not labeled \"not retouched,\" then the public can assume that photograph has been modified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-retouched-photos-impact-our-mental-health-2018-3|title=Here's how retouched photos impact our mental health|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref> As the fashion industry continues to use photos that have been manipulated to idealize body types, there is a need for education about how unreal and unhealthy these images are and the negative implications they are promoting.

A photoshop expert, who edited and altered a lot of images for the fashion industry and wants to remain private, says it's normal to photoshop a model thinner and it doesn't matter how thick or thin the model is. They usually edit away up to 10 kilo's. But in the past 20 years, the practice has changed as more celebrities are on social media and the public is now used to how they look. You can't alter their bodies or faces too much as the public will notice that. The retoucher notes that the industry is made for making a lot of dollars in advertising and that the unrealistic ideals cycle will continue as they have to maintain this. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/photoshop-shock-insider-reveals-fashion-industry-image-editing-practices-20140924-10l97y.html|title=Photoshop shock: Insider reveals fashion industry image editing practices|last=Clun|first=Rachel|date=2014-09-24|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

Since 2012, Seventeen Magazine has let the public know that they stopped photoshopping their models. This happened after 14 year old Julia Bluhm started a petition were she demanded that the magazine use, with a minimum of one, unaltered photo in their spread. The petition got over 84,000 signatures. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://groundswell.org/4-companies-that-refuse-to-photoshop-and-why-that-matters-for-all-genders/|title=4 Companies That Refuse to Photoshop—And Why That Matters For All Genders|last=Amanda Oliver|website=Groundswell|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

=== In social media ===
Not only are photos being manipulated by professionals for the media, but also with the rise of social media everyone has easy access to edit photos they post online.  Countless apps have been created to allow smartphone user tools to modify personal images.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image|last=Media|first=Caroline Knorr, Common Sense|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>  These apps allow people to edit virtually every aspect in the photo focusing on the face and body represented. With social media users and the younger generation being exposed to an extreme amount of imagery that has been manipulated the consequences have a negative impact as body ideals are unachievable.  Social media has the opportunity to be used as a platform for promoting healthy body image and unedited photos; the need for approval over social media has to be altered in the near future.<ref name=\":0\" />

Apps like Facetune are used a lot by celebrities and influencers on social media. An example is Khloe Kardashian. It was the bestselling app for Apple in 2017 and it sold around 10 million times copies. Facetune 2 is an upgrade of the original version and has more features like live editing. With live editing it means you can edit your camera before you take a picture. Normally you would edit a picture after you have taken it, but now you can do it before and alter yourself to your liking. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Solon|first=Olivia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate|title=FaceTune is conquering Instagram – but does it take airbrushing too far?|date=2018-03-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

=== In advertising ===
Photo manipulation is not only used by fashion magazines, celebrities and influencers, it's also used in advertisement for Tv commercials and magazines. They use this to make their products or the person look better and more appealing than how they look in reality. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/the-problem-with-photo-manipulation/1/|title=Digital Media Literacy: The Problem with Photo Manipulation|website=GCFGlobal.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A few tricks that are used with photo manipulation for advertising are: fake grill marks with eye-liner, instead of milk use white glue, to make vegetables look glossy use deodorant, ice-cream melts quick so they use masked potato's. In food photographs we see for example a perfect looking burger, with bright colours. But in reality when you receive the burger, it's very sad looking. But as consumers we accept this, we find it normal that the burger we buy is not the same as in the picture. When a consumer buys a laptop, it's the same one as in the picture. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trulydeeply.com.au/2015/11/food-photography-and-manipulation-in-advertising-why-do-we-accept-knowingly-being-lied-to/|title=Food photography and manipulation in advertising: Why do we accept knowingly being lied to?|date=2015-11-19|website=Truly Deeply - Brand Agency Melbourne|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

===Celebrity opposition===
Photo manipulation has triggered negative responses from both viewers and celebrities. This has led to celebrities refusing to have their photos retouched in support of the [[American Medical Association]] that has decided that \"[we] must stop exposing impressionable children and teenagers to advertisements portraying models with body types only attainable with the help of photo editing software\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/fashion/ama-takes-stand-photoshop-medical-association-altering-contributes-unrealistic-expectations-article-1.126921#ixzz1QUW2THCf|title=Photoshop contributes to unrealistic expectations of appropriate body image: AMA|website=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> These include [[Keira Knightley]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Andy Roddick]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Zendaya]].

Brad Pitt had a photographer, [[Chuck Close]], take photos of him that emphasized all of his flaws. Chuck Close is known for his photos that emphasize all skin flaws of an individual. Pitt did so in an effort to speak out against media using photoshop and manipulating celebrities’ photos in an attempt to hide their flaws. [[Kate Winslet]] spoke out against photo manipulation in media after ''[[GQ]]'' magazine altered her body, making it look unnaturally thin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Keep It Real Challenge: Photoshop's Impact on Body Image|date= 29 June 2012|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://info.umkc.edu/womenc/2012/06/29/keep-it-real-challenge-photoshops-impact-on-body-image/|website=info.umkc.edu}}</ref> And 42-year-old [[Cate Blanchett]] appeared on the cover of [[1843 (magazine)|''Intelligent Life'']]'s 2012 March/April issue, makeup-free and without digital retouching for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Soraya|title=Cate Blanchett goes without digital enhancement on the cover of Intelligent Life|url=http://ca.omg.yahoo.com/blogs/the-juice-celeb-news/cate-blanchett-goes-without-digital-enhancement-cover-intelligent-154517034.html|publisher=The Juice|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref>

Another influencer, who is also a certified fitness instructor, named Cassey Ho expressed how the digital age has an impact on her body image and how she se struggles with it. To show how much influence cyberbullying can have on somebodies body image, she edited herself in her videos she posted on her social media. The videos went viral. Cassey also looked for the 100 most-followed influencers, who are female, and noted 22 physical attributes. She classified these as 'Instagram beauty standard'. Examples of these beauty standards are a flat stomach and filled lips. After looking it up and classifying these standards, Cassey applied them to her own pictures and photoshopped them. To make sure her followers on Instagram get more aware about these Instagram beauty standards, she posted the before-and-after and that not everything on Instagram is what it seems to be. Not everybody reacted positive on Cassey's revelation. Some found that she pushed the talent of the influencers and celebrities aside while analyzing these pictures. They also claimed she focused too much on their appearance. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/influencer-instagram-photoshop-beauty-standards-2019-9|title=A fitness influencer Photoshopped herself to meet the beauty standards of Instagram's most-followed women to prove social media isn't real life|last=Schild|first=Darcy|website=Insider|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

===Corporate opposition===
Multiple companies have begun taking the initiative to speak out against the use of photo manipulation when advertising their products. Two companies that have done so include [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]. Dove created the Dove Self-Esteem Fund and also the [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty]] as a way to try to help build confidence in young women. They want to emphasize what is known as real beauty, or untouched photographs, in the media now.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Evolution Video – Dove Self Esteem Project|website=selfesteem.dove.us|date= 2 June 2013|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://selfesteem.dove.us/Articles/Video/Evolution_video_how_images_of_beauty_are_manipulated_by_the_media.aspx}}</ref> Also, Aerie has started their campaign #AerieREAL.

Also, the American Medical Association has taken a stand against the use of photo manipulation. Dr. McAneny made a statement that altering models to such extremes creates unrealistic expectations in children and teenagers regarding body image. He also said that we should stop altering the models so they are not exposed to body types that can be attained only through the use of editing the photos. The American Medical Associations as a whole adopted a policy to work with advertisers to work on setting up guidelines for advertisements to try to limit how much photoshop is used. The goal of this policy is to limit the amount of unrealistic expectations for body image in advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|title=AMA Adopts New Policies at Annual Meeting|date=21 June 2011|website=ama-assn.org|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/a11-new-policies.page}}</ref>

=== Government opposition ===
Governments are exerting pressure on advertisers, and are starting to ban photos that are too airbrushed and edited. In the United Kingdom the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has banned an advertisement by [[Lancôme]] featuring [[Julia Roberts]] for being misleading, stating that the flawless skin seen in the photo was too good to be true.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Michael|title=Julia Roberts Makeup Ads Banned in UK for Too Much Photoshop|url=http://www.petapixel.com/2011/07/27/julia-roberts-makeup-ads-banned-in-uk-for-too-much-photoshop/|publisher=PetaPixel|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>  The US is also moving in the direction of banning excessive photo manipulation where a [[CoverGirl]] model's ad was banned because it had exaggerated effects, leading to a misleading representation of the product.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|title=US watchdog bans photoshopping in cosmetics ads|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/109375-us-bans-photoshop-use-in-cosmetics-ads|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>

In 2015, France proceeded to pass a law that battles against the use of unrealistic body images and anorexia in the fashion industry. This includes modeling and photography. The models now have to show they are healthy and have a BMI of over 18 through a note from their doctor. Employers who don't attain to this law will be fined and can serve a jail sentence up to 6 months. When a creator of a photograph does not disclose that the picture is edited or retouched, no matter how small the edit, they also can get a fine or 30% of the costs of what they used to create their ad. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petapixel.com/2015/12/22/france-bans-too-thin-fashion-models-demands-that-photoshopping-be-labeled/|title=France Bans Too-Thin Fashion Models, Demands That Photoshopping Be Labeled|website=petapixel.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

===Support===
Some editors of magazine companies do not view manipulating their [[cover model]]s as an issue. In an interview with the editor of the French magazine ''[[Marie Claire]]'', she stated that their readers are not idiots and that they can tell when a model has been retouched. Also, some who support photo manipulation in the media state that the altered photographs are not the issue, but that it is the expectations that viewers have that they fail to meet, such as wanting to have the same body as a celebrity on the cover of their favorite magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Defense of Photoshop: Why Retouching Isn't As Evil As Everyone Thinks|work= The Cut|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2010/08/photoshop_retouching.html}}</ref>

===Opinion polling===
Surveys have been done to see how photo manipulation affects society and to see what society thinks of it. One survey was done by a fashion store in the United Kingdom, [[New Look (company)|New Look]], and it showed that 90% of the individuals surveyed would prefer seeing a wider variety of body shapes in media. This would involve them wanting to see cover models that are not all thin, but some with more curves than others. The survey also talked about how readers view the use of photo manipulation. One statistic stated that 15% of the readers believed that the cover images are accurate depictions of the model in reality. Also, they found that 33% of women who were surveyed are aiming for a body that is impossible for them to attain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women Need Further Educating Into Extent of Digital Manipulation of Mo|website=prweb.com|date= 26 November 2013|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/11/prweb11361783.htm}}</ref>

Dove also did a survey to see how photo manipulation affects the self-esteem of females. In doing this, they found that 80% of the women surveyed felt insecure when seeing photos of celebrities in the media. Of the women surveyed who had lower self-esteem, 71% of them do not believe that their appearance is pretty or stylish enough in comparison to cover models.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Self Esteem Act: Parents Push for Anti-Photoshop Law in U.S. to Protect Teens from Unrealistic Body Image Ideals|publisher=Daily Mail Online|work=Associated Newspapers|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2048375/Self-Esteem-Act-US-parents-push-anti-Photoshop-laws-advertising.html}}</ref>

=== Social and cultural implications ===

The growing popularity of image manipulation has raised concern as to whether it allows for unrealistic images to be portrayed to the public. In her article \"[[On Photography]]\" (1977), [[Susan Sontag]] discusses the objectivity, or lack thereof, in photography, concluding that \"photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored and tricked out\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Sontag | first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Sontag | year = 1977 | title = [[On Photography]] | page = 4}}</ref>  A practice widely used in the magazine industry, the use of photo manipulation on an already subjective photograph, creates a constructed reality for the individual and it can become difficult to differentiate fact from fiction. With the potential to alter body image, debate continues as to whether manipulated images, particularly those in magazines, contribute to self-esteem issues in both men and women.

In today's world, photo manipulation has a positive impact by developing the creativity of one's mind or maybe a negative one by removing the art and beauty of capturing something so magnificent and natural or the way it should be. According to ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', \"Photoshopping and airbrushing, many believe, are now an inherent part of the beauty industry, as are makeup, lighting and styling\".  In a way, these image alterations are \"selling\" actual people to the masses to affect responses, reactions, and emotions toward these cultural icons.<ref>{{cite web|last=L.

==Digital fakes==
{{Main articles|Deepfake}}
A '''digital [[Hoax|fake]]''' refers to a digital video, photo, or audio file that has been altered or manipulated by digital application [[Application software|software]].  [[Deepfake]] videos fall within the category of a digital fake media,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/5382150/deepfakes-shallow-fakes-misinformation/|title=What are deepfakes?|last=Joseph|first=Rebecca|date=|work=Global News|access-date=}}</ref> but video may be digitally altered without being considered a deepfake.   The alterations can be done for [[For entertainment purposes only|entertainment purposes]], or more nefarious purposes such as spreading [[disinformation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fake-news-misinformation-online-1.5196865|title=CBC News Technology Fake News and Misinformation|last=Bellemare|first=Andrea|date=|website=Canadian Broadcast Corporation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The information can be used to conduct [[Defamation|malicious attacks]], [https://election.ctvnews.ca/how-deepfakes-could-impact-the-2019-canadian-election-1.4586847 political gains], [[Financial crime|financial]] crime, or [[fraud]].

Deepfake is used the most in pornographic style videos. In September 2019, around 15.000 deepfake videos were found online by a firm named Deeptrace. In those videos, 99% were faces used from female celebrities and put on the body's of porn stars. This new technique is used with just a couple of photos and will be used as revenge porn by anybody, not just by celebreties. A professor of law named Danielle Citron says: 'Deepfake technology is being weaponised against women.' Deepfake looks realistic even when it's made completely from fictional photos. It can also manipulate voices and let somebody say something they would never say. That makes it also very convincing. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Sample|first=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them|title=What are deepfakes – and how can you spot them?|date=2020-01-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

'''Photo manipulation''' involves [[image editing|transforming or altering]] a [[photograph]] using various methods and techniques to achieve desired results.  Some photo manipulations are considered skillful artwork while others are frowned upon as unethical practices, especially when used to deceive the public.  Other examples include being used for political [[propaganda]], or to make a product or person look better, or simply for entertainment purposes or harmless pranks.

Depending on the application and intent, some photo manipulations are considered an [[art form]] because it involves the creation of unique images and in some instances, signature expressions of art by photographic artists.  For example, [[Ansel Adams]] employed some of the more common manipulations using [[Burning and dodging|darkroom exposure techniques]], burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) a photograph.<ref name=Dziamba>{{cite web | url = https://whitherthebook.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/ansel-adams-and-photography-before-photoshop/ | title = Ansel Adams, and Photography Before Photoshop | author = Jack Dziamba | date = February 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite interview | title=Artbeat | date=November 29, 2012 | accessdate=January 30, 2016 | author=Mia Fineman | interviewer=Tom Legro | work=PBS Newshour | publisher=WPBT2 | location=South Florida | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/slide-show-what-did-we-do-before-photoshop/}}</ref>  Other examples of photo manipulation include retouching photographs using ink or paint, [[airbrushing]], [[double exposure (photography)|double exposure]], piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom, scratching [[instant film]]s, or through the use of software-based manipulation tools applied to digital images.  There are a number of software applications available for digital image manipulation, ranging from professional applications to very basic imaging software for casual users.

Photo manipulation dates back to some of the earliest photographs captured on [[ambrotype|glass]] and [[tintype|tin plates]] during the 19th century.  The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by [[Joseph Nicéphore Niépce]] who developed [[heliography]] and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1885093.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 21 March 2002 | title = World's oldest photo sold to library | quote = The image of an engraving depicting a man leading a horse was made in 1825 by Nicephore Niepce, who invented a technique known as heliogravure. | accessdate = 2011-11-17}}</ref><ref name=Farid>{{cite web | url = http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/history.pdf/ | title = Photo Tampering Throughout History | first = Hany | last = Farid | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150908155915/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/history.pdf | archivedate = September 8, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, [[airbrush]]ing, or scratching [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroids]] during developing.<ref name=Scratch>{{cite web | url=http://www.pola-art.de/technique/ | title=How to manipulate SX-70? | work = Polaroid SX-70 Art | publisher = Skylab Portfolio | editor = Klaus Wolfer | accessdate = February 2, 2016}}</ref>  Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the [[darkroom]] by piecing photos or negatives together.

In the early 19th century, photography and the technology that made it possible were rather crude and cumbersome. While the equipment and technology progressed over time, it was not until the late 20th century that photography evolved into the digital realm. At the onset, digital photography was considered by some to be a radical new approach and was initially rejected by photographers because of its substandard quality.<ref name=\"Peres\">{{cite book|last=Peres|first=Michael|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Fourth Edition|year=2007|publisher=Focal Press; 4 edition|isbn=978-0-240-80740-9|page= Preface, 24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYyldcYfq3MC&pg=PR23#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}</ref> The transition from film to digital has been an ongoing process although great strides were made in the early 21st century as a result of [[innovation]] that has greatly improved digital image quality while reducing the bulk and weight of cameras and equipment.<ref name=Adobe>{{cite web | url = https://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_filmtodig.pdf | publisher = Adobe Systems Incorporated | title = Making The Transition From Film To Digital |author-first=Michael |author-last=Reichmann |author-link=Michael Reichmann | date = 2006}}</ref>

===Early===
An early example of tampering was in the early 1860s, when a photo was altered using the body from a portrait of [[John C. Calhoun]] and the head of Lincoln from a famous seated portrait by [[Mathew Brady]] – the [[United States five-dollar bill#The redesigned .245 bill|same portrait]] which was the basis for the [[United States five-dollar bill#Small size note history|original]] Lincoln [[United States five-dollar bill|five-dollar bill]].<ref name=Farid/>  Another is exampled in the [[Library of Congress]] ''Prints and Photographs Online Catalogue'' wherein it exposes a manipulated [[American Civil War]] photograph of [[General Ulysses S. Grant]] posing horseback in front of his troops at [[City Point, Virginia]].<ref name=LOC>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/cwp/mystery.html | title=Civil War Glass Negatives and Related Prints – Solving a Civil War Photograph Mystery | publisher = [[Library of Congress]] | accessdate=January 30, 2016}}</ref>  Close observation of the photograph raises questions and brings to light certain details in the photograph that simply do not add up. For example, Grant's head is set at a strange angle to his body, his uniform is of a different time period, and his favorite horse [[Cincinnati (horse)|Cincinnati]] did not have a left hind sock like the horse in the photograph, although his other horse Egypt did have a sock but on a different foot. With further research, three different photographs were discovered that explained the composite using Grant's head from one photograph, the body of [[Alexander McDowell McCook|Major General Alexander McDowell McCook]] atop his horse from another photograph, and for the background, and 1864 photograph of [[Confederate Army of the Shenandoah|Confederate prisoners]] captured at the [[Battle of Fisher's Hill]].<ref name=LOC/> Queen Victoria herself once scratched out her own face on the negative of a family picture made in 1852, as she found herself 'horrid' looking.

[[Joseph Stalin]] made use of photo retouching for propaganda purposes.<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=D. |year=1997 |title=The Commissar Vanishes: the falsification of photographs and art in Stalin's Russia |publisher=Metropolitan Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-5294-1 }}</ref>  On May 5, 1920 his predecessor [[Vladimir Lenin]] held a speech for Soviet troops that [[Leon Trotsky]] attended.

The pioneer among journalists distorting photographic images for news value was [[Bernarr Macfadden]]: in the mid-1920s, his \"[[composograph]]\" process involved reenacting real news events with costumed [[body double]]s and then photographing the dramatized scenes—then pasting faces of the real news-personalities (gathered from unrelated photos) onto his staged images. In the 1930s, artist [[John Heartfield]] used a type of photo manipulation known as the [[photomontage]] to critique [[propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]].

Some ethical theories have been applied to image manipulation. During a panel on the topic of ethics in image manipulation<ref>{{cite conference | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1179176 | title = Ethics in image manipulation | conference = International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-59593-364-6 | first1 = Kathryn | last1 = Carlson | first2 = Brian | last2 = DeLevie | first3 = Aude | last3 = Oliva | doi = 10.1145/1179171.1179176 | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] | booktitle = ACM SIGGRAPH 2006}}</ref> [[Aude Oliva]] theorized that categorical shifts are necessary in order for an edited image to be viewed as a manipulation.

A notable incident of controversial photo manipulation occurred over a photograph that was altered to fit the vertical orientation of a 1982 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine cover.  The altered image made two [[Egyptian pyramids]] appear closer together than they actually were in the original photograph.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/04/magazine/photography-s-new-bag-of-tricks.html?pagewanted=4|publisher=The New York Times Company | date=November 4, 1984 | author=Fred Ritchin | title=Photography's New Bag Of Tricks | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}</ref> The incident triggered a debate about the appropriateness of falsifying an image,<ref name=BRONXDOC>{{cite web|url=http://www.alteredimagesbdc.org/national-geographic/ | title=National Geographic — Altered Images | publisher=Bronx Documentary Center | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}</ref> and raised questions regarding the magazine's credibility.  Shortly after the incident, Tom Kennedy, director of photography for ''National Geographic'' stated,  \"We no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply to achieve a more compelling graphic effect. We regarded that afterwards as a mistake, and we wouldn’t repeat that mistake today.\"<ref name=BRONXDOC/>

There are other incidents of questionable photo manipulation in journalism.  One such incident arose in early 2005 after [[Martha Stewart]] was released from prison. ''[[Newsweek]]'' used a photograph of Stewart's face on the body of a much slimmer woman for their cover, suggesting that Stewart had lost weight while in prison.<ref name= NYT2005>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/03/business/media/martha-stewart-gets-new-body-in-newsweek.html?_r=0 | title = Martha Stewart Gets New Body In Newsweek | work=New York Times | author =  Jonathan D. Glater | date=March 3, 2005 | accessdate=January 6, 2015}}</ref> Speaking about the incident in an interview, Lynn Staley, assistant managing editor at ''Newsweek'' said, \"The piece that we commissioned was intended to show Martha as she would be, not necessarily as she is.\" Staley also explained that ''Newsweek'' disclosed on page 3 that the cover image of Martha Stewart was a composite.<ref name=NYT2005/>

Image manipulation software has affected the level of trust many viewers once had in the aphorism, the camera never lies.<ref name=IntlNYT2004>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/11/technology/the-camera-never-lies-but-the-software-can.html | title=The Camera Never Lies, But The Software Can | publisher= The New York Times Company | author = Katie Hefner | date=March 11, 2004}}</ref> Images may be manipulated for fun, aesthetic reasons, or to improve the appearance of a subject<ref name=Photo>{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|title=Code/Space: Software and Everyday Life|year=2011|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-04248-2|chapter=6 | page=120|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHez2BXgIeQC&pg=PA120}}</ref> but not all image manipulation is innocuous as evidenced by the [[Kerry Fonda 2004 election photo controversy]]. The image in question was a fraudulent composite image of [[John Kerry]] taken on June 13, 1971 and [[Jane Fonda]] taken in August, 1972 sharing the same platform at a 1971 antiwar rally; the latter of which carried a fake [[Associated Press]] credit with the intent to change the public's perspective of reality.<ref name=\"IntlNYT2004\"/>

There is a growing body of writings devoted to the ethical use of digital editing in [[photojournalism]]. In the United States, for example, the [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) established a Code of Ethics which promotes the accuracy of published images, advising that photographers \"do not manipulate images [...] that can mislead viewers or misrepresent subjects.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://nppa.org/code_of_ethics | title = NPPA Code of Ethics | date = January 28, 2017 | publisher=[[National Press Photographers Association]]}}</ref> Infringements of the Code are taken very seriously, especially regarding digital alteration of published photographs, as evidenced by a case in which [[Pulitzer prize]]-nominated photographer [[Allan Detrich]] resigned his post following the revelation that a number of his photographs had been manipulated.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571795 | title = Blade Editor: Detrich Submitted 79 Altered Photos This Year | work=[[Photo District News]] | date = April 15, 2007 | first = Daryl | last = Lang}}</ref>

In 2010, a Ukrainian photographer Stepan Rudik, winner of the 3rd prize story in Sports Features, has been disqualified due to violation of the rules of the [[World Press Photo of the Year|World Press Photo]] contest. \"After requesting [[Raw image format|RAW-files]] of the series from him, it became clear that an element had been removed from one of the original photographs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Announcement of disqualification|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/news/2010-03-03/announcement-disqualification|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> As of 2015, up to 20%<ref>{{Cite web|title = World Press Photo Organizer: 20% of Finalists Disqualified|url = http://time.com/3706626/world-press-photo-processing-manipulation-disqualified/|website = TIME.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> of World Press Photo entries that made it to the penultimate round of the contest were disqualified after they were found to have been manipulated or post-processed with rules violations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What counts as manipulation?|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/activities/photo-contest/verification-process/what-counts-as-manipulation|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref>

=== Use in fashion ===
The photo manipulation industry has often been accused of promoting or inciting a distorted and unrealistic image of self; most specifically in younger people. The world of [[glamour photography]] is one specific industry which has been heavily involved with the use of photo manipulation (what many consider to be a concerning element as many people look up to celebrities in search of embodying the 'ideal figure').<ref name=photo/>  Manipulation of a photo to alter a model's appearance can be used to change features such as skin complexion, hair color, body shape, and other features.  Many of the alterations to skin involve removing blemishes through the use of the healing tool in Photoshop.  Photo editors may also alter the color of hair to remove roots or add shine.  Additionally, the model's teeth and eyes may be made to look whiter than they are in reality. [[Cosmetics|Make up]] and [[body piercing|piercings]] can even be edited into pictures to look as though the model was wearing them when the photo was taken.  Through photo editing, the appearance of a model may be drastically changed to mask imperfections.<ref>Metzmacher, Dirk. \"Smashing Magazine.\" Smashing Magazine. N.p., n.d. Web. April 16, 2014.</ref>

In an article entitled, Confessions of a Retoucher: how the modeling industry is harming women, a professional retoucher who has worked for mega-fashion brands shares the industry's secrets.<ref name=\"Cage\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/confessions-of-a-retoucher-how-the-modelling-industry-is-harming-women-20171006-gyvqf2.html|title=Confessions of a retoucher: how the modelling industry is harming women|last=Cage|first=Carolyn|date=2017-10-06|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>  Along with fixing imperfections like skin wrinkles and smoothing features, the size of the model is manipulated by either adding or subtracting visible weight. Reverse retouching is just as common as making models skinnier, “distorting the bodies of very thin models to make them appear more robust in a process called reverse retouching. It is almost worse than making someone slimmer because the image claims you can be at an unhealthy weight but still look healthy. In reality, you can't, you have to Photoshop it\".<ref name=\"Cage\"/>  Reverse retouching includes eliminating shadows from protruding bones, adding flesh over body parts, color correcting, and removing hair generated for warmth from extreme weight loss. Professionals are saying that if an image is not labeled \"not retouched,\" then the public can assume that photograph has been modified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-retouched-photos-impact-our-mental-health-2018-3|title=Here's how retouched photos impact our mental health|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref> As the fashion industry continues to use photos that have been manipulated to idealize body types, there is a need for education about how unreal and unhealthy these images are and the negative implications they are promoting.

A photoshop expert, who edited and altered a lot of images for the fashion industry and wants to remain private, says it's normal to photoshop a model thinner and it doesn't matter how thick or thin the model is. They usually edit away up to 10 kilo's. But in the past 20 years, the practice has changed as more celebrities are on social media and the public is now used to how they look. You can't alter their bodies or faces too much as the public will notice that. The retoucher notes that the industry is made for making a lot of dollars in advertising and that the unrealistic ideals cycle will continue as they have to maintain this. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/photoshop-shock-insider-reveals-fashion-industry-image-editing-practices-20140924-10l97y.html|title=Photoshop shock: Insider reveals fashion industry image editing practices|last=Clun|first=Rachel|date=2014-09-24|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

Since 2012, Seventeen Magazine has let the public know that they stopped photoshopping their models. This happened after 14 year old Julia Bluhm started a petition were she demanded that the magazine use, with a minimum of one, unaltered photo in their spread. The petition got over 84,000 signatures. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://groundswell.org/4-companies-that-refuse-to-photoshop-and-why-that-matters-for-all-genders/|title=4 Companies That Refuse to Photoshop—And Why That Matters For All Genders|last=Amanda Oliver|website=Groundswell|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

=== In social media ===
Not only are photos being manipulated by professionals for the media, but also with the rise of social media everyone has easy access to edit photos they post online.  Countless apps have been created to allow smartphone user tools to modify personal images.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image|last=Media|first=Caroline Knorr, Common Sense|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>  These apps allow people to edit virtually every aspect in the photo focusing on the face and body represented. With social media users and the younger generation being exposed to an extreme amount of imagery that has been manipulated the consequences have a negative impact as body ideals are unachievable.  Social media has the opportunity to be used as a platform for promoting healthy body image and unedited photos; the need for approval over social media has to be altered in the near future.<ref name=\":0\" />

Apps like Facetune are used a lot by celebrities and influencers on social media. An example is Khloe Kardashian. It was the bestselling app for Apple in 2017 and it sold around 10 million times copies. Facetune 2 is an upgrade of the original version and has more features like live editing. With live editing it means you can edit your camera before you take a picture. Normally you would edit a picture after you have taken it, but now you can do it before and alter yourself to your liking. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Solon|first=Olivia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate|title=FaceTune is conquering Instagram – but does it take airbrushing too far?|date=2018-03-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

=== In advertising ===
Photo manipulation is not only used by fashion magazines, celebrities and influencers, it's also used in advertisement for Tv commercials and magazines. They use this to make their products or the person look better and more appealing than how they look in reality. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/the-problem-with-photo-manipulation/1/|title=Digital Media Literacy: The Problem with Photo Manipulation|website=GCFGlobal.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A few tricks that are used with photo manipulation for advertising are: fake grill marks with eye-liner, instead of milk use white glue, to make vegetables look glossy use deodorant, ice-cream melts quick so they use masked potato's. In food photographs we see for example a perfect looking burger, with bright colours. But in reality when you receive the burger, it's very sad looking. But as consumers we accept this, we find it normal that the burger we buy is not the same as in the picture. When a consumer buys a laptop, it's the same one as in the picture. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trulydeeply.com.au/2015/11/food-photography-and-manipulation-in-advertising-why-do-we-accept-knowingly-being-lied-to/|title=Food photography and manipulation in advertising: Why do we accept knowingly being lied to?|date=2015-11-19|website=Truly Deeply - Brand Agency Melbourne|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

===Celebrity opposition===
Photo manipulation has triggered negative responses from both viewers and celebrities. This has led to celebrities refusing to have their photos retouched in support of the [[American Medical Association]] that has decided that \"[we] must stop exposing impressionable children and teenagers to advertisements portraying models with body types only attainable with the help of photo editing software\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/fashion/ama-takes-stand-photoshop-medical-association-altering-contributes-unrealistic-expectations-article-1.126921#ixzz1QUW2THCf|title=Photoshop contributes to unrealistic expectations of appropriate body image: AMA|website=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> These include [[Keira Knightley]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Andy Roddick]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Zendaya]].

Brad Pitt had a photographer, [[Chuck Close]], take photos of him that emphasized all of his flaws. Chuck Close is known for his photos that emphasize all skin flaws of an individual. Pitt did so in an effort to speak out against media using photoshop and manipulating celebrities’ photos in an attempt to hide their flaws. [[Kate Winslet]] spoke out against photo manipulation in media after ''[[GQ]]'' magazine altered her body, making it look unnaturally thin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Keep It Real Challenge: Photoshop's Impact on Body Image|date= 29 June 2012|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://info.umkc.edu/womenc/2012/06/29/keep-it-real-challenge-photoshops-impact-on-body-image/|website=info.umkc.edu}}</ref> And 42-year-old [[Cate Blanchett]] appeared on the cover of [[1843 (magazine)|''Intelligent Life'']]'s 2012 March/April issue, makeup-free and without digital retouching for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Soraya|title=Cate Blanchett goes without digital enhancement on the cover of Intelligent Life|url=http://ca.omg.yahoo.com/blogs/the-juice-celeb-news/cate-blanchett-goes-without-digital-enhancement-cover-intelligent-154517034.html|publisher=The Juice|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref>

Another influencer, who is also a certified fitness instructor, named Cassey Ho expressed how the digital age has an impact on her body image and how she se struggles with it. To show how much influence cyberbullying can have on somebodies body image, she edited herself in her videos she posted on her social media. The videos went viral. Cassey also looked for the 100 most-followed influencers, who are female, and noted 22 physical attributes. She classified these as 'Instagram beauty standard'. Examples of these beauty standards are a flat stomach and filled lips. After looking it up and classifying these standards, Cassey applied them to her own pictures and photoshopped them. To make sure her followers on Instagram get more aware about these Instagram beauty standards, she posted the before-and-after and that not everything on Instagram is what it seems to be. Not everybody reacted positive on Cassey's revelation. Some found that she pushed the talent of the influencers and celebrities aside while analyzing these pictures. They also claimed she focused too much on their appearance. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/influencer-instagram-photoshop-beauty-standards-2019-9|title=A fitness influencer Photoshopped herself to meet the beauty standards of Instagram's most-followed women to prove social media isn't real life|last=Schild|first=Darcy|website=Insider|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

===Corporate opposition===
Multiple companies have begun taking the initiative to speak out against the use of photo manipulation when advertising their products. Two companies that have done so include [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]. Dove created the Dove Self-Esteem Fund and also the [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty]] as a way to try to help build confidence in young women. They want to emphasize what is known as real beauty, or untouched photographs, in the media now.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Evolution Video – Dove Self Esteem Project|website=selfesteem.dove.us|date= 2 June 2013|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://selfesteem.dove.us/Articles/Video/Evolution_video_how_images_of_beauty_are_manipulated_by_the_media.aspx}}</ref> Also, Aerie has started their campaign #AerieREAL.

Also, the American Medical Association has taken a stand against the use of photo manipulation. Dr. McAneny made a statement that altering models to such extremes creates unrealistic expectations in children and teenagers regarding body image. He also said that we should stop altering the models so they are not exposed to body types that can be attained only through the use of editing the photos. The American Medical Associations as a whole adopted a policy to work with advertisers to work on setting up guidelines for advertisements to try to limit how much photoshop is used. The goal of this policy is to limit the amount of unrealistic expectations for body image in advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|title=AMA Adopts New Policies at Annual Meeting|date=21 June 2011|website=ama-assn.org|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/a11-new-policies.page}}</ref>

=== Government opposition ===
Governments are exerting pressure on advertisers, and are starting to ban photos that are too airbrushed and edited. In the United Kingdom the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has banned an advertisement by [[Lancôme]] featuring [[Julia Roberts]] for being misleading, stating that the flawless skin seen in the photo was too good to be true.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Michael|title=Julia Roberts Makeup Ads Banned in UK for Too Much Photoshop|url=http://www.petapixel.com/2011/07/27/julia-roberts-makeup-ads-banned-in-uk-for-too-much-photoshop/|publisher=PetaPixel|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>  The US is also moving in the direction of banning excessive photo manipulation where a [[CoverGirl]] model's ad was banned because it had exaggerated effects, leading to a misleading representation of the product.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|title=US watchdog bans photoshopping in cosmetics ads|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/109375-us-bans-photoshop-use-in-cosmetics-ads|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>

In 2015, France proceeded to pass a law that battles against the use of unrealistic body images and anorexia in the fashion industry. This includes modeling and photography. The models now have to show they are healthy and have a BMI of over 18 through a note from their doctor. Employers who don't attain to this law will be fined and can serve a jail sentence up to 6 months. When a creator of a photograph does not disclose that the picture is edited or retouched, no matter how small the edit, they also can get a fine or 30% of the costs of what they used to create their ad. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petapixel.com/2015/12/22/france-bans-too-thin-fashion-models-demands-that-photoshopping-be-labeled/|title=France Bans Too-Thin Fashion Models, Demands That Photoshopping Be Labeled|website=petapixel.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

===Support===
Some editors of magazine companies do not view manipulating their [[cover model]]s as an issue. In an interview with the editor of the French magazine ''[[Marie Claire]]'', she stated that their readers are not idiots and that they can tell when a model has been retouched. Also, some who support photo manipulation in the media state that the altered photographs are not the issue, but that it is the expectations that viewers have that they fail to meet, such as wanting to have the same body as a celebrity on the cover of their favorite magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Defense of Photoshop: Why Retouching Isn't As Evil As Everyone Thinks|work= The Cut|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2010/08/photoshop_retouching.html}}</ref>

===Opinion polling===
Surveys have been done to see how photo manipulation affects society and to see what society thinks of it. One survey was done by a fashion store in the United Kingdom, [[New Look (company)|New Look]], and it showed that 90% of the individuals surveyed would prefer seeing a wider variety of body shapes in media. This would involve them wanting to see cover models that are not all thin, but some with more curves than others. The survey also talked about how readers view the use of photo manipulation. One statistic stated that 15% of the readers believed that the cover images are accurate depictions of the model in reality. Also, they found that 33% of women who were surveyed are aiming for a body that is impossible for them to attain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women Need Further Educating Into Extent of Digital Manipulation of Mo|website=prweb.com|date= 26 November 2013|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/11/prweb11361783.htm}}</ref>

Dove also did a survey to see how photo manipulation affects the self-esteem of females. In doing this, they found that 80% of the women surveyed felt insecure when seeing photos of celebrities in the media. Of the women surveyed who had lower self-esteem, 71% of them do not believe that their appearance is pretty or stylish enough in comparison to cover models.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Self Esteem Act: Parents Push for Anti-Photoshop Law in U.S. to Protect Teens from Unrealistic Body Image Ideals|publisher=Daily Mail Online|work=Associated Newspapers|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2048375/Self-Esteem-Act-US-parents-push-anti-Photoshop-laws-advertising.html}}</ref>

=== Social and cultural implications ===

The growing popularity of image manipulation has raised concern as to whether it allows for unrealistic images to be portrayed to the public. In her article \"[[On Photography]]\" (1977), [[Susan Sontag]] discusses the objectivity, or lack thereof, in photography, concluding that \"photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored and tricked out\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Sontag | first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Sontag | year = 1977 | title = [[On Photography]] | page = 4}}</ref>  A practice widely used in the magazine industry, the use of photo manipulation on an already subjective photograph, creates a constructed reality for the individual and it can become difficult to differentiate fact from fiction. With the potential to alter body image, debate continues as to whether manipulated images, particularly those in magazines, contribute to self-esteem issues in both men and women.

In today's world, photo manipulation has a positive impact by developing the creativity of one's mind or maybe a negative one by removing the art and beauty of capturing something so magnificent and natural or the way it should be. According to ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', \"Photoshopping and airbrushing, many believe, are now an inherent part of the beauty industry, as are makeup, lighting and styling\".  In a way, these image alterations are \"selling\" actual people to the masses to affect responses, reactions, and emotions toward these cultural icons.<ref>{{cite web|last=L.

=== Scientific Fraud ===
{{Main|Scientific_misconduct#Photo_manipulation}}

==Digital fakes==
{{Main articles|Deepfake}}
A '''digital [[Hoax|fake]]''' refers to a digital video, photo, or audio file that has been altered or manipulated by digital application [[Application software|software]].  [[Deepfake]] videos fall within the category of a digital fake media,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/5382150/deepfakes-shallow-fakes-misinformation/|title=What are deepfakes?|last=Joseph|first=Rebecca|date=|work=Global News|access-date=}}</ref> but video may be digitally altered without being considered a deepfake.   The alterations can be done for [[For entertainment purposes only|entertainment purposes]], or more nefarious purposes such as spreading [[disinformation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fake-news-misinformation-online-1.5196865|title=CBC News Technology Fake News and Misinformation|last=Bellemare|first=Andrea|date=|website=Canadian Broadcast Corporation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The information can be used to conduct [[Defamation|malicious attacks]], [https://election.ctvnews.ca/how-deepfakes-could-impact-the-2019-canadian-election-1.4586847 political gains], [[Financial crime|financial]] crime, or [[fraud]].

Deepfake is used the most in pornographic style videos. In September 2019, around 15.000 deepfake videos were found online by a firm named Deeptrace. In those videos, 99% were faces used from female celebrities and put on the body's of porn stars. This new technique is used with just a couple of photos and will be used as revenge porn by anybody, not just by celebreties. A professor of law named Danielle Citron says: 'Deepfake technology is being weaponised against women.' Deepfake looks realistic even when it's made completely from fictional photos. It can also manipulate voices and let somebody say something they would never say. That makes it also very convincing. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Sample|first=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them|title=What are deepfakes – and how can you spot them?|date=2020-01-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

[[File:PostcardLakevilleCTHotchkissSchool1901to1907UndividedBack.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Postcard circa 1905]]
In 1891, [[Maria Bissell Hotchkiss|Maria Harrison Bissell Hotchkiss]], with guidance from Yale President [[Timothy Dwight V]], founded the school to prepare young men for [[Yale University]]. In 1892, The Hotchkiss School opened its doors to 50 male boarding students for $600. Hotchkiss's endowment also precipitated scholarship aid to deserving students. In 1974, the school became coeducational.<ref name=WhoWeAreTraditions>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotchkiss.org/AboutHotchkiss/HistoryTra.aspx |title=About Hotchkiss: History & Traditions |publisher=Hotchkiss School |date=2014 |accessdate=November 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120040039/http://www.hotchkiss.org/AboutHotchkiss/HistoryTra.aspx |archivedate=November 20, 2014 }}

===Faculty sexual misconduct===
In 2015, a male student sued the school, alleging that he had been raped and sexually harassed in \"an environment of well-known and tolerated sexual assaults, sexually violent hazing, and pedophilia\". In the suit, he said the Dormitory Master and instructor had drugged him and lured him to his quarters where he was raped.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Hotchkiss-School-Investigating-Sex-Abuse-Allegations-290976681.html|title=Former Hotchkiss School Student Raped by Teacher: Lawsuit|date=February 5, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2019}}</ref>

In the lawsuit, he said he wrote an article for the student newspaper about the failure of the school to appropriately respond to complaints. The suit said the headmaster blocked publication and \"conspired to prevent (the plaintiff) from informing the students, parents and the school community about the faculty members's sexual assault and his aberrant and predatory propensities and behavior.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Exclusive-Hotchkiss-sued-for-alleged-sex-assaults-6064782.php|title=Exclusive Hotchkiss sued for alleged sex assaults|first=Daniel|last=Tepfer|date=Feb 6, 2015|website=Connecticut Post|accessdate=Aug 31, 2019}}</ref>

As a result of this complaint and others, the school hired a law firm to investigate. The law firm interviewed more than 150 people and reviewed more than 200,000 pages of documents.

On August 16, 2018, the firm released its report, which found that seven former faculty members had abused students for years, yet school administrators took no action, even when made aware of the [[sexual misconduct]]. The report said that the abuse, stretching from 1969 through 1992, involved at least 16 students and consisted of intercourse and unnecessary \"medical gynecological\" exams.

A former headmaster who had been serving on the Board of Trustees resigned after cooperating with investigators. Board of Trustee representatives said the information would be turned over to law enforcement officials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hotchkiss-school-sexual-abuse_n_5b79b46ee4b018b93e94eb31|title=Connecticut Boarding School Says 7 Former Staffers Sexually Abused Students|date=Aug 19, 2018|website=HuffPost|accessdate=Aug 31, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:PostcardLakevilleCTHotchkissSchool1901to1907UndividedBack.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Postcard circa 1905]]
In 1891, [[Maria Bissell Hotchkiss|Maria Harrison Bissell Hotchkiss]], with guidance from Yale President [[Timothy Dwight V]], founded the school to prepare young men for [[Yale University]]. In 1892, The Hotchkiss School opened its doors to 50 male boarding students for $600. Hotchkiss's endowment also precipitated scholarship aid to deserving students. In 1974, the school became coeducational.<ref name=WhoWeAreTraditions>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotchkiss.org/AboutHotchkiss/HistoryTra.aspx |title=About Hotchkiss: History & Traditions |publisher=Hotchkiss School |date=2014 |accessdate=November 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120040039/http://www.hotchkiss.org/AboutHotchkiss/HistoryTra.aspx |archivedate=November 20, 2014 }}

===Faculty sexual misconduct===
In 2015, a male student sued the school, alleging that he had been raped and sexually harassed in \"an environment of well-known and tolerated sexual assaults, sexually violent hazing, and pedophilia\". In the suit, he said the Dormitory Master and instructor had drugged him and lured him to his quarters where he was raped.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Hotchkiss-School-Investigating-Sex-Abuse-Allegations-290976681.html|title=Former Hotchkiss School Student Raped by Teacher: Lawsuit|date=February 5, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2019}}</ref>

In the lawsuit, he said he wrote an article for the student newspaper about the failure of the school to appropriately respond to complaints. The suit said the headmaster blocked publication and \"conspired to prevent (the plaintiff) from informing the students, parents and the school community about the faculty members's sexual assault and his aberrant and predatory propensities and behavior.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Exclusive-Hotchkiss-sued-for-alleged-sex-assaults-6064782.php|title=Exclusive Hotchkiss sued for alleged sex assaults|first=Daniel|last=Tepfer|date=Feb 6, 2015|website=Connecticut Post|accessdate=Aug 31, 2019}}</ref>

As a result of this complaint and others, the school hired a law firm to investigate. The law firm interviewed more than 150 people and reviewed more than 200,000 pages of documents.

On August 16, 2018, the firm released its report, which found that seven former faculty members had abused students for years, yet school administrators took no action, even when made aware of the [[sexual misconduct]]. The report said that the abuse, stretching from 1969 through 1992, involved at least 16 students and consisted of intercourse and unnecessary \"medical gynecological\" exams.

A former headmaster who had been serving on the Board of Trustees resigned after cooperating with investigators.

The draw for the group stage took place at the [[Liechtenstein Museum]] in [[Vienna]] on 24 June 2009. A total of 24 teams were drawn into four groups of six. Teams were divided into four pots, based on EHF coefficients. Clubs from the same pot or the same association cannot be drawn into the same group.

Each team played against each other in its group twice. The top two in each group proceeded to the knockout stage, and the third-placed teams entered the EHF Cup's Winners Cup Round of 32.

==Draw==
The draw for the group stage took place at the [[Liechtenstein Museum]] in [[Vienna]] on 24 June 2009. A total of 24 teams were drawn into four groups of six. Teams were divided into four pots, based on EHF coefficients. Clubs from the same pot or the same association cannot be drawn into the same group.

Each team played against each other in its group twice. The top two in each group proceeded to the knockout stage, and the third-placed teams entered the EHF Cup's Winners Cup Round of 32.

|ShortSummary    = After a car explodes, killing a Navy officer, the team discovers that the intended target was his wife—the sister to deep cover NCIS agent Nick Torres, who disappeared months earlier in Buenos Aires while investigating criminal businessman Leo Silva (a failed target in the past for Gibbs' mentor Mike Franks). Torres re-emerges after realizing his cover was blown by his sister coming to Argentina to search for him. Torres begs Gibbs to let him help close the case, as he knows that Silva wants him and his family dead. His only way of ensuring the safety of his sister and niece (and staying alive himself) is for Silva and his son to be safely removed from their power for a very long time. Meanwhile, Special Agent Quinn shadows the team to figure out the type of agent Gibbs is looking for. In the end, Torres and Quinn both join the team.

|ShortSummary    = After a car explodes, killing a Navy officer, the team discovers that the intended target was his wife—the sister to deep cover NCIS agent Nick Torres, who disappeared months earlier in Buenos Aires while investigating criminal businessman Leo Silva (a failed target in the past for Gibbs' mentor Mike Franks). Torres re-emerges after realizing his cover was blown by his sister coming to Argentina to search for him. Torres begs Gibbs to let him help close the case, as he knows that Silva wants him and his family dead. His only way of ensuring the safety of his sister and niece (and staying alive himself) is for Silva and his son to be safely removed from their power for a very long time. Meanwhile, Special Agent Quinn shadows the team to figure out the type of agent Gibbs is looking for. In the end, Torres and Quinn both join the team.

[[File:Chris-minh-doky-live-dudelange-2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Danish jazz]] musician [[Chris Minh Doky]] in a live performance.]]
{{Denmark culture}}
[[Denmark]]'s most famous classical composer is [[Carl Nielsen]], especially remembered for his six symphonies, while the [[Royal Danish Ballet]] specializes in the work of Danish choreographer [[August Bournonville]]. Danes have distinguished themselves as [[jazz]] musicians, and the [[Copenhagen Jazz Festival]] has acquired an international reputation. The modern pop and rock scene has produced a few names of note, including [[MØ]], [[Lukas Graham]], [[D-A-D]], [[Tina Dico]], [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]], [[The Raveonettes]], [[Michael Learns to Rock]], [[Volbeat (band)|Volbeat]], [[Alphabeat]], [[Safri Duo]], [[Medina (singer)|Medina]], [[Oh Land]], [[Kashmir (band)|Kashmir]], [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]], [[Outlandish]], and [[Mew (band)|Mew]]. [[Lars Ulrich]] is the first Danish musician to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==Origins==
[[File:Bronse-Lurer-Danmark.png|thumb|right|100px|The [[Brudevælte Lurs]] from northern [[Zealand]]]]The earliest traces of Danish music go back to the many twisting [[bronze-age]] horns or [[lur]]s which some experts have identified as musical instruments. They have been discovered in various parts of [[Scandinavia]], mostly Denmark, since the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"um.dk\">[http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap4/4-11.asp \"Denmark – Culture – Music\", Royal Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs].

[[File:Codex Runicus - Drømde mik en drøm i nat.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Codex Runicus: Denmark's oldest musical notation]]

In his [[Gesta Danorum]] (c.1200), historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] refers to the power that music had over [[Eric I of Denmark|King Erik the Kind-Hearted]]. In the 13th and early 14th centuries, German [[minnesingers]] such as Tannhäuser and Frauenlob sang in the Danish courts. The [[Codex Runicus]] (c.1300) contains a verse written in runes with a non-rhythmic musical notation. The first line is ''[[Drømde mig en drøm i nat|Drømdæ mik æn drøm i nat]]'' (I Dreamed Me a Dream Last Night). There is also evidence that English monks came to Denmark to sing at a celebration commemorating [[Cnut the Great|St Canute]], who died in 1086. In 1145, [[Lund Cathedral]] received [[Scandinavia]]'s first choir statues, and by 1330 it was one of the larger churches to have an organ installed.<ref name=\"um.dk\"/>

==Historical influences==
[[File:Pratum Spirituale Pedersøn 1620.gif|thumb|right|130px|Pratum Spirituale by [[Mogens Pedersøn]] (1620)]]
The greatest influence on the evolution of music in Denmark has certainly been the monarchy. At the time of his coronation in 1448, [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] engaged a permanent corps of trumpeters, and by 1519 the court had a corps of court singers and an instrumental ensemble as well. The collections of works used by the chapel royal under [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] in the middle of the 16th century were based on Dutch, Italian, French and German masters. [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] spent considerable sums of money on training local musicians and bringing foreign masters to Denmark. [[Mogens Pedersøn]], one of his Danish musicians who had studied in [[Venice]] under [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], became one of Denmark's most important composers of church music. His principal work ''Pratum spirituale'' was a collection of 21 Danish hymns in five-part settings, a mass in five parts, three Latin [[motet]]s and a number of Danish and Latin choral responses. It was published in [[Copenhagen]] in 1620 and is still performed today.<ref>[http://www.naxos.com/composerinfo/Mogens_Pederson/21432.htm \"Pederson, Mogens (1580–1628)\", Naxos.com].

Under the influence of [[Louis XIV of France]], music for the theatre was established in Denmark during the reigns of [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederik III]] and [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] when lavish court ballets were performed. This soon led to opera and the performance of ''Der vereinigte Götterstreit'' composed by Povl Christian Schindler on Christian's birthday in 1689. Although it was a great success, there was little interest in opera after the theatre caught fire a few days later causing 180 deaths.<ref>[http://home.online.no/~cfscheel/brand.htm Louis Bobé, \"Operahusets Brand paa Amalienborg den 19.

His members included [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] and [[Giuseppe Sarti]]. In 1756, Sarti provided the music for the first ''syngespil'' which, in the early 1790s, became established as a popular national genre with ''Høstgildet'' (the Harvest Celebration) and ''Peters Bryllup'' (Peter's Wedding). Both were composed by [[Johann Abraham Peter Schulz]].

[[Christoph Ernst Friedrich Weyse]], from [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], who was a pupil of Schulz, is remembered above all for his Danish songs, hymns and carols, which remain popular to this day.

===The Golden Age===
[[File:Hans Christian Lumbye.gif|thumb|left|130px|[[Hans Christian Lumbye]] (1810–1874)]]
The 19th century saw the emergence of a number of Danish composers inspired by [[Romantic nationalism]]. [[Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann]] (1805–1900) who, apart from opera and ballet music, contributed to song and the piano repertory. From 1843 until his death, he was the organist at the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]]. His works are not only romantic but generally inspired by the old [[Norse mythology|Nordic legends]].<ref>[http://www.ugle.dk/j_p_e_hartmann.html \"Gamle Danske Sange – med melodi af J. P. E. Hartmann\"]. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 11 March 2010.</ref>

[[Hans Christian Lumbye]] (1810–1874) was employed as the first music director at the Copenhagen amusement park [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]] when it opened in 1843. Here he had a platform for presenting a large foreign and Danish repertory, including his many waltzes and [[galop]]s. In 1839, he had heard a Viennese orchestra play music by [[Johann Strauss I|Johann Strauss]], after which he composed in the same style, eventually earning the nickname \"The Strauss of the North\".<ref>[http://www.naxos.com/composerinfo/Hans_Christian_Lumbye/22613.htm \"Lumbye, Hans Christian\"], Naxos.com. Retrieved 11 March 2010</ref> One of his most popular pieces, associated with Tivoli, is ''Champagnegaloppen'' (the [[Champagne Galop]]), which starts with the happy sound of a champagne cork popping. It has been used in several Danish films including ''[[Reptilicus]]'' (1961), and ''[[Champagnegaloppen]]'' (1938).

[[Niels W. Gade]] (1817–1890) participated in the development of ''[[Musikforeningen]]'' (the Music Society) which had been founded in 1836 with the purpose of extending and improving the understanding of classical music. He became its conductor in 1850, and under his management a number of masterpieces of choral music were given their first performance in Denmark, among them Bach's [[St Matthew Passion (Bach)|St. Matthew Passion]] in 1875.<ref>[http://www.danishmusic.info/index.php?id=1300&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=391&cHash=7d33b82007 \"Danish Choral Music\"], DanishMusic.info.

In the spirit of Romantic nationalism, he composed eight symphonies, a violin concerto, chamber music, organ and piano pieces and a number of large-scale cantatas, among them ''[[Elverskud]]'' (''The Elf King's Daughter''), the most famous Danish work of its kind.<ref>[http://www.eclassical.com/eclassic/eclassical?&composer_id=39&page=find_by_composer_list \"Gade, Niels W.\"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Eclassical.com.

From 1830 to 1877, he was the choreographer at the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], for which he created more than 50 ballets admired for their exuberance, lightness, and beauty. He created a style which, although influenced by the Paris ballet, is entirely his own. Bournonville's best-known works are ''[[La Sylphide]]'' (1836), ''[[Napoli (ballet)|Napoli]]'' (1842), ''[[Le Conservatoire]]'' (1849), ''[[The Kermesse in Bruges]]'' (1851) and ''[[A Folk Tale (ballet)|A Folk Tale]]'' (1854). He drew on a number of different composers including [[Holger Simon Paulli]] and [[Niels Gade]].

===The Carl Nielsen era===
As a result of problems with Germany, Denmark's attitude during the first half of the 20th century became nationalistic and introverted. The two leading figures, [[Carl Nielsen]] and [[Thomas Laub]] revived interest in the purer music of earlier periods such as the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"netpub\"/>

[[File:Carl Nielsen.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Carl Nielsen]] (1865–1931)]]
*Carl Nielsen (1865–1931), now an internationally recognized composer, was the dominant figure in Danish music and musical life from the end of the 1890s until well into the 20th century. He had grown up in a small village on [[Funen]] but, by performing with folk musicians as a child and as a bugler in the army, he was able to enter the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music|music conservatory]] in Copenhagen in 1884. By the time he took over Gade's role around 1900, Denmark's music scene was firmly established with strong popular interest and support.<ref name=\"DanishMusic\">[http://www.danishmusic.info/index.php?id=1300&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=280&cHash=161612f116 \"Four milestones in Danish music before 1945\"], DanishMusic.info.

Indeed, the success of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Nielsen)|First Symphony]] when it was played in Berlin in 1896 paved the way for his growing reputation. The [[Symphony No. 3 (Nielsen)|Third Symphony]] (1912), which contains wordless vocal solos, was performed in the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] within the first two years. The [[Symphony No. 4 (Nielsen)|Fourth Symphony]] (1916) featuring a battle between two sets of timpani is the one which has been most widely recorded.<ref>[http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/list-of-works/orchestral-music.php \"Carl Nielsen Society – Orchestral Music.\"] Retrieved 12 March 2010.</ref> [[Maskarade]] (1906), a three-act opera based on the play by [[Ludwig Holberg]], is regarded as the Danish national opera.<ref>[http://www.musicweb-international.com/SandH/2008/Jan-Jun08/maskarade2601.htm \"Nielsen, Maskarade : at the Royal Danish Opera, Copenhagen, 26.1.2008\"], MusicWeb-International. Retrieved 13 March 2010.</ref> Nielsen also composed the opera ''[[Saul og David]]'' (1901) which offers marvellous chorus scenes. Another important choral work is the cantata ''[[Hymnus amoris]]'' (1896), a beautiful composition for choir and orchestra.<ref name=\"DanishMusic\"/> He is also remembered for the incidental music he wrote for [[Adam Oehlenschläger]]'s play [[Aladdin (Nielsen)|Aladdin]] as well as for the songs he set to music, many of which are still popular in Denmark.
*[[Thomas Laub]] (1852–1927), an organist, was devoted to reintroducing the old Protestant hymn tunes which had been forgotten or altered over the years. He published a number of important works including ''Kirkemelodier'' (Church Melodies) (1890), ''Udvalg af Salme-Melodier i Kirkestil'' (Selected Hymn Tunes in the Church Style) (1896 and 1902), ''Dansk Kirkesang'' (Danish Church Song) (1918) and ''Musik og Kirke'' (Music and Church) (1920). Laub also wrote folk song music and together with Carl Nielsen published ''En Snes danske Viser'' (A Set of Danish Folk Songs) (1917).<ref>[http://www2.kb.dk/elib/mss/dmg/musik/laub/index.htm \"Thomas Laub og salmesangsreformen\"], Provisorietidens musik. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 13 March 2010.</ref>
*[[Rued Langgaard]] (1893–1952), a late-[[Romantic music|Romantic]] composer, was not fully recognized until 16 years after his death. He was inspired by his conviction that music had a spiritual power and was therefore important for mankind. He was a prolific composer, completing over 400 works representing over 50 hours of music. His Symphony No. 1 ''Klippepastoraler'' (Rock Pastorals) is in the late-romantic style, reminiscent of [[Anton Bruckner]] while Symphony No. 10 ''Din Torden-Bolig'' (Your Dwelling of Thunder) is also majestic, but more in the style of [[Richard Strauss]]<ref>[http://www.langgaard.dk/intro/cdvejle.htm \"A listening guide for those new to Langgaard\"].

===Light Classical===
One of the most universally known pieces of Danish music is the ''[[Jalousie 'Tango Tzigane']]'' (1925) composed by [[Jacob Gade]]. It has been used in countless films, such as the classic Danish sex comedy ''[[Zodiac-films|I Tvillingernes tegn]]'' (1975), where it is the centerpiece of a big nude dancing production number set in the 1930s,<ref>[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xkvxcl_nude-ballroom-dancing-in-vintage-danish-porn-movie_sexy Jalousie-scene in  ''I Tvillingernes tegn'']{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and [[Sally Potter]]'s ''[[The Man Who Cried]]'' (2000), with [[Johnny Depp]] playing a gypsy in the 1920s.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206917/soundtrack IMDb soundtrack listing]</ref>

Jazz has been one of Denmark's most important musical developments over the past century. Its origins can be traced to [[Valdemar Eiberg]]'s band in 1923 and their recordings the following year. But it was in 1925, when [[Sam Wooding]] brought his orchestra to Copenhagen that the Danish music scene was properly introduced to the genre. Early Danish jazz was influenced by three classically trained musicians: [[Erik Tuxen]] (1902–1957), who created one the country's first jazz bands, [[Bernhard Christensen]] (1906–2004), a composer of both jazz and classical music, and Sven Møller Kristensen (1909–1991) who wrote lyrics for Christensen as well as a number of books about jazz.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040829013311/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/FactsheetDenmark/JazzPopAndRock/html/chapter01.htm Peter H.

Following [[World War II]], Danish jazz musicians began to split into an older guard, which maintained the style of older [[New Orleans]] jazz, and newer musicians who favored the [[bebop]] style of [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]] that was then emerging in America.

In the early days of rock and beat, some Danish artist quickly adapted this new type of music with success. Bands like [[Peter og Ulvene]], [[Sir Henry and his Butlers]], [[The Beefeaters]] and later on [[Steppeulvene]] (the Steppenwolves), [[Alrune Rod]] and [[Savage Rose]] were among the popular bands in Denmark throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Still, Danish rock and pop music in those days resembled more of German schlager than American or British rock.

The Danish rock scene thrived in the 1970s when groups drew on trends in the United States and Britain. Many consider their style to be Danish although this seems mainly to be due to the language of the songs and the way they fit into the national agenda. The most successful have been [[Gasolin']], [[Shu-Bi-Dua]], [[Sebastian (Danish musician)|Sebastian]], [[Anne Linnet]], [[Gnags]], [[TV-2 (band)|TV-2]], and more recently [[Magtens Korridorer]]. [[Kim Larsen]] who had played with Gasolin' went on to become a very successful solo artist in his own right while Sebastian has composed a number of successful musicals for theatre and film.

The festival has featured many prominent artists (mainly rock), such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Kings of Leon]], [[U2]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Green Day]], and there has also been an emphasis on world music, alternative genres and Danish music at the festival. In 2000, the festival suffered a terrible accident during a [[Pearl Jam]] concert where nine people were crushed by the wild crowds, making security a primary issue of the following festivals. The festival has suffered no further incidents of the kind.<ref>[http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/uk/history/ \"Roskilde Festival throughout the years\"]. Retrieved 15 March 2010</ref>

Traditionally, Danish folk music has relied on a [[fiddle]] and [[accordion]] duo but, unlike its [[Scandinavia]]n neighbours, Danish fiddlers almost always play in groups with few solo performance. Danish bands also tend to feature the [[guitar]] more prominently than the other [[Nordic countries]].<ref name=\"moabmusicfest\">[http://www.moabmusicfest.org/Norse_by_NorseWest_School_Assembly Norse by Norse(West) School Assembly 2009]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>

Fiddle and accordion duos play generally rhythmic [[dance music]], local versions of the [[Nordic folk dance music]]. The oldest variety is called [[pols]], and it is now mostly found on [[Fanø]] with variants such as ''Sønderhoning'' from [[Sønderho]].<ref name=\"moabmusicfest\"/>

The first systematic collection of popular folk songs, some of which go back centuries, was undertaken by the folklore collector [[Evald Tang Kristensen]] (1843–1929). These important sources were then transferred to the Danish Folklore Archives, established in 1904. The popular dance music tradition was continued into the 20th century by musicians such as the violinist [[Evald Thomsen]] (1913–93).<ref name=\"folk music\">[http://www.danishmusic.info/index.php?id=1295 Bendt Viinholt Nielsen, \"Folk Music in Denmark – in brief\"], DanishMusic.info. Retrieved 15 March 2020.</ref>

[[File:Lars Lilholt 1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Lars Lilholt]]]]

Danish traditional music experienced a renaissance when the Anglo-American folk song wave hit Denmark around 1970. Among the prominent soloists, often composing new songs, were [[Sebastian (Danish musician)|Sebastian]], Poul Dissing and [[Niels Hausgaard]]. The successful Lars Lilholt Band led by the violinist [[Lars Lilholt]] combines the folk music tradition with rock. A new and refreshing combination of techno music and medieval ballads has been provided by the group [[Sorten Muld]] since their first recording in 1996.<ref name=\"folk music\"/>

The formation of the [[Danish Folk Council]] to actively promote folk music both at home and abroad has helped raise the profile.<ref>[http://www.folkmusic.dk/view.php3?SectionID=635&ContentID=2512&ParentIDs=/ \"The Danish Folk Council\"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved 15 March 2010.</ref> Curiously, Danish folk music received its biggest boost from the home chart success of Sorten Muld, who used acoustic and electric instruments and [[electronica]] on old songs to create something very contemporary on its best-selling albums. Some of the most well-known artists in recent years include [[Harald Haugaard]] and [[Dreamers' Circus]]. <ref name=\"moabmusicfest\"/>

== Music schools ==
As part of the reform of [[Municipalities of Denmark|Danish municipalities]] in 2008 it was established by law that each of the 98 municipalities runs a music school. The first Danish music schools were formed in the 1930's with inspiration for Germany. From 1991 Musikloven - Law on Music - has had a [https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/r0710.aspx?id=158921#Kap2a chapter on music schools].  According to the law the purposes of the music schools are to develop and support the musical talents and knowledge and to enhance music in the local communities. The primary goal is to engage with children and youth (0-24 years), but activities for adults are also possible. The financing of the music schools are divided among state, municipality and students (or parents of students). 

==Music in everyday life==
Music is an important part of the lives of most Danes. One of the carefully observed traditions is to include music at celebrations at large, including family oriented ones such as wedding parties, birthdays and anniversaries. Indeed, it is not only common to engage one or more musicians for dancing but it is usual for the guests to write songs, normally to well-known traditional tunes, in honour of those to be celebrated.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Livsstil,_sport_og_fritid/Underholdning_og_spil/Forestillinger_og_forlystelser/Fest \"Fest\"], ''Den store Danske''. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 18 March 2010.</ref>

There is also a popular tradition of choir singing. There are hundreds of amateur choirs throughout Denmark, usually specialising in traditional Danish songs or folk music.<ref>[http://www.kor72.dk/dk/om_kor_72/ Lisbeth Gråkjær, \"Om Kor 72\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122055023/http://www.kor72.dk/dk/om_kor_72/ |date=22 January 2010 }} {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 19 March 2010.</ref> 

Denmark has two national anthems, which are widely performed. ''[[Der er et yndigt land]]'' (There is a Lovely Country) is sung loudly and enthusiastically at sporting events and is the most popular. Lyrics are by the Danish poet [[Adam Oehlenschläger]] and music by [[Hans Ernst Krøyer]]. ''[[Kong Kristian stod ved højen mast]]'' (King Christian stood by tow'ring mast), is sung on official occasions when the royal family is represented. Lyrics are by [[Johannes Ewald]] while music was probably written by [[Ditlev Ludwig Rogert]] and can be heard in the final tableau of [[Elves' Hill|Elverhøj]].<ref name=\"netpub\"/><ref>[http://www.ambnewdelhi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/DanishNationalSymbols/TheDanishNationalAnthems/ \"The Danish National Anthems\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132835/http://www.ambnewdelhi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/DanishNationalSymbols/TheDanishNationalAnthems/ |date=19 July 2011 }}, Embassy of Denmark, New Delhi.

[[Denmark]]'s most famous classical composer is [[Carl Nielsen]], especially remembered for his six symphonies, while the [[Royal Danish Ballet]] specializes in the work of Danish choreographer [[August Bournonville]]. Danes have distinguished themselves as [[jazz]] musicians, and the [[Copenhagen Jazz Festival]] has acquired an international reputation. The modern pop and rock scene has produced a few names of note, including [[MØ]], [[Lukas Graham]], [[D-A-D]], [[Tina Dico]], [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]], [[The Raveonettes]], [[Michael Learns to Rock]], [[Volbeat (band)|Volbeat]], [[Alphabeat]], [[Safri Duo]], [[Medina (singer)|Medina]], [[Oh Land]], [[Kashmir (band)|Kashmir]], [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]], [[Outlandish]], and [[Mew (band)|Mew]].

[[File:Codex Runicus - Drømde mik en drøm i nat.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Codex Runicus: Denmark's oldest musical notation]]

In his [[Gesta Danorum]] (c.1200), historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] refers to the power that music had over [[Eric I of Denmark|King Erik the Kind-Hearted]]. In the 13th and early 14th centuries, German [[minnesingers]] such as Tannhäuser and Frauenlob sang in the Danish courts. The [[Codex Runicus]] (c.1300) contains a verse written in runes with a non-rhythmic musical notation. The first line is ''[[Drømde mig en drøm i nat|Drømdæ mik æn drøm i nat]]'' (I Dreamed Me a Dream Last Night). There is also evidence that English monks came to Denmark to sing at a celebration commemorating [[Cnut the Great|St Canute]], who died in 1086. In 1145, [[Lund Cathedral]] received [[Scandinavia]]'s first choir statues, and by 1330 it was one of the larger churches to have an organ installed.<ref name=\"um.dk\"/>

==Historical influences==
[[File:Pratum Spirituale Pedersøn 1620.gif|thumb|right|130px|Pratum Spirituale by [[Mogens Pedersøn]] (1620)]]
The greatest influence on the evolution of music in Denmark has certainly been the monarchy. At the time of his coronation in 1448, [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] engaged a permanent corps of trumpeters, and by 1519 the court had a corps of court singers and an instrumental ensemble as well. The collections of works used by the chapel royal under [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] in the middle of the 16th century were based on Dutch, Italian, French and German masters. [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] spent considerable sums of money on training local musicians and bringing foreign masters to Denmark. [[Mogens Pedersøn]], one of his Danish musicians who had studied in [[Venice]] under [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], became one of Denmark's most important composers of church music. His principal work ''Pratum spirituale'' was a collection of 21 Danish hymns in five-part settings, a mass in five parts, three Latin [[motet]]s and a number of Danish and Latin choral responses. It was published in [[Copenhagen]] in 1620 and is still performed today.<ref>[http://www.naxos.com/composerinfo/Mogens_Pederson/21432.htm \"Pederson, Mogens (1580–1628)\", Naxos.com].

Under the influence of [[Louis XIV of France]], music for the theatre was established in Denmark during the reigns of [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederik III]] and [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] when lavish court ballets were performed. This soon led to opera and the performance of ''Der vereinigte Götterstreit'' composed by Povl Christian Schindler on Christian's birthday in 1689. Although it was a great success, there was little interest in opera after the theatre caught fire a few days later causing 180 deaths.<ref>[http://home.online.no/~cfscheel/brand.htm Louis Bobé, \"Operahusets Brand paa Amalienborg den 19.

His members included [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] and [[Giuseppe Sarti]]. In 1756, Sarti provided the music for the first ''syngespil'' which, in the early 1790s, became established as a popular national genre with ''Høstgildet'' (the Harvest Celebration) and ''Peters Bryllup'' (Peter's Wedding). Both were composed by [[Johann Abraham Peter Schulz]].

[[Christoph Ernst Friedrich Weyse]], from [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], who was a pupil of Schulz, is remembered above all for his Danish songs, hymns and carols, which remain popular to this day.

===The Golden Age===
[[File:Hans Christian Lumbye.gif|thumb|left|130px|[[Hans Christian Lumbye]] (1810–1874)]]
The 19th century saw the emergence of a number of Danish composers inspired by [[Romantic nationalism]]. [[Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann]] (1805–1900) who, apart from opera and ballet music, contributed to song and the piano repertory. From 1843 until his death, he was the organist at the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]]. His works are not only romantic but generally inspired by the old [[Norse mythology|Nordic legends]].<ref>[http://www.ugle.dk/j_p_e_hartmann.html \"Gamle Danske Sange – med melodi af J. P. E. Hartmann\"]. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 11 March 2010.</ref>

[[Hans Christian Lumbye]] (1810–1874) was employed as the first music director at the Copenhagen amusement park [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]] when it opened in 1843. Here he had a platform for presenting a large foreign and Danish repertory, including his many waltzes and [[galop]]s. In 1839, he had heard a Viennese orchestra play music by [[Johann Strauss I|Johann Strauss]], after which he composed in the same style, eventually earning the nickname \"The Strauss of the North\".<ref>[http://www.naxos.com/composerinfo/Hans_Christian_Lumbye/22613.htm \"Lumbye, Hans Christian\"], Naxos.com. Retrieved 11 March 2010</ref> One of his most popular pieces, associated with Tivoli, is ''Champagnegaloppen'' (the [[Champagne Galop]]), which starts with the happy sound of a champagne cork popping. It has been used in several Danish films including ''[[Reptilicus]]'' (1961), and ''[[Champagnegaloppen]]'' (1938).

[[Niels W. Gade]] (1817–1890) participated in the development of ''[[Musikforeningen]]'' (the Music Society) which had been founded in 1836 with the purpose of extending and improving the understanding of classical music. He became its conductor in 1850, and under his management a number of masterpieces of choral music were given their first performance in Denmark, among them Bach's [[St Matthew Passion (Bach)|St. Matthew Passion]] in 1875.<ref>[http://www.danishmusic.info/index.php?id=1300&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=391&cHash=7d33b82007 \"Danish Choral Music\"], DanishMusic.info.

At the conservatory in Copenhagen he helped teach future generations, including [[Edvard Grieg]] and [[Carl Nielsen]]. In the spirit of Romantic nationalism, he composed eight symphonies, a violin concerto, chamber music, organ and piano pieces and a number of large-scale cantatas, among them ''[[Elverskud]]'' (''The Elf King's Daughter''), the most famous Danish work of its kind.<ref>[http://www.eclassical.com/eclassic/eclassical?&composer_id=39&page=find_by_composer_list \"Gade, Niels W.\"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Eclassical.com.

Another major contributor to the Golden Age was [[August Bournonville]] (1805–1879), the renowned [[ballet master]] and [[choreographer]]. From 1830 to 1877, he was the choreographer at the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], for which he created more than 50 ballets admired for their exuberance, lightness, and beauty. He created a style which, although influenced by the Paris ballet, is entirely his own. Bournonville's best-known works are ''[[La Sylphide]]'' (1836), ''[[Napoli (ballet)|Napoli]]'' (1842), ''[[Le Conservatoire]]'' (1849), ''[[The Kermesse in Bruges]]'' (1851) and ''[[A Folk Tale (ballet)|A Folk Tale]]'' (1854). He drew on a number of different composers including [[Holger Simon Paulli]] and [[Niels Gade]]. The ballets are widely performed today, not only in Denmark but worldwide, especially in the [[United States]].<ref>[http://www.bournonville.com/ \"The Bourgonville website.\"] Retrieved 12 March 2010.</ref>

===The Carl Nielsen era===
As a result of problems with Germany, Denmark's attitude during the first half of the 20th century became nationalistic and introverted. The two leading figures, [[Carl Nielsen]] and [[Thomas Laub]] revived interest in the purer music of earlier periods such as the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"netpub\"/>

[[File:Carl Nielsen.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Carl Nielsen]] (1865–1931)]]
*Carl Nielsen (1865–1931), now an internationally recognized composer, was the dominant figure in Danish music and musical life from the end of the 1890s until well into the 20th century. He had grown up in a small village on [[Funen]] but, by performing with folk musicians as a child and as a bugler in the army, he was able to enter the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music|music conservatory]] in Copenhagen in 1884. By the time he took over Gade's role around 1900, Denmark's music scene was firmly established with strong popular interest and support.<ref name=\"DanishMusic\">[http://www.danishmusic.info/index.php?id=1300&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=280&cHash=161612f116 \"Four milestones in Danish music before 1945\"], DanishMusic.info.

Indeed, the success of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Nielsen)|First Symphony]] when it was played in Berlin in 1896 paved the way for his growing reputation. The [[Symphony No. 3 (Nielsen)|Third Symphony]] (1912), which contains wordless vocal solos, was performed in the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] within the first two years. The [[Symphony No. 4 (Nielsen)|Fourth Symphony]] (1916) featuring a battle between two sets of timpani is the one which has been most widely recorded.<ref>[http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/list-of-works/orchestral-music.php \"Carl Nielsen Society – Orchestral Music.\"] Retrieved 12 March 2010.</ref> [[Maskarade]] (1906), a three-act opera based on the play by [[Ludwig Holberg]], is regarded as the Danish national opera.<ref>[http://www.musicweb-international.com/SandH/2008/Jan-Jun08/maskarade2601.htm \"Nielsen, Maskarade : at the Royal Danish Opera, Copenhagen, 26.1.2008\"], MusicWeb-International. Retrieved 13 March 2010.</ref> Nielsen also composed the opera ''[[Saul og David]]'' (1901) which offers marvellous chorus scenes. Another important choral work is the cantata ''[[Hymnus amoris]]'' (1896), a beautiful composition for choir and orchestra.<ref name=\"DanishMusic\"/> He is also remembered for the incidental music he wrote for [[Adam Oehlenschläger]]'s play [[Aladdin (Nielsen)|Aladdin]] as well as for the songs he set to music, many of which are still popular in Denmark.
*[[Thomas Laub]] (1852–1927), an organist, was devoted to reintroducing the old Protestant hymn tunes which had been forgotten or altered over the years. He published a number of important works including ''Kirkemelodier'' (Church Melodies) (1890), ''Udvalg af Salme-Melodier i Kirkestil'' (Selected Hymn Tunes in the Church Style) (1896 and 1902), ''Dansk Kirkesang'' (Danish Church Song) (1918) and ''Musik og Kirke'' (Music and Church) (1920). Laub also wrote folk song music and together with Carl Nielsen published ''En Snes danske Viser'' (A Set of Danish Folk Songs) (1917).<ref>[http://www2.kb.dk/elib/mss/dmg/musik/laub/index.htm \"Thomas Laub og salmesangsreformen\"], Provisorietidens musik. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 13 March 2010.</ref>
*[[Rued Langgaard]] (1893–1952), a late-[[Romantic music|Romantic]] composer, was not fully recognized until 16 years after his death. He was inspired by his conviction that music had a spiritual power and was therefore important for mankind. He was a prolific composer, completing over 400 works representing over 50 hours of music. His Symphony No. 1 ''Klippepastoraler'' (Rock Pastorals) is in the late-romantic style, reminiscent of [[Anton Bruckner]] while Symphony No. 10 ''Din Torden-Bolig'' (Your Dwelling of Thunder) is also majestic, but more in the style of [[Richard Strauss]]<ref>[http://www.langgaard.dk/intro/cdvejle.htm \"A listening guide for those new to Langgaard\"].

===Light Classical===
One of the most universally known pieces of Danish music is the ''[[Jalousie 'Tango Tzigane']]'' (1925) composed by [[Jacob Gade]]. It has been used in countless films, such as the classic Danish sex comedy ''[[Zodiac-films|I Tvillingernes tegn]]'' (1975), where it is the centerpiece of a big nude dancing production number set in the 1930s,<ref>[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xkvxcl_nude-ballroom-dancing-in-vintage-danish-porn-movie_sexy Jalousie-scene in  ''I Tvillingernes tegn'']{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and [[Sally Potter]]'s ''[[The Man Who Cried]]'' (2000), with [[Johnny Depp]] playing a gypsy in the 1920s.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206917/soundtrack IMDb soundtrack listing]</ref>

Jazz has been one of Denmark's most important musical developments over the past century. Its origins can be traced to [[Valdemar Eiberg]]'s band in 1923 and their recordings the following year. But it was in 1925, when [[Sam Wooding]] brought his orchestra to Copenhagen that the Danish music scene was properly introduced to the genre. Early Danish jazz was influenced by three classically trained musicians: [[Erik Tuxen]] (1902–1957), who created one the country's first jazz bands, [[Bernhard Christensen]] (1906–2004), a composer of both jazz and classical music, and Sven Møller Kristensen (1909–1991) who wrote lyrics for Christensen as well as a number of books about jazz.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040829013311/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/FactsheetDenmark/JazzPopAndRock/html/chapter01.htm Peter H.

Indeed, the period became known as \"The Golden Age of Jazz\" as the number of concerts in hotels and restaurants increased and the number of recordings rose from about 180 in 1935–1939 to over 650 from 1940 to 1945.<ref>[http://dvm.nu/hierarchy/theme/jazz/?lang=en&?format=medium&type=theme Danish Golden Age Jazz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212144833/http://dvm.nu/hierarchy/theme/jazz/?lang=en&%3Fformat=medium&type=theme |date=12 February 2013 }}.

Following [[World War II]], Danish jazz musicians began to split into an older guard, which maintained the style of older [[New Orleans]] jazz, and newer musicians who favored the [[bebop]] style of [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]] that was then emerging in America.

In the early days of rock and beat, some Danish artist quickly adapted this new type of music with success. Bands like [[Peter og Ulvene]], [[Sir Henry and his Butlers]], [[The Beefeaters]] and later on [[Steppeulvene]] (the Steppenwolves), [[Alrune Rod]] and [[Savage Rose]] were among the popular bands in Denmark throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Still, Danish rock and pop music in those days resembled more of German schlager than American or British rock.

The Danish rock scene thrived in the 1970s when groups drew on trends in the United States and Britain. Many consider their style to be Danish although this seems mainly to be due to the language of the songs and the way they fit into the national agenda. The most successful have been [[Gasolin']], [[Shu-Bi-Dua]], [[Sebastian (Danish musician)|Sebastian]], [[Anne Linnet]], [[Gnags]], [[TV-2 (band)|TV-2]], and more recently [[Magtens Korridorer]]. [[Kim Larsen]] who had played with Gasolin' went on to become a very successful solo artist in his own right while Sebastian has composed a number of successful musicals for theatre and film.

Traditionally, Danish folk music has relied on a [[fiddle]] and [[accordion]] duo but, unlike its [[Scandinavia]]n neighbours, Danish fiddlers almost always play in groups with few solo performance. Danish bands also tend to feature the [[guitar]] more prominently than the other [[Nordic countries]].<ref name=\"moabmusicfest\">[http://www.moabmusicfest.org/Norse_by_NorseWest_School_Assembly Norse by Norse(West) School Assembly 2009]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>

Fiddle and accordion duos play generally rhythmic [[dance music]], local versions of the [[Nordic folk dance music]]. The oldest variety is called [[pols]], and it is now mostly found on [[Fanø]] with variants such as ''Sønderhoning'' from [[Sønderho]].<ref name=\"moabmusicfest\"/>

The first systematic collection of popular folk songs, some of which go back centuries, was undertaken by the folklore collector [[Evald Tang Kristensen]] (1843–1929). These important sources were then transferred to the Danish Folklore Archives, established in 1904. The popular dance music tradition was continued into the 20th century by musicians such as the violinist [[Evald Thomsen]] (1913–93).<ref name=\"folk music\">[http://www.danishmusic.info/index.php?id=1295 Bendt Viinholt Nielsen, \"Folk Music in Denmark – in brief\"], DanishMusic.info. Retrieved 15 March 2020.</ref>

[[File:Lars Lilholt 1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Lars Lilholt]]]]

Danish traditional music experienced a renaissance when the Anglo-American folk song wave hit Denmark around 1970. Among the prominent soloists, often composing new songs, were [[Sebastian (Danish musician)|Sebastian]], Poul Dissing and [[Niels Hausgaard]]. The successful Lars Lilholt Band led by the violinist [[Lars Lilholt]] combines the folk music tradition with rock. A new and refreshing combination of techno music and medieval ballads has been provided by the group [[Sorten Muld]] since their first recording in 1996.<ref name=\"folk music\"/>

The formation of the [[Danish Folk Council]] to actively promote folk music both at home and abroad has helped raise the profile.<ref>[http://www.folkmusic.dk/view.php3?SectionID=635&ContentID=2512&ParentIDs=/ \"The Danish Folk Council\"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved 15 March 2010.</ref> Curiously, Danish folk music received its biggest boost from the home chart success of Sorten Muld, who used acoustic and electric instruments and [[electronica]] on old songs to create something very contemporary on its best-selling albums. Some of the most well-known artists in recent years include [[Harald Haugaard]] and [[Dreamers' Circus]]. <ref name=\"moabmusicfest\"/>

== Music schools ==
As part of the reform of [[Municipalities of Denmark|Danish municipalities]] in 2008 it was established by law that each of the 98 municipalities runs a music school. The first Danish music schools were formed in the 1930's with inspiration for Germany. From 1991 Musikloven - Law on Music - has had a [https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/r0710.aspx?id=158921#Kap2a chapter on music schools].  According to the law the purposes of the music schools are to develop and support the musical talents and knowledge and to enhance music in the local communities. The primary goal is to engage with children and youth (0-24 years), but activities for adults are also possible. The financing of the music schools are divided among state, municipality and students (or parents of students). 

==Music in everyday life==
Music is an important part of the lives of most Danes. One of the carefully observed traditions is to include music at celebrations at large, including family oriented ones such as wedding parties, birthdays and anniversaries. Indeed, it is not only common to engage one or more musicians for dancing but it is usual for the guests to write songs, normally to well-known traditional tunes, in honour of those to be celebrated.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Livsstil,_sport_og_fritid/Underholdning_og_spil/Forestillinger_og_forlystelser/Fest \"Fest\"], ''Den store Danske''. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 18 March 2010.</ref>

There is also a popular tradition of choir singing. There are hundreds of amateur choirs throughout Denmark, usually specialising in traditional Danish songs or folk music.<ref>[http://www.kor72.dk/dk/om_kor_72/ Lisbeth Gråkjær, \"Om Kor 72\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122055023/http://www.kor72.dk/dk/om_kor_72/ |date=22 January 2010 }} {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 19 March 2010.</ref> 

Denmark has two national anthems, which are widely performed. ''[[Der er et yndigt land]]'' (There is a Lovely Country) is sung loudly and enthusiastically at sporting events and is the most popular. Lyrics are by the Danish poet [[Adam Oehlenschläger]] and music by [[Hans Ernst Krøyer]]. ''[[Kong Kristian stod ved højen mast]]'' (King Christian stood by tow'ring mast), is sung on official occasions when the royal family is represented. Lyrics are by [[Johannes Ewald]] while music was probably written by [[Ditlev Ludwig Rogert]] and can be heard in the final tableau of [[Elves' Hill|Elverhøj]].<ref name=\"netpub\"/><ref>[http://www.ambnewdelhi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/DanishNationalSymbols/TheDanishNationalAnthems/ \"The Danish National Anthems\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132835/http://www.ambnewdelhi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/DanishNationalSymbols/TheDanishNationalAnthems/ |date=19 July 2011 }}, Embassy of Denmark, New Delhi.

A 2007–2008 [[Gallup Poll]] surveyed individuals in 128 countries. This poll queried whether the respondent knew of global warming. Those who had a basic concept of global warming didn’t necessarily connect it to human activities, revealing that knowledge of global warming and the knowledge that it’s human-induced are two separate things. Over a third of the world's population were unaware of global warming. [[Developing country|Developing countrie]]<nowiki/>s have less awareness than [[Developed country|developed]], and Africa the least aware. Of those aware, residents of [[Latin America]] and developed countries in Asia led the belief that climate change is a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] led in the opposite.

The first major worldwide poll, conducted by Gallup in 2008–2009 in 127 countries, found that some 62% of people worldwide said they knew about global warming. In the [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] of North America, Europe, and Japan, 67% or more knew about it (97% in the U.S., 99% in Japan); in [[Developing country|developing countries]], especially in Africa, fewer than a quarter knew about it, although many had noticed local weather changes. Among those who knew about global warming, there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|title=Awareness, Opinions about Global Warming Vary Worldwide| last=Pelham | first=Brett | publisher=Gallup |year=2009 | accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

Adults in Asia, with the exception of those in developed countries, are the least likely to perceive global warming as a threat.

These variations pose a challenge to [[policymaker]]s, as different countries travel down different paths, making an agreement over an appropriate response difficult. While Africa may be the most vulnerable and produce the least amount of greenhouse gases, they are the most ambivalent. The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies. People in China, Russia, and the United States, while varying in awareness, have expressed a similar proportion of aware individuals concerned. Similarly, those aware in India are likely to be concerned, but India faces challenges spreading this concern to the remaining population as its energy needs increase over the next decade.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124595/Top-Emitting-Countries-Differ-Climate-Change-Threat.aspx|title=Top-Emitting Countries Differ on Climate Change Threat|first1=Anita|last1=Pugliese|first2=Julie|last2=Ray|date=7 December 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

==== United States====
{{further|Climate change in the United States}}
In 2009 [[Yale University]] conducted a study identifying global warming's \"Six Americas\". The report identifies six audiences with different opinions about global warming: The alarmed (18%), the concerned (33%), the cautious (19%), the disengaged (12%), the doubtful (11%) and the dismissive (7%). The alarmed and concerned make out the largest percentage and think something should be done about global warming. The cautious, disengaged and doubtful are less likely to take action. The dismissive are convinced global warming is not happening. These audiences can be used to define the best approaches for environmental action. The theory of the 'Six Americas' is also used for marketing purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-2009/|title=Global Warming's Six Americas 2009|website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref>

In a January 2013 survey, Pew found that 69% of Americans say there is solid evidence that the Earth's average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130515145510/http://www.pewresearch.org/2013/04/02/climate-change-key-data-points-from-pew-research/ Climate Change: Key Data Points from Pew Research | Pew Research Center]</ref>

A Gallup poll in 2014 concluded that 51 percent of Americans were a little or not at all worried about climate change, 24 percent a great deal and 25 percent a fair amount.<ref name=\"Riffkin\">{{cite news|last1=Riffkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Climate Change Not a Top Worry in U.S.|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/167843/climate-change-not-top-worry.aspx|accessdate=21 July 2014|publisher=Gallup|date=12 March 2014}}</ref> 

In 2015, 32 percent or Americans were worried about global warming as a great deal, 37 percent in 2016, and 45 percent in 2017.

===Education===
{{main|Climate change education}}
In countries varying in awareness, an educational gap translates into a gap in awareness.<ref name=gap>[http://www.cultureuniversity.com/closing-massive-gaps-between-culture-awareness-education-action/ Closing the Massive Gaps Between Culture Awareness, Education, and Action]</ref> However an increase in awareness does not always result in an increase in perceived threat. In China, 98% of those who have completed four years or more of college education reported knowing something or a great deal of climate change while only 63% of those who have completed nine years of education reported the same. Despite the differences in awareness in China, all groups perceive a low level of threat from global warming. In India, those who are educated are more likely to be aware, and those who are educated there are far more likely to report perceiving global warming as a threat than those who are not educated.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" /> In Europe, individuals who have attained a higher level of education perceive climate change as a serious threat. There is also a strong association between education and Internet use. Europeans who use the Internet more are more likely to perceive climate change as a serious threat.<ref name=\"Eurobarometer2009p13\" /> However, a survey of American adults found \"little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens{{clarify|date=August 2016}} on what science knows about climate change.

===Demographics===

Residential [[demographics]] affect perceptions of global warming. In China, 77% of those who live in urban areas are aware of global warming compared to 52% in rural areas. This trend is mirrored in India with 49% to 29% awareness, respectively.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" />

Of the countries where at least half the population is aware of global warming, those with the majority who believe that global warming is due to human activities have a greater national GDP per unit energy—or, a greater energy efficiency.<ref name=\"Pelham2009Energy\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117835/Views-Global-Warming-Relate-Energy-Efficiency.aspx|title=Views on Global Warming Relate to Energy Efficiency|first=Brett W.|last=Pelham|date=24 April 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

In Europe, individuals under fifty-five are more likely to perceive both \"poverty, lack of food and drinking water\" and climate change as a serious threat than individuals over fifty-five. Male individuals are more likely to perceive climate change as a threat than female individuals. Managers, white-collar workers, and students are more likely to perceive climate change as a greater threat than house persons and retired individuals.<ref name=\"Eurobarometer2009p13\">{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=13}}</ref>

===Political identification===
In the United States, support for environmental protection was relatively [[non-partisan]] in the twentieth century. Republican [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established national parks whereas Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] established the [[Soil Conservation Service]]. Republican [[Richard Nixon]] was instrumental in founding the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and tried to install a third pillar of [[NATO]] dealing with environmental challenges such as acid rain and the greenhouse effect. [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] was Nixon's NATO delegate for the topic.<ref name=\"Hüne\">Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), Kai F. Hünemörder, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 ISBN</ref>

This non-partisanship began to erode during the 1980s, when the [[Reagan administration]] described environmental protection as an economic burden. Views over global warming began to seriously diverge between Democrats and Republicans during the negotiations that led up to the creation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998. In a 2008 Gallup poll of the American public, 76% of Democrats and only 41% of Republicans said that they believed global warming was already happening. The opinions of the [[political elite]]s, such as members of Congress, tends to be even more polarized.<ref name=\"Dunlap2008RepublicanDemocraticGap\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/107569/ClimateChange-Views-RepublicanDemocratic-Gaps-Expand.aspx|title=Climate-Change Views: Republican-Democratic Gaps Expand|first=Riley E.|last=Dunlap|date=29 May 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

Public opinion on climate change can be influenced by who people vote for. Although media coverage influences how some view climate change, research shows that voting behavior influences climate change skepticism. This shows that people’s views on climate change tend to align with the people they voted for.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCrea |first1=Rod |last2=Leviston |first2=Zoe |last3=Walker |first3=Iain A. |title=Climate Change Skepticism and Voting Behavior |journal=Environment and Behavior |date=27 July 2016 |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=1309–1334 |doi=10.1177/0013916515599571}}</ref> 

In Europe, opinion is not strongly divided among [[Left-right politics|left and right parties]]. Although European political parties on the left, including [[Green parties]], strongly support measures to address climate change, conservative European political parties maintain similar sentiments, most notably in Western and Northern Europe. For example, [[Margaret Thatcher]], never a friend of the coal mining industry, was a strong supporter of an active climate protection policy and was instrumental in founding the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the British [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]].<ref>[https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/04/thatchers-climate-change-greatest-hits How Margaret Thatcher Made the Conservative Case for Climate Action], James West, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', Mon Apr. 8, 2013</ref> Some speeches, as to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107346 1988 Sep 27 Tu Margaret Thatcher Speech to the Royal Society]</ref> and to the UN general assembly in November 1989 helped to put climate change, acid rain, and general pollution in the British mainstream. After her career, however, Thatcher was less of a climate activist, as she called climate action a \"marvelous excuse for supranational socialism\", and called Al Gore an \"apocalyptic hyperbole\".<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/04/08/margaret_thatcher_s_environmental_record_she_was_a_climate_hawk.html An Inconvenient Truth About Margaret Thatcher: She Was a Climate Hawk], Will Oremus, [[Slate (magazine)]] April 8, 2013</ref> France's center-right [[Jacques Chirac|President Chirac]] pushed key environmental and climate change policies in France in 2005–2007. Conservative German administrations (under the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]]) in the past two decades{{when|date=March 2019}} have supported [[European Union]] climate change initiatives; concern about [[forest dieback]] and [[acid rain]] regulation were initiated under Kohl's archconservative minister of the interior [[Friedrich Zimmermann]]. In the period after former President George W. Bush announced that the United States was leaving the [[Kyoto Treaty]], European media and newspapers on both the left and right criticized the move. The conservative Spanish ''[[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]]'', the ''[[Irish Times]]'', the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', the Danish ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', and the Greek ''[[Kathimerini]]'' all condemned the Bush administration's decision, as did left-leaning newspapers.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\">{{cite journal | first1= M.

The shared sentiments between the political left and right on climate change further illustrate the divide in perception between the United States and Europe on climate change. As an example, conservative German Prime Ministers [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[Angela Merkel]] have differed with other parties in Germany only on how to meet emissions reduction targets, not whether or not to establish or fulfill them.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" />

A 2017 study found that those who changed their opinion on climate change between 2010 and 2014 did so \"primarily to align better with those who shared their party identification and political ideology. This conforms with the theory of motivated reasoning: Evidence consistent with prior beliefs is viewed as strong and, on politically salient issues, people strive to bring their opinions into conformance with those who share their political identity\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|last2=Lewis|first2=Gregory B.|last3=Feng|first3=Bo|date=2017-03-13|title=What Causes People to Change Their Opinion about Climate Change?|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=0|issue=4|pages=883–896|doi=10.1080/24694452.2016.1270193|issn=2469-4452|url=https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/geosciences_facpub/22}}</ref> Furthermore, a 2019 study examining the growing skepticism of climate change among American Republicans argues that persuasion and rhetoric from party elites play a critical role in public opinion formation, and that these elite cues are propagated through mainstream and social media sources.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Merkley |first1=Eric |last2=Stecula |first2=Dominik |title=Party Cues in the News: Elite Opinion Leadership and Climate Skepticism |journal=Toronto Political Behaviour Workshop |date=November 8-9, 2019 |page=1 |url=https://rubenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/merkley-stecula.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref>

Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, compares the different public reactions towards [[ozone depletion and global warming]].<ref name = Ungar/> The public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events which could be used as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger.<ref name = Ungar/> Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of two to three degrees Celsius over several decades do not respond with people, e.g. in North America, that experience similar swings during a single day.<ref name = Ungar/> As scientists define global warming a problem of the future, a liability in \"[[attention economy]]\", pessimistic outlooks in general and assigning extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed (compare [[Gore effect]]) in the public arena.<ref>Sheldon Ungar Climatic Change February 1999, Volume 41, Issue 2, pp. 133–150 Is Strange Weather in the Air? A Study of U.S. National Network News Coverage of Extreme Weather Events</ref> While the [[greenhouse effect]] ''[[per se (Latin)|per se]]'' is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the [[ozone shield]] and other metaphors about the ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties. But the metaphors used in the discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) reflected better with lay people and their concerns.

{{\"|The idea of rays penetrating a damaged \"shield\" meshes nicely with abiding and resonant cultural motifs, including \"Hollywood affinities\". These range from the shields on the Starship Enterprise to Star Wars, ... It is these pre-scientific bridging metaphors built around the penetration of a deteriorating shield that render the ozone problem relatively simple. That the ozone threat can be linked with Darth Vader means that it is encompassed in common sense understandings that are deeply ingrained and widely shared.

The chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) regulation attempts of the end of the 1980s profited from those easy-to-grasp metaphors and the personal risk assumptions taken from them. As well the fate of celebrities like President [[Ronald Reagan]], which had skin cancer removal in 1985 and 1987, was of high importance.

The 2006 BBC World Service poll found that when asked about various policy options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – tax incentives for alternative energy research and development, installment of taxes to encourage energy conservation, and reliance on nuclear energy to reduce fossil fuels. The majority of those asked felt that tax incentives were the path of action that they preferred.

As of May 2016, polls have repeatedly found that a majority of Republican voters, particularly young ones, believe the government should take action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/science/donald-trump-global-warming-energy-policy-kevin-cramer.html | work=The New York Times | first=Erica | last=Goode | title=What Are Donald Trump's Views on Climate Change?

A [[scientific consensus]] on climate change exists, as recognized by national [[Academy of Sciences|academies of science]] and other authoritative bodies.<ref name=\"JointScienceAcademies2005\" />  The opinion gap between scientists and the public in 2009 stands at 84% to 49% that global temperatures are increasing because of human-activity.<ref name=\"PewResearchCenter2009PublicPraiseScientistsFault\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/528.pdf|title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media|date=9 Jun 2009|pages=5, 55|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> However, more recent research has identified substantial geographical variation in the public's understanding of the scientific consensus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Baobao|last2=van der Linden|first2=Sander|last3=Mildenberger|first3=Matto|last4=Marlon|first4=Jennifer|last5=Howe|first5=Peter|last6=Leiserowitz|first6=Anthony|title=Experimental effects of climate messages vary geographically|journal=Nature Climate Change|date=2018|volume=21|issue=5|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0122-0|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/278735|bibcode=2018NatCC...8..370Z}}</ref>

===Economics===
{{See also|Economics of global warming}}

Economic debates weigh the benefits of limiting industrial emissions of mitigating global warming against the costs that such changes would entail. While there is a greater amount of agreement over whether global warming exists, there is less agreement over the appropriate response. Electric or petroleum distribution may be government owned or utilities may be regulated by government. The government owned or regulated utilities may, or may not choose to make lower emissions a priority over economics, in unregulated counties industry follows economic priorities. An example of the economic priority is [[Royal Dutch Shell#Environmental pollution|Royal Dutch Shell PLC]] reporting CO2 emissions of 81 million metric tonnes in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Dutch Shell PLC – AMEE |url=https://www.amee.com/companies/006723599-royal-dutch-shell-plc#/tabs/environmental}}</ref>

===Politics===
{{See also|Politics of global warming}}

Public opinion impacts on the issue of climate change because governments need willing electorates and citizens in order to implement policies that address climate change. Further, when climate change perceptions differ between the populace and governments, the communication of risk to the public becomes problematic. Finally, a public that is not aware of the issues surrounding climate change may resist or oppose climate change policies, which is of considerable importance to politicians and state leaders.<ref name=\"LorenzoniAndPidgeon2006\">{{cite journal | pages = 73–95 | issue = 1–2 | doi = 10.1007/s10584-006-9072-z | issn = 1573-1480 | format = Full free text | url = http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/lev/ESSgc/lorenzoniPclimchng06.pdf | volume = 77 | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | first2 = N.

A 2009 Eurobarometer survey found that, on the average, Europeans rate climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world today, between \"poverty, the lack of food and drinking water\" and \"a major global economic downturn.\" 87% of Europeans consider climate change to be a \"serious\" or \"very serious\" problem, while 10% \"do not consider it a serious problem.\" However, the proportion who believe it to be a problem has dropped in the period 2008/9 when the surveys were conducted.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=15}}</ref> While the small majority believe climate change is a serious threat, 55% percent believe the EU is doing too little and 30% believe the EU is going the right amount.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=21}}</ref> As a result of European Union climate change perceptions, \"climate change is an issue that has reached such a level of social and political acceptability across the EU that it enables (indeed, forces) the EU Commission and national leaders to produce all sorts of measures, including taxes.\"<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" /> Despite the persistent high level of personal involvement of European citizens, found in another Eurobarometer survey in 2011,<ref>[[European Commission]], [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_372_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 372 – Climate Change] Brussels, June 2011</ref> EU leaders have begun to downscale climate policy issues on the political agenda since the beginning of the Eurozone crisis.<ref>Oliver Geden (2012), [http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2012_RP01_lpt_prt.pdf#page=19 The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it], SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01</ref>

Although public opinion may not be the only factor influencing renewable energy policies, it is a key catalyst.

A 2007–2008 [[Gallup Poll]] surveyed individuals in 128 countries. This poll queried whether the respondent knew of global warming. Those who had a basic concept of global warming didn’t necessarily connect it to human activities, revealing that knowledge of global warming and the knowledge that it’s human-induced are two separate things. Over a third of the world's population were unaware of global warming. [[Developing country|Developing countrie]]<nowiki/>s have less awareness than [[Developed country|developed]], and Africa the least aware. Of those aware, residents of [[Latin America]] and developed countries in Asia led the belief that climate change is a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] led in the opposite. Opinion within the United Kingdom was divided.<ref name=\"Pelham2009Awareness\">{{Cite web|first=Brett|last=Pelham|title=Awareness, Opinions About Global Warming Vary Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization]]|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

The first major worldwide poll, conducted by Gallup in 2008–2009 in 127 countries, found that some 62% of people worldwide said they knew about global warming. In the [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] of North America, Europe, and Japan, 67% or more knew about it (97% in the U.S., 99% in Japan); in [[Developing country|developing countries]], especially in Africa, fewer than a quarter knew about it, although many had noticed local weather changes. Among those who knew about global warming, there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|title=Awareness, Opinions about Global Warming Vary Worldwide| last=Pelham | first=Brett | publisher=Gallup |year=2009 | accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

These variations pose a challenge to [[policymaker]]s, as different countries travel down different paths, making an agreement over an appropriate response difficult. While Africa may be the most vulnerable and produce the least amount of greenhouse gases, they are the most ambivalent. The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies. People in China, Russia, and the United States, while varying in awareness, have expressed a similar proportion of aware individuals concerned. Similarly, those aware in India are likely to be concerned, but India faces challenges spreading this concern to the remaining population as its energy needs increase over the next decade.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124595/Top-Emitting-Countries-Differ-Climate-Change-Threat.aspx|title=Top-Emitting Countries Differ on Climate Change Threat|first1=Anita|last1=Pugliese|first2=Julie|last2=Ray|date=7 December 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

A 2010 survey of 14 [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] found that [[Climate change skeptics|skepticism]] about the danger of global warming was highest in Australia, Norway, New Zealand and the United States, in that order, correlating positively with [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|per capita emissions of carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tranter|first1=Bruce|last2=Booth|first2=Kate|title=Scepticism in a Changing Climate: A Cross-national Study|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=July 2015|volume=33|pages=54–164|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.05.003}}</ref>

==== United States====
{{further|Climate change in the United States}}
In 2009 [[Yale University]] conducted a study identifying global warming's \"Six Americas\". The report identifies six audiences with different opinions about global warming: The alarmed (18%), the concerned (33%), the cautious (19%), the disengaged (12%), the doubtful (11%) and the dismissive (7%). The alarmed and concerned make out the largest percentage and think something should be done about global warming. The cautious, disengaged and doubtful are less likely to take action. The dismissive are convinced global warming is not happening. These audiences can be used to define the best approaches for environmental action. The theory of the 'Six Americas' is also used for marketing purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-2009/|title=Global Warming's Six Americas 2009|website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref>

In a January 2013 survey, Pew found that 69% of Americans say there is solid evidence that the Earth's average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130515145510/http://www.pewresearch.org/2013/04/02/climate-change-key-data-points-from-pew-research/ Climate Change: Key Data Points from Pew Research | Pew Research Center]</ref>

A Gallup poll in 2014 concluded that 51 percent of Americans were a little or not at all worried about climate change, 24 percent a great deal and 25 percent a fair amount.<ref name=\"Riffkin\">{{cite news|last1=Riffkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Climate Change Not a Top Worry in U.S.|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/167843/climate-change-not-top-worry.aspx|accessdate=21 July 2014|publisher=Gallup|date=12 March 2014}}</ref> 

In 2015, 32 percent or Americans were worried about global warming as a great deal, 37 percent in 2016, and 45 percent in 2017. A poll taken in 2016 shows that 52% of Americans believe climate change to be [[causes of global warming|caused by human activity]], while 34% state it is caused by natural changes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/?est=happening&type=value&geo=county|title=Yale Climate Opinion Maps - U.S. 2016 - Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|work=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Data is increasingly showing that 62 percent of Americans believe that the [[effects of global warming]] are happening now in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/206030/global-warming-concern-three-decade-high.aspx|title=Global Warming Concern at Three-Decade High in U.S.|last=Inc.|first=Gallup|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-us}}</ref>

===Education===
{{main|Climate change education}}
In countries varying in awareness, an educational gap translates into a gap in awareness.<ref name=gap>[http://www.cultureuniversity.com/closing-massive-gaps-between-culture-awareness-education-action/ Closing the Massive Gaps Between Culture Awareness, Education, and Action]</ref> However an increase in awareness does not always result in an increase in perceived threat. In China, 98% of those who have completed four years or more of college education reported knowing something or a great deal of climate change while only 63% of those who have completed nine years of education reported the same. Despite the differences in awareness in China, all groups perceive a low level of threat from global warming. In India, those who are educated are more likely to be aware, and those who are educated there are far more likely to report perceiving global warming as a threat than those who are not educated.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" /> In Europe, individuals who have attained a higher level of education perceive climate change as a serious threat. There is also a strong association between education and Internet use. Europeans who use the Internet more are more likely to perceive climate change as a serious threat.<ref name=\"Eurobarometer2009p13\" /> However, a survey of American adults found \"little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens{{clarify|date=August 2016}} on what science knows about climate change.

===Demographics===

Residential [[demographics]] affect perceptions of global warming. In China, 77% of those who live in urban areas are aware of global warming compared to 52% in rural areas. This trend is mirrored in India with 49% to 29% awareness, respectively.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" />

Of the countries where at least half the population is aware of global warming, those with the majority who believe that global warming is due to human activities have a greater national GDP per unit energy—or, a greater energy efficiency.<ref name=\"Pelham2009Energy\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117835/Views-Global-Warming-Relate-Energy-Efficiency.aspx|title=Views on Global Warming Relate to Energy Efficiency|first=Brett W.|last=Pelham|date=24 April 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

In Europe, individuals under fifty-five are more likely to perceive both \"poverty, lack of food and drinking water\" and climate change as a serious threat than individuals over fifty-five. Male individuals are more likely to perceive climate change as a threat than female individuals. Managers, white-collar workers, and students are more likely to perceive climate change as a greater threat than house persons and retired individuals.<ref name=\"Eurobarometer2009p13\">{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=13}}</ref>

In the United States, conservative white men are more likely than other Americans to deny climate change.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McCright|first1=Aaron M.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Riley E.|title=Cool dudes: The denial of climate change among conservative white males in the United States|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=October 2011|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1163–72|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.06.003}}</ref>

===Political identification===
In the United States, support for environmental protection was relatively [[non-partisan]] in the twentieth century. Republican [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established national parks whereas Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] established the [[Soil Conservation Service]]. Republican [[Richard Nixon]] was instrumental in founding the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and tried to install a third pillar of [[NATO]] dealing with environmental challenges such as acid rain and the greenhouse effect. [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] was Nixon's NATO delegate for the topic.<ref name=\"Hüne\">Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), Kai F. Hünemörder, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 ISBN</ref>

This non-partisanship began to erode during the 1980s, when the [[Reagan administration]] described environmental protection as an economic burden. Views over global warming began to seriously diverge between Democrats and Republicans during the negotiations that led up to the creation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998. In a 2008 Gallup poll of the American public, 76% of Democrats and only 41% of Republicans said that they believed global warming was already happening. The opinions of the [[political elite]]s, such as members of Congress, tends to be even more polarized.<ref name=\"Dunlap2008RepublicanDemocraticGap\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/107569/ClimateChange-Views-RepublicanDemocratic-Gaps-Expand.aspx|title=Climate-Change Views: Republican-Democratic Gaps Expand|first=Riley E.|last=Dunlap|date=29 May 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

Public opinion on climate change can be influenced by who people vote for. Although media coverage influences how some view climate change, research shows that voting behavior influences climate change skepticism. This shows that people’s views on climate change tend to align with the people they voted for.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCrea |first1=Rod |last2=Leviston |first2=Zoe |last3=Walker |first3=Iain A. |title=Climate Change Skepticism and Voting Behavior |journal=Environment and Behavior |date=27 July 2016 |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=1309–1334 |doi=10.1177/0013916515599571}}</ref> 

In Europe, opinion is not strongly divided among [[Left-right politics|left and right parties]]. Although European political parties on the left, including [[Green parties]], strongly support measures to address climate change, conservative European political parties maintain similar sentiments, most notably in Western and Northern Europe. For example, [[Margaret Thatcher]], never a friend of the coal mining industry, was a strong supporter of an active climate protection policy and was instrumental in founding the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the British [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]].<ref>[https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/04/thatchers-climate-change-greatest-hits How Margaret Thatcher Made the Conservative Case for Climate Action], James West, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', Mon Apr. 8, 2013</ref> Some speeches, as to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107346 1988 Sep 27 Tu Margaret Thatcher Speech to the Royal Society]</ref> and to the UN general assembly in November 1989 helped to put climate change, acid rain, and general pollution in the British mainstream. After her career, however, Thatcher was less of a climate activist, as she called climate action a \"marvelous excuse for supranational socialism\", and called Al Gore an \"apocalyptic hyperbole\".<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/04/08/margaret_thatcher_s_environmental_record_she_was_a_climate_hawk.html An Inconvenient Truth About Margaret Thatcher: She Was a Climate Hawk], Will Oremus, [[Slate (magazine)]] April 8, 2013</ref> France's center-right [[Jacques Chirac|President Chirac]] pushed key environmental and climate change policies in France in 2005–2007. Conservative German administrations (under the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]]) in the past two decades{{when|date=March 2019}} have supported [[European Union]] climate change initiatives; concern about [[forest dieback]] and [[acid rain]] regulation were initiated under Kohl's archconservative minister of the interior [[Friedrich Zimmermann]]. In the period after former President George W. Bush announced that the United States was leaving the [[Kyoto Treaty]], European media and newspapers on both the left and right criticized the move. The conservative Spanish ''[[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]]'', the ''[[Irish Times]]'', the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', the Danish ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', and the Greek ''[[Kathimerini]]'' all condemned the Bush administration's decision, as did left-leaning newspapers.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\">{{cite journal | first1= M.

The shared sentiments between the political left and right on climate change further illustrate the divide in perception between the United States and Europe on climate change. As an example, conservative German Prime Ministers [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[Angela Merkel]] have differed with other parties in Germany only on how to meet emissions reduction targets, not whether or not to establish or fulfill them.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" />

A 2017 study found that those who changed their opinion on climate change between 2010 and 2014 did so \"primarily to align better with those who shared their party identification and political ideology. This conforms with the theory of motivated reasoning: Evidence consistent with prior beliefs is viewed as strong and, on politically salient issues, people strive to bring their opinions into conformance with those who share their political identity\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|last2=Lewis|first2=Gregory B.|last3=Feng|first3=Bo|date=2017-03-13|title=What Causes People to Change Their Opinion about Climate Change?|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=0|issue=4|pages=883–896|doi=10.1080/24694452.2016.1270193|issn=2469-4452|url=https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/geosciences_facpub/22}}</ref> Furthermore, a 2019 study examining the growing skepticism of climate change among American Republicans argues that persuasion and rhetoric from party elites play a critical role in public opinion formation, and that these elite cues are propagated through mainstream and social media sources.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Merkley |first1=Eric |last2=Stecula |first2=Dominik |title=Party Cues in the News: Elite Opinion Leadership and Climate Skepticism |journal=Toronto Political Behaviour Workshop |date=November 8-9, 2019 |page=1 |url=https://rubenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/merkley-stecula.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref>

For those who care about the environment and want change are not happy about some policies, for example the support of the cap and trade policy but very few people are willing to pay more than 15 dollars per month for a program that is supposed to help the environment.

Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, compares the different public reactions towards [[ozone depletion and global warming]].<ref name = Ungar/> The public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events which could be used as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger.<ref name = Ungar/> Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of two to three degrees Celsius over several decades do not respond with people, e.g. in North America, that experience similar swings during a single day.<ref name = Ungar/> As scientists define global warming a problem of the future, a liability in \"[[attention economy]]\", pessimistic outlooks in general and assigning extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed (compare [[Gore effect]]) in the public arena.<ref>Sheldon Ungar Climatic Change February 1999, Volume 41, Issue 2, pp. 133–150 Is Strange Weather in the Air? A Study of U.S. National Network News Coverage of Extreme Weather Events</ref> While the [[greenhouse effect]] ''[[per se (Latin)|per se]]'' is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the [[ozone shield]] and other metaphors about the ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties. But the metaphors used in the discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) reflected better with lay people and their concerns.

{{\"|The idea of rays penetrating a damaged \"shield\" meshes nicely with abiding and resonant cultural motifs, including \"Hollywood affinities\". These range from the shields on the Starship Enterprise to Star Wars, ... It is these pre-scientific bridging metaphors built around the penetration of a deteriorating shield that render the ozone problem relatively simple. That the ozone threat can be linked with Darth Vader means that it is encompassed in common sense understandings that are deeply ingrained and widely shared.

The chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) regulation attempts of the end of the 1980s profited from those easy-to-grasp metaphors and the personal risk assumptions taken from them. As well the fate of celebrities like President [[Ronald Reagan]], which had skin cancer removal in 1985 and 1987, was of high importance.

As of May 2016, polls have repeatedly found that a majority of Republican voters, particularly young ones, believe the government should take action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/science/donald-trump-global-warming-energy-policy-kevin-cramer.html | work=The New York Times | first=Erica | last=Goode | title=What Are Donald Trump's Views on Climate Change?

A [[scientific consensus]] on climate change exists, as recognized by national [[Academy of Sciences|academies of science]] and other authoritative bodies.<ref name=\"JointScienceAcademies2005\" />  The opinion gap between scientists and the public in 2009 stands at 84% to 49% that global temperatures are increasing because of human-activity.<ref name=\"PewResearchCenter2009PublicPraiseScientistsFault\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/528.pdf|title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media|date=9 Jun 2009|pages=5, 55|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> However, more recent research has identified substantial geographical variation in the public's understanding of the scientific consensus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Baobao|last2=van der Linden|first2=Sander|last3=Mildenberger|first3=Matto|last4=Marlon|first4=Jennifer|last5=Howe|first5=Peter|last6=Leiserowitz|first6=Anthony|title=Experimental effects of climate messages vary geographically|journal=Nature Climate Change|date=2018|volume=21|issue=5|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0122-0|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/278735|bibcode=2018NatCC...8..370Z}}</ref>

===Economics===
{{See also|Economics of global warming}}

Economic debates weigh the benefits of limiting industrial emissions of mitigating global warming against the costs that such changes would entail. While there is a greater amount of agreement over whether global warming exists, there is less agreement over the appropriate response. Electric or petroleum distribution may be government owned or utilities may be regulated by government. The government owned or regulated utilities may, or may not choose to make lower emissions a priority over economics, in unregulated counties industry follows economic priorities. An example of the economic priority is [[Royal Dutch Shell#Environmental pollution|Royal Dutch Shell PLC]] reporting CO2 emissions of 81 million metric tonnes in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Dutch Shell PLC – AMEE |url=https://www.amee.com/companies/006723599-royal-dutch-shell-plc#/tabs/environmental}}</ref>

The efforts of [[Al Gore]] and other environmental campaigns have focused on the effects of global warming and have managed to increase awareness and concern, but despite these efforts as of 2007, the number of Americans believing humans are the cause of global warming was holding steady at 61%, and those believing the popular media was understating the issue remained about 35%.<ref name=\"Saad2007HollywoodHeathUpConcern\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/26932/Did-Hollywoods-Glare-Heat-Public-Concern-About-Global-Warming.aspx|title=Did Hollywood's Glare Heat Up Public Concern About Global Warming?|first=Lydia|last=Saad|date=21 March 2007|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref>  Between 2010 and 2013, the number of Americans who believe the media under-reports the seriousness of global warming has been increasing, and the number who think media over-states it has been falling.

===Politics===
{{See also|Politics of global warming}}

Public opinion impacts on the issue of climate change because governments need willing electorates and citizens in order to implement policies that address climate change. Further, when climate change perceptions differ between the populace and governments, the communication of risk to the public becomes problematic. Finally, a public that is not aware of the issues surrounding climate change may resist or oppose climate change policies, which is of considerable importance to politicians and state leaders.<ref name=\"LorenzoniAndPidgeon2006\">{{cite journal | pages = 73–95 | issue = 1–2 | doi = 10.1007/s10584-006-9072-z | issn = 1573-1480 | format = Full free text | url = http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/lev/ESSgc/lorenzoniPclimchng06.pdf | volume = 77 | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | first2 = N.

A 2009 Eurobarometer survey found that, on the average, Europeans rate climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world today, between \"poverty, the lack of food and drinking water\" and \"a major global economic downturn.\" 87% of Europeans consider climate change to be a \"serious\" or \"very serious\" problem, while 10% \"do not consider it a serious problem.\" However, the proportion who believe it to be a problem has dropped in the period 2008/9 when the surveys were conducted.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=15}}</ref> While the small majority believe climate change is a serious threat, 55% percent believe the EU is doing too little and 30% believe the EU is going the right amount.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=21}}</ref> As a result of European Union climate change perceptions, \"climate change is an issue that has reached such a level of social and political acceptability across the EU that it enables (indeed, forces) the EU Commission and national leaders to produce all sorts of measures, including taxes.\"<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" /> Despite the persistent high level of personal involvement of European citizens, found in another Eurobarometer survey in 2011,<ref>[[European Commission]], [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_372_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 372 – Climate Change] Brussels, June 2011</ref> EU leaders have begun to downscale climate policy issues on the political agenda since the beginning of the Eurozone crisis.<ref>Oliver Geden (2012), [http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2012_RP01_lpt_prt.pdf#page=19 The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it], SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01</ref>

Although public opinion may not be the only factor influencing renewable energy policies, it is a key catalyst.

The proportion of Americans who believe that the effects of global warming have begun or will begin in a few years rose to a peak in 2008 where it then declined, and a similar trend was found regarding the belief that global warming is a threat to their lifestyle within their lifetime.<ref name=\"Newman2010AmericanConcernDrop\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/126560/Americans-Global-Warming-Concerns-Continue-Drop.aspx|title=Americans' Global Warming Concerns Continue to Drop|first=Frank|last=Newport|date=11 Mar 2010|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=13 Mar 2010}}</ref> Concern over global warming often corresponds with economic downturns and national crisis such as 9/11 as Americans prioritize the economy and national security over environmental concerns.

A 2007–2008 [[Gallup Poll]] surveyed individuals in 128 countries. This poll queried whether the respondent knew of global warming. Those who had a basic concept of global warming didn’t necessarily connect it to human activities, revealing that knowledge of global warming and the knowledge that it’s human-induced are two separate things. Over a third of the world's population were unaware of global warming. [[Developing country|Developing countrie]]<nowiki/>s have less awareness than [[Developed country|developed]], and Africa the least aware. Of those aware, residents of [[Latin America]] and developed countries in Asia led the belief that climate change is a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] led in the opposite. Opinion within the United Kingdom was divided.<ref name=\"Pelham2009Awareness\">{{Cite web|first=Brett|last=Pelham|title=Awareness, Opinions About Global Warming Vary Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization]]|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

The first major worldwide poll, conducted by Gallup in 2008–2009 in 127 countries, found that some 62% of people worldwide said they knew about global warming. In the [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] of North America, Europe, and Japan, 67% or more knew about it (97% in the U.S., 99% in Japan); in [[Developing country|developing countries]], especially in Africa, fewer than a quarter knew about it, although many had noticed local weather changes. Among those who knew about global warming, there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|title=Awareness, Opinions about Global Warming Vary Worldwide| last=Pelham | first=Brett | publisher=Gallup |year=2009 | accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

Adults in Asia, with the exception of those in developed countries, are the least likely to perceive global warming as a threat. In the western world, individuals are the most likely to be aware and perceive it as a very or somewhat serious threat to themselves and their families;<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124652/Awareness-Climate-Change-Threat-Vary-Region.aspx|title=Awareness of Climate Change and Threat Vary by Region|last1=Pugliese|first1=Anita|last2=Ray|first2=Julie|date=11 December 2009|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> although Europeans are more concerned about climate change than those in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/health/04iht-poll.4102536.html?_r=1|title=More in Europe worry about climate than in U.S., poll shows|last=Crampton|first=Thomas|date=1 January 2007|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=26 December 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> However, the public in Africa, where individuals are the most vulnerable to global warming while producing the least carbon dioxide, is the least aware – which translates into a low perception that it is a threat.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat\" />

These variations pose a challenge to [[policymaker]]s, as different countries travel down different paths, making an agreement over an appropriate response difficult. While Africa may be the most vulnerable and produce the least amount of greenhouse gases, they are the most ambivalent. The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies. People in China, Russia, and the United States, while varying in awareness, have expressed a similar proportion of aware individuals concerned. Similarly, those aware in India are likely to be concerned, but India faces challenges spreading this concern to the remaining population as its energy needs increase over the next decade.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124595/Top-Emitting-Countries-Differ-Climate-Change-Threat.aspx|title=Top-Emitting Countries Differ on Climate Change Threat|first1=Anita|last1=Pugliese|first2=Julie|last2=Ray|date=7 December 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

In 2009 [[Yale University]] conducted a study identifying global warming's \"Six Americas\". The report identifies six audiences with different opinions about global warming: The alarmed (18%), the concerned (33%), the cautious (19%), the disengaged (12%), the doubtful (11%) and the dismissive (7%). The alarmed and concerned make out the largest percentage and think something should be done about global warming. The cautious, disengaged and doubtful are less likely to take action. The dismissive are convinced global warming is not happening. These audiences can be used to define the best approaches for environmental action. The theory of the 'Six Americas' is also used for marketing purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-2009/|title=Global Warming's Six Americas 2009|website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref>

===Education===
{{main|Climate change education}}
In countries varying in awareness, an educational gap translates into a gap in awareness.<ref name=gap>[http://www.cultureuniversity.com/closing-massive-gaps-between-culture-awareness-education-action/ Closing the Massive Gaps Between Culture Awareness, Education, and Action]</ref> However an increase in awareness does not always result in an increase in perceived threat. In China, 98% of those who have completed four years or more of college education reported knowing something or a great deal of climate change while only 63% of those who have completed nine years of education reported the same. Despite the differences in awareness in China, all groups perceive a low level of threat from global warming. In India, those who are educated are more likely to be aware, and those who are educated there are far more likely to report perceiving global warming as a threat than those who are not educated.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" /> In Europe, individuals who have attained a higher level of education perceive climate change as a serious threat. There is also a strong association between education and Internet use. Europeans who use the Internet more are more likely to perceive climate change as a serious threat.<ref name=\"Eurobarometer2009p13\" /> However, a survey of American adults found \"little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens{{clarify|date=August 2016}} on what science knows about climate change.

===Demographics===

Residential [[demographics]] affect perceptions of global warming. In China, 77% of those who live in urban areas are aware of global warming compared to 52% in rural areas. This trend is mirrored in India with 49% to 29% awareness, respectively.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" />

Of the countries where at least half the population is aware of global warming, those with the majority who believe that global warming is due to human activities have a greater national GDP per unit energy—or, a greater energy efficiency.<ref name=\"Pelham2009Energy\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117835/Views-Global-Warming-Relate-Energy-Efficiency.aspx|title=Views on Global Warming Relate to Energy Efficiency|first=Brett W.|last=Pelham|date=24 April 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

In Europe, individuals under fifty-five are more likely to perceive both \"poverty, lack of food and drinking water\" and climate change as a serious threat than individuals over fifty-five. Male individuals are more likely to perceive climate change as a threat than female individuals.

===Political identification===
In the United States, support for environmental protection was relatively [[non-partisan]] in the twentieth century. Republican [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established national parks whereas Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] established the [[Soil Conservation Service]]. Republican [[Richard Nixon]] was instrumental in founding the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and tried to install a third pillar of [[NATO]] dealing with environmental challenges such as acid rain and the greenhouse effect. [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] was Nixon's NATO delegate for the topic.<ref name=\"Hüne\">Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), Kai F. Hünemörder, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 ISBN</ref>

This non-partisanship began to erode during the 1980s, when the [[Reagan administration]] described environmental protection as an economic burden. Views over global warming began to seriously diverge between Democrats and Republicans during the negotiations that led up to the creation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998. In a 2008 Gallup poll of the American public, 76% of Democrats and only 41% of Republicans said that they believed global warming was already happening. The opinions of the [[political elite]]s, such as members of Congress, tends to be even more polarized.<ref name=\"Dunlap2008RepublicanDemocraticGap\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/107569/ClimateChange-Views-RepublicanDemocratic-Gaps-Expand.aspx|title=Climate-Change Views: Republican-Democratic Gaps Expand|first=Riley E.|last=Dunlap|date=29 May 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

Public opinion on climate change can be influenced by who people vote for. Although media coverage influences how some view climate change, research shows that voting behavior influences climate change skepticism. This shows that people’s views on climate change tend to align with the people they voted for.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCrea |first1=Rod |last2=Leviston |first2=Zoe |last3=Walker |first3=Iain A. |title=Climate Change Skepticism and Voting Behavior |journal=Environment and Behavior |date=27 July 2016 |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=1309–1334 |doi=10.1177/0013916515599571}}</ref> 

In Europe, opinion is not strongly divided among [[Left-right politics|left and right parties]]. Although European political parties on the left, including [[Green parties]], strongly support measures to address climate change, conservative European political parties maintain similar sentiments, most notably in Western and Northern Europe. For example, [[Margaret Thatcher]], never a friend of the coal mining industry, was a strong supporter of an active climate protection policy and was instrumental in founding the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the British [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]].<ref>[https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/04/thatchers-climate-change-greatest-hits How Margaret Thatcher Made the Conservative Case for Climate Action], James West, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', Mon Apr. 8, 2013</ref> Some speeches, as to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107346 1988 Sep 27 Tu Margaret Thatcher Speech to the Royal Society]</ref> and to the UN general assembly in November 1989 helped to put climate change, acid rain, and general pollution in the British mainstream. After her career, however, Thatcher was less of a climate activist, as she called climate action a \"marvelous excuse for supranational socialism\", and called Al Gore an \"apocalyptic hyperbole\".<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/04/08/margaret_thatcher_s_environmental_record_she_was_a_climate_hawk.html An Inconvenient Truth About Margaret Thatcher: She Was a Climate Hawk], Will Oremus, [[Slate (magazine)]] April 8, 2013</ref> France's center-right [[Jacques Chirac|President Chirac]] pushed key environmental and climate change policies in France in 2005–2007. Conservative German administrations (under the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]]) in the past two decades{{when|date=March 2019}} have supported [[European Union]] climate change initiatives; concern about [[forest dieback]] and [[acid rain]] regulation were initiated under Kohl's archconservative minister of the interior [[Friedrich Zimmermann]]. In the period after former President George W. Bush announced that the United States was leaving the [[Kyoto Treaty]], European media and newspapers on both the left and right criticized the move. The conservative Spanish ''[[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]]'', the ''[[Irish Times]]'', the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', the Danish ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', and the Greek ''[[Kathimerini]]'' all condemned the Bush administration's decision, as did left-leaning newspapers.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\">{{cite journal | first1= M.

In Norway, a 2013 poll conducted by [[TNS Gallup]] found that 92% of those who vote for the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] and 89% of those who vote for the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] believe that global warming is caused by humans, while the percentage who held this belief is 60% among voters for the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and 41% among voters for the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]].<ref>\"Among those who vote for the Liberal Party or the Socialist Party, the great majority think that humans are behind climate changes (89 and 92%).

The shared sentiments between the political left and right on climate change further illustrate the divide in perception between the United States and Europe on climate change. As an example, conservative German Prime Ministers [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[Angela Merkel]] have differed with other parties in Germany only on how to meet emissions reduction targets, not whether or not to establish or fulfill them.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" />

A 2017 study found that those who changed their opinion on climate change between 2010 and 2014 did so \"primarily to align better with those who shared their party identification and political ideology. This conforms with the theory of motivated reasoning: Evidence consistent with prior beliefs is viewed as strong and, on politically salient issues, people strive to bring their opinions into conformance with those who share their political identity\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|last2=Lewis|first2=Gregory B.|last3=Feng|first3=Bo|date=2017-03-13|title=What Causes People to Change Their Opinion about Climate Change?|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=0|issue=4|pages=883–896|doi=10.1080/24694452.2016.1270193|issn=2469-4452|url=https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/geosciences_facpub/22}}</ref> Furthermore, a 2019 study examining the growing skepticism of climate change among American Republicans argues that persuasion and rhetoric from party elites play a critical role in public opinion formation, and that these elite cues are propagated through mainstream and social media sources.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Merkley |first1=Eric |last2=Stecula |first2=Dominik |title=Party Cues in the News: Elite Opinion Leadership and Climate Skepticism |journal=Toronto Political Behaviour Workshop |date=November 8-9, 2019 |page=1 |url=https://rubenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/merkley-stecula.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref>

Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, compares the different public reactions towards [[ozone depletion and global warming]].<ref name = Ungar/> The public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events which could be used as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger.<ref name = Ungar/> Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of two to three degrees Celsius over several decades do not respond with people, e.g. in North America, that experience similar swings during a single day.<ref name = Ungar/> As scientists define global warming a problem of the future, a liability in \"[[attention economy]]\", pessimistic outlooks in general and assigning extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed (compare [[Gore effect]]) in the public arena.<ref>Sheldon Ungar Climatic Change February 1999, Volume 41, Issue 2, pp. 133–150 Is Strange Weather in the Air? A Study of U.S. National Network News Coverage of Extreme Weather Events</ref> While the [[greenhouse effect]] ''[[per se (Latin)|per se]]'' is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the [[ozone shield]] and other metaphors about the ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties. But the metaphors used in the discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) reflected better with lay people and their concerns.

{{\"|The idea of rays penetrating a damaged \"shield\" meshes nicely with abiding and resonant cultural motifs, including \"Hollywood affinities\". These range from the shields on the Starship Enterprise to Star Wars, ... It is these pre-scientific bridging metaphors built around the penetration of a deteriorating shield that render the ozone problem relatively simple. That the ozone threat can be linked with Darth Vader means that it is encompassed in common sense understandings that are deeply ingrained and widely shared.

The chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) regulation attempts of the end of the 1980s profited from those easy-to-grasp metaphors and the personal risk assumptions taken from them. As well the fate of celebrities like President [[Ronald Reagan]], which had skin cancer removal in 1985 and 1987, was of high importance.

A [[scientific consensus]] on climate change exists, as recognized by national [[Academy of Sciences|academies of science]] and other authoritative bodies.<ref name=\"JointScienceAcademies2005\" />  The opinion gap between scientists and the public in 2009 stands at 84% to 49% that global temperatures are increasing because of human-activity.<ref name=\"PewResearchCenter2009PublicPraiseScientistsFault\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/528.pdf|title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media|date=9 Jun 2009|pages=5, 55|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> However, more recent research has identified substantial geographical variation in the public's understanding of the scientific consensus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Baobao|last2=van der Linden|first2=Sander|last3=Mildenberger|first3=Matto|last4=Marlon|first4=Jennifer|last5=Howe|first5=Peter|last6=Leiserowitz|first6=Anthony|title=Experimental effects of climate messages vary geographically|journal=Nature Climate Change|date=2018|volume=21|issue=5|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0122-0|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/278735|bibcode=2018NatCC...8..370Z}}</ref>

===Economics===
{{See also|Economics of global warming}}

Economic debates weigh the benefits of limiting industrial emissions of mitigating global warming against the costs that such changes would entail. While there is a greater amount of agreement over whether global warming exists, there is less agreement over the appropriate response. Electric or petroleum distribution may be government owned or utilities may be regulated by government. The government owned or regulated utilities may, or may not choose to make lower emissions a priority over economics, in unregulated counties industry follows economic priorities. An example of the economic priority is [[Royal Dutch Shell#Environmental pollution|Royal Dutch Shell PLC]] reporting CO2 emissions of 81 million metric tonnes in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Dutch Shell PLC – AMEE |url=https://www.amee.com/companies/006723599-royal-dutch-shell-plc#/tabs/environmental}}</ref>

The efforts of [[Al Gore]] and other environmental campaigns have focused on the effects of global warming and have managed to increase awareness and concern, but despite these efforts as of 2007, the number of Americans believing humans are the cause of global warming was holding steady at 61%, and those believing the popular media was understating the issue remained about 35%.<ref name=\"Saad2007HollywoodHeathUpConcern\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/26932/Did-Hollywoods-Glare-Heat-Public-Concern-About-Global-Warming.aspx|title=Did Hollywood's Glare Heat Up Public Concern About Global Warming?|first=Lydia|last=Saad|date=21 March 2007|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref>  Between 2010 and 2013, the number of Americans who believe the media under-reports the seriousness of global warming has been increasing, and the number who think media over-states it has been falling.

===Politics===
{{See also|Politics of global warming}}

Public opinion impacts on the issue of climate change because governments need willing electorates and citizens in order to implement policies that address climate change. Further, when climate change perceptions differ between the populace and governments, the communication of risk to the public becomes problematic. Finally, a public that is not aware of the issues surrounding climate change may resist or oppose climate change policies, which is of considerable importance to politicians and state leaders.<ref name=\"LorenzoniAndPidgeon2006\">{{cite journal | pages = 73–95 | issue = 1–2 | doi = 10.1007/s10584-006-9072-z | issn = 1573-1480 | format = Full free text | url = http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/lev/ESSgc/lorenzoniPclimchng06.pdf | volume = 77 | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | first2 = N.

A 2009 Eurobarometer survey found that, on the average, Europeans rate climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world today, between \"poverty, the lack of food and drinking water\" and \"a major global economic downturn.\" 87% of Europeans consider climate change to be a \"serious\" or \"very serious\" problem, while 10% \"do not consider it a serious problem.\" However, the proportion who believe it to be a problem has dropped in the period 2008/9 when the surveys were conducted.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=15}}</ref> While the small majority believe climate change is a serious threat, 55% percent believe the EU is doing too little and 30% believe the EU is going the right amount.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=21}}</ref> As a result of European Union climate change perceptions, \"climate change is an issue that has reached such a level of social and political acceptability across the EU that it enables (indeed, forces) the EU Commission and national leaders to produce all sorts of measures, including taxes.\"<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" /> Despite the persistent high level of personal involvement of European citizens, found in another Eurobarometer survey in 2011,<ref>[[European Commission]], [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_372_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 372 – Climate Change] Brussels, June 2011</ref> EU leaders have begun to downscale climate policy issues on the political agenda since the beginning of the Eurozone crisis.<ref>Oliver Geden (2012), [http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2012_RP01_lpt_prt.pdf#page=19 The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it], SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01</ref>

Although public opinion may not be the only factor influencing renewable energy policies, it is a key catalyst.

The proportion of Americans who believe that the effects of global warming have begun or will begin in a few years rose to a peak in 2008 where it then declined, and a similar trend was found regarding the belief that global warming is a threat to their lifestyle within their lifetime.<ref name=\"Newman2010AmericanConcernDrop\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/126560/Americans-Global-Warming-Concerns-Continue-Drop.aspx|title=Americans' Global Warming Concerns Continue to Drop|first=Frank|last=Newport|date=11 Mar 2010|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=13 Mar 2010}}</ref> Concern over global warming often corresponds with economic downturns and national crisis such as 9/11 as Americans prioritize the economy and national security over environmental concerns.

A 2007–2008 [[Gallup Poll]] surveyed individuals in 128 countries. This poll queried whether the respondent knew of global warming. Those who had a basic concept of global warming didn’t necessarily connect it to human activities, revealing that knowledge of global warming and the knowledge that it’s human-induced are two separate things. Over a third of the world's population were unaware of global warming. [[Developing country|Developing countrie]]<nowiki/>s have less awareness than [[Developed country|developed]], and Africa the least aware. Of those aware, residents of [[Latin America]] and developed countries in Asia led the belief that climate change is a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] led in the opposite. Opinion within the United Kingdom was divided.<ref name=\"Pelham2009Awareness\">{{Cite web|first=Brett|last=Pelham|title=Awareness, Opinions About Global Warming Vary Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization]]|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

The first major worldwide poll, conducted by Gallup in 2008–2009 in 127 countries, found that some 62% of people worldwide said they knew about global warming. In the [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] of North America, Europe, and Japan, 67% or more knew about it (97% in the U.S., 99% in Japan); in [[Developing country|developing countries]], especially in Africa, fewer than a quarter knew about it, although many had noticed local weather changes. Among those who knew about global warming, there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|title=Awareness, Opinions about Global Warming Vary Worldwide| last=Pelham | first=Brett | publisher=Gallup |year=2009 | accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

Adults in Asia, with the exception of those in developed countries, are the least likely to perceive global warming as a threat. In the western world, individuals are the most likely to be aware and perceive it as a very or somewhat serious threat to themselves and their families;<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124652/Awareness-Climate-Change-Threat-Vary-Region.aspx|title=Awareness of Climate Change and Threat Vary by Region|last1=Pugliese|first1=Anita|last2=Ray|first2=Julie|date=11 December 2009|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> although Europeans are more concerned about climate change than those in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/health/04iht-poll.4102536.html?_r=1|title=More in Europe worry about climate than in U.S., poll shows|last=Crampton|first=Thomas|date=1 January 2007|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=26 December 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> However, the public in Africa, where individuals are the most vulnerable to global warming while producing the least carbon dioxide, is the least aware – which translates into a low perception that it is a threat.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat\" />

These variations pose a challenge to [[policymaker]]s, as different countries travel down different paths, making an agreement over an appropriate response difficult. While Africa may be the most vulnerable and produce the least amount of greenhouse gases, they are the most ambivalent. The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies.

In 2009 [[Yale University]] conducted a study identifying global warming's \"Six Americas\". The report identifies six audiences with different opinions about global warming: The alarmed (18%), the concerned (33%), the cautious (19%), the disengaged (12%), the doubtful (11%) and the dismissive (7%). The alarmed and concerned make out the largest percentage and think something should be done about global warming. The cautious, disengaged and doubtful are less likely to take action. The dismissive are convinced global warming is not happening. These audiences can be used to define the best approaches for environmental action. The theory of the 'Six Americas' is also used for marketing purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-2009/|title=Global Warming's Six Americas 2009|website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref>

===Education===
{{main|Climate change education}}
In countries varying in awareness, an educational gap translates into a gap in awareness.<ref name=gap>[http://www.cultureuniversity.com/closing-massive-gaps-between-culture-awareness-education-action/ Closing the Massive Gaps Between Culture Awareness, Education, and Action]</ref> However an increase in awareness does not always result in an increase in perceived threat. In China, 98% of those who have completed four years or more of college education reported knowing something or a great deal of climate change while only 63% of those who have completed nine years of education reported the same. Despite the differences in awareness in China, all groups perceive a low level of threat from global warming. In India, those who are educated are more likely to be aware, and those who are educated there are far more likely to report perceiving global warming as a threat than those who are not educated.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" /> In Europe, individuals who have attained a higher level of education perceive climate change as a serious threat. There is also a strong association between education and Internet use. Europeans who use the Internet more are more likely to perceive climate change as a serious threat.<ref name=\"Eurobarometer2009p13\" /> However, a survey of American adults found \"little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens{{clarify|date=August 2016}} on what science knows about climate change.

===Demographics===

Residential [[demographics]] affect perceptions of global warming. In China, 77% of those who live in urban areas are aware of global warming compared to 52% in rural areas. This trend is mirrored in India with 49% to 29% awareness, respectively.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" />

Of the countries where at least half the population is aware of global warming, those with the majority who believe that global warming is due to human activities have a greater national GDP per unit energy—or, a greater energy efficiency.<ref name=\"Pelham2009Energy\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117835/Views-Global-Warming-Relate-Energy-Efficiency.aspx|title=Views on Global Warming Relate to Energy Efficiency|first=Brett W.|last=Pelham|date=24 April 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

In Europe, individuals under fifty-five are more likely to perceive both \"poverty, lack of food and drinking water\" and climate change as a serious threat than individuals over fifty-five. Male individuals are more likely to perceive climate change as a threat than female individuals.

===Political identification===
In the United States, support for environmental protection was relatively [[non-partisan]] in the twentieth century. Republican [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established national parks whereas Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] established the [[Soil Conservation Service]]. Republican [[Richard Nixon]] was instrumental in founding the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and tried to install a third pillar of [[NATO]] dealing with environmental challenges such as acid rain and the greenhouse effect. [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] was Nixon's NATO delegate for the topic.<ref name=\"Hüne\">Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), Kai F. Hünemörder, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 ISBN</ref>

This non-partisanship began to erode during the 1980s, when the [[Reagan administration]] described environmental protection as an economic burden. Views over global warming began to seriously diverge between Democrats and Republicans during the negotiations that led up to the creation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998. In a 2008 Gallup poll of the American public, 76% of Democrats and only 41% of Republicans said that they believed global warming was already happening. The opinions of the [[political elite]]s, such as members of Congress, tends to be even more polarized.<ref name=\"Dunlap2008RepublicanDemocraticGap\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/107569/ClimateChange-Views-RepublicanDemocratic-Gaps-Expand.aspx|title=Climate-Change Views: Republican-Democratic Gaps Expand|first=Riley E.|last=Dunlap|date=29 May 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

Public opinion on climate change can be influenced by who people vote for. Although media coverage influences how some view climate change, research shows that voting behavior influences climate change skepticism. This shows that people’s views on climate change tend to align with the people they voted for.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCrea |first1=Rod |last2=Leviston |first2=Zoe |last3=Walker |first3=Iain A. |title=Climate Change Skepticism and Voting Behavior |journal=Environment and Behavior |date=27 July 2016 |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=1309–1334 |doi=10.1177/0013916515599571}}</ref> 

In Europe, opinion is not strongly divided among [[Left-right politics|left and right parties]]. Although European political parties on the left, including [[Green parties]], strongly support measures to address climate change, conservative European political parties maintain similar sentiments, most notably in Western and Northern Europe. For example, [[Margaret Thatcher]], never a friend of the coal mining industry, was a strong supporter of an active climate protection policy and was instrumental in founding the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the British [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]].<ref>[https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/04/thatchers-climate-change-greatest-hits How Margaret Thatcher Made the Conservative Case for Climate Action], James West, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', Mon Apr. 8, 2013</ref> Some speeches, as to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107346 1988 Sep 27 Tu Margaret Thatcher Speech to the Royal Society]</ref> and to the UN general assembly in November 1989 helped to put climate change, acid rain, and general pollution in the British mainstream. After her career, however, Thatcher was less of a climate activist, as she called climate action a \"marvelous excuse for supranational socialism\", and called Al Gore an \"apocalyptic hyperbole\".<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/04/08/margaret_thatcher_s_environmental_record_she_was_a_climate_hawk.html An Inconvenient Truth About Margaret Thatcher: She Was a Climate Hawk], Will Oremus, [[Slate (magazine)]] April 8, 2013</ref> France's center-right [[Jacques Chirac|President Chirac]] pushed key environmental and climate change policies in France in 2005–2007. Conservative German administrations (under the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]]) in the past two decades{{when|date=March 2019}} have supported [[European Union]] climate change initiatives; concern about [[forest dieback]] and [[acid rain]] regulation were initiated under Kohl's archconservative minister of the interior [[Friedrich Zimmermann]]. In the period after former President George W. Bush announced that the United States was leaving the [[Kyoto Treaty]], European media and newspapers on both the left and right criticized the move. The conservative Spanish ''[[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]]'', the ''[[Irish Times]]'', the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', the Danish ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', and the Greek ''[[Kathimerini]]'' all condemned the Bush administration's decision, as did left-leaning newspapers.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\">{{cite journal | first1= M.

In Norway, a 2013 poll conducted by [[TNS Gallup]] found that 92% of those who vote for the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] and 89% of those who vote for the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] believe that global warming is caused by humans, while the percentage who held this belief is 60% among voters for the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and 41% among voters for the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]].<ref>\"Among those who vote for the Liberal Party or the Socialist Party, the great majority think that humans are behind climate changes (89 and 92%).

The shared sentiments between the political left and right on climate change further illustrate the divide in perception between the United States and Europe on climate change. As an example, conservative German Prime Ministers [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[Angela Merkel]] have differed with other parties in Germany only on how to meet emissions reduction targets, not whether or not to establish or fulfill them.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" />

A 2017 study found that those who changed their opinion on climate change between 2010 and 2014 did so \"primarily to align better with those who shared their party identification and political ideology. This conforms with the theory of motivated reasoning: Evidence consistent with prior beliefs is viewed as strong and, on politically salient issues, people strive to bring their opinions into conformance with those who share their political identity\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|last2=Lewis|first2=Gregory B.|last3=Feng|first3=Bo|date=2017-03-13|title=What Causes People to Change Their Opinion about Climate Change?|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=0|issue=4|pages=883–896|doi=10.1080/24694452.2016.1270193|issn=2469-4452|url=https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/geosciences_facpub/22}}</ref> Furthermore, a 2019 study examining the growing skepticism of climate change among American Republicans argues that persuasion and rhetoric from party elites play a critical role in public opinion formation, and that these elite cues are propagated through mainstream and social media sources.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Merkley |first1=Eric |last2=Stecula |first2=Dominik |title=Party Cues in the News: Elite Opinion Leadership and Climate Skepticism |journal=Toronto Political Behaviour Workshop |date=November 8-9, 2019 |page=1 |url=https://rubenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/merkley-stecula.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref>

Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, compares the different public reactions towards [[ozone depletion and global warming]].<ref name = Ungar/> The public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events which could be used as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger.<ref name = Ungar/> Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of two to three degrees Celsius over several decades do not respond with people, e.g. in North America, that experience similar swings during a single day.<ref name = Ungar/> As scientists define global warming a problem of the future, a liability in \"[[attention economy]]\", pessimistic outlooks in general and assigning extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed (compare [[Gore effect]]) in the public arena.<ref>Sheldon Ungar Climatic Change February 1999, Volume 41, Issue 2, pp. 133–150 Is Strange Weather in the Air? A Study of U.S. National Network News Coverage of Extreme Weather Events</ref> While the [[greenhouse effect]] ''[[per se (Latin)|per se]]'' is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the [[ozone shield]] and other metaphors about the ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties. But the metaphors used in the discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) reflected better with lay people and their concerns.

{{\"|The idea of rays penetrating a damaged \"shield\" meshes nicely with abiding and resonant cultural motifs, including \"Hollywood affinities\". These range from the shields on the Starship Enterprise to Star Wars, ... It is these pre-scientific bridging metaphors built around the penetration of a deteriorating shield that render the ozone problem relatively simple. That the ozone threat can be linked with Darth Vader means that it is encompassed in common sense understandings that are deeply ingrained and widely shared.

The chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) regulation attempts of the end of the 1980s profited from those easy-to-grasp metaphors and the personal risk assumptions taken from them. As well the fate of celebrities like President [[Ronald Reagan]], which had skin cancer removal in 1985 and 1987, was of high importance.

===Science===
{{See also|Scientific consensus on climate change}}
A [[scientific consensus]] on climate change exists, as recognized by national [[Academy of Sciences|academies of science]] and other authoritative bodies.<ref name=\"JointScienceAcademies2005\" />  The opinion gap between scientists and the public in 2009 stands at 84% to 49% that global temperatures are increasing because of human-activity.<ref name=\"PewResearchCenter2009PublicPraiseScientistsFault\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/528.pdf|title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media|date=9 Jun 2009|pages=5, 55|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> However, more recent research has identified substantial geographical variation in the public's understanding of the scientific consensus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Baobao|last2=van der Linden|first2=Sander|last3=Mildenberger|first3=Matto|last4=Marlon|first4=Jennifer|last5=Howe|first5=Peter|last6=Leiserowitz|first6=Anthony|title=Experimental effects of climate messages vary geographically|journal=Nature Climate Change|date=2018|volume=21|issue=5|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0122-0|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/278735|bibcode=2018NatCC...8..370Z}}</ref>

===Economics===
{{See also|Economics of global warming}}

Economic debates weigh the benefits of limiting industrial emissions of mitigating global warming against the costs that such changes would entail. While there is a greater amount of agreement over whether global warming exists, there is less agreement over the appropriate response. Electric or petroleum distribution may be government owned or utilities may be regulated by government. The government owned or regulated utilities may, or may not choose to make lower emissions a priority over economics, in unregulated counties industry follows economic priorities. An example of the economic priority is [[Royal Dutch Shell#Environmental pollution|Royal Dutch Shell PLC]] reporting CO2 emissions of 81 million metric tonnes in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Dutch Shell PLC – AMEE |url=https://www.amee.com/companies/006723599-royal-dutch-shell-plc#/tabs/environmental}}</ref>

===Media===

The popular media in the U.S. gives greater attention to skeptics relative to the scientific community as a whole, and the level of agreement within the scientific community has not been accurately communicated.<ref>{{Cite journal| first1 = M.| first2 = J. | title = Balance as bias: global warming and the US prestige press| last1 = Boykoff | journal = Global Environmental Change Part A | volume = 14| issue =  2 | pages = 125–36 | date = July 2004 | doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001| last2 =  Boykoff| url = http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2005.08.003| title = Climate of scepticism: US newspaper coverage of the science of climate change| year = 2005| last1 = Antilla | first1 = L.| journal = Global Environmental Change Part A| volume = 15| issue = 4| pages = 338–52 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.372.2033}}</ref> US popular media coverage differs from that presented in other countries, where reporting is more consistent with the scientific literature.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1108/01443330310790327 | title = Media's social construction of environmental issues: focus on global warming – a comparative study | year = 2003 | last1 = Dispensa | first1 = J.

The efforts of [[Al Gore]] and other environmental campaigns have focused on the effects of global warming and have managed to increase awareness and concern, but despite these efforts as of 2007, the number of Americans believing humans are the cause of global warming was holding steady at 61%, and those believing the popular media was understating the issue remained about 35%.<ref name=\"Saad2007HollywoodHeathUpConcern\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/26932/Did-Hollywoods-Glare-Heat-Public-Concern-About-Global-Warming.aspx|title=Did Hollywood's Glare Heat Up Public Concern About Global Warming?|first=Lydia|last=Saad|date=21 March 2007|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref>  Between 2010 and 2013, the number of Americans who believe the media under-reports the seriousness of global warming has been increasing, and the number who think media over-states it has been falling.   According to a 2013 Gallup US opinion poll, 57% believe global warming is at least as bad as portrayed in the media (with 33% thinking media has downplayed global warming and 24% saying coverage is accurate).  Less than half of Americans (41%) think the problem is not as bad as media portrays it.<ref>{{cite news|last=Saad|first=Lydia|title=Americans' Concerns About Global Warming on the Rise|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/161645/americans-concerns-global-warming-rise.aspx}}</ref>

===Politics===
{{See also|Politics of global warming}}

Public opinion impacts on the issue of climate change because governments need willing electorates and citizens in order to implement policies that address climate change. Further, when climate change perceptions differ between the populace and governments, the communication of risk to the public becomes problematic. Finally, a public that is not aware of the issues surrounding climate change may resist or oppose climate change policies, which is of considerable importance to politicians and state leaders.<ref name=\"LorenzoniAndPidgeon2006\">{{cite journal | pages = 73–95 | issue = 1–2 | doi = 10.1007/s10584-006-9072-z | issn = 1573-1480 | format = Full free text | url = http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/lev/ESSgc/lorenzoniPclimchng06.pdf | volume = 77 | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | first2 = N.

A 2009 Eurobarometer survey found that, on the average, Europeans rate climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world today, between \"poverty, the lack of food and drinking water\" and \"a major global economic downturn.\" 87% of Europeans consider climate change to be a \"serious\" or \"very serious\" problem, while 10% \"do not consider it a serious problem.\" However, the proportion who believe it to be a problem has dropped in the period 2008/9 when the surveys were conducted.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=15}}</ref> While the small majority believe climate change is a serious threat, 55% percent believe the EU is doing too little and 30% believe the EU is going the right amount.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=21}}</ref> As a result of European Union climate change perceptions, \"climate change is an issue that has reached such a level of social and political acceptability across the EU that it enables (indeed, forces) the EU Commission and national leaders to produce all sorts of measures, including taxes.\"<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" /> Despite the persistent high level of personal involvement of European citizens, found in another Eurobarometer survey in 2011,<ref>[[European Commission]], [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_372_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 372 – Climate Change] Brussels, June 2011</ref> EU leaders have begun to downscale climate policy issues on the political agenda since the beginning of the Eurozone crisis.<ref>Oliver Geden (2012), [http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2012_RP01_lpt_prt.pdf#page=19 The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it], SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01</ref>

Although public opinion may not be the only factor influencing renewable energy policies, it is a key catalyst. Research has found that the shifts in public opinion in the direction of pro-environmentalism strongly increased the adoption of renewable energy policies in Europe, which can thus be applied in the U.S. and how important climate solutions are to Americans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Brilé |last2=Böhmelt |first2=Tobias |last3=Ward |first3=Hugh |title=Public opinion and environmental policy output: a cross-national analysis of energy policies in Europe |journal=Environmental Research Letters |date=1 November 2017 |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=114011 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/aa8f80}}</ref>

The proportion of Americans who believe that the effects of global warming have begun or will begin in a few years rose to a peak in 2008 where it then declined, and a similar trend was found regarding the belief that global warming is a threat to their lifestyle within their lifetime.<ref name=\"Newman2010AmericanConcernDrop\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/126560/Americans-Global-Warming-Concerns-Continue-Drop.aspx|title=Americans' Global Warming Concerns Continue to Drop|first=Frank|last=Newport|date=11 Mar 2010|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=13 Mar 2010}}</ref> Concern over global warming often corresponds with economic downturns and national crisis such as 9/11 as Americans prioritize the economy and national security over environmental concerns. However the drop in concern in 2008 is unique compared to other environmental issues.<ref name=\"Saad2009GlobalWarmingExaggerated\" /> Considered in the context of environmental issues, Americans consider global warming as a less critical concern than the pollution of rivers, lakes, and drinking water; toxic waste; fresh water needs; air pollution; damage to the ozone layer; and the loss of tropical rain forests.

==Controversies==
In 2018, 21 Savage reportedly started a movement called \"Guns Down, Paintballs Up\" which was intended to reduce gun violence by suggesting the use of [[Paintball marker|paintball guns]] instead of lethal firarms.<ref name=\"CBS2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paintball-wars-initially-intended-to-curb-gun-violence-linked-to-2-deaths/|title='Paintball wars', initially intended to curb gun violence, linked to 2 deaths|last=Diaz|first=Adriana|date=May 1, 2018|website=[[CBS News]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref> The head of the [[Detroit Police Department]], [[James Craig (police chief)|James Craig]], described the movement as \"well-intentioned, however, misguided\", after several incidents involving paintball guns later resulted in injuries, disorderly conduct involving large groups of people with paintball guns, property vandalism (e.g., of police vehicles), violent reprisals, and the mistaking of paintball guns for firearms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paint-up-guns-down-detroit-paintball-arrests-2018-04-27/|title=Detroit police cracks down on citywide 'paintball wars'|author=<!--Not stated-->|date=April 21, 2018|website=CBS News|access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/04/27/detroit-police-crack-down-citywide-paintball-wars/560019002/|title=Detroit police to crack down on citywide 'paintball wars'|last1=Patterson|first1=Brandon|last2=Zaniewski|first2=Ann|date=April 27, 2018|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref> The movement has been linked to several cases of property crime and homicide.<ref name=\"CBS2\" /><ref name=\"USA Today2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/01/paintball-wars-spate-shootings/569407002/|title=Paintball shootings splatter cities after rapper calls for swapping handguns for paintball weapons|last1=Mensch|first1=Jessica|last2=Luthern|first2=Ashley|date=May 1, 2018|website=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref> 21 Savage has not commented on the matter, although he paid for the funeral of a 3-year-old who was killed in a related incident.<ref name=\"CBS2\" /><ref name=\"USA Today2\" />

\"ASMR\", a song from 21 Savage's second studio album ''I Am > I Was'', caused some controversy with its lyrics. The lyrics included \"We been gettin' that [[Jews|Jewish]] money, everything is kosher.\" The lyrics came under fire for perpetuating negative Jewish stereotypes when [[LeBron James]] shared an Instagram story quoting the track.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/21-savage-apologizes-for-jewish-money-lyrics/|title=21 Savage Apologizes for \"Jewish Money\" Lyrics|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=January 2, 2019}}</ref> 21 Savage later apologized, saying on Twitter that \"The Jewish people I know are very wise with there {{sic}} money so that's why I said we been gettin' Jewish money.

21 Savage was convicted of felony drug charges in October 2014 in [[Fulton County, Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcboston.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/21-Savage-ICE-UK-505280672.html |title=Grammy-Nominated Rapper 21 Savage in US Immigration Custody |work=[[NBC 10 Boston]] |access-date=February 16, 2019 |date=February 3, 2019 |via=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>

====Arrest on immigration charges in 2019====
On February 3, 2019, just two days after releasing the music video for his single \"[[A Lot (song)|A Lot]]\", 21 Savage was taken into custody by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) after a vehicle was pulled over that contained him and his cousin, the rapper known as [[Young Nudy]], and two other men.

After his arrest, ICE revealed that 21 Savage is a [[British nationality law|British]] national who has been in the United States unlawfully since his non-immigrant visa expired in July 2006. 21 Savage's management team expresses he has been trying to get his Visa renewed since the year 2017. Before this, 21 Savage had commonly been believed to be a native of the Atlanta area – e.g., ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine had reported in an interview with [[Seth Rogen]] in April 2018 that the rapper's birthplace was Atlanta, Georgia, and in a 2016 interview with ''[[XXL Magazine]]'', he said he was \"from Decatur, Georgia\" (which is in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]).<ref name=Ortiz/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview |title=21 Savage |first=Seth |last=Rogen |website=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |date=<!-- No date for the article is given on the website --> |accessdate=February 3, 2019 |quote=Born Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph in Atlanta, Georgia...}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Andrews |first1=Travis |title=Rapper 21 Savage arrested by ICE agents, who say he's from the United Kingdom, not Atlanta |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/02/03/rapper-savage-arrested-by-ice-agents-who-say-hes-united-kingdom-not-atlanta/ |website=Washington Post |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |language=en |date=February 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Dowd |agency=AP |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/21-savage-atlanta-arrested-british-visa-13585649.php |title=Rapper 21 Savage arrested by ICE, which alleges he is actually British |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=February 3, 2019}}</ref>

\"ASMR\", a song from 21 Savage's second studio album ''I Am > I Was'', caused some controversy with its lyrics. The lyrics included \"We been gettin' that [[Jews|Jewish]] money, everything is kosher.\" The lyrics came under fire for perpetuating negative Jewish stereotypes when [[LeBron James]] shared an Instagram story quoting the track.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/21-savage-apologizes-for-jewish-money-lyrics/|title=21 Savage Apologizes for \"Jewish Money\" Lyrics|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=January 2, 2019}}</ref> 21 Savage later apologized, saying on Twitter that \"The Jewish people I know are very wise with there {{sic}} money so that's why I said we been gettin' Jewish money.

On February 3, 2019, just two days after releasing the music video for his single \"[[A Lot (song)|A Lot]]\", 21 Savage was taken into custody by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) after a vehicle was pulled over that contained him and his cousin, the rapper known as [[Young Nudy]], and two other men.

After his arrest, ICE revealed that 21 Savage is a [[British nationality law|British]] national who has been in the United States unlawfully since his non-immigrant visa expired in July 2006. 21 Savage's management team expresses he has been trying to get his Visa renewed since the year 2017. Before this, 21 Savage had commonly been believed to be a native of the Atlanta area – e.g., ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine had reported in an interview with [[Seth Rogen]] in April 2018 that the rapper's birthplace was Atlanta, Georgia, and in a 2016 interview with ''[[XXL Magazine]]'', he said he was \"from Decatur, Georgia\" (which is in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]).<ref name=Ortiz/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview |title=21 Savage |first=Seth |last=Rogen |website=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |date=<!-- No date for the article is given on the website --> |accessdate=February 3, 2019 |quote=Born Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph in Atlanta, Georgia...}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Andrews |first1=Travis |title=Rapper 21 Savage arrested by ICE agents, who say he's from the United Kingdom, not Atlanta |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/02/03/rapper-savage-arrested-by-ice-agents-who-say-hes-united-kingdom-not-atlanta/ |website=Washington Post |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |language=en |date=February 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Dowd |agency=AP |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/21-savage-atlanta-arrested-british-visa-13585649.php |title=Rapper 21 Savage arrested by ICE, which alleges he is actually British |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=February 3, 2019}}</ref>

====Theft by deception charges in 2019====
On February 15, 2019, 21 Savage turned himself in to authorities and was booked into a south Georgia jail in response to a warrant for his arrest for felony [[theft by deception]]. This dispute surrounds a gig arranged in 2016 for which the rapper allegedly accepted a payment of $17,000 to appear at a concert, but did not appear and did not give back the money. He was released on his own recognizance, pending a court hearing on a later date to resolve the charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/atlanta-rapper-savage-booked-into-georgia-jail-felony-warrant/lLqFGDcVJvWyfPgx54o5RM/ |title=Atlanta rapper 21 Savage booked into S.
