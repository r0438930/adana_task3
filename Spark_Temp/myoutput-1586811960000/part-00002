However, it subsequently augmented its biowarfare programs. After 1975, the program of biological weapons was run primarily by the \"civilian\" [[Biopreparat]] agency, although it also included numerous facilities run by the  Soviet Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of Health, and [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=\"Alibek\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Ken Alibek]], who was deputy-director of [[Biopreparat]], the Soviet biological weapons agency, and who defected to the United States in 1992, weapons were developed in labs in isolated areas of the Soviet Union including mobilization facilities at [[Omutininsk]], [[Penza]] and [[Pokrov, Vladimir Oblast|Pokrov]] and research facilities at [[Moscow]], [[Stirzhi]] and [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. These weapons were tested at several facilities most often at \"Rebirth Island\" ([[Vozrozhdeniya]]) in the [[Aral Sea]] by firing the weapons into the air above monkeys tied to posts, the monkeys would then be monitored to determine the effects.

Under the terms of the [[Lisbon Protocol]] to the NPT, and following the 1995 Trilateral Agreement between Russia, Belarus, and the USA, these were transferred to Russia, leaving Russia as the sole inheritor of the Soviet nuclear arsenal.

Fears of a [[nuclear holocaust]] lessened. In September 1997, the former secretary of the Russian Security Council Alexander Lebed claimed 100 \"suitcase sized\" nuclear weapons were unaccounted for.
