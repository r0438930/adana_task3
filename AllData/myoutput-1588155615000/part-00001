{"title_page": "Attorney general", "text_new": "{{short description|In common law jurisdictions, main legal advisor to the government}}\nIn most [[common law]] jurisdictions, the '''attorney general''' or '''attorney-general''' (sometimes abbreviated '''AG''') is the main legal advisor to the [[government]]. The plural is '''attorneys general''' or '''attorneys-general'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/attorney-general|title=Attorney General definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attorney+general|title=Definition of ATTORNEY GENERAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref>\n\nIn some jurisdictions, attorneys general also have executive responsibility for [[law enforcement]], prosecutions or even responsibility for legal affairs generally. In practice, the extent to which the attorney general personally provides legal advice to the government varies between jurisdictions, and even between individual office-holders within the same jurisdiction, often depending on the level and nature of the office-holder's prior legal experience.\n\nWhere the attorney general has ministerial responsibility for legal affairs in general (as is the case, for example, with the [[United States Attorney General]] or the [[Attorney-General for Australia]], and the respective [[State attorney general|attorneys general]] of the states in each country), the ministerial portfolio is largely equivalent to that of a [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]] in some other countries.\n\nThe term was originally used to refer to any person who holds a general [[power of attorney]] to represent a principal in all matters. In the common law tradition, anyone who represents the state, especially in criminal prosecutions, is such an attorney. Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general, anyone who came to represent the state in the same way could, in the past, be referred to as such, even if only for a particular case. Today, however, in most jurisdictions, the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state, sovereign or other member of the royal family.\n\n[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have similar offices, which may be variously called \"[[public prosecutor general (disambiguation)|public prosecutor general]]\", \"procurators\", \"[[Advocate General|advocates general]]\", \"public attorneys\", and other titles. Many of these offices also use \"attorney general\" or \"attorney-general\" as the English translation of the title, although because of different historical provenance, the nature of such offices is usually different from that of attorneys-general in common law jurisdictions.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn regard to the [[etymology]] of the phrase ''Attorney General'', [[Steven Pinker]] writes that the earliest citation in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] is from 1292: \"Tous attorneyz general purrount lever fins et cirrographer\" (All general attorneys may levy fines and make legal documents).<ref name=\"SP-ZWords\">{{cite book|last1=Pinker |first1=Steven |title=Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language |date=1999 |publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY |isbn=0-465-07269-0 |pages=25, 28 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=HeA4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Steven+Pinker+Words+and+rules+:+the+ingredients+of+language&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_pKis8e7TAhXkJZoKHQ98BnkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=attorneyz%20general&f=false |accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> The phrase was borrowed from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] when England was ruled by [[Normans]] after the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] in the 11th-century. As a variety of French, which was spoken in the law courts, schools, universities and in sections of the gentry and the bourgeoisie, the term relating to government got introduced into English. The phrase ''attorney general'' is composed of a noun followed by the [[postpositive adjective]] ''general'' and as other [[English plurals#French compounds|French compounds]] its plural form also appears as ''\"attorneys generals\"''.<ref name=\"Haaretz-attorneys-general\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Attorneys Generals Protest Trump's Ban: Liberty Is Bedrock of Our Country|url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.768331|publisher=Haaretz.com|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-attorneys-generals\">{{cite web|title=Former Attorneys Generals at Work|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/19/us/politics/1-Former-Attorneys-Generals-at-Work.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> As compared to ''[[major general]]s,'' a term that also originates from French (\"[[:fr:major-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|major-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral]]\") and also has a postpositive adjective, it also appears as ''\"attorney generals\"''.

[[Christian Porter]] is the current Attorney-General. The Australian states each have separate [[Attorney-General for Australia|attorneys-general]], who are state ministers with similar responsibilities to the federal minister with respect to state law.\n\nFunctions of the state and federal attorneys-general include the administration of the selection of persons for nomination to judicial posts, and authorizing prosecutions. In normal circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the Attorney-General are exercised by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] and staff; however, the Attorney-General maintains formal control, including the power to initiate and terminate public prosecutions and take over private prosecutions. Statutory criminal law provides that prosecutions for certain offences require the individual consent of the Attorney-General. This is generally for offences whose illegality is of a somewhat controversial nature or where there is perceived to be a significant risk that prosecutions of a political nature may be embarked upon. The Attorney-General also generally has the power to issue certificates legally conclusive of certain facts (e.g., that the revelation of certain matters in court proceedings might constitute a risk to national security); the facts stated in such certificates must be accepted by the courts and cannot legally be disputed by any parties. The Attorney-General also has the power to issue a ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' with respect to a case, which authoritatively determines that the state (in whose name prosecutions are brought) does not wish to prosecute the case, so preventing any person from doing so.\n\nFor the attorneys-general of the various [[states and territories of Australia]] see:\n* [[Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory]]\n* [[Attorney-General of New South Wales]]\n* [[Attorney-General of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Queensland]]\n* [[Attorney-General of South Australia]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Tasmania]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Victoria]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Western Australia]]\n\n===Bangladesh===\n{{Main|Attorney-General of Bangladesh}}\n\n===Barbados===\n{{Main|Attorney-General of Barbados}}\n\n===British Virgin Islands===\n{{Main|Attorney General of the British Virgin Islands}}\n\n===Canada===\n{{main|Canadian Minister of Justice|Canadian Minister of Public Safety}}\nThe [[Attorney General of Canada]] ({{lang-fr|Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada}}) is a separate title held by the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Canadian Minister of Justice]] (''{{lang|fr|Ministre de la Justice}}''), a member of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]].

In practice, the extent to which the attorney general personally provides legal advice to the government varies between jurisdictions, and even between individual office-holders within the same jurisdiction, often depending on the level and nature of the office-holder's prior legal experience.\n\nWhere the attorney general has ministerial responsibility for legal affairs in general (as is the case, for example, with the [[United States Attorney General]] or the [[Attorney-General for Australia]], and the respective [[State attorney general|attorneys general]] of the states in each country), the ministerial portfolio is largely equivalent to that of a [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]] in some other countries.\n\nThe term was originally used to refer to any person who holds a general [[power of attorney]] to represent a principal in all matters. In the common law tradition, anyone who represents the state, especially in criminal prosecutions, is such an attorney. Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general, anyone who came to represent the state in the same way could, in the past, be referred to as such, even if only for a particular case. Today, however, in most jurisdictions, the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state, sovereign or other member of the royal family.\n\n[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have similar offices, which may be variously called \"[[public prosecutor general (disambiguation)|public prosecutor general]]\", \"procurators\", \"[[Advocate General|advocates general]]\", \"public attorneys\", and other titles. Many of these offices also use \"attorney general\" or \"attorney-general\" as the English translation of the title, although because of different historical provenance, the nature of such offices is usually different from that of attorneys-general in common law jurisdictions.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn regard to the [[etymology]] of the phrase ''Attorney General'', [[Steven Pinker]] writes that the earliest citation in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] is from 1292: \"Tous attorneyz general purrount lever fins et cirrographer\" (All general attorneys may levy fines and make legal documents).<ref name=\"SP-ZWords\">{{cite book|last1=Pinker |first1=Steven |title=Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language |date=1999 |publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY |isbn=0-465-07269-0 |pages=25, 28 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=HeA4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Steven+Pinker+Words+and+rules+:+the+ingredients+of+language&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_pKis8e7TAhXkJZoKHQ98BnkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=attorneyz%20general&f=false |accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> The phrase was borrowed from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] when England was ruled by [[Normans]] after the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] in the 11th-century. As a variety of French, which was spoken in the law courts, schools, universities and in sections of the gentry and the bourgeoisie, the term relating to government got introduced into English. The phrase ''attorney general'' is composed of a noun followed by the [[postpositive adjective]] ''general'' and as other [[English plurals#French compounds|French compounds]] its plural form also appears as ''\"attorneys generals\"''.<ref name=\"Haaretz-attorneys-general\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Attorneys Generals Protest Trump's Ban: Liberty Is Bedrock of Our Country|url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.768331|publisher=Haaretz.com|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-attorneys-generals\">{{cite web|title=Former Attorneys Generals at Work|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/19/us/politics/1-Former-Attorneys-Generals-at-Work.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> As compared to ''[[major general]]s,'' a term that also originates from French (\"[[:fr:major-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|major-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral]]\") and also has a postpositive adjective, it also appears as ''\"attorney generals\"''.

[[Christian Porter]] is the current Attorney-General. The Australian states each have separate [[Attorney-General for Australia|attorneys-general]], who are state ministers with similar responsibilities to the federal minister with respect to state law.\n\nFunctions of the state and federal attorneys-general include the administration of the selection of persons for nomination to judicial posts, and authorizing prosecutions. In normal circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the Attorney-General are exercised by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] and staff; however, the Attorney-General maintains formal control, including the power to initiate and terminate public prosecutions and take over private prosecutions. Statutory criminal law provides that prosecutions for certain offences require the individual consent of the Attorney-General. This is generally for offences whose illegality is of a somewhat controversial nature or where there is perceived to be a significant risk that prosecutions of a political nature may be embarked upon. The Attorney-General also generally has the power to issue certificates legally conclusive of certain facts (e.g., that the revelation of certain matters in court proceedings might constitute a risk to national security); the facts stated in such certificates must be accepted by the courts and cannot legally be disputed by any parties. The Attorney-General also has the power to issue a ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' with respect to a case, which authoritatively determines that the state (in whose name prosecutions are brought) does not wish to prosecute the case, so preventing any person from doing so.\n\nFor the attorneys-general of the various [[states and territories of Australia]] see:\n* [[Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory]]\n* [[Attorney-General of New South Wales]]\n* [[Attorney-General of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Queensland]]\n* [[Attorney-General of South Australia]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Tasmania]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Victoria]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Western Australia]]\n\n===Bangladesh===\n{{Main|Attorney-General of Bangladesh}}\n\n===Barbados===\n{{Main|Attorney-General of Barbados}}\n\n===British Virgin Islands===\n{{Main|Attorney General of the British Virgin Islands}}\n\n===Canada===\n{{main|Canadian Minister of Justice|Canadian Minister of Public Safety}}\nThe [[Attorney General of Canada]] ({{lang-fr|Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada}}) is a separate title held by the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Canadian Minister of Justice]] (''{{lang|fr|Ministre de la Justice}}''), a member of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]].

The plural is \"Attorneys General\" or \"Attorneys-General\".\n\n===Zimbabwe===\n{{Main|Attorney General of Zimbabwe}}\nThe Attorney General is the chief legal advisor of the government of Zimbabwe. The office falls under the [[Ministry of Justice and Legal Affairs (Zimbabwe)|Ministry of Justice and Legal Affairs]].\n\n==Similar offices in non-common law jurisdictions==\n{{see also|Advocate General|Public procurator}}\nNon-common law jurisdictions usually have one or more offices which are similar to attorneys-general in common law jurisdictions, some of which use \"attorney-general\" as the English translation of their titles.\n\n===Afghanistan===\n{{Main|Attorney General's Office of Afghanistan}}\n\n===Brazil===\n{{Main|Attorney General of the Union|Prosecutor General of the Republic}}\n\n===Crimea===\n{{Main|Prosecutor General of the Republic of Crimea}}\n\n===Dominican Republic===\n{{Main|Attorney General of the Republic (Dominican Republic)}}\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main|Chancellor of Justice (Finland)}}\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|Public Prosecutor General (Germany)}}\n\n===Hungary===\n{{main|Chief Prosecutor of Hungary}}\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{Main|Attorney General of Indonesia}}\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Ministry of Justice (Italy)}}\n\n===Mexico===\n{{Main|Attorney General (Mexico)}}\n===Netherlands===\nIn the Netherlands, there are two types of attorneys-general, that are only historically related.\n\nThe first type of attorney-general (\"advocaat-generaal\" in Dutch) is the public prosecutor in criminal cases at appellate courts.\n\nThe second type of attorney-general (\"procureur-generaal\", while their replacements are called \"advocaat-generaal\") is an independent advisor to the Supreme Court. These people give an opinion on cases (called \"conclusies\") in any field of law (not just criminal law), supported by a scientific staff. The Supreme Court may either follow or reject the opinion of the attorney-general (which is published together with the eventual decision). In a way, an attorney-general acts as yet another judge, but in the Dutch system that does not allow dissenting opinions to be published, it is the only way to reflect different perceptions on a case. The Procureur-Generaal also prosecutes members of parliament in the case of misfeance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001830/2017-01-01#Hoofdstuk3_Artikel111|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wet op de rechterlijke organisatie - BWBR0001830|website=wetten.overheid.nl|access-date=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n\nDutch attorneys-general do ''not'' normally advise the government.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Norway===\n{{main|Office of the Attorney General of Norway}}\n===Russia===\n{{main|Prosecutor General of Russia}}\n\n===Serbia===\n{{Main|Public Attorney's Office of the Republic of Serbia}}\n===Soviet Union===\n{{main|Procurator General of the USSR}}\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Spanish Attorney General}}\n===Vietnam===\n{{Main|Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam}}\n\n== List of countries, states or territories with attorneys-general ==\n{{Main list|Justice ministry#Related articles and lists}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Dabanga_Khair_confirmed_191010\">{{cite news | last1= | first1= | last2= | first2= | pages= | language = | title= Sudan appoints its first woman Chief Justice |trans-title = | date= 2019-10-10 | newspaper= [[Radio Dabanga]] | url= https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/sudan-appoints-its-first-woman-chief-justice |accessdate=2019-10-10 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20191010224602/https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/sudan-appoints-its-first-woman-chief-justice |archivedate= 2019-10-10 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first1 = Gad |last1 = Barzilai |author1-link = Gad Barzilai |first2=David |last2=Nachmias |author2-link = David Nachmias |title = The Attorney General: Authority and Responsibility |series = Principles, Institutions in Comparative Perspective, Analysis and Recommendations for Reforms |volume = No. 6 |location=[[Jerusalem]] |publisher=[[Israel Institute for Democracy]] |year=1997 }}\n* {{cite book |first = Gad |last = Barzilai |author-link = Gad Barzilai |title = The Attorney General and the State Prosecutor: Is Institutional Separation Warranted? |location = Jerusalem  |publisher=Israel Institute for Democracy |year=2010 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Attorneys General}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Attorney General}}\n[[Category:Legal professions]]\n[[Category:Attorneys general| ]]\n[[Category:Scots law formal titles]]\n[[Category:Law of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Legal ethics]]\n[[Category:Prosecution]]\n[[Category:United States law]]\n", "name_user": "Knuthove", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed double period.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general"}
