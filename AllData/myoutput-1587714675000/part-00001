Historically, the Catholic University of Leuven has been a major contributor to the development of Catholic theology. It is considered the oldest extant Catholic university. Although Catholic in heritage, it operates independently from the [[Catholic Church|Church]]. KU Leuven is open to students from different faiths.\n\n==Background and history==\n[[File:Castle Arenberg, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven adj.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kasteel van Arenberg]], purchased by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven's predecessor in 1921.]]\n{{For|the history of the pre-1970 university|Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)#History}}\n\nIn 1968, tensions between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities led to the splitting of the bilingual Catholic University of Leuven into two \"sister\" universities, with the Dutch-language university becoming a fully functioning independent institution in Leuven in 1970, and the [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain]] departing to a newly built greenfield campus site in the French-speaking part of Belgium. [[Pieter De Somer]] became the first rector of the KUL.\n\nIn 1972, the KUL set up a separate entity Leuven Research & Development (LRD) to support industrial and commercial applications of university research. It has led to [http://lrd.kuleuven.be/en/spinoff/spin-off-companies numerous spin-offs], such as the technology company Metris, and manages tens of millions of euros in investments and venture capital.\n\nThe university's electronic learning environment, TOLEDO, which started in September 2001, was gradually developed into the central electronic learning environment at the KUL. The word is an acronym for ''TOetsen en LEren Doeltreffend Ondersteunen'' (English: \"effectively supporting testing and learning\"). It is the collective name for a number of commercial software programs and tools, such as [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]]. The project offers the Question Mark Perception assignment software to all institution members and has implemented the [[Ariadne (software)|Ariadne KPS]] to reuse digital learning objects inside the Blackboard environment.\n\nOn 11 July 2002, the KU Leuven became the dominant institution in the \"KU Leuven Association\" (see below).\n\nKU Leuven is a member of the [[Coimbra Group]] (a network of leading European universities) as well as of the [[LERU|LERU Group]] (League of European Research Universities). Since November 2014, KU Leuven's Faculty of Economics and Business is accredited by [[European Quality Improvement System]], which is a leading accreditation system specializing in higher education institutions of management and business administration.<ref name=\"equis\">{{cite web|url=http://feb.kuleuven.be/home/equis|title=EFMD EQUIS Accreditation for KU Leuven's Faculty of Economics and Business}}</ref>\n\nSince August 2017, the university has been led by [[Luc Sels]] who replaced former [[rector (academia)|rector]] [[Rik Torfs]]. The [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[archbishop]], [[Andr\u00e9-Joseph L\u00e9onard]] is the current ''Grand Chancellor'' and a member of the university [[school board|board]].\n\nKU Leuven is dedicated to [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], under her traditional attribute as \"[[Seat of Wisdom]]\", and organizes an annual celebration on [[Candlemas|2 February]] in her honour. On that day, the university also awards its [[honorary doctorate]]s. The seal used by the university shows the medieval statue [[Sedes Sapientiae, Leuven|Our Lady of Leuven]] in a [[vesica piscis]] shape.\n\nIn the academic year of 2012-2013, the university held Erasmus contracts with 434 European establishments. It also had 22 central bilateral agreements in 8 countries: the United States, China, South Africa, Japan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Vietnam, Poland, and the Netherlands. The vast majority of international EU students came from the Netherlands, while most non-EU ones come from China.\n\nKU Leuven hosts the world's largest [[banana]] [[Gene bank|genebank]], the [[Bioversity International]] ''Musa'' Germplasm Transit Centre, that celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2017 and was visited by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Development Cooperation, [[Alexander De Croo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.decroo.belgium.be/en/belgian-support-innovative-agricultural-research|title=Belgian support for innovative agricultural research|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Organization and academics==\nAcademics at KU Leuven is organized into three groups, each with its own faculties, departments, and schools offering programs up to doctoral level.

Historically, the Catholic University of Leuven has been a major contributor to the development of Catholic theology. It is considered the oldest extant Catholic university.

[[Pieter De Somer]] became the first rector of the KUL.\n\nIn 1972, the KUL set up a separate entity Leuven Research & Development (LRD) to support industrial and commercial applications of university research. It has led to [http://lrd.kuleuven.be/en/spinoff/spin-off-companies numerous spin-offs], such as the technology company Metris, and manages tens of millions of euros in investments and venture capital.\n\nThe university's electronic learning environment, TOLEDO, which started in September 2001, was gradually developed into the central electronic learning environment at the KUL. The word is an acronym for ''TOetsen en LEren Doeltreffend Ondersteunen'' (English: \"effectively supporting testing and learning\"). It is the collective name for a number of commercial software programs and tools, such as [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]]. The project offers the Question Mark Perception assignment software to all institution members and has implemented the [[Ariadne (software)|Ariadne KPS]] to reuse digital learning objects inside the Blackboard environment.\n\nOn 11 July 2002, the KU Leuven became the dominant institution in the \"KU Leuven Association\" (see below).\n\nKU Leuven is a member of the [[Coimbra Group]] (a network of leading European universities) as well as of the [[LERU|LERU Group]] (League of European Research Universities).

The [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[archbishop]], [[Andr\u00e9-Joseph L\u00e9onard]] is the current ''Grand Chancellor'' and a member of the university [[school board|board]].\n\nKU Leuven is dedicated to [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], under her traditional attribute as \"[[Seat of Wisdom]]\", and organizes an annual celebration on [[Candlemas|2 February]] in her honour. On that day, the university also awards its [[honorary doctorate]]s. The seal used by the university shows the medieval statue [[Sedes Sapientiae, Leuven|Our Lady of Leuven]] in a [[vesica piscis]] shape.\n\nIn the academic year of 2012-2013, the university held Erasmus contracts with 434 European establishments. It also had 22 central bilateral agreements in 8 countries: the United States, China, South Africa, Japan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Vietnam, Poland, and the Netherlands.
