The young stems are red, shiny, resinous and sticky. \n\nThe leaves are shiny (''\"lucida\"'' = \"shiny\"), trifoliate, leathery and olive-green. The three leaflets are sub-coriaceous and obovate-cuneate, often with small notches in their rounded tips. The leaflets are the same colour above and below, with a prominent central keel and fine lateral veins visible. Damaged leaf-surfaces become pale, almost white. \n\nThe leaf's petiole (stalk) is slightly winged, at least along its upper half. \n\nIt produces creamy-white flowers from June to October, in small, sparse, terminal inflorescences. The flowers are small, with petals less than 2 mm long.  \n\nIt bears spherical fruits 4&nbsp;mm in diameter, which are initially green and turn shiny brown as they mature (Oct-Nov). The fruits are eaten by birds.<ref>http://pza.sanbi.org/searsia-lucida</ref>  \n\n===Related species===\nThis species closely resembles ''[[Searsia pallens]]'' and ''[[Searsia undulata]]'', which co-occur over much of its distribution range. \n\n''[[Searsia pallens]]'' also has a petiole that is slightly winged, but it has ovoid fruits, and leaves with 4 to 6 lateral veins per centimeter. \n''Searsia lucida'' however, has a rounded fruit, and fewer lateral veins on its leaves (only 2 or 3 per centimeter).<ref>Coates Palgrave, M.
