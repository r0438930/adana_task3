Consequently, Muslims are projected to rise from 23% of the world\u2019s population in 2010 to 30% in 2050.\n:#Muslims are expected to grow twice as fast as the overall global population (the expected annual growth rate of Muslims is projected to be 0.6 p.p. above the rate for the world\u2019s population through 2050)\n:#If current trends continue, by 2050 the number of Muslims will nearly equal the number of Christians around the world.\n:# In Europe, Muslims will make up 10% of the overall population.\n:# India will retain a [[Hindu]] majority but also will have the largest Muslim population of any country in the world, surpassing [[Indonesia]].\n:# In the United States, Judaism will no longer be the largest non-Christian religion. Muslims will be more numerous in the U.S. than people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion.\n\n:'''Reasons given for the projected growth'''\n:# The change in the world's religious is \"driven primarily by differences in fertility rates and the size of youth populations among the world's major religions, as well as by people switching faiths.\"\n:# ''Fertility rates''. The world's total population \"is expected to rise to 9.3 billion, a 35% increase\" between 2010 and 2050, However, \"over that same period, Muslims, who have a comparatively youthful population with high fertility rates, are projected to increase by 73%.\" Muslim growth benefits from the fertility factor because \"globally, Muslims have the highest fertility rate, an average of 3.1 children per woman.\" This is above a replacement level of 2.1 which is \"the minimum typically needed to maintain a stable population.\"\n:# ''Size of youth population''. \"In 2010, more than a quarter of the world's total population (27%) was under the age of 15. But a \"higher percentage of Muslims (34%) were younger than 15.\"\n:# ''Size of old population''. In 2010, \"11% of the world's population was at least 60 years old,\" but only 7% of Muslims were over 60.\n:# ''Switching''. Between 2010 and 2050 a gain of 3,220,000 Muslim adherents is projected to come through switching, mostly found in the [[Sub Saharan Africa]] (2.9 million). Also, the Muslim population are projected to add 1.3 million and lose 880,000 via switching, for a net gain of 420,000 between 2015 and 2020.\n:# ''Migration''. Migration  is the third reason for the Muslim population growth. For example, 1.8% of the projected growth in Europe is attributed to Muslims migrating in.\n\n===Asia===\n[[Islam]] is currently the largest religion in Asia. According to the [[Pew Research Center]], 27.3% of the people living in the Asia-Pacific region in 2030 will be Muslim, up from about a quarter in 2010 (24.8%) and 21.6% in 1990.<ref name=\"Pew2011Muslim\" />\n\n====India====\nIslam is the [[Growth of religion|fastest-growing religion]] in India.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/religion.aspx |title=Census of India |access-date=11 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015225409/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/religion.aspx |publisher=[[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]] |archive-date=15 October 2007}}</ref> Growth rate of Muslims has been consistently higher than the growth rate of Hindus, ever since the census data of independent India has been available.

Consequently, Muslims are projected to rise from 23% of the world\u2019s population in 2010 to 30% in 2050.\n:#Muslims are expected to grow twice as fast as the overall global population (the expected annual growth rate of Muslims is projected to be 0.6 p.p. above the rate for the world\u2019s population through 2050)\n:#If current trends continue, by 2050 the number of Muslims will nearly equal the number of Christians around the world.\n:# In Europe, Muslims will make up 10% of the overall population.\n:# India will retain a [[Hindu]] majority but also will have the largest Muslim population of any country in the world, surpassing [[Indonesia]].\n:# In the United States, Judaism will no longer be the largest non-Christian religion. Muslims will be more numerous in the U.S. than people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion.\n\n:'''Reasons given for the projected growth'''\n:# The change in the world's religious is \"driven primarily by differences in fertility rates and the size of youth populations among the world's major religions, as well as by people switching faiths.\"\n:# ''Fertility rates''. The world's total population \"is expected to rise to 9.3 billion, a 35% increase\" between 2010 and 2050, However, \"over that same period, Muslims, who have a comparatively youthful population with high fertility rates, are projected to increase by 73%.\" Muslim growth benefits from the fertility factor because \"globally, Muslims have the highest fertility rate, an average of 3.1 children per woman.\" This is above a replacement level of 2.1 which is \"the minimum typically needed to maintain a stable population.\"\n:# ''Size of youth population''. \"In 2010, more than a quarter of the world's total population (27%) was under the age of 15. But a \"higher percentage of Muslims (34%) were younger than 15.\"\n:# ''Size of old population''. In 2010, \"11% of the world's population was at least 60 years old,\" but only 7% of Muslims were over 60.\n:# ''Switching''. Between 2010 and 2050 a gain of 3,220,000 Muslim adherents is projected to come through switching, mostly found in the [[Sub Saharan Africa]] (2.9 million). Also, the Muslim population are projected to add 1.3 million and lose 880,000 via switching, for a net gain of 420,000 between 2015 and 2020.\n:# ''Migration''. Migration  is the third reason for the Muslim population growth. For example, 1.8% of the projected growth in Europe is attributed to Muslims migrating in.\n\n===Asia===\n[[Islam]] is currently the largest religion in Asia. According to the [[Pew Research Center]], 27.3% of the people living in the Asia-Pacific region in 2030 will be Muslim, up from about a quarter in 2010 (24.8%) and 21.6% in 1990.<ref name=\"Pew2011Muslim\" />\n\n====India====\nIslam is the [[Growth of religion|fastest-growing religion]] in India.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/religion.aspx |title=Census of India |access-date=11 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015225409/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/religion.aspx |publisher=[[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]] |archive-date=15 October 2007}}</ref> Growth rate of Muslims has been consistently higher than the growth rate of Hindus, ever since the census data of independent India has been available.
