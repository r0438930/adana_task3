In order to do this, the company developed porting platforms that produced [[bug compatible]] versions. The company took the same approach when the IBM PC was launched, producing a product that was essentially identical to the original 8-bit Apple II version. Sales were initially brisk, with about 300,000 copies sold.\n\nVisiCalc used the A1 notation in formulas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bricklin.com/history/saiidea.htm|title=The Idea|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lotus 1-2-3]] was launched in 1983, taking full advantage of the expanded memory and screen of the PC, VisiCalc sales ended almost overnight. Sales declined so rapidly that the company was soon insolvent. [[Lotus Development]] purchased the company in 1985, and immediately ended sales of VisiCalc and the company's other products.\n\n==History==\n{{blockquote|VISICALC represented a new idea of a way to use a computer and a new way of thinking about the world. Where conventional programming was thought of as a sequence of steps, this new thing was no longer sequential in effect: When you made a change in one place, all other things changed instantly and automatically.\n\n\u2014 [[Ted Nelson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_for_1986_1985_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_for_1986_1985_Point_djvu.txt|title=Whole Earth Software Catalog}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Dan Bricklin]] conceived VisiCalc while watching a presentation at [[Harvard Business School]]. The professor was creating a financial model on a blackboard that was ruled with vertical and horizontal lines (resembling accounting paper) to create a table, and he wrote formulas and data into the cells. When the professor found an error or wanted to change a parameter, he had to erase and rewrite several sequential entries in the table. Bricklin realized that he could replicate the process on a computer using an \"electronic spreadsheet\" to view results of underlying formulae.<ref name=\"joshcalc\">{{cite web\n <!--  | last = NONE (credited to staff writers)\n  | first =NONE (credited to staff writers) -->\n  | title =Dan Bricklin, Inventor of the Electronic Spreadsheet\n  | work = Low End Mac\n  | date = November 7, 2006\n  | url = http://lowendmac.com/2006/dan-bricklin-inventor-of-the-electronic-spreadsheet/\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =July 13, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n[[Bob Frankston]] joined Bricklin, and the pair formed the [[Software Arts]] company and developed the VisiCalc program in two months during the winter of 1978\u201379.  Bricklin wrote that\n\n<blockquote>with the years of experience we had at the time we created VisiCalc, we were familiar with many row/column financial programs. In fact, Bob had worked since the 1960s at Interactive Data Corporation, a major timesharing utility that was used for some of them and I was exposed to some at Harvard Business School in one of the classes.</blockquote>\n\nBricklin was referring to the variety of [[report generator]]s that were in use at that time, including Business Planning Language (BPL) from International Timesharing Corporation (ITS) and Foresight from Foresight Systems. However, these earlier timesharing programs were not completely interactive, and they pre-dated personal computers.\n\nFrankston described VisiCalc as a \"magic sheet of paper that can perform calculations and recalculations\", which \"allows the user to just solve the problem using familiar tools and concepts\". The [[VisiCorp|Personal Software]] company began selling VisiCalc in mid-1979 for under $100, after a demonstration at the fourth [[West Coast Computer Faire]] and an official launch on June&nbsp;4 at the [[National Computer Conference]]. It required an Apple II with 32K of [[random-access memory]] (RAM), and supported saving files to magnetic [[tape cassette]] or to Apple's [[Disk II]] floppy disk system.<ref name = \"InfoWorld Jun 1979\">{{Cite journal \n| title = VisiCalc: User-Defined Problem Solving Package \n| journal = The Intelligent Machines Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 9 | page = 22  <!-- | publisher = InfoWorld Media Group NOT IN MASTHEAD--> \n| date = June 11, 1979 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gj4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 \n| issn = 0199-6649 | quote = The formal introduction of VisiCalc is scheduled for the National Computer Conference, being held June 4\u20137, in New York City.}}</ref>\n\nVisiCalc was unusually easy to use and came with excellent documentation; Apple's developer documentation cited the software as an example of one with a simple user interface.<ref name=\"apple1982\">{{cite book | url=http://www.apple2scans.net/files/1982-A2F2116-m-a2e-aiiedg.pdf | title=Apple IIe Design Guidelines | publisher=Apple Computer |author1=Meyers, Joe |author2=Tognazzini, Bruce | year=1982 | pages=22}}</ref>{{r|aw1984}} Observers immediately noticed its power.

This allowed skilled BASIC programmers to add features, such as trigonometric functions, that VisiCalc lacked.\n\nBricklin and Frankston originally intended to fit the program into 16k memory, but they later realized that the program needed at least 32k. Even 32k was too small to support some features that the creators wanted to include, such as a split text/graphics screen. However, Apple eventually began shipping all Apple IIs with 48k memory following a drop in RAM prices, which enabled the developers to include more features. The initial release supported tape cassette storage, but that was quickly dropped.\n\nAt VisiCalc's release, Personal Software promised to port the program to other computers, starting with those that used the [[MOS Technology 6502]] microprocessor,{{r|InfoWorld Jun 1979}} and versions appeared for the Atari 800 and Commodore PET, both of which could be done easily because those computers used the same processor as the Apple II, and large portions of code could be reused. The PET version, which contained two separate executables for 40 and 80-column models, was widely criticized for having a very small amount of worksheet space due to the developers' inclusion of their own custom DOS, which used a large amount of memory (the PET only had 32k versus the Apple II's available 48k).\n\nOther ports followed for the [[Apple III]], [[Zilog Z80]]-based Tandy [[TRS-80 Model I]], [[TRS-80 Model II|Model II]], [[TRS-80 Model III|Model III]], [[TRS-80 Model 4|Model 4]], and [[Sony SMC-70]]. The TRS-80 Model I and Sony SMC-70 ports were the only versions of VisiCalc without [[copy protection]]. The Sony SMC-70 port was the only CP/M version. Most versions were disk-based, but the PET VisiCalc came with a [[dongle|ROM chip]] that the user had to install in one of the motherboard's expansion ROM sockets. The most important port was for the [[IBM PC]], and VisiCalc was one of the first commercial packages available when the IBM PC shipped in 1981.{{r|reed}} It quickly became a best-seller on this platform, in spite of being severely limited to be compatible with the versions for the 8-bit platforms. It is estimated that 300,000 copies were sold on the PC, bringing total sales to about 1 million copies.<ref name=\"langdell19850806\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvLd5Aw2T3YC&lpg=PA6&pg=PA33#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=VisiCalc Production Ends | work=PC Magazine | date=1985-08-06 | accessdate=28 October 2013 | author=Langdell, James | pages=33}}</ref>\n\nBy 1982 VisiCalc's price had risen from $100 to $250.<ref name=\"tommervik198203\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=6&id=4 | title=What Price Software? / Part 2 of The Great Arcade/Computer Controversy | work=Softline | date=March 1982 | accessdate=15 July 2014 | author=Tommervik, Allan | pages=10}}</ref> Several competitors appeared in the market, notably [[SuperCalc]]{{r|barry19811005}} and [[Multiplan]],{{r|caruso19840402}} each of which added more features and corrected deficiencies in VisiCalc, but could not overcome its market dominance. A more dramatic change occurred with the 1983 launch of [[Lotus Development Corporation]]'s [[Lotus 1-2-3]], written by a former Personal Software/VisiCorp employee, [[Mitch Kapor]], who had written VisiTrend and VisiPlot. Unlike the PC version of VisiCalc, 1-2-3 was written to take full advantage of the PC's increased memory, screen and performance. Yet it was designed to be as compatible as possible with VisiCalc, including the menu structure, to allow VisiCalc users to easily migrate to 1-2-3.\n\n1-2-3 was almost immediately successful, and by 1984 ''InfoWorld'' wrote that sales of VisiCalc were \"rapidly declining\", stating that it was \"the first successful software product to have gone through a complete [[software life cycle|life cycle]], from conception in 1978 to introduction in 1979 to peak success in 1982 to decline in 1983 to a probable death, according to industry insiders, in 1984.\" The magazine added that the company was slow to upgrade the software, only releasing an Advanced Version of VisiCalc for the Apple II in 1983 and announcing one for the IBM PC in 1984.<ref name=\"caruso19840402\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA80&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Company Strategies Boomerang | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-04-02 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | author=Caruso, Denise | pages=80\u201383}}</ref> By 1985 VisiCorp was insolvent.

In order to do this, the company developed porting platforms that produced [[bug compatible]] versions. The company took the same approach when the IBM PC was launched, producing a product that was essentially identical to the original 8-bit Apple II version. Sales were initially brisk, with about 300,000 copies sold.\n\nVisiCalc used the A1 notation in formulas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bricklin.com/history/saiidea.htm|title=The Idea|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lotus 1-2-3]] was launched in 1983, taking full advantage of the expanded memory and screen of the PC, VisiCalc sales ended almost overnight. Sales declined so rapidly that the company was soon insolvent. [[Lotus Development]] purchased the company in 1985, and immediately ended sales of VisiCalc and the company's other products.\n\n==History==\n{{blockquote|VISICALC represented a new idea of a way to use a computer and a new way of thinking about the world.

The professor was creating a financial model on a blackboard that was ruled with vertical and horizontal lines (resembling accounting paper) to create a table, and he wrote formulas and data into the cells. When the professor found an error or wanted to change a parameter, he had to erase and rewrite several sequential entries in the table. Bricklin realized that he could replicate the process on a computer using an \"electronic spreadsheet\" to view results of underlying formulae.<ref name=\"joshcalc\">{{cite web\n <!--  | last = NONE (credited to staff writers)\n  | first =NONE (credited to staff writers) -->\n  | title =Dan Bricklin, Inventor of the Electronic Spreadsheet\n  | work = Low End Mac\n  | date = November 7, 2006\n  | url = http://lowendmac.com/2006/dan-bricklin-inventor-of-the-electronic-spreadsheet/\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =July 13, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n[[Bob Frankston]] joined Bricklin, and the pair formed the [[Software Arts]] company and developed the VisiCalc program in two months during the winter of 1978\u201379.  Bricklin wrote that\n\n<blockquote>with the years of experience we had at the time we created VisiCalc, we were familiar with many row/column financial programs. In fact, Bob had worked since the 1960s at Interactive Data Corporation, a major timesharing utility that was used for some of them and I was exposed to some at Harvard Business School in one of the classes.</blockquote>\n\nBricklin was referring to the variety of [[report generator]]s that were in use at that time, including Business Planning Language (BPL) from International Timesharing Corporation (ITS) and Foresight from Foresight Systems. However, these earlier timesharing programs were not completely interactive, and they pre-dated personal computers.\n\nFrankston described VisiCalc as a \"magic sheet of paper that can perform calculations and recalculations\", which \"allows the user to just solve the problem using familiar tools and concepts\". The [[VisiCorp|Personal Software]] company began selling VisiCalc in mid-1979 for under $100, after a demonstration at the fourth [[West Coast Computer Faire]] and an official launch on June&nbsp;4 at the [[National Computer Conference]]. It required an Apple II with 32K of [[random-access memory]] (RAM), and supported saving files to magnetic [[tape cassette]] or to Apple's [[Disk II]] floppy disk system.<ref name = \"InfoWorld Jun 1979\">{{Cite journal \n| title = VisiCalc: User-Defined Problem Solving Package \n| journal = The Intelligent Machines Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 9 | page = 22  <!-- | publisher = InfoWorld Media Group NOT IN MASTHEAD--> \n| date = June 11, 1979 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gj4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 \n| issn = 0199-6649 | quote = The formal introduction of VisiCalc is scheduled for the National Computer Conference, being held June 4\u20137, in New York City.}}</ref>\n\nVisiCalc was unusually easy to use and came with excellent documentation; Apple's developer documentation cited the software as an example of one with a simple user interface.<ref name=\"apple1982\">{{cite book | url=http://www.apple2scans.net/files/1982-A2F2116-m-a2e-aiiedg.pdf | title=Apple IIe Design Guidelines | publisher=Apple Computer |author1=Meyers, Joe |author2=Tognazzini, Bruce | year=1982 | pages=22}}</ref>{{r|aw1984}} Observers immediately noticed its power.

This allowed skilled BASIC programmers to add features, such as trigonometric functions, that VisiCalc lacked.\n\nBricklin and Frankston originally intended to fit the program into 16k memory, but they later realized that the program needed at least 32k. Even 32k was too small to support some features that the creators wanted to include, such as a split text/graphics screen . However, Apple eventually began shipping all Apple IIs with 48k memory following a drop in RAM prices, which enabled the developers to include more features. The initial release supported tape cassette storage, but that was quickly dropped.\n\nAt VisiCalc's release, Personal Software promised to port the program to other computers, starting with those that used the [[MOS Technology 6502]] microprocessor,{{r|InfoWorld Jun 1979}} and versions appeared for the Atari 800 and Commodore PET, both of which could be done easily because those computers used the same processor as the Apple II, and large portions of code could be reused. The PET version, which contained two separate executables for 40 and 80-column models, was widely criticized for having a very small amount of worksheet space due to the developers' inclusion of their own custom DOS, which used a large amount of memory (the PET only had 32k versus the Apple II's available 48k).\n\nOther ports followed for the [[Apple III]], [[Zilog Z80]]-based Tandy [[TRS-80 Model I]], [[TRS-80 Model II|Model II]], [[TRS-80 Model III|Model III]], [[TRS-80 Model 4|Model 4]], and [[Sony SMC-70]]. The TRS-80 Model I and Sony SMC-70 ports were the only versions of VisiCalc without [[copy protection]]. The Sony SMC-70 port was the only CP/M version. Most versions were disk-based, but the PET VisiCalc came with a [[dongle|ROM chip]] that the user had to install in one of the motherboard's expansion ROM sockets. The most important port was for the [[IBM PC]], and VisiCalc was one of the first commercial packages available when the IBM PC shipped in 1981.{{r|reed}} It quickly became a best-seller on this platform, in spite of being severely limited to be compatible with the versions for the 8-bit platforms. It is estimated that 300,000 copies were sold on the PC, bringing total sales to about 1 million copies.<ref name=\"langdell19850806\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvLd5Aw2T3YC&lpg=PA6&pg=PA33#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=VisiCalc Production Ends | work=PC Magazine | date=1985-08-06 | accessdate=28 October 2013 | author=Langdell, James | pages=33}}</ref>\n\nBy 1982 VisiCalc's price had risen from $100 to $250.<ref name=\"tommervik198203\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=6&id=4 | title=What Price Software? / Part 2 of The Great Arcade/Computer Controversy | work=Softline | date=March 1982 | accessdate=15 July 2014 | author=Tommervik, Allan | pages=10}}</ref> Several competitors appeared in the market, notably [[SuperCalc]]{{r|barry19811005}} and [[Multiplan]],{{r|caruso19840402}} each of which added more features and corrected deficiencies in VisiCalc, but could not overcome its market dominance. A more dramatic change occurred with the 1983 launch of [[Lotus Development Corporation]]'s [[Lotus 1-2-3]], written by a former Personal Software/VisiCorp employee, [[Mitch Kapor]], who had written VisiTrend and VisiPlot. Unlike the PC version of VisiCalc, 1-2-3 was written to take full advantage of the PC's increased memory, screen and performance. Yet it was designed to be as compatible as possible with VisiCalc, including the menu structure, to allow VisiCalc users to easily migrate to 1-2-3.\n\n1-2-3 was almost immediately successful, and by 1984 ''InfoWorld'' wrote that sales of VisiCalc were \"rapidly declining\", stating that it was \"the first successful software product to have gone through a complete [[software life cycle|life cycle]], from conception in 1978 to introduction in 1979 to peak success in 1982 to decline in 1983 to a probable death, according to industry insiders, in 1984.\" The magazine added that the company was slow to upgrade the software, only releasing an Advanced Version of VisiCalc for the Apple II in 1983 and announcing one for the IBM PC in 1984.<ref name=\"caruso19840402\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA80&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Company Strategies Boomerang | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-04-02 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | author=Caruso, Denise | pages=80\u201383}}</ref> By 1985 VisiCorp was insolvent.
