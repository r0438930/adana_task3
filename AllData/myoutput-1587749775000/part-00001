However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Rock Troll colony arrive at Arendelle, and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf, and Anna accepts Kristoff's marriage proposal. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the speaking and singing voices of Kristoff's pet reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the other reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n**  [[Frank Welker]] as the vocal effects for Sven and the reindeer.\n* [[Sterling K.

At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Into the Unknown (Disney song)|Into the Unknown]]\".\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words, according to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, so please do not expand this section too much and do not include unnecessary details. -->\nKing Agnarr of Arendelle tells a story to his young children, [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]] and [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], that their grandfather, King Runeard, had established a treaty with the neighboring tribe of Northuldra by building a dam in their homeland, the Enchanted Forest. However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Rock Troll colony arrive at Arendelle, and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf, and Anna accepts Kristoff's marriage proposal. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.
