From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-[[smelting]] operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local bog iron ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.\n\nLakewood's developers thought that \"Bricksburg\" didn't capture their vision for the community, and the names \"Brightwood\" and \"Lakewood\" were proposed. After reaching out to area residents, \"Lakewood\" was chosen, and the [[United States Postal Service]] approved the name in March 1880.<ref>[http://www.villageprofile.com/newjersey/lakewood/01/topic.html History of Lakewood], VillageProfile.com.

From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-[[smelting]] operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local bog iron ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.\n\nLakewood's developers thought that \"Bricksburg\" didn't capture their vision for the community, and the names \"Brightwood\" and \"Lakewood\" were proposed. After reaching out to area residents, \"Lakewood\" was chosen, and the [[United States Postal Service]] approved the name in March 1880.<ref>[http://www.villageprofile.com/newjersey/lakewood/01/topic.html History of Lakewood], VillageProfile.com.
