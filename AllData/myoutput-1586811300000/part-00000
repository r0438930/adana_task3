Many of these troops were brought through [[Baltimore|Baltimore City]], a major transportation hub.

Randall, a native Marylander, was teaching at [[Poydras High School|Poydras College]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana]], at the time and, moved by the news of his friend's death, wrote the nine-stanza poem, \"Maryland, My Maryland\". The poem was a plea to his home state of Maryland to [[secession#Confederate States of America|secede]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and join the Confederacy. Randall later claimed the poem was written \"almost involuntarily\" in the middle of the night on April 26, 1861.
