The '''[[Malta Song for Europe]] 2008''' was a television show in which [[Malta]] selected its entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]], held in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. It was held at the [[Malta Fairs & Conventions Centre]] in [[Ta' Qali]] on 24 and 26 January, and the winning song, [[Vodka (song)|Vodka]], was sung by [[Morena (singer)|Morena]].

After the bad results in the two previous contests, some changes were made to the regulations by the MaltaSong board. Long discussions took place with UKAM (Maltese union to represent musicians) for the final regulations to be signed.  Not withstanding the proposed changes, the chosen song still failed to reach the final evening of the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest.

225 songs were submitted to compete in the first phase of the Malta Song for Europe 2008, which was judged behind closed doors. From the first phase only 36 songs made it through, judged by international jury between the 19th and 21 November 2007.

The edition was hosted by [[John Demanuele]], [[Ruth Casingena]] and [[Chiara Siracusa]].  [[Australian Idol (season 5)|Australian Idol]] winner [[Natalie Gauci]], who is of Maltese descent, performed during the national finale.

The canyon has a narrow possibility that it is necessary to move along the riverbed. A stream of water escapes from the rock wall at a height of about 20 meters. In terms of its height, water consumption and power, the Big [[Shymbulak]] waterfall is comparable to the [[Medvezhy]] waterfall in the [https://tourstokazakhstan.com/en/sights/almaty-region/turgen-gorge.html Turgen gorge]. Heavy spring precipitation also helps to increase the power of the waterfall, compared with the summer or autumn period, it is not easy to get close to the waterfall, in a few seconds you get soaked to the skin, and all this thanks to water dust. But if you cross the river, then there is not a large observation deck on the hill, where it is relatively dry. Flowing down, the water dug a deep bath at the bottom of the gorge, up to 2 meters deep. The water in this reservoir is very cold even on the hottest day, as it has a glacial origin. Spruce forests in the gorge are absent throughout its entire length. In the lower belt grows apricot and shrubs, barberry, rose hips, and other Shrubs are very prickly. For multi-day hikes, this is a big minus — the lack of firewood. Shrub vegetation is present on the slopes up to the heights of 2200–2400 m of the confluence with the [[Maybulak]] river.

In the extreme Western part of the [[Trans-Ili Alatau]] mountains, which are part of the Northern [[Tian Shan]] mountain system, the ridge sharply degrades and its height decreases (Kastek gorges). Factory gorge is located 50&nbsp;km West of [[Almaty]]. At the beginning of the gorge is the village of Fabrichny (Kargaly). In order to get to the waterfall you need to go through the village to the water supply zone and then start walking part of the trekking 8&nbsp;km long

==Protection of objects and visit period==
The object is not protected by anyone and the gorge is not included in the state national Park. The acoustic environment of the object has a favorable climate (silence, melodic sounds in nature). Recommended visiting periods: April–June; August–October. Viewing the waterfall is spectacular at any time of the day, including at night. Mobile communication is difficult. The territory of the monument has no tourist infrastructure, there is no system of tourist signs, food points, and observation platforms are not equipped.

Spruce forests in the gorge are absent throughout its entire length. In the lower belt grows apricot and shrubs, barberry, rose hips, and other Shrubs are very prickly. For multi-day hikes, this is a big minus — the lack of firewood. Shrub vegetation is present on the slopes up to the heights of 2200–2400 m of the confluence with the [[Maybulak]] river.

In the extreme Western part of the [[Trans-Ili Alatau]] mountains, which are part of the Northern [[Tian Shan]] mountain system, the ridge sharply degrades and its height decreases (Kastek gorges). Factory gorge is located 50&nbsp;km West of [[Almaty]]. At the beginning of the gorge is the village of Fabrichny (Kargaly). In order to get to the waterfall you need to go through the village to the water supply zone and then start walking part of the trekking 8&nbsp;km long

==Protection of objects and visit period==
The object is not protected by anyone and the gorge is not included in the state national Park. The acoustic environment of the object has a favorable climate (silence, melodic sounds in nature). Recommended visiting periods: April–June; August–October. Viewing the waterfall is spectacular at any time of the day, including at night. Mobile communication is difficult. The territory of the monument has no tourist infrastructure, there is no system of tourist signs, food points, and observation platforms are not equipped.

add authority control,safe,Ser Amantio di Nicolao,"'''Frank Harrison Gassaway''' was a noted American humorist and poet who often wrote under the pseudonym '''Derrick Dodd'''.  Dodd is perhaps most well known for his travel letters ''Summer Saunterings'' published under this pseudonym.  Although little is known of his personal life before he became a prominent writer in California, save that he was of a Virginian family,<ref>Brian Howard: Portrait of a Failure, Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster, Timewell Press, 2005, pg 6</ref> Dodd apparently married a southern belle from Washington D.C. named Elizabeth Paschal and fathered a son, Francis, in 1874 or 1875. Dodd's grandson was the writer [[Brian Howard (poet)|Brian Howard]].<ref>Brian Howard: Portrait of a Failure, Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster, Timewell Press, 2005, pg 6</ref> In 1880, Dodd left Washington D.C. and moved to Oakland, California where he began writing for major San Francisco papers including the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]], [[San Francisco Chronicle|Chronicle]]'' and the ''Evening Post''.  By 1892, Dodd had become the business manager for [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s paper the ''San Francisco Examiner'' and a great admirer of the leading newspaper mogul.  A volume of his poems entitled ''Poems'' was published in 1920 and was dedicated to Hearst.<ref>Green, Martin. ''Children of the Sun''. New York: Basic Books, Inc., Publishers, 1976.</ref>

== Writing career ==
Dodd contributed a humorous column to the ''Evening Post'' and gained notoriety for his Mark Twain-like style and wit.  Some of his writings from this column were compiled in 1882 as the volume ''Summer Saunterings''.  This collection of short travel narratives comments on popular hotels, landmarks and transportation routes in various California cities such as Santa Barbara, Monterey, Napa and San Jose.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem/calbkbib:@field(NUMBER+@od1(calbk+201)) Library of Congress Digital Collection]</ref>  In his later work, Dodd adopted a more serious and sentimental style, mainly writing poetry dealing with the Civil War.  His most renowned poem, \"The Pride of Battery B\" was originally published in the ''San Francisco Examiner''.  This poem, about an orphan girl who temporarily reconciles the two sides during the bloody battle of Antietam, was critically acclaimed and became a popular piece for recitations.  A compilation of Dodd's poetry was published as the volume ''Poems'' in 1920.<ref>Gassaway, Frank Harrison. ''Poems''. New York: James T. White & Co., 1920.</ref>

[[Category:Year of birth missing]]","'''Frank Harrison Gassaway''' was a noted American humorist and poet who often wrote under the pseudonym '''Derrick Dodd'''.  Dodd is perhaps most well known for his travel letters ''Summer Saunterings'' published under this pseudonym.  Although little is known of his personal life before he became a prominent writer in California, save that he was of a Virginian family,<ref>Brian Howard: Portrait of a Failure, Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster, Timewell Press, 2005, pg 6</ref> Dodd apparently married a southern belle from Washington D.C. named Elizabeth Paschal and fathered a son, Francis, in 1874 or 1875. Dodd's grandson was the writer [[Brian Howard (poet)|Brian Howard]].<ref>Brian Howard: Portrait of a Failure, Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster, Timewell Press, 2005, pg 6</ref> In 1880, Dodd left Washington D.C. and moved to Oakland, California where he began writing for major San Francisco papers including the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]], [[San Francisco Chronicle|Chronicle]]'' and the ''Evening Post''.  By 1892, Dodd had become the business manager for [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s paper the ''San Francisco Examiner'' and a great admirer of the leading newspaper mogul.  A volume of his poems entitled ''Poems'' was published in 1920 and was dedicated to Hearst.<ref>Green, Martin. ''Children of the Sun''. New York: Basic Books, Inc., Publishers, 1976.</ref>

== Writing career ==
Dodd contributed a humorous column to the ''Evening Post'' and gained notoriety for his Mark Twain-like style and wit.  Some of his writings from this column were compiled in 1882 as the volume ''Summer Saunterings''.  This collection of short travel narratives comments on popular hotels, landmarks and transportation routes in various California cities such as Santa Barbara, Monterey, Napa and San Jose.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem/calbkbib:@field(NUMBER+@od1(calbk+201)) Library of Congress Digital Collection]</ref>  In his later work, Dodd adopted a more serious and sentimental style, mainly writing poetry dealing with the Civil War.  His most renowned poem, \"The Pride of Battery B\" was originally published in the ''San Francisco Examiner''.  This poem, about an orphan girl who temporarily reconciles the two sides during the bloody battle of Antietam, was critically acclaimed and became a popular piece for recitations.  A compilation of Dodd's poetry was published as the volume ''Poems'' in 1920.<ref>Gassaway, Frank Harrison. ''Poems''. New York: James T. White & Co., 1920.</ref>

Well, I wrote this song for the Christian youth

I wanna teach kids the Christian truth

If you wanna reach those kids on the street

Then you gotta do a rap to a hip-hop beat

So I gave my sermon an urban kick

My rhymes are fly, my beats are sick

My crew is big and it keeps getting bigger

That's 'cause Jesus Christ is my nigga

Woo!

\"'''Rappin' for Jesus'''\" is a 2013 song that has been viewed over 63 million times on YouTube as of April 2020.<ref name=\"youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kppx4bzfAaE&t=1s|title=Rappin' for Jesus|last=Spinney|first=Brian|date=February 5, 2013|website=[[YouTube]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref> The song was purportedly written by a Pastor Jim Colerick and his wife Mary Sue from a church in [[Iowa]] for a youth Christian outreach program.<ref name=\"youtube\" /><ref name=\"church\">{{cite web|url=http://westdubuque2ndchurchofchrist.org/Home_Page.html|title=West Dubuque 2nd Church of Christ|publisher=www.westdubuque2ndchurchofchrist.org|accessdate=August 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418012222/http://westdubuque2ndchurchofchrist.org/Home_Page.html|archive-date=2018-04-18|url-status=live}}</ref> The original video was uploaded to [[YouTube]] by user Brian Spinney on February 5, 2013 and garnered wider attention after being posted to [[Reddit]].<ref name=\"huffpost\">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/rappin-for-jesus-music-video_n_2664664|title=Rappin' For Jesus: Music Video Births New Rap Star Of Christianity (NSFW Language)|last=Thomas|first=Emily|date=February 13, 2013|work=[[HuffPost Canada]]|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613134009/https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/rappin-for-jesus-music-video_n_2664664|archive-date=2018-06-13|accessdate=February 18, 2020}}</ref> Spinney claimed to have directed the video with his pastor while in high school.<ref name=\"dot\"/>

The website of West Dubuque 2nd Church of Christ, linked to by the original video, claims that the church closed in 2004. However, ''The Daily Dot'' pointed out that the website had been created on January 15, 2013, the same day as Spinney's YouTube channel.<ref name=\"dot\" /> In light of this, ''[[HuffPost]]'' questioned the authenticity of the video, calling it \"very peculiar indeed\".<ref name=\"huffpost\" />

The song has the chorus line \"Jesus Christ is my nigga\". Pastor Chris English, in an email to ''[[The Christian Post]]'', said the use of the word ''nigga'' was \"clearly over the line, and offensive\".<ref name=\"ChristianPost\">{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/iowa-churchs-youtube-hit-rappin-for-jesus-video-a-hoax-90460/|title=Iowa Church's YouTube Hit 'Rappin' for Jesus' Video a Hoax?|work=[[The Christian Post]]|last=Schapiro|first=Jeff|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=August 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805203854/https://www.christianpost.com/news/iowa-churchs-youtube-hit-rappin-for-jesus-video-a-hoax-90460/|archive-date=2018-08-05|url-status=live}}</ref> He thought the video, parody or not, perpetuated many negative stereotypes about Christians, and as such, would have never worked in an outreach program for young people.<ref name=\"ChristianPost\"/>

[[Dallas Observer]] also criticized the song, saying \"it's cheesy. It's bad. It's painful.\" It described the song as having a negative impact on public perception of [[Christian rap]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/dallas-christian-rappers-like-moses-uvere-adrion-butler-and-tedashii-tell-us-about-the-genre-10783580|title=Dallas' Christian Rappers Have Beats and Holy Spirit, But Is What They Do Rap?|last=Skinner|first=Paige|date=2018-06-12|website=Dallas Observer|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>

[[File:The Diver.jpg|thumb|''The Diver'']]
'''''The Diver''''' (full name:''The Diver:Regeneration'') is a [[sculpture]] by John Kaufman located in the [[River Thames]] at [[Rainham, London|Rainham]], east London. ''The Diver'' is made of [[Galvanisation|galvanised]] [[steel]] bands on a steel frame and is {{convert|15|ft|m}} tall and approximately {{convert|6|ft|m}} wide<ref name=\"pmsa\" /> and is partly submerged every high [[tide]] and totally submerged by spring and neap tides.

''The Diver'' is constructed from (approx.) 300&nbsp;m of galvanised steel banding and 3000 nuts and bolts and weighs 3&nbsp;tons.  It is secured {{convert|26|ft|m}} into the Thames mud. 

==History==
John Kaufman (1941–2002) was a self-taught sculptor living and working in the [[London Borough of Havering]], East London. Inspired by prominent public artist Don Rankin to create his own piece of public art, John embarked on the Diver project in 1995. Initially he financed the project himself but later received funding from [[Veolia|Cleanaway]], a local refuse company. Receiving mentoring from Don Rankin, support from the Havering London Borough Council in the person of Adam Nardell and additional financial support from friend, John Bowyer, John was able to complete and site the statue in August 2000 in its current location. It was installed at 3:30 am in order to avoid river traffic.

The piece is inspired by Kaufman's own family history. His grandfather Friederich Johann Andreas Kaufmann was a diver in the [[London Docks]]<ref name=\"pmsa\">[http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/UEL/HA006.htm Public Monument and Sculpture Association] – National Recording Project</ref> c. 1900. The sculpture stands as a monument to this man and all working men of the area who have worked in difficult and dangerous conditions. 

Soon after the completion of the sculpture, John fell ill and died in 2002. After his death, a wake was held at the location of the sculpture with family and friends.

==Location==
The sculpture is sited in the River Thames in Rainham, East London. It can be reached from the Ferry Lane Industrial area and Coldharbour Lane. The car park is found by passing the Tilda rice warehouse.

→‎As a phrase:format cite template,safe,Grimes2,"[[File:Monopoly Money (5589184944).jpg|thumb|Currency stacked in the game's \"bank\"]]
'''Monopoly money''' is a type of [[play money]] used in the board game ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]''. It is different from most currencies, including the [[United States dollar|American currency]] or [[Pound sterling|British currency]] upon which it is based, in that it is smaller, one-sided, and comes in different colors. Additionally, being a game element, it is not legal tender and has little to no monetary value in most jurisdictions.

==Format==

Many [[Monopoly (game)#Variants|variations]] of ''Monopoly'' exist, with many types of money representing various [[currencies]]. In the more \"standard\" versions of the game, Monopoly money consists entirely of notes. Monopoly notes come in the following colors:


The modern ''Monopoly'' game has its Monopoly money denominated in $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500, and (in some editions) $1,000, with all but the last two paralleling the denominations in circulation in the United States. (The [[Large denominations of United States currency#$500 Bill|U.S. $500 bill]] and [[Large denominations of United States currency#$1,000 Bill|U.S. $1000 bill]] were withdrawn in 1969). Monopoly does not include a two-dollar bill; however, [[Monopoly Junior]] did include the two in addition to three and four denominations (which do not exist in U.S. currency) for many years. (Monopoly Junior later simplified its system to include only one-dollar bills.)

Fans have designed unofficial $1,000 Monopoly bills for longer games and made them available online.

Special editions and spinoffs (e.g. [[Monopoly Deal]]) may use larger denominations. 

More recent ''Monopoly'' games use a ''Monopoly''-specific currency symbol of a double struck-through capital letter M, similar to the [[Won sign|Won sign (₩)]] flipped upside-down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/23909/what-is-the-monopoly-m-symbol-called|title=What is the Monopoly M Symbol called?|website=Board & Card Games Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref>

==As a phrase==
\"Monopoly money\" is also a derisive term used in multiple senses. The most common is by countries that have traditionally had [[monochromatic]] currency banknotes (such as the [[United States dollar|United States]]) to refer to countries that have colorful banknotes (such as [[Canadian dollar|Canada]]). This has been used in places such as the [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] song \"[[Canadian Idiot]]\".

It can also be used as a derisive term to refer to money not really worth anything, or at least not being used as if it is worth anything.<ref>{{cite book |title=''Playing with ‘Monopoly Money’: Phony Profits, Fraud Penalties and Equity'' |last= Boise |first= Craig M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2005 |publisher= }}</ref>

\"'''Lullaby'''\" is the fourth single from the album ''[[Love Is Here]]'' by British pop band [[Starsailor (band)|Starsailor]], released in 2001. It is the least successful single from the album, failing to make the top 30 in the UK charts.<ref name=\"Lullaby\">\"[http://www.goodsouls.org.uk/livecovers.html Lullaby]\". Chart Stats.

==Music video==
[[Image:Starsailormusicvideo.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Walsh (musician)|James Walsh]] leaving the band's room in the music video.]]

The video starts in a room where the band is playing.

The singer, James Walsh left the room with a big cup of coffee in his hands and starts to walk slowly after he throws the cup.

Since he walked the shadows starts to prosecute him but that doesn't change the peaceful environment of the whole video. At the end the shadows catch him and the music stops symbolising the step between life and death when James is in a total darkness- that could be interpreted the end of his life.

Then, the lights come back and James starts again his walk after his blue eyes are caught by the lights of the camera as the first shot which means a \"comeback to life\".

According to Leibniz, a complete individual thing (for example a person) is characterized by all its properties, and these determine its relations with other individuals. The existence of one individual may contradict the existence of another. A possible world is made up of individuals that are '''compossible'''&mdash;that is, individuals that can exist together.

When Leibniz speaks of a possible world, he means a set of compossible, finite things that God could have brought into existence if he were not constrained by the goodness that is part of his nature. The actual world, on the other hand, is simply that set of finite things that is instantiated by God, because it is greatest in goodness, reality and perfection. Naturally, the fact that we are here experiencing this world—the actual world—means that there is at least one possible world.

It represents and processes systems of [[mixed hypothetical syllogism|mixed hypothetical]] and categorical [[syllogism]]s, no matter how large and complex. The hypothetical premises or rule systems are represented in River graphics that are tributary structures like [[Ishikawa diagram]]s that may be nested to any depth required by the expertise.

Instructions on the user’s categorical premises are received as input when answers are given to questions in the communication system of the interface. Each [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[consequent]] in the rule system is represented as a node in the River graphic, and each node has a question with three alternative answers: positive, negative and uncertain. As answers are selected by the user, their node labels appear as feedback in the appropriate adversarial case window and the Current result is available in the Current result window if the Current result button is pressed.

The answers are alternate three values and there is a fourth value, unanswered, allowed in the combinatoric deductive processing, where the user does not select an answer. Thus the process simulates the application of a [[four value logic]]. Its [[heuristics]] incorporate expert priorities in [[logical conjunction|conjunctions]] and [[logical disjunction|disjunctions]], in determining pro tem and Final consequents throughout a consultation.

Each node may also be glossed in different ways. A spectrum gloss is available to represent inductive instances that fall into the three categories of positive, negative and uncertain, as data to assist the selection of answers. Abductive glosses may take free form as text providing justification or reasons for a rule or part thereof. There may also be gloss links to other programs or websites that provide further understanding of the rule system and what input should be given by the user.
