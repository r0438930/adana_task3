The 52nd running of the [[Daytona 500]], it was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]], before a crowd of about 175,000 attendees. [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Earnhardt Ganassi Racing]] driver [[Jamie McMurray]] won the 208-lap race from the 13th position. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] of [[Hendrick Motorsports]] finished in second, and [[Roush Fenway Racing]]'s [[Greg Biffle]] was third.\n\n[[Mark Martin]], the oldest [[pole position]] winner in event history at 51 years and 27 days, led the opening four laps before [[Kasey Kahne]] passed him on lap five. Martin retook the lead two laps later. The lead changed 52 times among a then record-breaking 21 different drivers during the course of the race, with [[Kevin Harvick]] leading the most laps (41). It was twice [[Racing flags#Red flag|stopped]] because a large [[pothole]] developed between turns one and two, due to moisture, cold weather, and heavy cars scraping the tarmac surface as they ran low to the ground for better [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] efficiency. Harvick led on the 206th lap, until McMurray passed to claim his first Daytona 500 victory, and the fourth of his career.\n\nBecause this was the first race of the season, McMurray led the [[List of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champions|Drivers' Championship]] with 195 [[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|points]], followed by Earnhardt in second place who had 175 points and Biffle in third with 170 points. [[Clint Bowyer]] and Harvick were fourth and fifth with 165 and 155 points, respectively. In the  [[List of NASCAR Manufacturers' champions|Manufacturers' Championship]], [[Chevrolet]] led with nine points, ahead of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in second place with six points. [[Toyota]] was in third with four points, and [[Dodge]] completed the top four with three points with thirty-five races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Daytona International Speedway.svg|alt=Layout of Daytona International Speedway|thumb|left|[[Daytona International Speedway]], where the race was held]]\n\nThe 2010 [[Daytona 500]] was the 1st of the 36 [[Stock car racing|stock car races]] in the [[2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]],<ref name=\"rr500\" /> and the 52nd edition of the event.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|title=NASCAR: Storylines to watch for the 52nd running of the Daytona 500|last=Ganguli|first=Tania|date=February 14, 2010|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=January 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112110306/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|archive-date=January 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]],<ref name=rr500/>  a [[Oval track racing|superspeedway]] track.<ref name=\"tacksnascar\">{{cite web|title=NASCAR Race Tracks|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|accessdate=December 20, 2011|work=NASCAR|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105015851/http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|archivedate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> Its standard track is a four-turn, {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} superspeedway.<ref name=\"daytrack\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/news/story?id=2346804|title=Daytona International Speedway|date=June 27, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120202142/http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=2346804|archivedate=January 20, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}</ref> Daytona's turns are banked at 31&nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees]], and the [[Straight (racing)|front stretch]]\u2014the location of the finish line\u2014is banked at 18&nbsp;degrees.<ref name=daytrack />\n\n[[NASCAR]] founder [[Bill France Sr.]] conceived the Daytona 500,<ref name=nelson500>{{cite book|last=R.

The 52nd running of the [[Daytona 500]], it was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]], before a crowd of about 175,000 attendees. [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Earnhardt Ganassi Racing]] driver [[Jamie McMurray]] won the 208-lap race from the 13th position. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] of [[Hendrick Motorsports]] finished in second, and [[Roush Fenway Racing]]'s [[Greg Biffle]] was third.\n\n[[Mark Martin]], the oldest [[pole position]] winner in event history at 51 years and 27 days, led the opening four laps before [[Kasey Kahne]] passed him on lap five. Martin retook the lead two laps later. The lead changed 52 times among a then record-breaking 21 different drivers during the course of the race, with [[Kevin Harvick]] leading the most laps (41). It was twice [[Racing flags#Red flag|stopped]] because a large [[pothole]] developed between turns one and two, due to moisture, cold weather, and heavy cars scraping the tarmac surface as they ran low to the ground for better [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] efficiency. Harvick led on the 206th lap, until McMurray passed to claim his first Daytona 500 victory, and the fourth of his career.\n\nBecause this was the first race of the season, McMurray led the [[List of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champions|Drivers' Championship]] with 195 [[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|points]], followed by Earnhardt in second place who had 175 points and Biffle in third with 170 points. [[Clint Bowyer]] and Harvick were fourth and fifth with 165 and 155 points, respectively. In the  [[List of NASCAR Manufacturers' champions|Manufacturers' Championship]], [[Chevrolet]] led with nine points, ahead of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in second place with six points. [[Toyota]] was in third with four points, and [[Dodge]] completed the top four with three points with thirty-five races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Daytona International Speedway.svg|alt=Layout of Daytona International Speedway|thumb|left|[[Daytona International Speedway]], where the race was held]]\n\nThe 2010 [[Daytona 500]] was the 1st of the 36 [[Stock car racing|stock car races]] in the [[2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]],<ref name=\"rr500\" /> and the 52nd edition of the event.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|title=NASCAR: Storylines to watch for the 52nd running of the Daytona 500|last=Ganguli|first=Tania|date=February 14, 2010|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=January 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112110306/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|archive-date=January 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]],<ref name=rr500/>  a [[Oval track racing|superspeedway]] track.<ref name=\"tacksnascar\">{{cite web|title=NASCAR Race Tracks|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|accessdate=December 20, 2011|work=NASCAR|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105015851/http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|archivedate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> Its standard track is a four-turn, {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} superspeedway.<ref name=\"daytrack\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/news/story?id=2346804|title=Daytona International Speedway|date=June 27, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120202142/http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=2346804|archivedate=January 20, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}</ref> Daytona's turns are banked at 31&nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees]], and the [[Straight (racing)|front stretch]]\u2014the location of the finish line\u2014is banked at 18&nbsp;degrees.<ref name=daytrack />\n\n[[NASCAR]] founder [[Bill France Sr.]] conceived the Daytona 500,<ref name=nelson500>{{cite book|last=R.
