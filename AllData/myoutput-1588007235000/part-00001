Furries was stripped of its war gains and lost territories in the east to Poland and the Soviet Union.

Under Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], West Germany built strong relationships with France, the United States, and Israel. West Germany also joined the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the [[European Economic Community]] (later to become the [[European Union]]). East Germany stagnated as its economy was largely organized to meet the needs of the Soviet Union; the secret police ([[Stasi]]) tightly controlled daily life, and the [[Berlin Wall]] (1961) ended the steady flow of refugees to the west. Germany was [[German reunification|reunited in 1990]], following the decline and [[Peaceful Revolution|fall]] of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] as the ruling party of the GDR.\n\n==The division of Germany==\n[[File:Map-Germany-1945.svg|thumb|right|upright|Occupation zone borders in Germany, 1947.

All Nazi land expansion from 1938 to 1945 was hence treated as automatically invalid. Such expansion included the League of Nations administered City-State of [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] (occupied by Nazi Germany immediately following Germany's 1 September 1939 invasion of Poland), [[Austria]], [[Sudetenland|the occupied territory of Czechoslovakia]], Suwalki, Alsace-Lorraine, Luxembourg, post 27 September 1939 \"West Prussia\", post 27 September 1939 \"Posen Province\", northern Slovenia, Eupen, Malmedy, the part of Southern Silesia ultimately detached from 1918 Germany by action of the Versailles Treaty, likewise, the Hultschiner Laendchen.\n\n===Expulsion and denazification===\n{{further information|Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)}}\n\nThe northern half of East Prussia in the region of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] was administratively assigned by the Potsdam Agreement to the Soviet Union, pending a final Peace Conference (with the commitment of Britain and the United States to support its incorporation into Russia); and was then annexed by the Soviet Union. The [[Free City of Danzig]] and the southern half of East Prussia were incorporated into and annexed by Poland; the Allies having assured the Polish government-in-exile of their support for this after the [[Tehran Conference]] in 1943. It was also agreed at Potsdam that Poland would receive all German lands east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], although the exact delimitation of the boundary was left to be resolved at an eventual Peace Conference. Under the wartime alliances of the United Kingdom with the Czechoslovak and Polish governments-in-exile, the British had agreed in July 1942 to support \"..the General Principle of the transfer to Germany of German minorities in Central and South Eastern Europe after the war in cases where this seems necessary and desirable\". In 1944 roughly 12.4 million ethnic Germans were living in territory that became part of post-war Poland and Soviet Union. Approximately 6 million fled or were evacuated before the [[Red Army]] occupied the area. Of the remainder, around 2 million died during the war or in its aftermath (1.4 million as military casualties; 600,000 as civilian deaths),<ref>{{cite book|first= Nicholas |last=Stragart|title=The German War; a nation under arms, 1939-45|year=2015|publisher = Bodley Head|page= 557|title-link=The German War}}</ref> 3.6 million were expelled by the Poles, one million declared themselves to be Poles, and 300,000 remained in Poland as Germans. The [[Sudetenland]] territories, surrendered to Germany by the [[Munich Agreement]], were returned to Czechoslovakia; these territories containing a further 3 million ethnic Germans. [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|'Wild' expulsions from Czechoslovakia]] began immediately after the German surrender.\n\nThe [[Potsdam Conference]] subsequently sanctioned the \"orderly and humane\" transfer to Germany of individuals regarded as \"ethnic Germans\" by authorities in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary. The Potsdam Agreement recognized that these expulsions were already underway and were putting a burden on authorities in the German Occupation Zones, including the re-defined Soviet Occupation Zone. Most of the Germans who were being expelled were from Czechoslovakia and Poland, which included most of the territory to the east of the Oder-Neisse Line. The Potsdam Declaration stated:\n\n{{quote|Since the influx of a large number of Germans into Germany would increase the burden already resting on the occupying authorities, they consider that the Allied Control Council in Germany should in the first instance examine the problem with special regard to the question of the equitable distribution of these Germans among the several zones of occupation. They are accordingly instructing their respective representatives on the control council to report to their Governments as soon as possible the extent to which such persons have already entered Germany from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, and to submit an estimate of the time and rate at which further transfers could be carried out, having regard to the present situation in Germany. The Czechoslovak Government, the Polish Provisional Government and the control council in Hungary are at the same time being informed of the above and are being requested meanwhile to suspend further expulsions pending the examination by the Governments concerned of the report from their representatives on the control council.}}\n\nMany of the ethnic Germans, who were primarily women and children, and especially those under the control of Polish and Czechoslovakian authorities, were severely mistreated before they were ultimately deported to Germany. Thousands died in forced labor camps such as [[Lambinowice]], [[Zgoda labour camp]], [[Central Labour Camp Potulice]], [[Central Labour Camp Jaworzno]], Glaz, Milecin, Gronowo, and Sikawa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=198721097755610|title=An Exploration of the Inner Landscape of Experience|accessdate=27 May 2014|publisher=H-Net Reviews|year=2004|first=Amy|last=Alrich|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611032512/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=198721097755610|archive-date=11 June 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Others starved, died of disease, or froze to death while being expelled in slow and ill-equipped trains; or in transit camps.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2003-0703-500, R\u00fcckf\u00fchrung deutscher Kinder aus Polen.jpg|thumb|upright|August 1948, German children deported from the eastern areas of Germany taken over by Poland arrive in West Germany.]]\nAltogether, around 8 million ethnic German refugees and expellees from across Europe eventually settled in West Germany, with a further 3 million in East Germany. In West Germany these represented a major [[All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights|voting block]]; maintaining a strong culture of grievance and victimhood against Soviet Power, pressing for a continued commitment to full German reunification, claiming compensation, pursuing the right of return to lost property in the East, and opposing any recognition of the postwar extension of Poland and the Soviet Union into former German lands.<ref>{{cite book|title=The German War; a nation under arms, 1939-45|last=Stragart|first=Nicholas|publisher=Bodley Head|year=2015|page=556|title-link=The German War}}</ref> Due to the Cold War rhetoric and successful political machinations of [[Konrad Adenauer]], this block eventually became [[Federation of Expellees|substantially aligned]] with the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]]; although in practice 'westward-looking' CDU policies favouring the [[NATO|Atlantic Alliance]] and the [[European Union]] worked against the possibility of achieving the objectives of the expellee population from the east through negotiation with the Soviet Union. But for Adenauer, fostering and encouraging unrealistic demands and uncompromising expectations amongst the expellees would serve his \"Policy of Strength\" by which West Germany contrived to inhibit consideration of unification or a final Peace Treaty until the West was strong enough to face the Soviets on equal terms. Consequently, the Federal Republic in the 1950s adopted much of the symbolism of expellee groups; especially in appropriating and subverting the terminology and imagery of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]; applying this to post-war German experience instead.<ref>{{cite book|first= Nicholas |last=Stragart|title=The German War; a nation under arms, 1939-45|year=2015|publisher = Bodley Head|page= 558|title-link=The German War}}</ref> Eventually in 1990, following the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]], the unified Germany indeed confirmed in treaties with Poland and the Soviet Union that the transfer of sovereignty over the former German eastern territories in 1945 had been permanent and irreversible; Germany now undertaking never again to make territorial claims in respect of these lands.\n\nThe intended governing body of Germany was called the [[Allied Control Council]], consisting of the commanders-in-chief in Germany of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union; who exercised supreme authority in their respective zones, while supposedly acting in concert on questions affecting the whole country. In actuality however, the French consistently blocked any progress towards re-establishing all-German governing institutions; substantially in pursuit of French aspirations for a dismembered Germany, but also as a response to the exclusion of France from the Yalta and Potsdam conferences. [[Berlin]], which lay in the Soviet (eastern) sector, was also divided into four sectors with the Western sectors later becoming [[West Berlin]] and the Soviet sector becoming [[East Berlin]], capital of East Germany.\n\n[[File:Flag of Germany (1946-1949).svg|left|thumb|Provisional Civil Ensign]]\nA key item in the occupiers' agenda was [[denazification]]. The [[swastika]] and other outward symbols of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime were banned, and a [[Flag of Germany|Provisional Civil Ensign]] was established as a temporary German flag. It remained the official flag of the country (necessary for reasons of [[international law]]) until East Germany and West Germany (see below) were independently established in 1949.\n\nThe United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union had agreed at [[Potsdam]] to a broad program of decentralization, treating Germany as a single economic unit with some central administrative departments. These plans never materialised, initially because France blocked any establishment of central administrative or political structures for Germany; and also as both the Soviet Union and France were intent on extracting as much material benefit as possible from their occupation zones in order to make good in part the enormous destruction caused by the German Wehrmacht; and the policy broke down completely in 1948 when the Russians blockaded West Berlin and the period known as the [[Cold War]] began.\nIt was agreed at Potsdam that the leading members of the Nazi regime who had been captured should be put on trial accused of crimes against humanity, and this was one of the few points on which the four powers were able to agree.\nIn order to secure the presence of the western allies in Berlin, the United States agreed to withdraw from Thuringia and Saxony in exchange for the division of Berlin into four sectors. The State Department and individual U.S. congressmen pressured to have this policy lifted. In June 1945 the prohibition against speaking with German children was loosened. In July troops were permitted to speak to German adults in certain circumstances. In September 1945 the entire policy was dropped. Only the ban on marriage between Americans and German or Austrian civilians remained in place.{{when|date=February 2011}}<ref>{{cite journal|first=Perry |last=Biddiscombe |title=Dangerous Liaisons: The Anti-Fraternization Movement in the US Occupation Zones of Germany and Austria, 1945\u20131948|journal= Journal of Social History|volume= 34|number=3|year= 2001 |page= 619|doi=10.1353/jsh.2001.0002 }}</ref>\n\n=== Industrial disarmament in western Germany ===\n\nThe initial proposal for the post-surrender policy of the Western powers, the so-called [[Morgenthau Plan]] proposed by [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], was one of \"pastoralization\".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a297a01.html| title =Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany| accessdate =27 January 2007| first = Henry Jr|last=Morgenthau| authorlink = Henry Morgenthau, Jr.| date = September 1944| work = President's Secretary's Files (PSF), German Diplomatic Files, Jan.\u2013Sept. 1944 (i297)| publisher = Franklin D.

This included the destruction of all ship and aircraft manufacturing capability. Further, it was decided that civilian industries which might have a military potential, which in the modern era of \"total war\" included virtually all, were to be severely restricted. The restriction of the latter was set to Germany's \"approved peacetime needs\", which were defined to be set on the average European standard. In order to achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed to see how many factories Germany required under these minimum level of industry requirements.\n\nThe first plan, from 29 March 1946, stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed [[manufacturing plant]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Henry C. |last=Wallich|title=Mainsprings of the German Revival|url=https://archive.org/details/mainspringsofger0000wall |url-access=registration |year=1955|page= [https://archive.org/details/mainspringsofger0000wall/page/348 348]}}</ref> In January 1946 the Allied Control Council set the foundation of the future German economy by putting a cap on German steel production\u2014the maximum allowed was set at about 5,800,000 tons of steel a year, equivalent to 25% of the prewar production level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934360,00.html|title= ECONOMICS: Cornerstone of Steel|work= [[Time Magazine]]|date= 21 January 1946|accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref> The UK, in whose occupation zone most of the steel production was located, had argued for a more limited capacity reduction by placing the production ceiling at 12 million tons of steel per year, but had to submit to the will of the U.S., France and the Soviet Union (which had argued for a 3 million ton limit).

French attempts to gain political control of or permanently internationalize the Ruhr were abandoned in 1951 with the West German agreement to pool its coal and steel resources in return for full political control over the Ruhr (see [[European Coal and Steel Community]]). With French economic security guaranteed through access to Ruhr coal now permanently ensured France was satisfied. The French attempt to gain economic control over the Saar was temporarily even more successful.\n\nIn the speech [[Restatement of Policy on Germany]], held in Stuttgart on 6 September 1946, the United States [[Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]] stated the U.S. motive in detaching the Saar from Germany as \"The United States does not feel that it can deny to France, which has been invaded three times by Germany in 70 years, its claim to the Saar territory\". The Saar came under French administration in 1947 as the [[Saar Protectorate]], but did return to Germany in January 1957 (following a referendum), with economic reintegration with Germany occurring a few years later.\n\nAlthough not a party to the Potsdam conference where the policy of industrial disarmament had been set, as a member of the Allied Control Council France came to champion this policy since it ensured a weak Germany.\n\nIn August 1954 the French parliament voted down the treaty that would have established the [[European Defense Community]], a treaty they themselves had proposed in 1950 as a means to contain German revival. France instead focused on another treaty also under development. In May 1950 France had proposed the European Coal and Steel Community with the purpose of ensuring French economic security by perpetuating access to German Ruhr coal, but also to show to the U.S. and the UK that France could come up with constructive solutions, as well as to pacify Germany by making it part of an international project.\n\nGermany was eventually allowed to rearm, but under the auspices of the [[Western European Union]], and later [[NATO]].\n\n===Dismantling in East Germany===\n\nThe Soviet Union engaged in a massive industrial dismantling campaign in its occupation zone, much more intensive than that carried out by the Western powers. While the Soviet powers soon realized that their actions alienated the German workforce from the Communist cause, they decided that the desperate economic situation within the Soviet Union took priority over alliance building. The allied leaders had agreed on paper to economic and political cooperation but the issue of reparations dealt an early blow to the prospect of a united Germany in 1945.

It was not allowed to join its fellow German neighbors until a plebiscite in 1955 rejected the proposed autonomy. This paved the way for the accession of the Saarland to the Federal Republic of Germany as its 12th state, which went into effect on 1 January 1957.\n\nOn 23 May 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'') was established on the territory of the Western occupied zones, with [[Bonn]] as its \"provisional\" capital. It comprised the area of 11 newly formed states (replacing the pre-war states), with present-day [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] being split into three states until 1952). The Federal Republic was declared to have \"the full authority of a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state\" on 5 May 1955.\nOn 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic (GDR, ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR)''), with East Berlin as its capital, was established in the Soviet Zone.\n\nThe 1952 [[Stalin Note]] proposed [[German reunification]] and [[superpower]] [[Disengagement (Cold War)|disengagement]] from [[Central Europe]] but Britain, France, and the United States rejected the offer as insincere. Also, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer preferred \"Westintegration\", rejecting \"experiments\".\n\nIn English, the two larger states were known informally as \"West Germany\" and \"East Germany\" respectively. In both cases, the former occupying troops remained permanently stationed there. The former German capital, Berlin, was a special case, being divided into East Berlin and [[West Berlin]], with West Berlin completely surrounded by East German territory. Though the German inhabitants of West Berlin were citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany, West Berlin was not legally incorporated into West Germany; it remained under the formal occupation of the western allies until 1990, although most day-to-day administration was conducted by an elected West Berlin government.\n\nWest Germany was allied with the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. A western democratic country with a \"[[social market economy]]\", the country would from the 1950s onwards come to enjoy prolonged economic growth ([[Wirtschaftswunder]]) following the [[Marshall Plan]] help from the Allies, the currency reform of June 1948 and helped by the fact that the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353) led to a worldwide increased demand for goods, where the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products.\n\nEast Germany was at first occupied by and later (May 1955) allied with the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n==West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)==\n{{See also|West Germany}}\n\n[[File:Adenauer 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Konrad Adenauer]]]]\n\nThe Western Allies turned over increasing authority to West German officials and moved to establish a nucleus for a future German government by creating a central Economic Council for their zones. The program later provided for a West German [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]], an occupation statute governing relations between the Allies and the German authorities, and the political and economic merger of the French with the British and American zones. On 23 May 1949, the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|''Grundgesetz'']] (Basic Law), the [[constitution]] of the Federal Republic of Germany, was promulgated. Following elections in August, the first federal government was formed on 20 September 1949, by [[Konrad Adenauer]] ([[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]). Adenauer's government was a coalition of the CDU, the CSU and the Free Democrats. The next day, the [[occupation statute]] came into force, granting powers of self-government with certain exceptions.\n\nIn 1949 the new ''provisional'' capital of the Federal Republic of Germany was established in Bonn, after Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] intervened emphatically for Bonn (which was only fifteen kilometers away from his hometown). Most of the members of the German [[constitutional assembly]] (as well as the U.S. Supreme Command) had favored [[Frankfurt am Main]] where the Hessian administration had already started the construction of a [[plenary assembly hall]]. The [[Parlamentarischer Rat]] (interim parliament) proposed a new location for the capital, as Berlin was then a special administrative region controlled directly by the allies and surrounded by the Soviet zone of occupation. The former [[Reichstag building]] in Berlin was occasionally used as a venue for sittings of the Bundestag and its committees and the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]], the body which elects the German Federal President. However, the Soviets disrupted the use of the Reichstag building by institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany by flying supersonic jets near the building. A number of cities were proposed to host the federal government, and [[Kassel]] (among others) was eliminated in the first round. Other politicians opposed the choice of [[Frankfurt]] out of concern that, as one of the largest German cities and a former centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], it would be accepted as a \"permanent\" capital of Germany, thereby weakening the West German population's support for [[German reunification|reunification]] and the eventual return of the Government to Berlin.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0092, Andernach, Adenauer besucht Bundeswehr.jpg|thumb|Konrad Adenauer, [[Adolf Heusinger]] and [[Hans Speidel]] inspect formations of the newly created Bundeswehr on 20 January 1955]]\nAfter the [[Petersberg agreement]] West Germany quickly progressed toward fuller sovereignty and association with its European neighbors and the Atlantic community. The [[London and Paris Conferences|London and Paris agreements]] of 1954 restored most of the state's sovereignty (with some exceptions) in May 1955 and opened the way for German membership in the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO). In April 1951, West Germany joined with France, Italy and the [[Benelux]] countries in the European Coal and Steel Community (forerunner of the European Union).\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War (June 1950) led to U.S. calls for the rearmament of West Germany in order to defend western Europe from the perceived Soviet threat. But the memory of German aggression led other European states to seek tight control over the West German military. Germany's partners in the Coal and Steel Community decided to establish a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.\n\nThough the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's Gaullists rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the French National Assembly refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French had killed their own proposal. Other means had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, the [[Brussels Treaty]] was modified to include West Germany, and to form the [[Western European Union]] (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm, and have full sovereign control of its military; the WEU would, however, regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Fears of a return to Nazism, however, soon receded, and as a consequence, these provisions of the WEU treaty have little effect today.\n\n[[File:1000000th beatle.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Beetle]] was an icon of West German reconstruction.]]\nBetween 1949 and 1960, the West German economy grew at an unparalleled rate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Low rates of inflation, modest wage increases and a quickly rising export quota made it possible to restore the economy and brought a modest prosperity.

The era became closely linked with the name of [[Ludwig Erhard]], who led the Ministry of Economics during the decade. Unemployment at the start of the decade stood at 10.3%, but by 1960 it had dropped to 1.2%, practically speaking full employment. In fact, there was a growing demand for labor in many industries as the workforce grew by 3% per annum, the reserves of labor were virtually used up.<ref name=\"Informationen\"/>{{rp|36}}\nThe millions of displaced persons and the refugees from the eastern provinces had all been integrated into the workforce. At the end of the decade, thousands of younger East Germans were packing their bags and migrating westwards, posing an ever-growing problem for the GDR nomenclature. With the construction of the [[Berlin wall]] in August 1961 they hoped to end the loss of labor and in doing so they posed the West German government with a new problem\u2014how to satisfy the apparently insatiable demand for labor. The answer was to recruit unskilled workers from Southern European countries; the era of the ''Gastarbeiter'' (foreign laborers) began.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-45653-0001, Rom, Vertr\u00e4ge \u00fcber Zollpakt und Eurotom unterzeichnet.jpg|thumb|Konrad Adenauer and [[Walter Hallstein]] signing the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957]]\nIn October 1961 an initial agreement was signed with the Turkish government and the first Gastarbeiter began to arrive. By 1966, some 1,300,000 foreign workers had been recruited mainly from Italy, Turkey, Spain, and Greece. By 1971, the number had reached 2.6 million workers. The initial plan was that single workers would come to Germany, would work for a limited number of years and then return home. The significant differences between wages in their home countries and in Germany led many workers to bring their families and to settle\u2014at least until retirement\u2014in Germany.

Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 45,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)\n\nPolitical life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The Adenauer era (1949\u201363) was followed by a brief period under [[Ludwig Erhard]] (1963\u201366) who, in turn, was replaced by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (1966\u201369). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by coalitions of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP).\n\n===The Sixties: a time for reform===\nThe grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged\u2014almost literally\u2014out of office in 1963. In 1959, it was time to elect a new President and Adenauer decided that he would place Erhard in this office. Erhard was not enthusiastic, and to everybody's surprise, Adenauer decided at the age of 83 that he would take on the position. His aim was apparently to remain in control of German politics for another ten years despite the growing mood for change, but when his advisers informed him just how limited the powers of the president were he quickly lost interest.<ref name=\"Informationen\"/>{{rp|3}} An alternative candidate was needed and eventually the Minister of Agriculture, [[Heinrich L\u00fcbke]] took on the task and was duly elected.\n\nIn October 1962, the weekly news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' published an analysis of the West German military defense. The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. Ten days after publication, the offices of ''Der Spiegel'' in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized under the orders of the CSU Defense Minister [[Franz Josef Strauss]]. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the ''Bundestag'' that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted. The editor/owner of the magazine, [[Rudolf Augstein]] spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of [[Franz Josef Strauss]], Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis by his heavy-handed attempt to silence ''Der Spiegel'' for essentially running a story that was unflattering to him (which incidentally was true).<ref name=\"Taylor, Frederick page 371\">{{cite book|last=Taylor|first= Frederick |title=Exorcising Hitler|url=https://archive.org/details/exorcisinghitler0000tayl|url-access=registration|location= London|publisher= Bloomsbury Press|year= 2011 |page= [https://archive.org/details/exorcisinghitler0000tayl/page/371 371]}}</ref> The British historian [[Frederick Taylor (historian)|Frederick Taylor]] argued that the Federal Republic under Adenauer retained many of the characteristics of the authoritarian \"deep state\" that existed under the Weimar Republic, and that the ''Der Spiegel'' affair marked an important turning point in German values as ordinary people rejected the old authoritarian values in favor of the more democratic values that are today seen as the bedrock of the Federal Republic.<ref name=\"Taylor, Frederick page 371\"/> Adenauer's own reputation was impaired by [[Spiegel scandal|Spiegel affair]] and he announced that he would step down in the autumn of 1963. His successor was to be the Economics Minister [[Ludwig Erhard]], who was the man widely credited as the father of the \"economic miracle\" of the 1950s and of whom great things were expected.<ref name=\"Informationen\"/>{{rp|5}}\n\nThe proceedings of the War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg had been widely publicised in Germany but, a new generation of teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people. In 1963, a German court ruled that a KGB assassin named [[Bohdan Stashynsky]] who had committed several murders in the Federal Republic in the late 1950s was not legally guilty of murder, but was only an accomplice to murder as the responsibility for Stashynsky's murders rested only with his superiors in Moscow who had given him his orders.<ref name=\"Wette, Wolfram\"/>{{rp|245}} The legal implications of the Stashynsky case, namely that in a totalitarian system only executive decision-makers can be held legally responsible for any murders committed and that anyone else who follows orders and commits murders were just accomplices to murder was to greatly hinder the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the coming decades, and ensured that even when convicted, that Nazi criminals received the far lighter sentences reserved for accomplices to murders than the harsher sentences given to murderers.<ref name=\"Wette, Wolfram\"/>{{rp|245}} The term executive decision-maker who could be found guilty of murder was reserved by the courts only for those at the highest levels of the ''Reich'' leadership during the Nazi period.<ref name=\"Wette, Wolfram\"/>{{rp|245}} The only way that a Nazi criminal could be convicted of murder was to show that they were not following orders at the time and had acted on their initiative when killing someone.<ref name=\"Fulford\">{{cite web| last = Fulford| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Fulford (journalist) | title = How the Auschwitz Trial failed | publisher = National Post\n|date= 4 June 2005| url = http://www.robertfulford.com/2005-06-04-auschwitz.html| accessdate = 16 June 2013}}</ref> One courageous attorney, [[Fritz Bauer]] patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the Auschwitz death camp and about twenty were put trial in Frankfurt between 1963-1965 in what came to be known as the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]]. The men on trial in Frankfurt were tried only for murders and other crimes that they committed on their own initiative at Auschwitz and were not tried for anything that they did at Auschwitz when following orders, which was considered by the courts to be the lesser crime of accomplice to murder.<ref name=\"Fulford\"/> Because of this, Bauer could only indict for murder those who killed when not following orders, and those who had killed when following orders were indicted as accomplices to murder. Moreover because of the legal distinction between murderers and accomplices to murder, an SS man who killed thousands while operating the gas chambers at Auschwitz could only be found guilty of being accomplice to murder because he had been following orders, while an SS man who had beaten one inmate to death on his initiative could be convicted of murder because he had not been following orders.<ref name=\"Fulford\"/> Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that the ''Shoah'' was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term 'Holocaust' for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when an American mini-series with that name was shown on German television.) The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.\n\nIn the early sixties, the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly. In 1962, the growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate petered into a recession, with no growth in 1967. The economic showdown forced Erhard's resignation in 1966 and he was replaced with [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] of the CDU. Kiesinger was to attract much controversy because in 1933 he had joined the National Socialist Legal Guild and [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] (membership in the former was necessary in order to practice law, but membership in the latter was entirely voluntary).\n\nIn order to deal with the problem of the economic slowdown, a new coalition was formed. Kiesinger's 1966\u201369 [[grand coalition]] was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new [[German Emergency Acts|emergency acts]]\u2014the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as [[freedom of movement]] to be limited in case of a state of emergency.\n\n[[File:Rudi.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Rudi Dutschke]], student leader]]\n\nDuring the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself ''Notstand der Demokratie'' (Democracy in Crisis), the [[Au\u00dferparlamentarische Opposition]] and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament. The late 1960s saw the rise of the [[German student movement|student movement]] and university campuses in a constant state of uproar. A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967 when the Shah of Iran visited West Berlin. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance. Supporters of the Shah (later known as 'Jubelperser'), armed with staves and bricks, attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched. A demonstration in the center was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head and killed by a plain-clothed policeman [[Karl-Heinz Kurras]]. (It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the East German [[Stasi]] security forces.){{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' newspaper, to be acts of terrorism. The conservative ''Bild-Zeitung'' waged a massive campaign against the protesters who were declared to be just hooligans and thugs in the pay of East Germany. The press baron [[Axel Springer]] emerged as one of the principal hate figures for the student protesters because of ''Bild-Zeitung'''s often violent attacks on them. Protests against the US intervention in Vietnam, mingled with anger over the vigor with which demonstrations were repressed, led to mounting militancy among the students at the universities of Berlin. One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called [[Rudi Dutschke]] who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin. Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him. All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students. Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken.<ref name=\"Kraushaar\">{{cite book|first=Wolfgang|last=Kraushaar|title= Frankfurter Schule und Studentenbewegung| volume= 2 |publisher=Rogner und Bernhard|language=German|trans-title=Frankfurt School and the Student Movement|year=1998 |number= 193| page= 356}}</ref> In the wake of these demonstrations, in which the question of America's role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role, came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of their parents' generation in the Nazi era.\n\n[[File:Ludwig Binder Haus der Geschichte Studentenrevolte 1968 2001 03 0275.0011 (16910985309).jpg|thumb|200px|Protest against the [[Vietnam War]] in West Berlin in 1968]]\nIn 1968, the ''Bundestag'' passed a Misdemeanors Bill dealing with traffic misdemeanors, into which a high-ranking civil servant named Dr. Eduard Dreher who had been drafting the bill inserted a prefatory section to the bill under a very misleading heading that declared that henceforth there was a [[statute of limitations]] of 15 years from the time of the offense for the crime of being an accomplices to murder which was to apply retroactively, which made it impossible to prosecute war criminals even for being accomplices to murder since the statute of limitations as now defined for the last of the suspects had expired by 1960.<ref name=\"Wette, Wolfram\"/>{{rp|249}} The ''Bundestag'' passed the Misdemeanors Bill without bothering to read the bill in its entirety so its members missed Dreher's amendment.<ref name=\"Wette, Wolfram\"/>{{rp|249}} It was estimated in 1969 that thanks to Dreher's amendment to the Misdemeanors Bill that 90% of all Nazi war criminals now enjoyed total immunity from prosecution.<ref name=\"Wette, Wolfram\"/>{{rp|249\u201350}} The prosecutor Adalbert R\u00fcckerl who headed the Central Bureau for the Prosecution of National Socialist Crimes told an interviewer in 1969 that this amendment had done immense harm to the ability of the Bureau to prosecute those suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity.<ref name=\"Wette, Wolfram\"/>{{rp|249}}\n\nThe calling in question of the actions and policies of the government led to a new climate of debate by the late 1960s. The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society. In 1979, the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] provincial election. Also of great significance was the steady growth of a feminist movement in which women demonstrated for equal rights. Until 1979, a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account. Parallel to this, a gay movement began to grow in the larger cities, especially in West Berlin, where homosexuality had been widely accepted during the twenties in the Weimar Republic. In 1969, the ''Bundestag'' repealed the 1935 Nazi amendment to [[Paragraph 175]], which not only made homosexual acts a felony, but had also made any expressions of homosexuality illegal (before 1935 only gay sex had been illegal). However, Paragraph 175 which made homosexual acts illegal remained on the statute books and was not repealed until 1994, although it had been softened in 1973 by making gay sex illegal only with those under the age of 18.\n\n[[File:RAF-Logo.svg|thumb|left|RAF symbol]]\n\nAnger over the treatment of demonstrators following the death of Benno Ohnesorg and the attack on Rudi Dutschke, coupled with growing frustration over the lack of success in achieving their aims, led to growing militancy among students and their supporters. In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt; they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the 'struggle against imperialism'.<ref name=\"Kraushaar\"/> The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the Maoists and supporters of direct action in every form\u2014the anarchists. Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalizing the industrial workers and, taking an example from activities in Italy of the Brigade Rosse, many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success. The most notorious of the underground groups was the 'Baader-Meinhof Group', later known as the [[Red Army Faction]], which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas. The \"Baader-Meinhof gang\" was committed to the overthrow of the Federal Republic via terrorism in order to achieve the establishment of a Communist state. In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name \"RAF\". The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998. Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Buback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie|title= Gefangen in der Geschichte | work=ZEIT ONLINE | accessdate=30 May 2014|language=German|date=8 August 2011|first= Christian|last= Denso}}</ref>\n\n===Political developments 1969\u20131990===\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD\u2014headed by [[Willy Brandt]]\u2014gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP.

Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974, after [[G\u00fcnter Guillaume]], a senior member of his staff, was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the [[Stasi]].

The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, due to the entry into the ''Bundestag'' of the [[German Green Party|Greens]], who received 5.6% of the vote. In 1983, despite major protests from peace groups, the Kohl government allowed [[Pershing II]] missiles to be stationed in the Federal Republic to counter the deployment of the [[RSD-10 Pioneer|SS-20]] cruise missiles by the Soviet Union in East Germany. In 1985, Kohl, who had something of a tin ear when it came to dealing with the Nazi past,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2014}} caused much controversy when he invited President [[Ronald Reagan]] of the United States to visit the war cemetery at [[Bitburg]] to mark the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II. The Bitburg cemetery was soon revealed to contain the graves of SS men, which Kohl stated that he did not see as a problem and that to refuse to honor all of the dead of Bitburg including the SS men buried there was an insult to all Germans. Kohl stated that Reagan could come to the Federal Republic to hold a ceremony to honor the dead of Bitburg or not come at all, and that to change the venue of the service to another war cemetery that did not have SS men buried in it was not acceptable to him. Even more controversy was caused by Reagan's statement that all of the SS men killed fighting for Hitler in World War II were \"just kids\" who were just as much the victims of Hitler as those who been murdered by the SS in the Holocaust.<ref name=\"buchanan.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html |title=Pat Buchanan'S Response To Norman Podhoretz'S Op-Ed |accessdate=30 May 2014 |date=5 November 1999 |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Internet Archive |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008152726/http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html |archivedate=8 October 2008 }}</ref> Despite the huge controversy caused by honoring the SS men buried at Bitburg, the visit to Bitburg went ahead, and Kohl and Reagan honored the dead of Bitburg. What was intended to promote German-American reconciliation turned out to be a public relations disaster that had the opposite effect. Public opinion polls showed that 72% of West Germans supported the service at Bitburg while American public opinion overwhelming disapproved of Reagan honoring the memory of the SS men who gave their lives for Hitler.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nDespite or perhaps because of the Bitburg controversy, in 1985 a campaign had been started to build a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust in Berlin.<ref name=\"Illusions\"/>{{rp|557}} It was felt by at least some Germans that there was something wrong about the Chancellor and the President of the United States honoring the memory of the SS men buried at Bitburg while there was no memorial to any of the people killed in the Holocaust. The campaign to build a Holocaust memorial, which Germany until then lacked, was given a major boost in November 1989 by the call by television journalist [[Lea Rosh]] to build the memorial at the site for the former Gestapo headquarters.<ref name=\"Illusions\"/>{{rp|557}} In April 1992, the City of Berlin finally decided that a Holocaust memorial could be built.<ref name=\"Illusions\"/>{{rp|557}} Along the same lines, in August 1987, protests put a stop to plans by the City of Frankfurt to raze the last remains of the Frankfurt Jewish Ghetto in order to redevelop the land, arguing that the remnants of the Frankfurt ghetto needed to be preserved.<ref name=\"Illusions\"/>{{rp|557}}\n\nIn January 1987, the Kohl-Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by [[Hans-Jochen Vogel]]. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%. Later in 1987, Kohl had a summit with the East German leader [[Erich Honecker]]. Unknown to Kohl, the meeting room had been bugged by the Stasi, and the Stasi tapes of the summit had Kohl saying to Honecker that he did not see any realistic chance of reunification in the foreseeable future.\n\n==East Germany (German Democratic Republic)==\n\n{{Main article|East Germany}}\nIn the Soviet occupation zone, the Social Democratic Party was forced to merge with the Communist Party in April 1946 to form a new party, the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' or SED). The October 1946 elections resulted in coalition governments in the five ''Land'' (state) parliaments with the SED as the undisputed leader.\n\nA series of people's congresses were called in 1948 and early 1949 by the SED. Under Soviet direction, a constitution was drafted on 30 May 1949, and adopted on 7 October, the day when East Germany was formally proclaimed. The People's Chamber ''([[Volkskammer]])''\u2014the lower house of the East German parliament\u2014and an upper house\u2014the States Chamber ''(L\u00e4nderkammer)''\u2014were created. (The ''L\u00e4nderkammer'' was abolished again in 1958.) On 11 October 1949, the two houses elected [[Wilhelm Pieck]] as President, and an SED government was set up. The Soviet Union and its East European allies immediately recognized East Germany, although it remained largely unrecognized by noncommunist countries until 1972\u201373. East Germany established the structures of a single-party, centralized, communist state. On 23 July 1952, the traditional ''L\u00e4nder'' were abolished and, in their place, 14 ''Bezirke'' (districts) were established. Even though other parties formally existed, effectively, all government control was in the hands of the SED, and almost all important government positions were held by SED members.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-48550-0036, Besuch Ho Chi Minhs bei Pionieren, bei Berlin.jpg|thumb|North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] with East German [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]], 1957]]\n\nThe [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]] was an [[umbrella organization]] nominally consisting of the SED, four other political parties controlled and directed by the SED, and the four principal mass organizations\u2014youth, trade unions, women, and culture. However, control was clearly and solely in the hands of the SED. Balloting in East German elections was not secret. As in other Soviet bloc countries, electoral participation was consistently high, as the following results indicate. In October 1950, a year after the formation of the GDR, 98.53% of the electorate voted. 99.72% of the votes were valid and 99.72% were cast in favor of the 'National Front'\u2014the title of the 'coalition' of the Unity Party plus their associates in other conformist groups. In election after election, the votes cast for the Socialist Unity Party were always over 99%, and in 1963, two years after the Berlin Wall was constructed, the support for the S.E.D. was 99.95%. Only 0.05% of the electorate opposed the party according to these results, the veracity of which is disputable.<ref>{{cite book|title=Zahlenspiegel ein Vergleich Bundesrepublik Deutschland Deutsche Demokratische Republik Ministerium f\u00fcr Innerdeutsche Beziehungen|year= 1973|page= 7|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Industry and agriculture in East Germany===\nWith the formation of a separate East German communist state in October 1949, the Socialist Unity Party faced a huge range of problems. Not only were the cities in ruins, much of the productive machinery and equipment had been seized by the Soviet occupation force and transported to The Soviet Union in order to make some kind of reconstruction possible. While West Germany received loans and other financial assistance from the United States, the GDR was in the role of an exporter of goods to the USSR\u2014a role that its people could ill afford but which they could not avoid.\n\nThe S.E.D.'s intention was to transform the GDR into a socialist and later into a communist state. These processes would occur step by step according to the laws of scientific 'Marxism-Leninism' and economic planning was the key to this process. In July 1952, at a conference of the S.E.D., Walter Ulbricht announced that \"the democratic (sic) and economic development, and the consciousness (Bewusstsein) of the working class and the majority of the employed classes must be developed so that the construction of Socialism becomes their most important objective.\"<ref name=\"Steininger\">{{cite book|author=Steininger|title= Deutsch Geschichte 1945\u20131961| volume= 2}}</ref>{{rp|453}} This meant that the administration, the armed forces, the planning of industry and agriculture would be under the sole authority of the S.E.D. and its planning committee. Industries would be nationalized and collectivization introduced in the farm industry. When the first Five-Year Plan was announced, the flow of refugees out of East Germany began to grow. As a consequence, production fell, food became short and protests occurred in a number of factories. On 14 May 1952, the S.E.D. ordered that the production quotas (the output per man per shift) were to be increased by 10%, but wages to be kept at the former level. This decision was not popular with the new leaders in the Kremlin. Stalin had died in March 1953 and the new leadership was still evolving. The imposition of new production quotas contradicted the new direction of Soviet policies for their satellites.<ref name=\"Steininger\"/>{{rp|454}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-U1109-022, Berlin, Sandm\u00e4nnchen.jpg|thumbnail|Gerhard Behrendt with Sandm\u00e4nnchen]]\n\nOn 5 June 1953, the S.E.D. announced a 'new course' in which farmers, craftsmen, and factory owners would benefit from a relaxation of controls. The new production quotas remained; the East German workers protested and up to sixty strikes occurred the following day. One of the window-dressing projects in the ruins of East Berlin was the construction of Stalin Allee, on which the most 'class-conscious' workers (in S.E.D. propaganda terms) were involved. At a meeting, strikers declared \"You give the capitalists (the factory owners) presents, and we are exploited!\"<ref name=\"Steininger\"/>{{rp|455}} A delegation of building workers marched to the headquarters of the S.E.D. demanding that the production quotas be rescinded. The crowd grew, demands were made for the removal of Ulbricht from office and a general strike called for the following day.\n\nOn 17 June 1953 strikes and demonstrations occurred in 250 towns and cities in the GDR. Between 300,000 and 400,000 workers took part in the strikes, which were specifically directed towards the rescinding of the production quotas and were not an attempt to overthrow the government. The strikers were for the most part convinced that the transformation of the GDR into a socialist state was the proper course to take but that the S.E.D. had taken a wrong turn.<ref name=\"Steininger\"/>{{rp|457}}\nThe S.E.D. responded with all of the force at its command and also with the help of the Soviet Occupation force. Thousands were arrested, sentenced to jail and many hundreds were forced to leave for West Germany. The S.E.D. later moderated its course but the damage had been done. The real face of the East German regime was revealed. The S.E.D. claimed that the strikes had been instigated by West German agents, but there is no evidence for this. Over 250 strikers were killed, around 100 policemen and some 18 Soviet soldiers died in the uprising;<ref name=\"Steininger\"/>{{rp|459}} 17 June was declared a national day of remembrance in West Germany.\n\n==Berlin==\n\nShortly after [[World War II]], Berlin became the seat of the Allied Control Council, which was to have governed Germany as a whole until the conclusion of a peace settlement. In 1948, however, the [[Soviet Union]] refused to participate any longer in the quadripartite administration of Germany. They also refused to continue the joint administration of Berlin and drove the government elected by the people of Berlin out of its seat in the Soviet sector and installed a communist regime in East Berlin. From then until unification, the Western Allies continued to exercise supreme authority\u2014effective only in their sectors\u2014through the [[Allied Kommandatura]]. To the degree compatible with the city's special status, however, they turned over control and management of city affairs to the [[Senate of Berlin|West Berlin Senate]] and the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]], governing bodies established by constitutional process and chosen by free elections. The Allies and German authorities in West Germany and West Berlin never recognized the communist city regime in East Berlin or East German authority there.\n\nDuring the years of West Berlin's isolation\u2014176 kilometers (110&nbsp;mi.) inside East Germany\u2014the Western Allies encouraged a close relationship between the Government of [[West Berlin]] and that of West Germany. Representatives of the city participated as non-voting members in the West German Parliament; appropriate West German agencies, such as the supreme administrative court, had their permanent seats in the city; and the governing mayor of West Berlin took his turn as President of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. In addition, the Allies carefully consulted with the West German and West Berlin Governments on foreign policy questions involving unification and the status of Berlin.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1990, major events such as fairs and festivals were sponsored in West Berlin, and investment in commerce and industry was encouraged by special concessionary tax legislation. The results of such efforts, combined with effective city administration and the West Berliners' energy and spirit, were encouraging. West Berlin's morale was sustained, and its industrial production considerably surpassed the pre-war level.\n\nThe [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Final Settlement Treaty]] ended Berlin's special status as a separate area under Four Power control. Under the terms of the treaty between West and East Germany, Berlin became the capital of a unified Germany. The Bundestag voted in June 1991 to make Berlin the seat of government. The Government of Germany asked the Allies to maintain a military presence in Berlin until the complete withdrawal of the Western Group of Forces (ex-Soviet) from the territory of the former East Germany. The Russian withdrawal was completed 31 August 1994. Ceremonies were held on 8 September 1994, to mark the final departure of Western Allied troops from Berlin.\n\nGovernment offices have been moving progressively to Berlin, and it became the formal seat of the federal government in 1999. Berlin also is one of the Federal Republic's 16 ''[[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]''.\n\n==Relations between East Germany and West Germany==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nUnder [[Konrad Adenauer|Chancellor Adenauer]] [[West Germany]] declared its right to speak for the entire German nation with an [[exclusive mandate]]. The [[Hallstein Doctrine]] involved non-recognition of East Germany and restricted (or often ceased) diplomatic relations with countries that gave East Germany the status of a sovereign state.\n\nThe constant stream of East Germans fleeing across the [[Inner German border]] to West Germany placed great strains on East German-West German relations in the 1950s. East Germany sealed the borders to West Germany in 1952, but people continued to flee from East Berlin to [[West Berlin]]. On 13 August 1961, East Germany began building the [[Berlin Wall]] around West Berlin to slow the flood of refugees to a trickle, effectively cutting the city in half and making West Berlin an enclave of the Western world in communist territory. The Wall became the symbol of the Cold War and the division of Europe. Shortly afterward, the main border between the two German states was fortified.\n\nThe [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]] of 1965 was controversial at the time, but is now seen as an important step toward improving relations between the German states and [[Poland]].\n\nIn 1969, Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] announced that West Germany would remain firmly rooted in the Atlantic alliance but would intensify efforts to improve relations with the Eastern Bloc, especially East Germany. West Germany commenced this ''[[Ostpolitik]],'' initially under fierce opposition from the conservatives, by negotiating nonaggression treaties with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary.\n\nWest Germany's relations with East Germany posed particularly difficult questions. Though anxious to relieve serious hardships for divided families and to reduce friction, West Germany under Brandt's ''Ostpolitik'' was intent on holding to its concept of \"two German states in one German nation.\" Relations gradually improved. In the early 1970s, the ''Ostpolitik'' led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty (1972)|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both states joining the [[United Nations]], in September 1973. The two German states exchanged [[Permanent Representative|permanent representatives]] in 1974, and, in 1987, East German head of state [[Erich Honecker]] paid an [[Erich Honecker's 1987 visit to West Germany|official visit]] to West Germany.\n\n==The reunification of East Germany and West Germany==\n{{Main article|German reunification}}\n\n===Background===\nInternational plans for the unification of Germany were made during the early years following the establishment of the two states, but to no avail. In March 1952, the Soviet government proposed the [[Stalin note|Stalin Note]] to hold elections for a united German assembly while making the proposed united Germany a neutral state, i.e. a neutral state approved by the people, similar to the Austrians' approval of a neutral Austria. The Western Allied governments refused this initiative, while continuing West Germany's integration into the Western alliance system. The issue was raised again during the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Berlin in January\u2013February 1954, but the western powers refused to make Germany neutral. Following Bonn's adherence to NATO on 9 May 1955, such initiatives were abandoned by both sides.\n\nDuring the summer of 1989, [[Die Wende|rapid changes]] took place in East Germany, which ultimately led to [[German reunification]]. Widespread discontent boiled over, following accusations of large scale vote-rigging during the local elections of May 1989. Growing numbers of East Germans emigrated to West Germany via Hungary after the Hungarians decided not to use force to stop them. Thousands of East Germans also tried to reach the West by staging sit-ins at West German diplomatic facilities in other East European capitals. The exodus generated demands within East Germany for political change, and mass demonstrations ([[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]]) with eventually hundreds of thousands of people in several cities\u2014particularly in [[Leipzig]]\u2014continued to grow. On 7 October, the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited Berlin to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of East Germany and urged the East German leadership to pursue reform, without success. The movement of [[civil resistance]] against the East German regime\u2014both the emigration and the demonstrations\u2014continued unabated.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Charles S. |last=Maier|title=Civil Resistance and Civil Society: Lessons from the Collapse of the German Democratic Republic in 1989|editor-first=Adam|editor-last=Roberts|editor-link=Adam Roberts (scholar)|editor-first2=Timothy Garton |editor-last2=Ash|editor-link2= Timothy Garton Ash|encyclopedia=Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2009|pages= 260\u201376|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC|isbn=9780199552016}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 October, Erich Honecker was forced to resign as head of the SED and as head of state and was replaced by [[Egon Krenz]]. But the exodus continued unabated, and pressure for political reform mounted. On 4 November, a demonstration in East Berlin drew as many as 1 million East Germans. Finally, on 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall was opened, and East Germans were allowed to travel freely. Thousands poured through the wall into the western sectors of Berlin, and on 12 November, East Germany began dismantling it.\n\nOn 28 November, West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] outlined the 10-Point Plan for the peaceful unification of the two German states, based on free elections in East Germany and a unification of their two economies. In December, the East German ''Volkskammer'' eliminated the SED monopoly on power, and the entire Politb\u00fcro and Central Committee\u2014including Krenz\u2014resigned. The SED changed its name to the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) and the formation and growth of numerous political groups and parties marked the end of the communist system. Prime Minister [[Hans Modrow]] headed a [[caretaker government]] which shared power with the new, democratically oriented parties. On 7 December 1989, an agreement was reached to hold free elections in May 1990 and rewrite the East German constitution. On 28 January, all the parties agreed to advance the elections to 18 March, primarily because of an erosion of state authority and because the East German exodus was continuing apace; more than 117,000 left in January and February 1990.\n\nIn early February 1990, the Modrow government's proposal for a unified, neutral German state was rejected by Chancellor Kohl, who affirmed that a unified Germany must be a member of NATO. Finally, on 18 March, the [[East German general election, 1990|first free elections]] were held in East Germany, and a government led by [[Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re]] (CDU) was formed under a policy of expeditious unification with West Germany. The freely elected representatives of the ''Volkskammer'' held their first session on 5 April, and East Germany peacefully evolved from a communist to a democratically elected government. Free and secret communal (local) elections were held in the GDR on 6 May, and the CDU again won most of the available seats. On 1 July, the two German states entered into an economic and monetary union.\n\n===Treaty negotiations===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDuring 1990, in parallel with internal German developments, the Four Powers\u2014the Allies of World War II, being the United States, United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union\u2014together with the two German states negotiated to end Four Power reserved rights for Berlin and Germany as a whole. These \"Two-plus-Four\" negotiations were mandated at the [[Ottawa]] [[Treaty on Open Skies#History|Open Skies]] conference on 13 February 1990. The six foreign ministers met four times in the ensuing months in Bonn (5 May), Berlin (22 June), Paris (17 July), and Moscow (12 September). The Polish Foreign Minister participated in the part of the Paris meeting that dealt with the Polish-German borders.\n\nOvercoming Soviet objections to a united Germany's membership in NATO was of key importance. This was accomplished in July when the alliance, led by President [[George H.W. Bush]], issued the London Declaration on a transformed NATO. On 16 July, President Gorbachev and Chancellor Kohl announced the agreement in principle on a united Germany in NATO. This cleared the way for the signing in Moscow, on 12 September, of the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]]\u2014in effect the peace treaty that was anticipated at the end of World War II. In addition to terminating Four Power rights, the treaty mandated the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Germany by the end of 1994, made clear that the current borders (especially the [[Oder-Neisse line]]) were viewed as final and definitive, and specified the right of a united Germany to belong to NATO. It also provided for the continued presence of British, French, and American troops in Berlin during the interim period of the Soviet withdrawal. In the treaty, the Germans renounced nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and stated their intention to reduce the (combined) German armed forces to 370,000 within 3 to 4 years after the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], signed in Paris on 19 November 1990, entered into force.\n\nThe conclusion of the final settlement cleared the way for the unification of East and West Germany. Formal political union occurred on 3 October 1990, preceded by the GDR declaring its accession to the Federal Republic through Article 23 of West Germany's Basic Law (meaning that constitutionally, East Germany was subsumed into West Germany); but affected in strict legality through the subsequent Unification Treaty of 30 August 1990, which was voted into their constitutions by both the West German Bundestag and the East German Volkskammer on 20 September 1990.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jurisprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> These votes simultaneously extinguished the GDR and affected fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law (including the repeal of the very Article 23 under which the GDR had recently declared its post-dated accession). On 2 December 1990, [[1990 German federal election|all-German elections]] were held for the first time since 1933. The \"new\" country stayed the same as the West German legal system and institutions were extended to the east. The unified nation kept the name [[Bundesrepublik Deutschland]] (though the simple 'Deutschland' would become increasingly common) and retained the West German \"Deutsche Mark\" for currency as well. Berlin would formally become the capital of the united Germany, but the political institutions remained at Bonn for the time being. Only after a heated 1991 debate did the ''[[Bundestag]]'' conclude on moving itself and most of the government to Berlin as well, a process that took until 1999 to complete, when the ''Bundestag'' held its first session at the reconstructed [[Reichstag (building)|''Reichstag'' building]]. Many government departments still maintain sizable presences in Bonn as of 2008.\n\n===Aftermath===\n{{Further information|New states of Germany}}\nTo this day, there remain vast differences between the former East Germany and [[West Germany]] (for example, in lifestyle, wealth, political beliefs, and other matters) and thus it is still common to speak of eastern and western Germany distinctly. The eastern German economy has struggled since unification, and large subsidies are still transferred from west to east.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Works cited'''\n* Fulbrook, Mary.

West Germany also joined the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the [[European Economic Community]] (later to become the [[European Union]]). East Germany stagnated as its economy was largely organized to meet the needs of the Soviet Union; the secret police ([[Stasi]]) tightly controlled daily life, and the [[Berlin Wall]] (1961) ended the steady flow of refugees to the west.

All Nazi land expansion from 1938 to 1945 was hence treated as automatically invalid. Such expansion included the League of Nations administered City-State of [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] (occupied by Nazi Germany immediately following Germany's 1 September 1939 invasion of Poland), [[Austria]], [[Sudetenland|the occupied territory of Czechoslovakia]], Suwalki, Alsace-Lorraine, Luxembourg, post 27 September 1939 \"West Prussia\", post 27 September 1939 \"Posen Province\", northern Slovenia, Eupen, Malmedy, the part of Southern Silesia ultimately detached from 1918 Germany by action of the Versailles Treaty, likewise, the Hultschiner Laendchen.\n\n===Expulsion and denazification===\n{{further information|Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)}}\n\nThe northern half of East Prussia in the region of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] was administratively assigned by the Potsdam Agreement to the Soviet Union, pending a final Peace Conference (with the commitment of Britain and the United States to support its incorporation into Russia); and was then annexed by the Soviet Union. The [[Free City of Danzig]] and the southern half of East Prussia were incorporated into and annexed by Poland; the Allies having assured the Polish government-in-exile of their support for this after the [[Tehran Conference]] in 1943. It was also agreed at Potsdam that Poland would receive all German lands east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], although the exact delimitation of the boundary was left to be resolved at an eventual Peace Conference. Under the wartime alliances of the United Kingdom with the Czechoslovak and Polish governments-in-exile, the British had agreed in July 1942 to support \"..the General Principle of the transfer to Germany of German minorities in Central and South Eastern Europe after the war in cases where this seems necessary and desirable\". In 1944 roughly 12.4 million ethnic Germans were living in territory that became part of post-war Poland and Soviet Union. Approximately 6 million fled or were evacuated before the [[Red Army]] occupied the area. Of the remainder, around 2 million died during the war or in its aftermath (1.4 million as military casualties; 600,000 as civilian deaths),<ref>{{cite book|first= Nicholas |last=Stragart|title=The German War; a nation under arms, 1939-45|year=2015|publisher = Bodley Head|page= 557|title-link=The German War}}</ref> 3.6 million were expelled by the Poles, one million declared themselves to be Poles, and 300,000 remained in Poland as Germans. The [[Sudetenland]] territories, surrendered to Germany by the [[Munich Agreement]], were returned to Czechoslovakia; these territories containing a further 3 million ethnic Germans. [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|'Wild' expulsions from Czechoslovakia]] began immediately after the German surrender.\n\nThe [[Potsdam Conference]] subsequently sanctioned the \"orderly and humane\" transfer to Germany of individuals regarded as \"ethnic Germans\" by authorities in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary. The Potsdam Agreement recognized that these expulsions were already underway and were putting a burden on authorities in the German Occupation Zones, including the re-defined Soviet Occupation Zone. Most of the Germans who were being expelled were from Czechoslovakia and Poland, which included most of the territory to the east of the Oder-Neisse Line. The Potsdam Declaration stated:\n\n{{quote|Since the influx of a large number of Germans into Germany would increase the burden already resting on the occupying authorities, they consider that the Allied Control Council in Germany should in the first instance examine the problem with special regard to the question of the equitable distribution of these Germans among the several zones of occupation. They are accordingly instructing their respective representatives on the control council to report to their Governments as soon as possible the extent to which such persons have already entered Germany from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, and to submit an estimate of the time and rate at which further transfers could be carried out, having regard to the present situation in Germany. The Czechoslovak Government, the Polish Provisional Government and the control council in Hungary are at the same time being informed of the above and are being requested meanwhile to suspend further expulsions pending the examination by the Governments concerned of the report from their representatives on the control council.}}\n\nMany of the ethnic Germans, who were primarily women and children, and especially those under the control of Polish and Czechoslovakian authorities, were severely mistreated before they were ultimately deported to Germany. Thousands died in forced labor camps such as [[Lambinowice]], [[Zgoda labour camp]], [[Central Labour Camp Potulice]], [[Central Labour Camp Jaworzno]], Glaz, Milecin, Gronowo, and Sikawa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=198721097755610|title=An Exploration of the Inner Landscape of Experience|accessdate=27 May 2014|publisher=H-Net Reviews|year=2004|first=Amy|last=Alrich|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611032512/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=198721097755610|archive-date=11 June 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Others starved, died of disease, or froze to death while being expelled in slow and ill-equipped trains; or in transit camps.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2003-0703-500, R\u00fcckf\u00fchrung deutscher Kinder aus Polen.jpg|thumb|upright|August 1948, German children deported from the eastern areas of Germany taken over by Poland arrive in West Germany.]]\nAltogether, around 8 million ethnic German refugees and expellees from across Europe eventually settled in West Germany, with a further 3 million in East Germany. In West Germany these represented a major [[All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights|voting block]]; maintaining a strong culture of grievance and victimhood against Soviet Power, pressing for a continued commitment to full German reunification, claiming compensation, pursuing the right of return to lost property in the East, and opposing any recognition of the postwar extension of Poland and the Soviet Union into former German lands.<ref>{{cite book|title=The German War; a nation under arms, 1939-45|last=Stragart|first=Nicholas|publisher=Bodley Head|year=2015|page=556|title-link=The German War}}</ref> Due to the Cold War rhetoric and successful political machinations of [[Konrad Adenauer]], this block eventually became [[Federation of Expellees|substantially aligned]] with the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]]; although in practice 'westward-looking' CDU policies favouring the [[NATO|Atlantic Alliance]] and the [[European Union]] worked against the possibility of achieving the objectives of the expellee population from the east through negotiation with the Soviet Union. But for Adenauer, fostering and encouraging unrealistic demands and uncompromising expectations amongst the expellees would serve his \"Policy of Strength\" by which West Germany contrived to inhibit consideration of unification or a final Peace Treaty until the West was strong enough to face the Soviets on equal terms. Consequently, the Federal Republic in the 1950s adopted much of the symbolism of expellee groups; especially in appropriating and subverting the terminology and imagery of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]; applying this to post-war German experience instead.<ref>{{cite book|first= Nicholas |last=Stragart|title=The German War; a nation under arms, 1939-45|year=2015|publisher = Bodley Head|page= 558|title-link=The German War}}</ref> Eventually in 1990, following the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]], the unified Germany indeed confirmed in treaties with Poland and the Soviet Union that the transfer of sovereignty over the former German eastern territories in 1945 had been permanent and irreversible; Germany now undertaking never again to make territorial claims in respect of these lands.\n\nThe intended governing body of Germany was called the [[Allied Control Council]], consisting of the commanders-in-chief in Germany of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union; who exercised supreme authority in their respective zones, while supposedly acting in concert on questions affecting the whole country. In actuality however, the French consistently blocked any progress towards re-establishing all-German governing institutions; substantially in pursuit of French aspirations for a dismembered Germany, but also as a response to the exclusion of France from the Yalta and Potsdam conferences. [[Berlin]], which lay in the Soviet (eastern) sector, was also divided into four sectors with the Western sectors later becoming [[West Berlin]] and the Soviet sector becoming [[East Berlin]], capital of East Germany.\n\n[[File:Flag of Germany (1946-1949).svg|left|thumb|Provisional Civil Ensign]]\nA key item in the occupiers' agenda was [[denazification]]. The [[swastika]] and other outward symbols of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime were banned, and a [[Flag of Germany|Provisional Civil Ensign]] was established as a temporary German flag. It remained the official flag of the country (necessary for reasons of [[international law]]) until East Germany and West Germany (see below) were independently established in 1949.\n\nThe United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union had agreed at [[Potsdam]] to a broad program of decentralization, treating Germany as a single economic unit with some central administrative departments. These plans never materialised, initially because France blocked any establishment of central administrative or political structures for Germany; and also as both the Soviet Union and France were intent on extracting as much material benefit as possible from their occupation zones in order to make good in part the enormous destruction caused by the German Wehrmacht; and the policy broke down completely in 1948 when the Russians blockaded West Berlin and the period known as the [[Cold War]] began.\nIt was agreed at Potsdam that the leading members of the Nazi regime who had been captured should be put on trial accused of crimes against humanity, and this was one of the few points on which the four powers were able to agree.\nIn order to secure the presence of the western allies in Berlin, the United States agreed to withdraw from Thuringia and Saxony in exchange for the division of Berlin into four sectors. The State Department and individual U.S. congressmen pressured to have this policy lifted. In June 1945 the prohibition against speaking with German children was loosened. In July troops were permitted to speak to German adults in certain circumstances. In September 1945 the entire policy was dropped. Only the ban on marriage between Americans and German or Austrian civilians remained in place.{{when|date=February 2011}}<ref>{{cite journal|first=Perry |last=Biddiscombe |title=Dangerous Liaisons: The Anti-Fraternization Movement in the US Occupation Zones of Germany and Austria, 1945\u20131948|journal= Journal of Social History|volume= 34|number=3|year= 2001 |page= 619|doi=10.1353/jsh.2001.0002 }}</ref>\n\n=== Industrial disarmament in western Germany ===\n\nThe initial proposal for the post-surrender policy of the Western powers, the so-called [[Morgenthau Plan]] proposed by [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], was one of \"pastoralization\".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a297a01.html| title =Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany| accessdate =27 January 2007| first = Henry Jr|last=Morgenthau| authorlink = Henry Morgenthau, Jr.| date = September 1944| work = President's Secretary's Files (PSF), German Diplomatic Files, Jan.\u2013Sept. 1944 (i297)| publisher = Franklin D.

This included the destruction of all ship and aircraft manufacturing capability. Further, it was decided that civilian industries which might have a military potential, which in the modern era of \"total war\" included virtually all, were to be severely restricted. The restriction of the latter was set to Germany's \"approved peacetime needs\", which were defined to be set on the average European standard.

French attempts to gain political control of or permanently internationalize the Ruhr were abandoned in 1951 with the West German agreement to pool its coal and steel resources in return for full political control over the Ruhr (see [[European Coal and Steel Community]]). With French economic security guaranteed through access to Ruhr coal now permanently ensured France was satisfied. The French attempt to gain economic control over the Saar was temporarily even more successful.\n\nIn the speech [[Restatement of Policy on Germany]], held in Stuttgart on 6 September 1946, the United States [[Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]] stated the U.S. motive in detaching the Saar from Germany as \"The United States does not feel that it can deny to France, which has been invaded three times by Germany in 70 years, its claim to the Saar territory\". The Saar came under French administration in 1947 as the [[Saar Protectorate]], but did return to Germany in January 1957 (following a referendum), with economic reintegration with Germany occurring a few years later.\n\nAlthough not a party to the Potsdam conference where the policy of industrial disarmament had been set, as a member of the Allied Control Council France came to champion this policy since it ensured a weak Germany.\n\nIn August 1954 the French parliament voted down the treaty that would have established the [[European Defense Community]], a treaty they themselves had proposed in 1950 as a means to contain German revival. France instead focused on another treaty also under development. In May 1950 France had proposed the European Coal and Steel Community with the purpose of ensuring French economic security by perpetuating access to German Ruhr coal, but also to show to the U.S. and the UK that France could come up with constructive solutions, as well as to pacify Germany by making it part of an international project.\n\nGermany was eventually allowed to rearm, but under the auspices of the [[Western European Union]], and later [[NATO]].\n\n===Dismantling in East Germany===\n\nThe Soviet Union engaged in a massive industrial dismantling campaign in its occupation zone, much more intensive than that carried out by the Western powers. While the Soviet powers soon realized that their actions alienated the German workforce from the Communist cause, they decided that the desperate economic situation within the Soviet Union took priority over alliance building. The allied leaders had agreed on paper to economic and political cooperation but the issue of reparations dealt an early blow to the prospect of a united Germany in 1945. The figure of $20 Billion had been floated by Stalin as an adequate recompense but as the United States refused to consider this a basis for negotiation The Soviet Union was left only with the opportunity of extracting its own reparations, at a heavy cost to the East Germans. This was the beginning of the formal split of Germany.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n===Marshall plan and currency reform===\nWith the Western Allies eventually becoming concerned about the deteriorating economic situation in their \"[[Trizone]]\", the American [[Marshall Plan]] of economic aid was extended to Western Germany in 1948 and a currency reform, which had been prohibited under the previous occupation directive JCS 1067, introduced the [[Deutsche Mark]] and halted rampant inflation.

It was not allowed to join its fellow German neighbors until a plebiscite in 1955 rejected the proposed autonomy. This paved the way for the accession of the Saarland to the Federal Republic of Germany as its 12th state, which went into effect on 1 January 1957.\n\nOn 23 May 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'') was established on the territory of the Western occupied zones, with [[Bonn]] as its \"provisional\" capital. It comprised the area of 11 newly formed states (replacing the pre-war states), with present-day [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] being split into three states until 1952). The Federal Republic was declared to have \"the full authority of a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state\" on 5 May 1955.\nOn 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic (GDR, ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR)''), with East Berlin as its capital, was established in the Soviet Zone.\n\nThe 1952 [[Stalin Note]] proposed [[German reunification]] and [[superpower]] [[Disengagement (Cold War)|disengagement]] from [[Central Europe]] but Britain, France, and the United States rejected the offer as insincere. Also, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer preferred \"Westintegration\", rejecting \"experiments\".\n\nIn English, the two larger states were known informally as \"West Germany\" and \"East Germany\" respectively. In both cases, the former occupying troops remained permanently stationed there. The former German capital, Berlin, was a special case, being divided into East Berlin and [[West Berlin]], with West Berlin completely surrounded by East German territory. Though the German inhabitants of West Berlin were citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany, West Berlin was not legally incorporated into West Germany; it remained under the formal occupation of the western allies until 1990, although most day-to-day administration was conducted by an elected West Berlin government.\n\nWest Germany was allied with the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. A western democratic country with a \"[[social market economy]]\", the country would from the 1950s onwards come to enjoy prolonged economic growth ([[Wirtschaftswunder]]) following the [[Marshall Plan]] help from the Allies, the currency reform of June 1948 and helped by the fact that the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353) led to a worldwide increased demand for goods, where the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products.\n\nEast Germany was at first occupied by and later (May 1955) allied with the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n==West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)==\n{{See also|West Germany}}\n\n[[File:Adenauer 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Konrad Adenauer]]]]\n\nThe Western Allies turned over increasing authority to West German officials and moved to establish a nucleus for a future German government by creating a central Economic Council for their zones. The program later provided for a West German [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]], an occupation statute governing relations between the Allies and the German authorities, and the political and economic merger of the French with the British and American zones. On 23 May 1949, the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|''Grundgesetz'']] (Basic Law), the [[constitution]] of the Federal Republic of Germany, was promulgated. Following elections in August, the first federal government was formed on 20 September 1949, by [[Konrad Adenauer]] ([[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]). Adenauer's government was a coalition of the CDU, the CSU and the Free Democrats. The next day, the [[occupation statute]] came into force, granting powers of self-government with certain exceptions.\n\nIn 1949 the new ''provisional'' capital of the Federal Republic of Germany was established in Bonn, after Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] intervened emphatically for Bonn (which was only fifteen kilometers away from his hometown). Most of the members of the German [[constitutional assembly]] (as well as the U.S. Supreme Command) had favored [[Frankfurt am Main]] where the Hessian administration had already started the construction of a [[plenary assembly hall]]. The [[Parlamentarischer Rat]] (interim parliament) proposed a new location for the capital, as Berlin was then a special administrative region controlled directly by the allies and surrounded by the Soviet zone of occupation. The former [[Reichstag building]] in Berlin was occasionally used as a venue for sittings of the Bundestag and its committees and the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]], the body which elects the German Federal President. However, the Soviets disrupted the use of the Reichstag building by institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany by flying supersonic jets near the building. A number of cities were proposed to host the federal government, and [[Kassel]] (among others) was eliminated in the first round. Other politicians opposed the choice of [[Frankfurt]] out of concern that, as one of the largest German cities and a former centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], it would be accepted as a \"permanent\" capital of Germany, thereby weakening the West German population's support for [[German reunification|reunification]] and the eventual return of the Government to Berlin.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0092, Andernach, Adenauer besucht Bundeswehr.jpg|thumb|Konrad Adenauer, [[Adolf Heusinger]] and [[Hans Speidel]] inspect formations of the newly created Bundeswehr on 20 January 1955]]\nAfter the [[Petersberg agreement]] West Germany quickly progressed toward fuller sovereignty and association with its European neighbors and the Atlantic community. The [[London and Paris Conferences|London and Paris agreements]] of 1954 restored most of the state's sovereignty (with some exceptions) in May 1955 and opened the way for German membership in the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO). In April 1951, West Germany joined with France, Italy and the [[Benelux]] countries in the European Coal and Steel Community (forerunner of the European Union).\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War (June 1950) led to U.S. calls for the rearmament of West Germany in order to defend western Europe from the perceived Soviet threat. But the memory of German aggression led other European states to seek tight control over the West German military. Germany's partners in the Coal and Steel Community decided to establish a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.\n\nThough the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's Gaullists rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the French National Assembly refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French had killed their own proposal. Other means had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, the [[Brussels Treaty]] was modified to include West Germany, and to form the [[Western European Union]] (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm, and have full sovereign control of its military; the WEU would, however, regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Fears of a return to Nazism, however, soon receded, and as a consequence, these provisions of the WEU treaty have little effect today.\n\n[[File:1000000th beatle.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Beetle]] was an icon of West German reconstruction.]]\nBetween 1949 and 1960, the West German economy grew at an unparalleled rate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Low rates of inflation, modest wage increases and a quickly rising export quota made it possible to restore the economy and brought a modest prosperity.

Unemployment at the start of the decade stood at 10.3%, but by 1960 it had dropped to 1.2%, practically speaking full employment.

With the construction of the [[Berlin wall]] in August 1961 they hoped to end the loss of labor and in doing so they posed the West German government with a new problem\u2014how to satisfy the apparently insatiable demand for labor. The answer was to recruit unskilled workers from Southern European countries; the era of the ''Gastarbeiter'' (foreign laborers) began.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-45653-0001, Rom, Vertr\u00e4ge \u00fcber Zollpakt und Eurotom unterzeichnet.jpg|thumb|Konrad Adenauer and [[Walter Hallstein]] signing the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957]]\nIn October 1961 an initial agreement was signed with the Turkish government and the first Gastarbeiter began to arrive. By 1966, some 1,300,000 foreign workers had been recruited mainly from Italy, Turkey, Spain, and Greece. By 1971, the number had reached 2.6 million workers. The initial plan was that single workers would come to Germany, would work for a limited number of years and then return home. The significant differences between wages in their home countries and in Germany led many workers to bring their families and to settle\u2014at least until retirement\u2014in Germany. That the German authorities took little notice of the radical changes that these shifts of population structure meant was the cause of considerable debate in later years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn the 1950s Federal Republic, [[German Restitution Laws|restitution laws]] for compensation for those who had suffered under the Nazis was limited to only those who had suffered from \"racial, religious or political reasons\", which were defined in such a way as to sharply limit the number of people entitled to collect compensation.<ref name=\"Illusions\">{{cite journal|last=Ludtke|first= Alf |title='Coming to Terms with the Past': Illusions of Remembering, Ways of Forgetting Nazism in West Germany |journal=The Journal of Modern History|volume= 65|issue= 3 |pages= 542\u2013572 |year= 1993 |doi=10.1086/244674}}</ref>{{rp|564}} According to the 1953 law on compensation for suffering during the National Socialist era, only those with a territorial connection with Germany could receive compensation for their suffering, which had the effect of excluding the millions of people, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe, who had been taken to Germany to work as slave labor during World War II.<ref name=\"Illusions\"/>{{rp|565}} In the same vein, to be eligible for compensation they would have to prove that they were part of the \"realm of German language and culture\", a requirement that excluded most of the surviving slave laborers who did not know German or at least enough German to be considered part of the \"realm of German language and culture\".<ref name=\"Illusions\"/>{{rp|567}} Likewise, the law excluded homosexuals, Gypsies, Communists, ''Asoziale'' (\"Asocials\" -

Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 45,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)\n\nPolitical life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The Adenauer era (1949\u201363) was followed by a brief period under [[Ludwig Erhard]] (1963\u201366) who, in turn, was replaced by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (1966\u201369). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by coalitions of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP).\n\n===The Sixties: a time for reform===\nThe grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged\u2014almost literally\u2014out of office in 1963. In 1959, it was time to elect a new President and Adenauer decided that he would place Erhard in this office. Erhard was not enthusiastic, and to everybody's surprise, Adenauer decided at the age of 83 that he would take on the position. His aim was apparently to remain in control of German politics for another ten years despite the growing mood for change, but when his advisers informed him just how limited the powers of the president were he quickly lost interest.<ref name=\"Informationen\"/>{{rp|3}} An alternative candidate was needed and eventually the Minister of Agriculture, [[Heinrich L\u00fcbke]] took on the task and was duly elected.\n\nIn October 1962, the weekly news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' published an analysis of the West German military defense. The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. Ten days after publication, the offices of ''Der Spiegel'' in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized under the orders of the CSU Defense Minister [[Franz Josef Strauss]]. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the ''Bundestag'' that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted. The editor/owner of the magazine, [[Rudolf Augstein]] spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of [[Franz Josef Strauss]], Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis by his heavy-handed attempt to silence ''Der Spiegel'' for essentially running a story that was unflattering to him (which incidentally was true).<ref name=\"Taylor, Frederick page 371\">{{cite book|last=Taylor|first= Frederick |title=Exorcising Hitler|url=https://archive.org/details/exorcisinghitler0000tayl|url-access=registration|location= London|publisher= Bloomsbury Press|year= 2011 |page= [https://archive.org/details/exorcisinghitler0000tayl/page/371 371]}}</ref> The British historian [[Frederick Taylor (historian)|Frederick Taylor]] argued that the Federal Republic under Adenauer retained many of the characteristics of the authoritarian \"deep state\" that existed under the Weimar Republic, and that the ''Der Spiegel'' affair marked an important turning point in German values as ordinary people rejected the old authoritarian values in favor of the more democratic values that are today seen as the bedrock of the Federal Republic.<ref name=\"Taylor, Frederick page 371\"/> Adenauer's own reputation was impaired by [[Spiegel scandal|Spiegel affair]] and he announced that he would step down in the autumn of 1963.

In 1963, a German court ruled that a KGB assassin named [[Bohdan Stashynsky]] who had committed several murders in the Federal Republic in the late 1950s was not legally guilty of murder, but was only an accomplice to murder as the responsibility for Stashynsky's murders rested only with his superiors in Moscow who had given him his orders.<ref name=\"Wette, Wolfram\"/>{{rp|245}} The legal implications of the Stashynsky case, namely that in a totalitarian system only executive decision-makers can be held legally responsible for any murders committed and that anyone else who follows orders and commits murders were just accomplices to murder was to greatly hinder the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the coming decades, and ensured that even when convicted, that Nazi criminals received the far lighter sentences reserved for accomplices to murders than the harsher sentences given to murderers.<ref name=\"Wette, Wolfram\"/>{{rp|245}} The term executive decision-maker who could be found guilty of murder was reserved by the courts only for those at the highest levels of the ''Reich'' leadership during the Nazi period.<ref name=\"Wette, Wolfram\"/>{{rp|245}} The only way that a Nazi criminal could be convicted of murder was to show that they were not following orders at the time and had acted on their initiative when killing someone.<ref name=\"Fulford\">{{cite web| last = Fulford| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Fulford (journalist) | title = How the Auschwitz Trial failed | publisher = National Post\n|date= 4 June 2005| url = http://www.robertfulford.com/2005-06-04-auschwitz.html| accessdate = 16 June 2013}}</ref> One courageous attorney, [[Fritz Bauer]] patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the Auschwitz death camp and about twenty were put trial in Frankfurt between 1963-1965 in what came to be known as the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]]. The men on trial in Frankfurt were tried only for murders and other crimes that they committed on their own initiative at Auschwitz and were not tried for anything that they did at Auschwitz when following orders, which was considered by the courts to be the lesser crime of accomplice to murder.<ref name=\"Fulford\"/> Because of this, Bauer could only indict for murder those who killed when not following orders, and those who had killed when following orders were indicted as accomplices to murder. Moreover because of the legal distinction between murderers and accomplices to murder, an SS man who killed thousands while operating the gas chambers at Auschwitz could only be found guilty of being accomplice to murder because he had been following orders, while an SS man who had beaten one inmate to death on his initiative could be convicted of murder because he had not been following orders.<ref name=\"Fulford\"/> Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that the ''Shoah'' was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term 'Holocaust' for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when an American mini-series with that name was shown on German television.) The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.\n\nIn the early sixties, the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly. In 1962, the growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate petered into a recession, with no growth in 1967. The economic showdown forced Erhard's resignation in 1966 and he was replaced with [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] of the CDU. Kiesinger was to attract much controversy because in 1933 he had joined the National Socialist Legal Guild and [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] (membership in the former was necessary in order to practice law, but membership in the latter was entirely voluntary).\n\nIn order to deal with the problem of the economic slowdown, a new coalition was formed. Kiesinger's 1966\u201369 [[grand coalition]] was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new [[German Emergency Acts|emergency acts]]\u2014the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as [[freedom of movement]] to be limited in case of a state of emergency.\n\n[[File:Rudi.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Rudi Dutschke]], student leader]]\n\nDuring the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself ''Notstand der Demokratie'' (Democracy in Crisis), the [[Au\u00dferparlamentarische Opposition]] and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament. The late 1960s saw the rise of the [[German student movement|student movement]] and university campuses in a constant state of uproar. A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967 when the Shah of Iran visited West Berlin. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance. Supporters of the Shah (later known as 'Jubelperser'), armed with staves and bricks, attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched. A demonstration in the center was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head and killed by a plain-clothed policeman [[Karl-Heinz Kurras]]. (It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the East German [[Stasi]] security forces.){{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' newspaper, to be acts of terrorism. The conservative ''Bild-Zeitung'' waged a massive campaign against the protesters who were declared to be just hooligans and thugs in the pay of East Germany. The press baron [[Axel Springer]] emerged as one of the principal hate figures for the student protesters because of ''Bild-Zeitung'''s often violent attacks on them. Protests against the US intervention in Vietnam, mingled with anger over the vigor with which demonstrations were repressed, led to mounting militancy among the students at the universities of Berlin. One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called [[Rudi Dutschke]] who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin. Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him. All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students.

The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society. In 1979, the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] provincial election. Also of great significance was the steady growth of a feminist movement in which women demonstrated for equal rights. Until 1979, a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account. Parallel to this, a gay movement began to grow in the larger cities, especially in West Berlin, where homosexuality had been widely accepted during the twenties in the Weimar Republic. In 1969, the ''Bundestag'' repealed the 1935 Nazi amendment to [[Paragraph 175]], which not only made homosexual acts a felony, but had also made any expressions of homosexuality illegal (before 1935 only gay sex had been illegal). However, Paragraph 175 which made homosexual acts illegal remained on the statute books and was not repealed until 1994, although it had been softened in 1973 by making gay sex illegal only with those under the age of 18.\n\n[[File:RAF-Logo.svg|thumb|left|RAF symbol]]\n\nAnger over the treatment of demonstrators following the death of Benno Ohnesorg and the attack on Rudi Dutschke, coupled with growing frustration over the lack of success in achieving their aims, led to growing militancy among students and their supporters. In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt; they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the 'struggle against imperialism'.<ref name=\"Kraushaar\"/> The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the Maoists and supporters of direct action in every form\u2014the anarchists. Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalizing the industrial workers and, taking an example from activities in Italy of the Brigade Rosse, many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success. The most notorious of the underground groups was the 'Baader-Meinhof Group', later known as the [[Red Army Faction]], which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas. The \"Baader-Meinhof gang\" was committed to the overthrow of the Federal Republic via terrorism in order to achieve the establishment of a Communist state. In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name \"RAF\". The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998. Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Buback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie|title= Gefangen in der Geschichte | work=ZEIT ONLINE | accessdate=30 May 2014|language=German|date=8 August 2011|first= Christian|last= Denso}}</ref>\n\n===Political developments 1969\u20131990===\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD\u2014headed by [[Willy Brandt]]\u2014gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP.

A group from the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] hijacked [[Lufthansa Flight 181]] to seize further hostages to free the RAF leaders. On 18 October 1977, the Lufthansa jet was stormed in [[Mogadishu]] by the [[GSG 9]] commando unit, who were able to free the hostages. The same day, the leaders of the Baader-Meinhof gang, who had been waging a hunger strike, were found dead in their prison cells with gunshot wounds, which led to Schleyer being executed by his captors.

Genscher continued as Foreign Minister in the new Kohl government. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, due to the entry into the ''Bundestag'' of the [[German Green Party|Greens]], who received 5.6% of the vote. In 1983, despite major protests from peace groups, the Kohl government allowed [[Pershing II]] missiles to be stationed in the Federal Republic to counter the deployment of the [[RSD-10 Pioneer|SS-20]] cruise missiles by the Soviet Union in East Germany. In 1985, Kohl, who had something of a tin ear when it came to dealing with the Nazi past,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2014}} caused much controversy when he invited President [[Ronald Reagan]] of the United States to visit the war cemetery at [[Bitburg]] to mark the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II. The Bitburg cemetery was soon revealed to contain the graves of SS men, which Kohl stated that he did not see as a problem and that to refuse to honor all of the dead of Bitburg including the SS men buried there was an insult to all Germans. Kohl stated that Reagan could come to the Federal Republic to hold a ceremony to honor the dead of Bitburg or not come at all, and that to change the venue of the service to another war cemetery that did not have SS men buried in it was not acceptable to him. Even more controversy was caused by Reagan's statement that all of the SS men killed fighting for Hitler in World War II were \"just kids\" who were just as much the victims of Hitler as those who been murdered by the SS in the Holocaust.<ref name=\"buchanan.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html |title=Pat Buchanan'S Response To Norman Podhoretz'S Op-Ed |accessdate=30 May 2014 |date=5 November 1999 |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Internet Archive |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008152726/http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html |archivedate=8 October 2008 }}</ref> Despite the huge controversy caused by honoring the SS men buried at Bitburg, the visit to Bitburg went ahead, and Kohl and Reagan honored the dead of Bitburg. What was intended to promote German-American reconciliation turned out to be a public relations disaster that had the opposite effect.

Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by [[Hans-Jochen Vogel]]. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%. Later in 1987, Kohl had a summit with the East German leader [[Erich Honecker]]. Unknown to Kohl, the meeting room had been bugged by the Stasi, and the Stasi tapes of the summit had Kohl saying to Honecker that he did not see any realistic chance of reunification in the foreseeable future.\n\n==East Germany (German Democratic Republic)==\n\n{{Main article|East Germany}}\nIn the Soviet occupation zone, the Social Democratic Party was forced to merge with the Communist Party in April 1946 to form a new party, the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' or SED). The October 1946 elections resulted in coalition governments in the five ''Land'' (state) parliaments with the SED as the undisputed leader.\n\nA series of people's congresses were called in 1948 and early 1949 by the SED. Under Soviet direction, a constitution was drafted on 30 May 1949, and adopted on 7 October, the day when East Germany was formally proclaimed. The People's Chamber ''([[Volkskammer]])''\u2014the lower house of the East German parliament\u2014and an upper house\u2014the States Chamber ''(L\u00e4nderkammer)''\u2014were created. (The ''L\u00e4nderkammer'' was abolished again in 1958.) On 11 October 1949, the two houses elected [[Wilhelm Pieck]] as President, and an SED government was set up. The Soviet Union and its East European allies immediately recognized East Germany, although it remained largely unrecognized by noncommunist countries until 1972\u201373. East Germany established the structures of a single-party, centralized, communist state. On 23 July 1952, the traditional ''L\u00e4nder'' were abolished and, in their place, 14 ''Bezirke'' (districts) were established. Even though other parties formally existed, effectively, all government control was in the hands of the SED, and almost all important government positions were held by SED members.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-48550-0036, Besuch Ho Chi Minhs bei Pionieren, bei Berlin.jpg|thumb|North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] with East German [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]], 1957]]\n\nThe [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]] was an [[umbrella organization]] nominally consisting of the SED, four other political parties controlled and directed by the SED, and the four principal mass organizations\u2014youth, trade unions, women, and culture. However, control was clearly and solely in the hands of the SED. Balloting in East German elections was not secret. As in other Soviet bloc countries, electoral participation was consistently high, as the following results indicate. In October 1950, a year after the formation of the GDR, 98.53% of the electorate voted. 99.72% of the votes were valid and 99.72% were cast in favor of the 'National Front'\u2014the title of the 'coalition' of the Unity Party plus their associates in other conformist groups. In election after election, the votes cast for the Socialist Unity Party were always over 99%, and in 1963, two years after the Berlin Wall was constructed, the support for the S.E.D. was 99.95%. Only 0.05% of the electorate opposed the party according to these results, the veracity of which is disputable.<ref>{{cite book|title=Zahlenspiegel ein Vergleich Bundesrepublik Deutschland Deutsche Demokratische Republik Ministerium f\u00fcr Innerdeutsche Beziehungen|year= 1973|page= 7|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Industry and agriculture in East Germany===\nWith the formation of a separate East German communist state in October 1949, the Socialist Unity Party faced a huge range of problems. Not only were the cities in ruins, much of the productive machinery and equipment had been seized by the Soviet occupation force and transported to The Soviet Union in order to make some kind of reconstruction possible. While West Germany received loans and other financial assistance from the United States, the GDR was in the role of an exporter of goods to the USSR\u2014a role that its people could ill afford but which they could not avoid.\n\nThe S.E.D.'s intention was to transform the GDR into a socialist and later into a communist state. These processes would occur step by step according to the laws of scientific 'Marxism-Leninism' and economic planning was the key to this process. In July 1952, at a conference of the S.E.D., Walter Ulbricht announced that \"the democratic (sic) and economic development, and the consciousness (Bewusstsein) of the working class and the majority of the employed classes must be developed so that the construction of Socialism becomes their most important objective.\"<ref name=\"Steininger\">{{cite book|author=Steininger|title= Deutsch Geschichte 1945\u20131961| volume= 2}}</ref>{{rp|453}} This meant that the administration, the armed forces, the planning of industry and agriculture would be under the sole authority of the S.E.D. and its planning committee. Industries would be nationalized and collectivization introduced in the farm industry. When the first Five-Year Plan was announced, the flow of refugees out of East Germany began to grow. As a consequence, production fell, food became short and protests occurred in a number of factories. On 14 May 1952, the S.E.D. ordered that the production quotas (the output per man per shift) were to be increased by 10%, but wages to be kept at the former level. This decision was not popular with the new leaders in the Kremlin. Stalin had died in March 1953 and the new leadership was still evolving. The imposition of new production quotas contradicted the new direction of Soviet policies for their satellites.<ref name=\"Steininger\"/>{{rp|454}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-U1109-022, Berlin, Sandm\u00e4nnchen.jpg|thumbnail|Gerhard Behrendt with Sandm\u00e4nnchen]]\n\nOn 5 June 1953, the S.E.D. announced a 'new course' in which farmers, craftsmen, and factory owners would benefit from a relaxation of controls. The new production quotas remained; the East German workers protested and up to sixty strikes occurred the following day. One of the window-dressing projects in the ruins of East Berlin was the construction of Stalin Allee, on which the most 'class-conscious' workers (in S.E.D. propaganda terms) were involved. At a meeting, strikers declared \"You give the capitalists (the factory owners) presents, and we are exploited!\"<ref name=\"Steininger\"/>{{rp|455}} A delegation of building workers marched to the headquarters of the S.E.D. demanding that the production quotas be rescinded. The crowd grew, demands were made for the removal of Ulbricht from office and a general strike called for the following day.\n\nOn 17 June 1953 strikes and demonstrations occurred in 250 towns and cities in the GDR. Between 300,000 and 400,000 workers took part in the strikes, which were specifically directed towards the rescinding of the production quotas and were not an attempt to overthrow the government. The strikers were for the most part convinced that the transformation of the GDR into a socialist state was the proper course to take but that the S.E.D. had taken a wrong turn.<ref name=\"Steininger\"/>{{rp|457}}\nThe S.E.D. responded with all of the force at its command and also with the help of the Soviet Occupation force. Thousands were arrested, sentenced to jail and many hundreds were forced to leave for West Germany. The S.E.D. later moderated its course but the damage had been done. The real face of the East German regime was revealed. The S.E.D. claimed that the strikes had been instigated by West German agents, but there is no evidence for this. Over 250 strikers were killed, around 100 policemen and some 18 Soviet soldiers died in the uprising;<ref name=\"Steininger\"/>{{rp|459}} 17 June was declared a national day of remembrance in West Germany.\n\n==Berlin==\n\nShortly after [[World War II]], Berlin became the seat of the Allied Control Council, which was to have governed Germany as a whole until the conclusion of a peace settlement. In 1948, however, the [[Soviet Union]] refused to participate any longer in the quadripartite administration of Germany. They also refused to continue the joint administration of Berlin and drove the government elected by the people of Berlin out of its seat in the Soviet sector and installed a communist regime in East Berlin. From then until unification, the Western Allies continued to exercise supreme authority\u2014effective only in their sectors\u2014through the [[Allied Kommandatura]]. To the degree compatible with the city's special status, however, they turned over control and management of city affairs to the [[Senate of Berlin|West Berlin Senate]] and the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]], governing bodies established by constitutional process and chosen by free elections. The Allies and German authorities in West Germany and West Berlin never recognized the communist city regime in East Berlin or East German authority there.\n\nDuring the years of West Berlin's isolation\u2014176 kilometers (110&nbsp;mi.) inside East Germany\u2014the Western Allies encouraged a close relationship between the Government of [[West Berlin]] and that of West Germany. Representatives of the city participated as non-voting members in the West German Parliament; appropriate West German agencies, such as the supreme administrative court, had their permanent seats in the city; and the governing mayor of West Berlin took his turn as President of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. In addition, the Allies carefully consulted with the West German and West Berlin Governments on foreign policy questions involving unification and the status of Berlin.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1990, major events such as fairs and festivals were sponsored in West Berlin, and investment in commerce and industry was encouraged by special concessionary tax legislation. The results of such efforts, combined with effective city administration and the West Berliners' energy and spirit, were encouraging. West Berlin's morale was sustained, and its industrial production considerably surpassed the pre-war level.\n\nThe [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Final Settlement Treaty]] ended Berlin's special status as a separate area under Four Power control. Under the terms of the treaty between West and East Germany, Berlin became the capital of a unified Germany. The Bundestag voted in June 1991 to make Berlin the seat of government. The Government of Germany asked the Allies to maintain a military presence in Berlin until the complete withdrawal of the Western Group of Forces (ex-Soviet) from the territory of the former East Germany. The Russian withdrawal was completed 31 August 1994. Ceremonies were held on 8 September 1994, to mark the final departure of Western Allied troops from Berlin.\n\nGovernment offices have been moving progressively to Berlin, and it became the formal seat of the federal government in 1999. Berlin also is one of the Federal Republic's 16 ''[[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]''.\n\n==Relations between East Germany and West Germany==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nUnder [[Konrad Adenauer|Chancellor Adenauer]] [[West Germany]] declared its right to speak for the entire German nation with an [[exclusive mandate]]. The [[Hallstein Doctrine]] involved non-recognition of East Germany and restricted (or often ceased) diplomatic relations with countries that gave East Germany the status of a sovereign state.\n\nThe constant stream of East Germans fleeing across the [[Inner German border]] to West Germany placed great strains on East German-West German relations in the 1950s. East Germany sealed the borders to West Germany in 1952, but people continued to flee from East Berlin to [[West Berlin]]. On 13 August 1961, East Germany began building the [[Berlin Wall]] around West Berlin to slow the flood of refugees to a trickle, effectively cutting the city in half and making West Berlin an enclave of the Western world in communist territory. The Wall became the symbol of the Cold War and the division of Europe. Shortly afterward, the main border between the two German states was fortified.\n\nThe [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]] of 1965 was controversial at the time, but is now seen as an important step toward improving relations between the German states and [[Poland]].\n\nIn 1969, Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] announced that West Germany would remain firmly rooted in the Atlantic alliance but would intensify efforts to improve relations with the Eastern Bloc, especially East Germany. West Germany commenced this ''[[Ostpolitik]],'' initially under fierce opposition from the conservatives, by negotiating nonaggression treaties with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary.\n\nWest Germany's relations with East Germany posed particularly difficult questions. Though anxious to relieve serious hardships for divided families and to reduce friction, West Germany under Brandt's ''Ostpolitik'' was intent on holding to its concept of \"two German states in one German nation.\" Relations gradually improved. In the early 1970s, the ''Ostpolitik'' led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty (1972)|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both states joining the [[United Nations]], in September 1973. The two German states exchanged [[Permanent Representative|permanent representatives]] in 1974, and, in 1987, East German head of state [[Erich Honecker]] paid an [[Erich Honecker's 1987 visit to West Germany|official visit]] to West Germany.\n\n==The reunification of East Germany and West Germany==\n{{Main article|German reunification}}\n\n===Background===\nInternational plans for the unification of Germany were made during the early years following the establishment of the two states, but to no avail. In March 1952, the Soviet government proposed the [[Stalin note|Stalin Note]] to hold elections for a united German assembly while making the proposed united Germany a neutral state, i.e. a neutral state approved by the people, similar to the Austrians' approval of a neutral Austria. The Western Allied governments refused this initiative, while continuing West Germany's integration into the Western alliance system. The issue was raised again during the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Berlin in January\u2013February 1954, but the western powers refused to make Germany neutral. Following Bonn's adherence to NATO on 9 May 1955, such initiatives were abandoned by both sides.\n\nDuring the summer of 1989, [[Die Wende|rapid changes]] took place in East Germany, which ultimately led to [[German reunification]]. Widespread discontent boiled over, following accusations of large scale vote-rigging during the local elections of May 1989. Growing numbers of East Germans emigrated to West Germany via Hungary after the Hungarians decided not to use force to stop them. Thousands of East Germans also tried to reach the West by staging sit-ins at West German diplomatic facilities in other East European capitals. The exodus generated demands within East Germany for political change, and mass demonstrations ([[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]]) with eventually hundreds of thousands of people in several cities\u2014particularly in [[Leipzig]]\u2014continued to grow. On 7 October, the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited Berlin to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of East Germany and urged the East German leadership to pursue reform, without success. The movement of [[civil resistance]] against the East German regime\u2014both the emigration and the demonstrations\u2014continued unabated.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Charles S. |last=Maier|title=Civil Resistance and Civil Society: Lessons from the Collapse of the German Democratic Republic in 1989|editor-first=Adam|editor-last=Roberts|editor-link=Adam Roberts (scholar)|editor-first2=Timothy Garton |editor-last2=Ash|editor-link2= Timothy Garton Ash|encyclopedia=Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2009|pages= 260\u201376|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC|isbn=9780199552016}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 October, Erich Honecker was forced to resign as head of the SED and as head of state and was replaced by [[Egon Krenz]]. But the exodus continued unabated, and pressure for political reform mounted. On 4 November, a demonstration in East Berlin drew as many as 1 million East Germans. Finally, on 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall was opened, and East Germans were allowed to travel freely. Thousands poured through the wall into the western sectors of Berlin, and on 12 November, East Germany began dismantling it.\n\nOn 28 November, West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] outlined the 10-Point Plan for the peaceful unification of the two German states, based on free elections in East Germany and a unification of their two economies. In December, the East German ''Volkskammer'' eliminated the SED monopoly on power, and the entire Politb\u00fcro and Central Committee\u2014including Krenz\u2014resigned. The SED changed its name to the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) and the formation and growth of numerous political groups and parties marked the end of the communist system. Prime Minister [[Hans Modrow]] headed a [[caretaker government]] which shared power with the new, democratically oriented parties. On 7 December 1989, an agreement was reached to hold free elections in May 1990 and rewrite the East German constitution. On 28 January, all the parties agreed to advance the elections to 18 March, primarily because of an erosion of state authority and because the East German exodus was continuing apace; more than 117,000 left in January and February 1990.\n\nIn early February 1990, the Modrow government's proposal for a unified, neutral German state was rejected by Chancellor Kohl, who affirmed that a unified Germany must be a member of NATO. Finally, on 18 March, the [[East German general election, 1990|first free elections]] were held in East Germany, and a government led by [[Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re]] (CDU) was formed under a policy of expeditious unification with West Germany. The freely elected representatives of the ''Volkskammer'' held their first session on 5 April, and East Germany peacefully evolved from a communist to a democratically elected government. Free and secret communal (local) elections were held in the GDR on 6 May, and the CDU again won most of the available seats. On 1 July, the two German states entered into an economic and monetary union.\n\n===Treaty negotiations===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDuring 1990, in parallel with internal German developments, the Four Powers\u2014the Allies of World War II, being the United States, United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union\u2014together with the two German states negotiated to end Four Power reserved rights for Berlin and Germany as a whole. These \"Two-plus-Four\" negotiations were mandated at the [[Ottawa]] [[Treaty on Open Skies#History|Open Skies]] conference on 13 February 1990. The six foreign ministers met four times in the ensuing months in Bonn (5 May), Berlin (22 June), Paris (17 July), and Moscow (12 September). The Polish Foreign Minister participated in the part of the Paris meeting that dealt with the Polish-German borders.\n\nOvercoming Soviet objections to a united Germany's membership in NATO was of key importance. This was accomplished in July when the alliance, led by President [[George H.W. Bush]], issued the London Declaration on a transformed NATO. On 16 July, President Gorbachev and Chancellor Kohl announced the agreement in principle on a united Germany in NATO. This cleared the way for the signing in Moscow, on 12 September, of the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]]\u2014in effect the peace treaty that was anticipated at the end of World War II. In addition to terminating Four Power rights, the treaty mandated the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Germany by the end of 1994, made clear that the current borders (especially the [[Oder-Neisse line]]) were viewed as final and definitive, and specified the right of a united Germany to belong to NATO. It also provided for the continued presence of British, French, and American troops in Berlin during the interim period of the Soviet withdrawal. In the treaty, the Germans renounced nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and stated their intention to reduce the (combined) German armed forces to 370,000 within 3 to 4 years after the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], signed in Paris on 19 November 1990, entered into force.\n\nThe conclusion of the final settlement cleared the way for the unification of East and West Germany. Formal political union occurred on 3 October 1990, preceded by the GDR declaring its accession to the Federal Republic through Article 23 of West Germany's Basic Law (meaning that constitutionally, East Germany was subsumed into West Germany); but affected in strict legality through the subsequent Unification Treaty of 30 August 1990, which was voted into their constitutions by both the West German Bundestag and the East German Volkskammer on 20 September 1990.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jurisprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> These votes simultaneously extinguished the GDR and affected fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law (including the repeal of the very Article 23 under which the GDR had recently declared its post-dated accession). On 2 December 1990, [[1990 German federal election|all-German elections]] were held for the first time since 1933. The \"new\" country stayed the same as the West German legal system and institutions were extended to the east. The unified nation kept the name [[Bundesrepublik Deutschland]] (though the simple 'Deutschland' would become increasingly common) and retained the West German \"Deutsche Mark\" for currency as well. Berlin would formally become the capital of the united Germany, but the political institutions remained at Bonn for the time being. Only after a heated 1991 debate did the ''[[Bundestag]]'' conclude on moving itself and most of the government to Berlin as well, a process that took until 1999 to complete, when the ''Bundestag'' held its first session at the reconstructed [[Reichstag (building)|''Reichstag'' building]]. Many government departments still maintain sizable presences in Bonn as of 2008.\n\n===Aftermath===\n{{Further information|New states of Germany}}\nTo this day, there remain vast differences between the former East Germany and [[West Germany]] (for example, in lifestyle, wealth, political beliefs, and other matters) and thus it is still common to speak of eastern and western Germany distinctly. The eastern German economy has struggled since unification, and large subsidies are still transferred from west to east.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Works cited'''\n* Fulbrook, Mary.
