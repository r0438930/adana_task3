She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]]. Later, she took part in the  [[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]] and was broken up.<ref name=forrer21 />\n\n== Context ==\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''.

He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> \n\nGroignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would now allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard completed quickly and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery should be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided cease procuring material directly and to mandate a harbour for the overall budget of the project, either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her pieces were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow, <ref name=forrer15 /> and ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767. <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> ''Bretagne'' was commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> but in June 1770 work remained to be done to make her sea worthy, and she spent the whole year fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would now allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard completed quickly and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery should be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided cease procuring material directly and to mandate a harbour for the overall budget of the project, either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her pieces were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow, <ref name=forrer15 /> and ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767. <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> ''Bretagne'' was commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> but in June 1770 work remained to be done to make her sea worthy, and she spent the whole year fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.
