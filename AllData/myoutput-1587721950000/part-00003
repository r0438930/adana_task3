There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the process of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new administrative county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire. \n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit. Its purpose was to take into account and defend the estates within the historic [[Anglican_Diocese_of_Worcester|See of Worcester]], held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]], [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester Priory]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> No fewer than 13 monastic foundations existed in the area, between the 8th and 13th centuries.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/ Encyclopedia Britannica] [https://www.britannica.com/place/Worcestershire-county-England Worcestershire County, England, United Kingdom] - Retrieved 22 February 2020</ref> A 'proto-shire' was believed to exist prior to the county formation, centred upon a fortified [[burh]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stourbridgewesternboundary.kjdocs.co.uk/Stourbridge%20Western%20Boundary.pdf|title=Stourbridge's Western Boundary: A cornerstone of the historical landscape|last=James BSc(Hons) MSc PhD FIAP|first=K|date=11 April 2018|website=Stourbridge's Western Boundary|access-date=11 April 2018}}</ref> The boundaries for this 'proto-shire' and the early established county are unknown.

The proposed border with Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Herefordshire would have seen considerable exchanges of parishes, thus eliminating all of Worcestershire's exclaves/enclaves.<ref>''The Boundary Commission'', The Times, 28 March 1888</ref> This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative ''[[Local Government Act 1888]]''.

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 8) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 8). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 9: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the process of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new administrative county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire. \n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit.

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 8) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 8). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 9: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.
