The temple is an important pilgrimage destination. The present temple was rebuilt from the 10th century onwards, on the site of an earlier temple, and begun by King [[Anantavarman Codaganga|Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva]], first of the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.asianart.com/articles/patachitra/index.html#4 |title=Bernard Cesarone: Pata-chitras of Odisha |first=Bernard |last= Cesarone|work=asianart.com |year=2012 |quote=This temple was built in approximately 1135-1150 by Codaganga, a king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Puri temple is famous for its annual [[Rath Yatra|Ratha yatra]], or [[Temple car|chariot]] festival, in which the three principal [[deities]] are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated [[temple car]]s.

Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and the Govardhan Mutt, which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas.

A 1134\u20131135 CE inscription records his donation to the temple. Therefore, the temple construction must have started sometime after 1112 CE.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|p=50}}\n\nAccording to a story in the temple chronicles, it was founded by [[Anangabhima-deva II]]: different chronicles variously mention the year of construction as 1196, 1197, 1205, 1216, or 1226.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|pp=50-51}} This suggests that the temple's construction was completed or that the temple was renovated during the reign of Anantavarman's son Anangabhima.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|p=51}} The temple complex was further developed during the reigns of the subsequent kings, including those of the Ganga dynasty and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Suryvamshi]] (Gajapati) dynasty.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|pp=51-52}}\n\n==Deities==\n[[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]] are a trio of deities worshipped at the temple.

Having heard about the deity, King [[Indradyumna]] sent a Brahmin priest, Vidyapati to locate the deity, who was worshipped secretly in a dense forest by Viswavasu. Vidyapati tried his best but could not locate the place. But at last he managed to marry Viswavasu's daughter Lalita. At repeated request of Vidyapti, Viswavasu took his son-in-law blind folded to a cave where Lord Neela Madhaba was worshipped.\n\nVidyapati was very intelligent. He dropped mustard seeds on the ground on the way. The seeds germinated after a few days, which enabled him to find out the cave later on. On hearing from him, King [[Indradyumna]] proceeded immediately to Odra desha (Odisha) on a pilgrimage to see and worship the Deity. But the deity had disappeared. The king was disappointed. The Deity was hidden in sand. The king was determined not to return without having a darshan of the deity and observed fast unto death at Mount Neela, Then a celestial voice cried 'thou shalt see him.'  Afterward, the king performed a horse sacrifice and built a magnificent temple for Vishnu. Sri [[Narasimha]] Murti brought by Narada was installed in the temple. During sleep, the king had a vision of Lord [[Jagannath]]. Also an astral voice directed him to receive the fragrant tree on the seashore and make idols out of it. Accordingly, the king got the image of Lord [[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]], [[Subhadra]] and Chakra [[Sudarshana Chakra|Sudarshan]] made out of the wood of the divine tree and installed them in the temple.\n\n'''[[Indradyumna]]'s prayer to Lord Brahma'''\n\nKing [[Indradyumna]] put up for [[Jagannath]] the tallest monument of the world. It was 1,000 cubits high. He invited Lord [[Brahma]], the cosmic creator, consecrate the temple and the images.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jagannathpuri-info.net/storypuri.php |title=Sri Jagannath Puri Dham Information - Jagannath |work=jagannathpuri-info.net |year=2012 |quote=The King wanted Lord Brahma to consecrate the temple |accessdate=26 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704050957/http://www.jagannathpuri-info.net/storypuri.php |archive-date=4 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nBrahma came all the way from Heaven for this purpose. Seeing the temple he was immensely pleased with him. Brahma asked [[Indradyumna]] as to in what way can he (Brahma) fulfill the king's desire, since was very much pleased with him for his having put the most beautiful Temple for Lord [[Vishnu]]. With folded hands, [[Indradyumna]] said, \"My Lord if you are really pleased with me, kindly bless me with one thing, and it is that I should be issueless and that I should be the last member of my family.\" In case anybody left alive after him, he would only take pride as the owner of the temple and would not work for the society.\n\n====Legend surrounding the Temple origin====\nThe traditional story concerning the origins of the Lord Jagannath temple is that here the original image of Jagannath (a [[deity]] form of [[Vishnu]]) at the end of [[Treta yuga]] manifested near a [[banyan]] tree, near [[Coast|seashore]] in the form of an [[Blue Sapphire|Indranila mani]] or the Blue Jewel.  It was so dazzling that it could grant instant [[moksha]], so the God [[Dharma]] or [[Yama]] wanted to hide it in the earth and was successful. In Dvapara Yuga King Indradyumna of [[Avanti (India)|Malwa]] wanted to find that mysterious image and to do so he performed harsh [[penance]]s to obtain his goal. Vishnu then instructed him to go to the Puri [[Coast|seashore]] and find a floating log to make an image from its trunk.\n\nThe King found the log of wood. He did a yajna from which God Yajna [[Nrisimha]] appeared and instructed that [[Narayana]] should be made as fourfold expansion, i.e. Paramatma as ''Vasudeva'', his Vyuha as ''Samkarshana'', Yogamaya as ''Subhadra'', and his Vibhava as''Sudarsana''. [[Vishwakarma]] appeared in the form of an artisan and prepared images of Jagannath, [[Balabhadra]] and Subhadra from the tree.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.templenet.com/Orissa/puri.html\n|title=Jagannath Temple at Puri\n|accessdate=12 September 2006\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen this log, radiant with light was seen floating in the sea, Narada told the king to make three idols out of it and place them in a pavilion. Indradyumna got Visvakarma, the architect of Gods, to build a magnificent temple to house the idols and Vishnu himself appeared in the guise of a carpenter to make the idols on condition that he was to be left undisturbed until he finished the work.\n\nBut just after two weeks, the Queen became very anxious. She took the carpenter to be dead as no sound came from the temple. Therefore, she requested the king to open the door. Thus, they went to see Vishnu at work at which the latter abandoned his work leaving the idols unfinished. The idol was devoid of any hands. But a divine voice told Indradyumana to install them in the temple. It has also been widely believed that in spite of the idol being without hands, it can watch over the world and be its lord. Thus the idiom.\n\n[[File:Rath Yatra Puri 07-11027.jpg|thumb|x216px|text|The [[Rath Yatra]] in Puri in modern times showing the three chariots of the deities with the Temple in the background.]]\n\n==Invasions and desecrations of the Temple==\nThe temple annals, the [[Madala Panji]] records that the Jagannath temple at Puri has been invaded and plundered eighteen times.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dash |first1=Abhimanyu |title=Invasions on the Temple of Lord Jagannath, Puri |journal=Orissa Review |date=July 2011 |pages=82\u201389 |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/july/engpdf/82-89.pdf |accessdate=4 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125621/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/july/engpdf/82-89.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref> In 1692, Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] ordered to close the temple until he wanted to reopen it otherwise it would be demolished, the local Mughal officials who came to carry out the job were requested by the locals and the temple was merely closed.

Another legend claims him to be [[Nilamadhava]], an image of Narayana made of blue stone and worshipped by the aboriginals. He was brought to [[Nilagiri]] (blue mountain) or Nilachala and installed there as Shri [[Jagannath]] in company with [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]]. The images made of wood are also claimed to have their distant linkage with the aboriginal system of worshipping wooden poles. To cap it all the Daitapatis, who have a fair share of responsibilities to perform rituals of the Temple, are claimed to be descendants of the aboriginals or hill tribes of Odisha. So we may safely claim that the beginning of the cultural history of Shrikshetra is found in the fusion of Hindu and Tribal Cultures. The three deities came to be claimed as the symbols of [[Samyak Darshan]], [[Samyak Jnana]] and [[Samyak Charita]] usually regarded as Triratha (of the [[Jain]] culture), an assimilation of which leads to [[Moksha]] ([[salvation]]) or the ultimate bliss...\n\nJagannath is worshipped as Vishnu or [[Narayana]] or [[Krishna]] and Lord [[Balabhadra]] as [[Shesha]]. Simultaneously, the deities are regarded as the [[bhairava]] with [[Vimala Temple|Vimala]] (the [[devi]] or the consort of Shiva) installed in the campus of the temple. So ultimately we find a fusion of [[Saivism]], [[Shaktism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] of the Hindu religion with [[Jainism]] and up to an extent Buddhism in the culture of Jagannath and the cultural tradition so reverently held together in Shrikshetra.\n\n===Acharyas and Jagannatha Puri===\nAll of the renowned acharyas including [[Madhvacharya]] have been known to visit this kshetra. [[Adi Shankara]] established his [[Govardhana matha]] here.  There is also evidence that [[Guru Nanak]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ramanujacharya]], and [[Nimbarkacharya]] had visited this place. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] stayed here for 24 years, establishing that the love of God can be spread by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. Srimad Vallabhacharya visited Jagannath Puri and performed a 7-day recitation of Srimad Bhagvat. His sitting place is still famous as \"baithakji.\" It confirms his visit to [[Puri]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Srimandir/srimandirenglish/Epdf/Ech1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410074454/http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Srimandir/srimandirenglish/Epdf/Ech1.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2009  }}</ref>\n\nA famous incident took place when Vallabhachrya visited. There was a discourse being held between the Brahmins and 4 questions were asked. Who is the highest of Gods, What is the highest of mantras, What is the highest scripture and What is the highest service. The discourse went on for many days with many schools of thought. Finally Shri Vallabh said to ask Lord Jagannath to confirm Shri Vallabh's answers. A pen and paper were left in the inner sanctum. After some time, the doors were opened and 4 answers were written. 1) The Son of Devaki (Krishna) is the God of Gods 2) His name is the highest of mantras 3) His song is the highest scripture (Bhagavat Geeta) 4) Service to Him is the Highest service. The king was shocked and declared Shri Vallabh the winner of the discourse. Some of the pandits who participated became jealous of Shri Vallabh and wanted to test Him. The next day was Ekadashi, a fasting day where one must fast from grains. The pandits gave Shri Vallabh rice Prasad of Shri Jagannathji (The temple is famous for this). If Shri Vallabh ate it, He would break His vow of fasting but if He did not take it, He would disrespect Lord Jagannath. Shri Vallabh accepted the prasad in his hand and spent the rest of the day and night explaining slokas of the greatness of Prasad and ate the rice the next morning.\n\n===Char Dham===\nThe temple is one of the holiest [[Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]] ''[[Char Dham]]'' (four divine sites) sites comprising [[Rameswaram]], [[Badrinath]], [[Puri]] and [[Dwarka]].{{sfn|Mahadev Chakravarti|1986|p=140}} Though the origins are not clearly known, the [[Advaita]] school of Hinduism propagated by [[Sankaracharya]], who created Hindu monastic institutions across India, attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mittal|first=Sushil|title=The Hindu World|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-64470-0|page=482}}</ref> The four monasteries lie across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are [[Badrinath Temple]] at Badrinath in the North, Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East, [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarakadheesh Temple]] at Dwarka in the West and [[Ramanathaswamy Temple]] at Rameswaram in the South.

They are named after the sculptures of animals guarding them. The other entrances are the '''Hathidwara''' or the Elephant Gate, the '''Vyaghradwara''' or the Tiger Gate and the '''Ashwadwara''' or the Horse Gate.\n\n===Minor temples===\n[[File:Minor temples in Jagannath Puri.jpg|thumb|Cluster of minor temples in the southern part of Jagannath temple complex, including the [[Vimala Temple]] (extreme right). c. 1890.]]\nThere are numerous smaller temples and shrines within the Temple complex where active worship is regularly conducted. The [[Vimala Temple]] (Bimala Temple) is considered one of the most important of the [[Shaktipeeth]]s marks the spot where the Goddess [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]]'s navel fell. It is located near [[Pancha Tirtha of Puri|Rohini Kund]] in the temple complex. Until food offered to Jagannath is offered to Goddess Vimala it is not considered [[Mahaprasad (Jagannath Temple)|Mahaprasad]].\n\nThe temple of [[Mahalakshmi]] has an important role in rituals of the main temple. It is said that preparation of [[naivedhya|naivedya]] as offering for Jagannath is supervised by Mahalakshmi. The Kanchi Ganesh Temple is dedicated to [[Uchchhishta Ganapati]]. Tradition says the King of [[Kanchipuram]] (Kanchi) in ancient times gifted the idol, when Gajapati Purushottama Deva married Padmavati, the ''kanchi'' princess. There are other shrines namely [[utkala brahmin|Muktimandap]], [[Surya]], [[Saraswati]], [[Bhuvaneshwari]], [[Narasimha]], [[Rama]], [[Hanuman]] and [[Shiva|Eshaneshwara]].\n\n===The Mandapas===\n[[File:Dola Mandap.jpg|thumb|150px|The Dola Mandapa in 1890 where the annual Dol Yatra is held.]]\nThere are many [[Mandapa]]s or Pillared halls on raised platforms within the temple complex meant for religious congregations.

The '''Dola Mandapa''' is noteworthy for a beautifully carved stone [[Torana]] or arch which is used for constructing a swing for the annual Dol Yatra festival. During the festival the idol of Dologobinda is placed on the swing. The Snana Bedi is a rectangular stone platform where idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra are placed for ceremonial bathing during the annual [[Snana Yatra]].\n\n==Daily food offerings==\n{{Main|Mahaprasad (Jagannath Temple)}}\nDaily offerings are made to the Lord six times a day.

There are many festivals each year attended by millions of people. The most important festival is the [[Temple car|Rath]] Yatra or the Chariot festival in June. This spectacular festival includes a procession of three huge chariots bearing the idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra through the '''Bada Danda''' meaning the Grand Avenue of Puri till their final destination the [[Gundicha Temple]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.templenet.com/Orissa/puri.html\n|title=Jagannath Temple at Puri\n|accessdate=20 September 2006\n}}</ref>\n\nEarly European observers told tales of devotees being crushed under the wheels of these chariots, whether by accident or even as a form of meritorious suicide akin to [[Sati (practice)|suttee]].  These reports gave rise to the loan word [[juggernaut]] suggesting an immense, unstoppable, threatening entity or process operated by fanatics.\nMany festivals like [[holi|Dol Yatra]] in spring and [[raksha bandhan|Jhulan Yatra]] in monsoon are celebrated by temple every year. '''Pavitrotsava''' and '''Damanaka utsava''' are celebrated as per [[panchanga]] or [[panjika]].There are special ceremonies in the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] and [[Pausha]].\n\nThe annual ''shodasha dinatmaka'' or 16-day puja beginning 8 days prior to [[Mahalaya]] of [[Ashwin]] month for Goddess [[Bhairavi|Vimala]] and ending on [[Vijayadashami]], is of great importance, in which both the utsava murty of lord [[krishna|Madanmohan]] and [[Bhairavi|Vimala]] take part.\n* Pana Sankranti: Also known or [[Vishuva Sankranti]] and [[Mesha (Indian astrology)|Mesha]] [[Sankranti]]: Special rituals are performed at the temple.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fullodisha.com/puri/temple_festivals.htm |title=Festivals of lord jagannath, puri festivals   |work=fullorissa.com |year=2010  |quote=Pana Sankranti or Mahabishuba sankranti: |accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chandan Yatra===\n{{main|Chandan Yatra}}\nIn [[Akshaya Tritiya]] every year the [[Chandan Yatra]] festival marks the commencement of the construction of the Chariots of the Rath Yatra.\n\n===Snnana Yatra===\nOn the [[Full Moon|Purnima]] of the month of [[Jyestha]] the Gods are ceremonially bathed and decorated every year on the occasion of [[Snana Yatra]].\n\n===Anavasara or Anasara===\n{{main|Snana Yatra}}\nLiterally means vacation.

This festival is known as Rath Yatra, meaning the journey ([[yatra]]) of the chariots (ratha). The Rathas are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 45 feet high and 35 feet square and takes about 2 months to construct.{{sfn|O. M. Starza|1993|p=16}} The artists and painters of Puri decorate the cars and paint flower petals and other designs on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne.{{Sfn|Das|1982|p=40}} The huge chariots of Jagannath pulled during Rath Yatra is the etymological origin of the English word [[Juggernaut]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Juggernaut-Definition and Meaning|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juggernaut|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref> The Ratha-Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha yatra.\n\nThe most significant ritual associated with the Ratha-Yatra is the ''chhera pahara''. During the festival, the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati King]] wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the ''Chera Pahara'' (sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati King cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion.  As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]n kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign Gajapati King and the most humble devotee.<ref>{{cite news|last=Karan|first=Jajati|title=Lord Jagannath yatra to begin soon|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lord-jagannath-yatra-to-begin-soon/68263-3-2.html|accessdate=28 November 2012|newspaper=IBN Live|date=4 July 2008}}</ref>\n''Chera pahara'' is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, when the deities are taken to garden house at [[Mausi Maa Temple]] and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.\n\nAs per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the Chariots in ''Pahandi vijay''.\n\nIn the Ratha Yatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the [[Gundicha Temple]], where they stay for nine days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in ''bahuda yatra''. On the way back, the three chariots halt at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered ''Poda Pitha,'' a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the Odisha people only.\n\nThe observance of the Rath Yatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas. Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in [[Brahma Purana]], [[Padma Purana]], and [[Skanda Purana]]. Kapila Samhita also refers to Rath Yatra. In [[Moghul]] period also, King Ramsingh of [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]] has been described as organizing the Rath Yatra in the 18th Century. In [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], Kings of [[Mayurbhanj District|Mayurbhanj]] and [[Parlakhemundi]] were organizing the Rath Yatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri.\n\nMoreover, Starza{{sfn|O. M. Starza|1993|p=133}} notes that the ruling [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga dynasty]] instituted the Rath Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. [[Friar Odoric]] of Pordenone visited India in 1316\u20131318, some 20 years after [[Marco Polo]] had dictated the account of his travels while in a [[Genoa|Genoese]] prison.{{sfn|Partha Mitter|1977|p=10}} In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the \"idols\" on chariots, and the King and Queen and all the people drew them from the \"church\" with song and music.{{sfn|O.

A 1134\u20131135 CE inscription records his donation to the temple. Therefore, the temple construction must have started sometime after 1112 CE.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|p=50}}\n\nAccording to a story in the temple chronicles, it was founded by [[Anangabhima-deva II]]: different chronicles variously mention the year of construction as 1196, 1197, 1205, 1216, or 1226.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|pp=50-51}} This suggests that the temple's construction was completed or that the temple was renovated during the reign of Anantavarman's son Anangabhima.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|p=51}} The temple complex was further developed during the reigns of the subsequent kings, including those of the Ganga dynasty and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Suryvamshi]] (Gajapati) dynasty.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|pp=51-52}}\n\n==Deities==\n[[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]] are a trio of deities worshipped at the temple.

Having heard about the deity, King [[Indradyumna]] sent a Brahmin priest, Vidyapati to locate the deity, who was worshipped secretly in a dense forest by Viswavasu. Vidyapati tried his best but could not locate the place. But at last he managed to marry Viswavasu's daughter Lalita. At repeated request of Vidyapti, Viswavasu took his son-in-law blind folded to a cave where Lord Neela Madhaba was worshipped.\n\nVidyapati was very intelligent. He dropped mustard seeds on the ground on the way. The seeds germinated after a few days, which enabled him to find out the cave later on. On hearing from him, King [[Indradyumna]] proceeded immediately to Odra desha (Odisha) on a pilgrimage to see and worship the Deity. But the deity had disappeared. The king was disappointed. The Deity was hidden in sand. The king was determined not to return without having a darshan of the deity and observed fast unto death at Mount Neela, Then a celestial voice cried 'thou shalt see him.'  Afterward, the king performed a horse sacrifice and built a magnificent temple for Vishnu. Sri [[Narasimha]] Murti brought by Narada was installed in the temple. During sleep, the king had a vision of Lord [[Jagannath]]. Also an astral voice directed him to receive the fragrant tree on the seashore and make idols out of it. Accordingly, the king got the image of Lord [[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]], [[Subhadra]] and Chakra [[Sudarshana Chakra|Sudarshan]] made out of the wood of the divine tree and installed them in the temple.\n\n'''[[Indradyumna]]'s prayer to Lord Brahma'''\n\nKing [[Indradyumna]] put up for [[Jagannath]] the tallest monument of the world. It was 1,000 cubits high. He invited Lord [[Brahma]], the cosmic creator, consecrate the temple and the images.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jagannathpuri-info.net/storypuri.php |title=Sri Jagannath Puri Dham Information - Jagannath |work=jagannathpuri-info.net |year=2012 |quote=The King wanted Lord Brahma to consecrate the temple |accessdate=26 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704050957/http://www.jagannathpuri-info.net/storypuri.php |archive-date=4 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nBrahma came all the way from Heaven for this purpose. Seeing the temple he was immensely pleased with him. Brahma asked [[Indradyumna]] as to in what way can he (Brahma) fulfill the king's desire, since was very much pleased with him for his having put the most beautiful Temple for Lord [[Vishnu]]. With folded hands, [[Indradyumna]] said, \"My Lord if you are really pleased with me, kindly bless me with one thing, and it is that I should be issueless and that I should be the last member of my family.\" In case anybody left alive after him, he would only take pride as the owner of the temple and would not work for the society.\n\n====Legend surrounding the Temple origin====\nThe traditional story concerning the origins of the Lord Jagannath temple is that here the original image of Jagannath (a [[deity]] form of [[Vishnu]]) at the end of [[Treta yuga]] manifested near a [[banyan]] tree, near [[Coast|seashore]] in the form of an [[Blue Sapphire|Indranila mani]] or the Blue Jewel.  It was so dazzling that it could grant instant [[moksha]], so the God [[Dharma]] or [[Yama]] wanted to hide it in the earth and was successful. In Dvapara Yuga King Indradyumna of [[Avanti (India)|Malwa]] wanted to find that mysterious image and to do so he performed harsh [[penance]]s to obtain his goal. Vishnu then instructed him to go to the Puri [[Coast|seashore]] and find a floating log to make an image from its trunk.\n\nThe King found the log of wood. He did a yajna from which God Yajna [[Nrisimha]] appeared and instructed that [[Narayana]] should be made as fourfold expansion, i.e. Paramatma as ''Vasudeva'', his Vyuha as ''Samkarshana'', Yogamaya as ''Subhadra'', and his Vibhava as''Sudarsana''. [[Vishwakarma]] appeared in the form of an artisan and prepared images of Jagannath, [[Balabhadra]] and Subhadra from the tree.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.templenet.com/Orissa/puri.html\n|title=Jagannath Temple at Puri\n|accessdate=12 September 2006\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen this log, radiant with light was seen floating in the sea, Narada told the king to make three idols out of it and place them in a pavilion. Indradyumna got Visvakarma, the architect of Gods, to build a magnificent temple to house the idols and Vishnu himself appeared in the guise of a carpenter to make the idols on condition that he was to be left undisturbed until he finished the work.\n\nBut just after two weeks, the Queen became very anxious. She took the carpenter to be dead as no sound came from the temple. Therefore, she requested the king to open the door. Thus, they went to see Vishnu at work at which the latter abandoned his work leaving the idols unfinished. The idol was devoid of any hands. But a divine voice told Indradyumana to install them in the temple. It has also been widely believed that in spite of the idol being without hands, it can watch over the world and be its lord. Thus the idiom.\n\n[[File:Rath Yatra Puri 07-11027.jpg|thumb|x216px|text|The [[Rath Yatra]] in Puri in modern times showing the three chariots of the deities with the Temple in the background.]]\n\n==Invasions and desecrations of the Temple==\nThe temple annals, the [[Madala Panji]] records that the Jagannath temple at Puri has been invaded and plundered eighteen times.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dash |first1=Abhimanyu |title=Invasions on the Temple of Lord Jagannath, Puri |journal=Orissa Review |date=July 2011 |pages=82\u201389 |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/july/engpdf/82-89.pdf |accessdate=4 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125621/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/july/engpdf/82-89.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref> In 1692, Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] ordered to close the temple until he wanted to reopen it otherwise it would be demolished, the local Mughal officials who came to carry out the job were requested by the locals and the temple was merely closed.

Another legend claims him to be [[Nilamadhava]], an image of Narayana made of blue stone and worshipped by the aboriginals. He was brought to [[Nilagiri]] (blue mountain) or Nilachala and installed there as Shri [[Jagannath]] in company with [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]]. The images made of wood are also claimed to have their distant linkage with the aboriginal system of worshipping wooden poles. To cap it all the Daitapatis, who have a fair share of responsibilities to perform rituals of the Temple, are claimed to be descendants of the aboriginals or hill tribes of Odisha. So we may safely claim that the beginning of the cultural history of Shrikshetra is found in the fusion of Hindu and Tribal Cultures. The three deities came to be claimed as the symbols of [[Samyak Darshan]], [[Samyak Jnana]] and [[Samyak Charita]] usually regarded as Triratha (of the [[Jain]] culture), an assimilation of which leads to [[Moksha]] ([[salvation]]) or the ultimate bliss...\n\nJagannath is worshipped as Vishnu or [[Narayana]] or [[Krishna]] and Lord [[Balabhadra]] as [[Shesha]]. Simultaneously, the deities are regarded as the [[bhairava]] with [[Vimala Temple|Vimala]] (the [[devi]] or the consort of Shiva) installed in the campus of the temple. So ultimately we find a fusion of [[Saivism]], [[Shaktism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] of the Hindu religion with [[Jainism]] and up to an extent Buddhism in the culture of Jagannath and the cultural tradition so reverently held together in Shrikshetra.\n\n===Acharyas and Jagannatha Puri===\nAll of the renowned acharyas including [[Madhvacharya]] have been known to visit this kshetra. [[Adi Shankara]] established his [[Govardhana matha]] here.  There is also evidence that [[Guru Nanak]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ramanujacharya]], and [[Nimbarkacharya]] had visited this place. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] stayed here for 24 years, establishing that the love of God can be spread by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. Srimad Vallabhacharya visited Jagannath Puri and performed a 7-day recitation of Srimad Bhagvat.

Who is the highest of Gods, What is the highest of mantras, What is the highest scripture and What is the highest service. The discourse went on for many days with many schools of thought. Finally Shri Vallabh said to ask Lord Jagannath to confirm Shri Vallabh's answers. A pen and paper were left in the inner sanctum. After some time, the doors were opened and 4 answers were written. 1) The Son of Devaki (Krishna) is the God of Gods 2) His name is the highest of mantras 3) His song is the highest scripture (Bhagavat Geeta) 4) Service to Him is the Highest service. The king was shocked and declared Shri Vallabh the winner of the discourse. Some of the pandits who participated became jealous of Shri Vallabh and wanted to test Him. The next day was Ekadashi, a fasting day where one must fast from grains. The pandits gave Shri Vallabh rice Prasad of Shri Jagannathji (The temple is famous for this). If Shri Vallabh ate it, He would break His vow of fasting but if He did not take it, He would disrespect Lord Jagannath. Shri Vallabh accepted the prasad in his hand and spent the rest of the day and night explaining slokas of the greatness of Prasad and ate the rice the next morning.\n\n===Char Dham===\nThe temple is one of the holiest [[Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]] ''[[Char Dham]]'' (four divine sites) sites comprising [[Rameswaram]], [[Badrinath]], [[Puri]] and [[Dwarka]].{{sfn|Mahadev Chakravarti|1986|p=140}} Though the origins are not clearly known, the [[Advaita]] school of Hinduism propagated by [[Sankaracharya]], who created Hindu monastic institutions across India, attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mittal|first=Sushil|title=The Hindu World|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-64470-0|page=482}}</ref> The four monasteries lie across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are [[Badrinath Temple]] at Badrinath in the North, Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East, [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarakadheesh Temple]] at Dwarka in the West and [[Ramanathaswamy Temple]] at Rameswaram in the South.

The [[Vimala Temple]] (Bimala Temple) is considered one of the most important of the [[Shaktipeeth]]s marks the spot where the Goddess [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]]'s navel fell. It is located near [[Pancha Tirtha of Puri|Rohini Kund]] in the temple complex. Until food offered to Jagannath is offered to Goddess Vimala it is not considered [[Mahaprasad (Jagannath Temple)|Mahaprasad]].\n\nThe temple of [[Mahalakshmi]] has an important role in rituals of the main temple. It is said that preparation of [[naivedhya|naivedya]] as offering for Jagannath is supervised by Mahalakshmi. The Kanchi Ganesh Temple is dedicated to [[Uchchhishta Ganapati]]. Tradition says the King of [[Kanchipuram]] (Kanchi) in ancient times gifted the idol, when Gajapati Purushottama Deva married Padmavati, the ''kanchi'' princess.

'''Pavitrotsava''' and '''Damanaka utsava''' are celebrated as per [[panchanga]] or [[panjika]].There are special ceremonies in the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] and [[Pausha]].\n\nThe annual ''shodasha dinatmaka'' or 16-day puja beginning 8 days prior to [[Mahalaya]] of [[Ashwin]] month for Goddess [[Bhairavi|Vimala]] and ending on [[Vijayadashami]], is of great importance, in which both the utsava murty of lord [[krishna|Madanmohan]] and [[Bhairavi|Vimala]] take part.\n* Pana Sankranti: Also known or [[Vishuva Sankranti]] and [[Mesha (Indian astrology)|Mesha]] [[Sankranti]]: Special rituals are performed at the temple.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fullodisha.com/puri/temple_festivals.htm |title=Festivals of lord jagannath, puri festivals   |work=fullorissa.com |year=2010  |quote=Pana Sankranti or Mahabishuba sankranti: |accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chandan Yatra===\n{{main|Chandan Yatra}}\nIn [[Akshaya Tritiya]] every year the [[Chandan Yatra]] festival marks the commencement of the construction of the Chariots of the Rath Yatra.\n\n===Snnana Yatra===\nOn the [[Full Moon|Purnima]] of the month of [[Jyestha]] the Gods are ceremonially bathed and decorated every year on the occasion of [[Snana Yatra]].\n\n===Anavasara or Anasara===\n{{main|Snana Yatra}}\nLiterally means vacation.

This festival is known as Rath Yatra, meaning the journey ([[yatra]]) of the chariots (ratha). The Rathas are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 45 feet high and 35 feet square and takes about 2 months to construct.{{sfn|O. M.

During the festival, the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati King]] wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the ''Chera Pahara'' (sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati King cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion.  As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]n kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign Gajapati King and the most humble devotee.<ref>{{cite news|last=Karan|first=Jajati|title=Lord Jagannath yatra to begin soon|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lord-jagannath-yatra-to-begin-soon/68263-3-2.html|accessdate=28 November 2012|newspaper=IBN Live|date=4 July 2008}}</ref>\n''Chera pahara'' is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, when the deities are taken to garden house at [[Mausi Maa Temple]] and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.\n\nAs per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the Chariots in ''Pahandi vijay''.\n\nIn the Ratha Yatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the [[Gundicha Temple]], where they stay for nine days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in ''bahuda yatra''. On the way back, the three chariots halt at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered ''Poda Pitha,'' a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the Odisha people only.\n\nThe observance of the Rath Yatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas. Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in [[Brahma Purana]], [[Padma Purana]], and [[Skanda Purana]]. Kapila Samhita also refers to Rath Yatra. In [[Moghul]] period also, King Ramsingh of [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]] has been described as organizing the Rath Yatra in the 18th Century. In [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], Kings of [[Mayurbhanj District|Mayurbhanj]] and [[Parlakhemundi]] were organizing the Rath Yatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri.\n\nMoreover, Starza{{sfn|O. M. Starza|1993|p=133}} notes that the ruling [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga dynasty]] instituted the Rath Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. [[Friar Odoric]] of Pordenone visited India in 1316-1318, some 20 years after [[Marco Polo]] had dictated the account of his travels while in a [[Genoa|Genoese]] prison.{{sfn|Partha Mitter|1977|p=10}} In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the \"idols\" on chariots, and the King and Queen and all the people drew them from the \"church\" with song and music.{{sfn|O.
