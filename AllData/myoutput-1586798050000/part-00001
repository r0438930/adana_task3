In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nIn Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.\n\nEarly in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].\n\nThe Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H.

In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty.\n\n==Flags==\nIn 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red. [[Ensign of the United States|A flag having 13 horizontal red and white stripes]] was used by Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]] (Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy) and by American merchant ships during the war.  This flag was also associated with the Sons of Liberty. Red and white were common colors of the flags, although other color combinations were used, such as green and white or yellow and white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us%5Erv.html|title=Colonial and Revolutionary War Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-librt.html#sons|title=Liberty Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=raven&id=raven_2004_0011_0001_0060|title=The First Navy Jack|first1=Peter|last1=Ansoff|first2=North American Vexillological Association / Association nord-am\u00e9ricaine de|last2=vexillologie|date=1 July 2004|publisher=|journal=Raven: A Journal of Vexillology|volume=11|pages=1\u201360|accessdate=10 January 2018|doi=10.5840/raven2004111}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Sons of Liberty==\n[[File:Sons of Liberty.jpg|thumb|'''1st row:''' [[Samuel Adams]] \u2022 [[Benedict Arnold]] \u2022 [[John Hancock]] \u2022 [[Patrick Henry]] \u2022 [[James Otis, Jr.]]  '''2nd row:''' [[Paul Revere]] \u2022 [[James Swan (financier)|James Swan]] \u2022 [[Alexander McDougall]] \u2022 [[Benjamin Rush]] \u2022 [[Charles Thomson]]  '''3rd row:''' [[Joseph Warren]] \u2022 [[Marinus Willett]] \u2022 [[Oliver Wolcott]] \u2022 [[Christopher Gadsden]] \u2022 [[Haym Salomon]] <br>'''Not pictured''': [[Hercules Mulligan]], [[Thomas Melvill (American patriot)|Thomas Melvill]], [[Isaac Sears]]]]\n=== Boston ===\n* [[Samuel Adams]] \u2013 political writer, [[tax collector]], cousin of [[John Adams]], fire warden.

This became commonly known as \"[[No Taxation without Representation]].\" Parliament insisted on its right to rule the colonies despite the fact that the colonists had no representative in Parliament.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943)</ref> The most incendiary tax was the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], which caused a firestorm of opposition through legislative resolutions (starting in the colony of [[History of Virginia|Virginia]]), public demonstrations,<ref>Such as by the local judges and Frederick, Maryland.

In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nIn Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.\n\nEarly in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].\n\nThe Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H. Irvin, \"Tar, feathers, and the enemies of American liberties, 1768-1776.\" ''New England Quarterly'' (2003): 197-238. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1559903 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===New York===\nIn December 1773, a new group calling itself the Sons of Liberty issued and distributed a declaration in New York City called the ''Association of the Sons of Liberty in New York,\" which formally stated that they were opposed to the [[Tea Act]] and that anyone who assisted in the execution of the act was \"an enemy to the liberties of America\" and that \"whoever shall transgress any of these resolutions, we will not deal with, or employ, or have any connection with him.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=T.

In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty. \n\n==Flags==\nIn 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red. [[Ensign of the United States|A flag having 13 horizontal red and white stripes]] was used by Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]] (Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy) and by American merchant ships during the war.  This flag was also associated with the Sons of Liberty. Red and white were common colors of the flags, although other color combinations were used, such as green and white or yellow and white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us%5Erv.html|title=Colonial and Revolutionary War Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-librt.html#sons|title=Liberty Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=raven&id=raven_2004_0011_0001_0060|title=The First Navy Jack|first1=Peter|last1=Ansoff|first2=North American Vexillological Association / Association nord-am\u00e9ricaine de|last2=vexillologie|date=1 July 2004|publisher=|journal=Raven: A Journal of Vexillology|volume=11|pages=1\u201360|accessdate=10 January 2018|doi=10.5840/raven2004111}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Sons of Liberty==\n[[File:Sons of Liberty.jpg|thumb|'''1st row:''' [[Samuel Adams]] \u2022 [[Benedict Arnold]] \u2022 [[John Hancock]] \u2022 [[Patrick Henry]] \u2022 [[James Otis, Jr.]]  '''2nd row:''' [[Paul Revere]] \u2022 [[James Swan (financier)|James Swan]] \u2022 [[Alexander McDougall]] \u2022 [[Benjamin Rush]] \u2022 [[Charles Thomson]]  '''3rd row:''' [[Joseph Warren]] \u2022 [[Marinus Willett]] \u2022 [[Oliver Wolcott]] \u2022 [[Christopher Gadsden]] \u2022 [[Haym Salomon]] <br>'''Not pictured''': [[Hercules Mulligan]], [[Thomas Melvill (American patriot)|Thomas Melvill]], [[Isaac Sears]]]]\n=== Boston ===\n* [[Samuel Adams]] \u2013 political writer, [[tax collector]], cousin of [[John Adams]], fire warden.
