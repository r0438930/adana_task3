It is an [[Irritation|irritant]] for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related compounds are called '''capsaicinoids''' and are produced as [[secondary metabolite]]s by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi.<ref name=\"totn\">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93636630 What Made Chili Peppers So Spicy?] Talk of the Nation, 15 August 2008.</ref> Pure capsaicin is a [[hydrophobic]], colorless, highly [[pungent]],<ref name=PubChem/> crystalline to waxy solid compound.\n\n==Natural function==\nCapsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes and, to a lesser extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus ''[[Capsicum]]''.  The seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith of the inner wall, where the seeds are attached.<ref>{{cite web|author=New Mexico State University \u2013 College of Agriculture and Home Economics |title=Chile Information \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions |year=2005 |url=http://spectre.nmsu.edu/dept/academic.html?i=1274&s=sub |accessdate=17 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070504035555/http://spectre.nmsu.edu/dept/academic.html?i=1274&s=sub <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 4 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe seeds of ''Capsicum'' plants are dispersed predominantly by birds: in birds, the [[TRPV1]] channel does not respond to capsaicin or related chemicals (avian vs. mammalian TRPV1 show functional diversity and selective sensitivity).  This is advantageous to the plant, as chili pepper seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and can germinate later, whereas mammals have [[molar (tooth)|molar teeth]] which destroy such seeds and prevent them from germinating.<!-- Tewksbury & Nabhan 2001, Nature 412 -->  Thus, natural selection may have led to increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it disperse.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tewksbury | first1 = J.

The resulting [[depolarization]] of the neuron stimulates it to [[action potential|signal]] the brain. By binding to the TRPV1 receptor, the capsaicin molecule produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, explaining why the spiciness of capsaicin is described as a burning sensation.\n\nEarly research showed capsaicin to evoke a long-onset current in comparison to other chemical agonists, suggesting the involvement of a significant rate-limiting factor.<ref>Geppetti, Pierangelo & Holzer, Peter (1996). Neurogenic Inflammation. CRC Press, 1996.</ref> Subsequent to this, the TRPV1 ion channel has been shown to be a member of the superfamily of [[transient receptor potential|TRP]] [[ion channels]], and as such is now referred to as {{Gene|TRPV1}}. There are a number of different [[transient receptor potential|TRP]] ion channels that have been shown to be sensitive to different ranges of temperature and probably are responsible for our range of temperature sensation. Thus, capsaicin does not actually cause a [[chemical burn]], or indeed any direct tissue damage at all, when chili peppers are the source of exposure.  The inflammation resulting from exposure to capsaicin is believed to be the result of the body's reaction to nerve excitement. For example, the mode of action of capsaicin in inducing bronchoconstriction is thought to involve stimulation of [[C fibers]]<ref>Fuller, R. W., Dixon, C. M. S. & Barnes, P. J. (1985).

In essence, the body inflames tissues as if it has undergone a burn or abrasion and the resulting inflammation can cause tissue damage in cases of extreme exposure, as is the case for many substances that cause the body to trigger an inflammatory response.\n\n==History==\nThe compound was first extracted in impure form in 1816 by {{ill|Christian Friedrich Bucholz|de}} (1770\u20131818).<ref>\n{{cite book|first=C.

It is an [[Irritation|irritant]] for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related compounds are called '''capsaicinoids''' and are produced as [[secondary metabolite]]s by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi.<ref name=\"totn\">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93636630 What Made Chili Peppers So Spicy?] Talk of the Nation, 15 August 2008.</ref> Pure capsaicin is a [[hydrophobic]], colorless, highly [[pungent]],<ref name=PubChem/> crystalline to waxy solid compound.\n\n==Natural function==\nCapsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes and, to a lesser extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus ''[[Capsicum]]''.  The seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith of the inner wall, where the seeds are attached.<ref>{{cite web|author=New Mexico State University \u2013 College of Agriculture and Home Economics |title=Chile Information \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions |year=2005 |url=http://spectre.nmsu.edu/dept/academic.html?i=1274&s=sub |accessdate=17 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070504035555/http://spectre.nmsu.edu/dept/academic.html?i=1274&s=sub <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 4 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe seeds of ''Capsicum'' plants are dispersed predominantly by birds: in birds, the [[TRPV1]] channel does not respond to capsaicin or related chemicals (avian vs. mammalian TRPV1 show functional diversity and selective sensitivity).  This is advantageous to the plant, as chili pepper seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and can germinate later, whereas mammals have [[molar (tooth)|molar teeth]] which destroy such seeds and prevent them from germinating.<!-- Tewksbury & Nabhan 2001, Nature 412 -->  Thus, natural selection may have led to increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it disperse.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tewksbury | first1 = J.

The resulting [[depolarization]] of the neuron stimulates it to [[action potential|signal]] the brain. By binding to the TRPV1 receptor, the capsaicin molecule produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, explaining why the spiciness of capsaicin is described as a burning sensation.\n\nEarly research showed capsaicin to evoke a long-onset current in comparison to other chemical agonists, suggesting the involvement of a significant rate-limiting factor.<ref>Geppetti, Pierangelo & Holzer, Peter (1996). Neurogenic Inflammation. CRC Press, 1996.</ref> Subsequent to this, the TRPV1 ion channel has been shown to be a member of the superfamily of [[transient receptor potential|TRP]] [[ion channels]], and as such is now referred to as {{Gene|TRPV1}}. There are a number of different [[transient receptor potential|TRP]] ion channels that have been shown to be sensitive to different ranges of temperature and probably are responsible for our range of temperature sensation. Thus, capsaicin does not actually cause a [[chemical burn]], or indeed any direct tissue damage at all, when chili peppers are the source of exposure.  The inflammation resulting from exposure to capsaicin is believed to be the result of the body's reaction to nerve excitement. For example, the mode of action of capsaicin in inducing bronchoconstriction is thought to involve stimulation of [[C fibers]]<ref>Fuller, R. W., Dixon, C. M. S. & Barnes, P. J. (1985). Bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled capsaicin in humans\" ''J. Appl. Physiol'' 58, 1080\u20131084. PubMed, CAS, Web of Science\u00ae Times Cited: 174</ref>  culminating in the release of neuropeptides. In essence, the body inflames tissues as if it has undergone a burn or abrasion and the resulting inflammation can cause tissue damage in cases of extreme exposure, as is the case for many substances that cause the body to trigger an inflammatory response.\n\n==History==\nThe compound was first extracted in impure form in 1816 by {{ill|Christian Friedrich Bucholz|de}} (1770\u20131818).<ref>\n{{cite book|first=C.
