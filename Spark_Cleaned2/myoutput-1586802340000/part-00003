Retrieved March 23, 2011.</ref> Durham is home to the [[University of New Hampshire]].\n\nThe primary settlement in the town, where 10,345 people resided at the 2010 census,<ref name=\"2010Census\"/> is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the [[Durham (CDP), New Hampshire|Durham census-designated place]] (CDP) and includes the densely populated portion of the town centered on the intersection of [[New Hampshire Route 108]] and Main Street, which includes the university that dominates the town.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:General View of UNH 1913.jpg|thumb|left|General View of UNH in 1913]]\nSituated beside [[Great Bay (New Hampshire)|Great Bay]] at the mouth of the [[Oyster River (New Hampshire)|Oyster River]], Durham was originally called \"Oyster River Plantation\". It was settled in 1635 by pioneers who traveled up the [[Piscataqua River]] and across Little Bay to settle at the falls of the Oyster River.\n\nAt the time, the land that is now New Hampshire belonged to Massachusetts; not until 1692 did the [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire colony]] finally gain full and permanent independence from its southern neighbor. Most of the coastal area was divided among four townships, and for its first century, Durham was part of [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]]. The location was ideal for its fresh water, natural meadows for livestock, and the transportation opportunities afforded by the waterways leading to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The land along the river was quickly settled, and nearby dense forests provided the timber necessary to construct homes as well as boats. Oyster River Plantation took the form of a small agricultural village, and the first generation of residents worked to clear and shape the land for planting.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/DHM| title=Durham, NH| publisher=The Great American Stations| accessdate=Sep 5, 2014| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129190504/http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/DHM| archivedate=2014-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe town name \"Durham\" was suggested by the Rev.

It contained more than 3,500 books and eventually merged with the library of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.\n \nLibrary of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts (1893- ): Came to Durham with the arrival of the College in 1893. Initially, the College housed the library in a single room in Thompson Hall. In 1900 Hamilton Smith gave the University $10,000 to construct a library, another $20,000 was obtained from Andrew Carnegie. In 1907 \u2013 a year after the town and the college agreed to merge their collective library resources \u2013 the building (Hamilton Smith Hall) was completed.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.library.unh.edu/special/index.php/durham-nh| title=Durham Town Records, New Hampshire| publisher=University of New Hampshire Library| accessdate=February 3, 2014| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202115912/http://www.library.unh.edu/special/index.php/durham-nh| archivedate=February 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1997 by a margin of 2-1, Durham voters passed a charter amendment to establish a Board of Trustees and allow plans for a new library to go forward. In July 1997 a temporary space was found for the new Public Library in a storefront between the dollar store and a pizzeria. Under the guidance of the Trustees and a newly formed Friends of the Library group, many volunteer townspeople come forward to sheetrock, paint, assemble shelves, and unpack and shelve 719 boxes of books. On July 21, 1997 a dedication ceremony was held for the new library, with Governor Jeanne Shaheen as the keynote speaker. It was the first new public library to be established in New Hampshire in almost a century. In July 2013 a new public library building was completed on Madbury Road.\n\n===Police department===\nA police force of some manner has served Durham since at least 1848.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.durham.nh.us/departments/police/history.html |title=Police Dept.

It was settled in 1635 by pioneers who traveled up the [[Piscataqua River]] and across Little Bay to settle at the falls of the Oyster River.\n\nAt the time, the land that is now New Hampshire belonged to Massachusetts; not until 1692 did the [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire colony]] finally gain full and permanent independence from its southern neighbor. Most of the coastal area was divided among four townships, and for its first century, Durham was part of [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]]. The village location was ideal for its fresh water, natural meadows for livestock, and the transportation opportunities afforded by the waterways leading to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The land along the river was quickly settled, and nearby dense forests provided the timber necessary to construct homes as well as boats. Oyster River Plantation took the form of a small agricultural village, and the first generation of residents worked to clear and shape the land for planting.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/DHM| title=Durham, NH| publisher=The Great American Stations| accessdate=Sep 5, 2014| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129190504/http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/DHM| archivedate=2014-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe town name \"Durham\" was suggested by the Rev.

Initially, the College housed the library in a single room in Thompson Hall. In 1900 Hamilton Smith gave the University $10,000 to construct a library, another $20,000 was obtained from Andrew Carnegie.

In July 1997 a temporary space was found for the new Public Library in a storefront between the dollar store and a pizzeria. Under the guidance of the Trustees and a newly formed Friends of the Library group, many volunteer townspeople come forward to sheetrock, paint, assemble shelves, and unpack and shelve 719 boxes of books. On July 21, 1997 a dedication ceremony was held for the new library, with Governor Jeanne Shaheen as the keynote speaker. It was the first new public library to be established in New Hampshire in almost a century.
