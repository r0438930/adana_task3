He led the Mavericks to their first [[NBA Finals]] appearance and to three consecutive 50+ win seasons. During his playing days, Johnson was known as the \"Little General\" for his small stature (by NBA standards), his leadership skills as a [[point guard]] (floor general), and his close friendship with former [[San Antonio Spurs]] teammate [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] - himself nicknamed \"The Admiral\" based on his tenure at the Naval Academy.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===College===\nAs a high school senior in 1983, Johnson led New Orleans' [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine High School]] to a 35\u20130 record and the Class 4A Louisiana State Championship. Johnson matriculated at [[New Mexico Junior College]] before moving on to [[Cameron University]], and finally [[Southern University]], at which in his senior season in 1988 he led [[NCAA Division I]] with 13.3 assists per game, an all-time record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/basketball/m_basketball_records_book/2007/2007_m_basketball_records.pdf |title=Official 2007 NCAA Men's Basketball Records Book, page 20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323023343/http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/basketball/m_basketball_records_book/2007/2007_m_basketball_records.pdf |archivedate=March 23, 2007}} &nbsp;{{small|(4.57&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])}}; retrieved August 13, 2007</ref> In that season, he also averaged 11.4 points per game, making him the first men's Division I player ever to average double figures in points and assists in the same season\u2014a feat that was not duplicated until [[Jason Brickman]] of [[LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball|LIU Brooklyn]] did so in [[2013\u201314 LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball team|2013\u201314]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/10538434/liu-brooklyn-brickman-reaches-1000-assists-final-game |title=Jason Brickman earns 1,000th assist |first=Kieran |last=Darcy |publisher=ESPN |date=March 1, 2014 |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nUpon [[graduation]] in 1988, Johnson was not selected in the [[1988 NBA draft|NBA draft]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/alabamabasketball/index.ssf/2015/04/avery_johnson_facts_alabama.html#3 |title=Get to know Avery Johnson with 15 facts, milestones and defining moments |publisher=[[The Birmingham News|AL.com]] |date=April 6, 2015 |accessdate=April 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Professional===\n\n====Palm Beach Stingrays (1988)====\nJohnson spent the summer of 1988 with the [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] Stingrays of the [[United States Basketball League]].

He made 18 assists on January 5, 1990 against the Miami Heat.<ref name=\"NBA player\"/>\n\nOn October 24, 1990, the SuperSonics traded Johnson to the [[1990\u201391 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] for a conditional pick in the [[1997 NBA draft]]. After playing 21 games, Johnson was waived from the Nuggets in December before signing with the [[1990\u201391 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] on January 17, 1991. Johnson played 47 games with seven starts for the Spurs and averaged 9.4 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists.<ref name=\"NBA player\"/>\n\nIn the beginning of the 1991\u201392 season, Johnson played 20 games and averaged 5.0 points and 6.8 assists for the Spurs before being waived in December. On January 10, 1992, Johnson signed the first of several 10-day contracts with the [[1991\u201392 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] that preceded a longer-term contract. Johnson scored a then-career-high 22 points against the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] on January 28.<ref name=\"NBA player\"/>\n\nSigned as an unrestricted free agent, Johnson returned to the Spurs on November 19, 1992. Promoted to starter, Johnson averaged 8.7 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 7.5 assists and improved his field goal percentage to .502 in 75 games. In the playoffs, Johnson averaged 8.2 points and 8.1 assists.<ref name=\"NBA player\"/>\n\nJohnson signed with the [[1993\u201394 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] on October 25, 1993 and was named team captain just nine days into his signing.

Most notably, Johnson made the go-ahead, championship-clinching shot in Game 5 on a jumper with 47 seconds remaining in the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/26/sports/nba-finals-spurs-win-title-as-knicks-dream-ends.html |title=N.B.A. FINALS; Spurs Win Title as Knicks' Dream Ends |first=Selena |last=Roberts |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 26, 1999 |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> The Spurs retired Johnson's number 6 on December 22, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/2007-12-23-186396253_x.htm |title=San Antonio Spurs retire Avery Johnson's No. 6 |first=Elizabeth |last=White |work=[[USA Today]] |date=December 23, 2007 |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> He was also inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame on February 20, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame Names Class of 2009 |publisher=San Antonio Sports Foundation |date=October 21, 2008 |url=http://www.sanantoniosports.org/releases/2009%20Inductees%20Announced_10_21_08.pdf |accessdate=April 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306122751/http://www.sanantoniosports.org/releases/2009%20Inductees%20Announced_10_21_08.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====After the Spurs====\nOn July 19, 2001, Johnson signed as a free agent with the [[2001\u201302 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]]. Johnson played 51 games (13 starts) with the Nuggets and averaged 9.4 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 5.1 assists.<ref name=\"bbr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsav01.html|title=Avery Johnson|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref> The Nuggets traded Johnson and three other players to the [[2001\u201302 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas Mavericks]] on February 21, 2002. Johnson played 17 games all as a reserve with the Mavericks for the rest of the season.<ref name=\"bbr\"/>\n\nIn the 2002\u201303 season, Johnson played in 48 games as a reserve for the Mavericks, averaging 9.0 minutes per game. Johnson ended his NBA career in the 2003\u201304 season back with the [[2003\u201304 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]]. He played 46 games with one start and averaged 4.6 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 2.4 assists.<ref name=\"bbr\"/>\n\n==Post-playing career==\n\n===Dallas Mavericks===\nOn October 28, 2004, Johnson retired from playing and signed as an assistant coach with the [[Dallas Mavericks]] under [[Don Nelson]]. Johnson had played under Nelson from 2001 to 2003, and it was understood from the beginning that he was being groomed to eventually succeed Nelson as [[head coach]]. His transition from assistant to head coach came five months later on March 19, 2005, after Nelson resigned.\n\nUnder Johnson, the Mavericks closed out the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] with a 16\u20132 run and a first-round playoff victory over the [[Houston Rockets]], before being eliminated by the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the second round of the [[NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Johnson was named the April 2005 NBA Coach of the Month, only one month after becoming a head coach for the first time.\n[[file:Avery Johnson.jpg|thumb|170px|Johnson as the coach of the Mavs, 2008]]\nThe [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] was even more successful for Johnson and was marked by a series of milestones. In November 2005, Johnson won his second NBA Coach of the Month award (which was also his second consecutive award, following the one he had won in April the previous season), making him the first NBA coach to win the award in his first two months as a head coach. On January 28, 2006, when the [[Dallas Mavericks]] defeated the [[Utah Jazz]], Johnson's record as head coach improved to 50\u201312, making Johnson the fastest coach to reach 50 wins. In February 2006, he was chosen to coach the [[2006 NBA All-Star Game|2006 NBA All-Star team]] for the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]]. Although Johnson ultimately led the Mavericks to the second-best record in the Western Conference, the team entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the West due to the structure of the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]] seeding. In April 2006, Johnson was rewarded for his success throughout the season with the 2006 [[NBA Coach of the Year Award]].\n\nIn June 2006, after defeating the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], the defending champion [[San Antonio Spurs]], and the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the first three rounds of the playoffs, Johnson led the Mavericks to their first ever [[2006 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance. However, the Mavs were defeated in [[Best-of-seven playoff|six games]] by the [[Miami Heat]], losing four straight after winning the first two games.\n\nOn December 31, 2006, Johnson became the fastest head coach (at the time) to win 100 games when his squad defeated the [[Denver Nuggets]]. This record was later broken by [[Tom Thibodeau]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]]. In the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]], Johnson's Mavericks had the best record in the NBA with 67 wins and entered the playoffs as the top seed. However, his Mavericks lost to the eighth-seeded [[Golden State Warriors]], led by former Mavericks head coach [[Don Nelson]], in one of the biggest upsets in recent NBA history.\n\nWith the Mavs' win over the Grizzlies on November 18, 2007, Johnson became the fastest coach to reach 150 wins. Following the [[2007\u201308 Dallas Mavericks season|2007\u201308 season]], the Mavericks under Johnson were eliminated in the first round of the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the second year in a row. A day later, on April 30, 2008, Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Mavericks and replaced by former [[NBA Coach of the Year]], [[Rick Carlisle]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3375306 ESPN \u2013 Mavs, Johnson part ways after team's playoff ouster \u2013 NBA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Avery_Johnson_dismissed_043008.html MAVERICKS: Avery Johnson dismissed as coach<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Official_release_Johnson_relieved.html MAVERICKS: Official release: Mavericks relieve Avery Johnson of coaching duties<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===First stint at ESPN===\nOn October 17, 2008, Johnson joined [[ESPN]] as a studio analyst.

In his first year as coach of the Nets, the team improved slightly, doubling its win total from the previous season and finishing 24\u201358. However, the next year saw no such improvement, as his team went 22\u201344 in the [[2011\u201312 NBA season|lockout-shortened season]].\n\nJohnson remained with the Nets when the team moved to Brooklyn in 2012. He was named the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Coach of the Month for October and November 2012 following an 11\u20134 start to the season. Despite that early success, the team went on to lose ten of its next 13 games, and subsequently Johnson was fired from his head coaching position on December 27, 2012.<ref>{{cite

He led the Mavericks to their first [[NBA Finals]] appearance and to three consecutive 50+ win seasons. During his playing days, Johnson was known as the \"Little General\" for his small stature (by NBA standards), his leadership skills as a [[point guard]] (floor general), and his close friendship with former [[San Antonio Spurs]] teammate [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] - himself nicknamed \"The Admiral\" based on his tenure at the Naval Academy.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===College===\nAs a high school senior in 1983, Johnson led New Orleans' [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine High School]] to a 35\u20130 record and the Class 4A Louisiana State Championship.

Starting 70 of 82 games, Johnson reached a new career high 10.9 points per game along with 5.3 assists per game.<ref name=\"NBA player\"/>\n\n====San Antonio Spurs (1994\u20132001)====\nJohnson is best known for his time with the Spurs from 1994 to 2001, and particularly his integral role on the [[1998\u201399 San Antonio Spurs season|1998\u201399 Spurs team]] that won the [[1999 NBA Finals|NBA championship]] against the [[New York Knicks]]. Most notably, Johnson made the go-ahead, championship-clinching shot in Game 5 on a jumper with 47 seconds remaining in the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/26/sports/nba-finals-spurs-win-title-as-knicks-dream-ends.html |title=N.B.A. FINALS; Spurs Win Title as Knicks' Dream Ends |first=Selena |last=Roberts |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 26, 1999 |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> The Spurs retired Johnson's number 6 on December 22, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/2007-12-23-186396253_x.htm |title=San Antonio Spurs retire Avery Johnson's No. 6 |first=Elizabeth |last=White |work=[[USA Today]] |date=December 23, 2007 |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> He was also inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame on February 20, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame Names Class of 2009 |publisher=San Antonio Sports Foundation |date=October 21, 2008 |url=http://www.sanantoniosports.org/releases/2009%20Inductees%20Announced_10_21_08.pdf |accessdate=April 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306122751/http://www.sanantoniosports.org/releases/2009%20Inductees%20Announced_10_21_08.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====After the Spurs====\nOn July 19, 2001, Johnson signed as a free agent with the [[2001\u201302 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]]. Johnson played 51 games (13 starts) with the Nuggets and averaged 9.4 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 5.1 assists.<ref name=\"bbr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsav01.html|title=Avery Johnson|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref> The Nuggets traded Johnson and three other players to the [[2001\u201302 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas Mavericks]] on February 21, 2002. Johnson played 17 games all as a reserve with the Mavericks for the rest of the season.<ref name=\"bbr\"/>\n\nIn the 2002\u201303 season, Johnson played in 48 games as a reserve for the Mavericks, averaging 9.0 minutes per game. Johnson ended his NBA career in the 2003\u201304 season back with the [[2003\u201304 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]]. He played 46 games with one start and averaged 4.6 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 2.4 assists.<ref name=\"bbr\"/>\n\n==Post-playing career==\n\n===Dallas Mavericks===\nOn October 28, 2004, Johnson retired from playing and signed as an assistant coach with the [[Dallas Mavericks]] under [[Don Nelson]]. Johnson had played under Nelson from 2001 to 2003, and it was understood from the beginning that he was being groomed to eventually succeed Nelson as [[head coach]]. His transition from assistant to head coach came five months later on March 19, 2005, after Nelson resigned.\n\nUnder Johnson, the Mavericks closed out the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] with a 16\u20132 run and a first-round playoff victory over the [[Houston Rockets]], before being eliminated by the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the second round of the [[NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Johnson was named the April 2005 NBA Coach of the Month, only one month after becoming a head coach for the first time.\n\nThe [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] was even more successful for Johnson and was marked by a series of milestones. In November 2005, Johnson won his second NBA Coach of the Month award (which was also his second consecutive award, following the one he had won in April the previous season), making him the first NBA coach to win the award in his first two months as a head coach. On January 28, 2006, when the [[Dallas Mavericks]] defeated the [[Utah Jazz]], Johnson's record as head coach improved to 50\u201312, making Johnson the fastest coach to reach 50 wins. In February 2006, he was chosen to coach the [[2006 NBA All-Star Game|2006 NBA All-Star team]] for the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]]. Although Johnson ultimately led the Mavericks to the second-best record in the Western Conference, the team entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the West due to the structure of the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]] seeding. In April 2006, Johnson was rewarded for his success throughout the season with the 2006 [[NBA Coach of the Year Award]].\n\nIn June 2006, after defeating the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], the defending champion [[San Antonio Spurs]], and the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the first three rounds of the playoffs, Johnson led the Mavericks to their first ever [[2006 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance. However, the Mavs were defeated in [[Best-of-seven playoff|six games]] by the [[Miami Heat]], losing four straight after winning the first two games.\n\nOn December 31, 2006, Johnson became the fastest head coach (at the time) to win 100 games when his squad defeated the [[Denver Nuggets]]. This record was later broken by [[Tom Thibodeau]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]]. In the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]], Johnson's Mavericks had the best record in the NBA with 67 wins and entered the playoffs as the top seed. However, his Mavericks lost to the eighth-seeded [[Golden State Warriors]], led by former Mavericks head coach [[Don Nelson]], in one of the biggest upsets in recent NBA history.\n\nWith the Mavs' win over the Grizzlies on November 18, 2007, Johnson became the fastest coach to reach 150 wins. Following the [[2007\u201308 Dallas Mavericks season|2007\u201308 season]], the Mavericks under Johnson were eliminated in the first round of the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the second year in a row. A day later, on April 30, 2008, Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Mavericks and replaced by former [[NBA Coach of the Year]], [[Rick Carlisle]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3375306 ESPN \u2013 Mavs, Johnson part ways after team's playoff ouster \u2013 NBA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Avery_Johnson_dismissed_043008.html MAVERICKS: Avery Johnson dismissed as coach<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Official_release_Johnson_relieved.html MAVERICKS: Official release: Mavericks relieve Avery Johnson of coaching duties<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===First stint at ESPN===\nOn October 17, 2008, Johnson joined [[ESPN]] as a studio analyst.

In his first year as coach of the Nets, the team improved slightly, doubling its win total from the previous season and finishing 24\u201358. However, the next year saw no such improvement, as his team went 22\u201344 in the [[2011\u201312 NBA season|lockout-shortened season]].\n\nJohnson remained with the Nets when the team moved to Brooklyn in 2012. He was named the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Coach of the Month for October and November 2012 following an 11\u20134 start to the season. Despite that early success, the team went on to lose ten of its next 13 games, and subsequently Johnson was fired from his head coaching position on December 27, 2012.<ref>{{cite
