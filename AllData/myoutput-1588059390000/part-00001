It is non-migratory and usually stays within its breeding range, though it sometimes irrupts southward. It is one of the few owls that is neither [[nocturnal]] nor [[crepuscular]], being active only during the day. This is the [[Monotypic taxon|only living species]] in the [[genus]] ''Surnia'' of the family [[Strigidae]], the \"typical\" owls (as opposed to [[Tytonidae|barn owls]], Tytonidae). The species is sometimes called simply the '''hawk owl'''; however, many species of owls in the genus ''[[Ninox]]'' are also called \"hawk owls\".\n\nThe genus name ''Surnia'' appears to be a word made up by [[Andr\u00e9 Marie Constant Dum\u00e9ril|A. M. C. Dum\u00e9ril]], the creator of the genus, and ''ulula'' is [[Latin]] for a screech owl.<ref name=job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher= Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling/page/n374 374], 395}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nMale northern hawk-owls are generally {{convert|36|\u2013|42.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and weigh about {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}.

The northern hawk-owl plumage is relatively dark brown with an off-white spotting pattern on all [[anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] parts of the body with the exception of the back of the neck which boasts a black v-shaped pattern. The underbelly is generally white or off-white which continues to the toes with brown bands on the breast and stomach. It also boasts a long tail with brown banding. The northern hawk-owl has a smokey white face with a black border, a flat head, yellow eyes and a yellow curved beak.<ref name=\"Duncan\">Duncan, James R. and Patricia A. Duncan.

In North America, its appearance in flight is often considered similar to a [[Cooper's hawk]] (''Accipiter cooperii''). It has been suggested that this may be because the hawk-owl may partially fill an important [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] niche similar to that of day hunters such as hawks.<ref name=\"son\"/>\n[[File:Surnia ulula Zoo Praha 2011-1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|At [[Prague Zoo]]]]\n\n==Vocalization==\n''S. ulula'' has a variety of calls used by the different sexes in different situations. When attracting a mate the male usually lets out a rolled whistle of ''ulululululululul'' and a sound similar to ''tu-wita-wit, tiwita-tu-wita, wita,'' when [[perch (equilibristic)|perch]]ing at a potential nest site. The female's call is usually less constant and more shrill.<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\nWhen alerting to danger, the northern hawk-owl lets out a sound similar to ''rike, rike, rike, rike''. It also releases a high pitched scream followed by a ''yip'' when an intruder is near to the nest. To warn of impending dangers to a [[fledgling (birds)|fledgling]], the hawk-owl will let out a noise similar to ''ki ki kikikikiki''. Calls can vary in length from 15 s to 2 min.<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\n==Distribution==\nThree [[subspecies]] exist across the northern [[holarctic]].<ref name=\"Voous and Cameron 1989\" /><ref name=\"Konig et al. 2008\">K\u00f6nig C, Weick F, Wink M. 2008. Owls of the world. London: Christopher Helm.</ref> The [[North American]] subspecies ''S. u. caparoch'' spans from eastern [[Alaska]] through Canada to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and in some areas extends south into northern [[United States]].<ref name=\"Duncan\" /><ref name=\"Konig et al. 2008\"/> The other two subspecies are found in [[Euro-Siberian region|Eurosiberia]]: ''S. u. tianschanica'' [[breed]]s in [[Central Asia]] reaching [[Xinjiang]] ([[China]]) and ''S. u. ulula'' resides across reaching [[Siberia]] at its most eastern range.<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\nOccasionally, ''S. u. caparoch'' can extend its territory as far south as northern [[Minnesota]] and many other states in the northern [[United States]] including more central states such as [[West Virginia]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[South Dakota]]. These southern forays into the northern United States are rare and generally occur during winter, or following an explosion in a population of [[prey]].<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> ''S. u. caparoch'' can occasionally be found in more southern areas such as [[Great Britain]], southern Russia and Scandinavia, following explosions of prey.<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\n==Habitat==\nNorthern hawk-owls are unevenly distributed and highly variable throughout the [[boreal forest]].<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> They live mostly in open [[coniferous]] forests, or coniferous forests mixed with [[deciduous]] species such as [[larch]], [[birch]], [[Populus|poplar]], and [[willow]].<ref name=\"Voous and Cameron 1989\" /> They are found in muskegs, clearings, swamp valleys, meadows,<ref name=\"Voous and Cameron 1989\" /> or recently burnt areas,<ref name= \"Hannah and Hoyt 2004\"/> and generally avoid dense spruce-fir forests.<ref name=\"Voous and Cameron 1989\" /> Winter habitat is usually the same as breeding habitat.<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\n==Breeding==\n[[File:Surnia ulula MWNH 0656.JPG|thumb|Eggs, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]\nThe northern hawk-owl generally starts its mating rituals at the beginning of March.<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> After calling and pairing is complete the northern hawk-owl will build a nest and start to lay eggs. On average the northern hawk-owl will lay 3\u201311 eggs per [[brooding|brood]]. The nest sites are usually the tops of hollow stumps of old dead [[spruce]] trees. These nesting sites are usually {{convert|2|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground for the [[North American]] ''S. u. caparoch'' and approximately {{convert|4|-|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground for the [[Eurasia]]n ''S. u. ulala''. The specific dates of egg appearance can be quite variable depending on locality. In central [[Canada]] eggs are usually laid from March 30 to the 5th of June. On [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] the appearance of eggs occurs later, between May 9 and June 11. In [[Finland]] however, eggs can be found anywhere between the 30th of March to the 23rd of June.<ref name=\"kertell\"/>\n\nFor the most part the female northern hawk-owl does the incubating of the eggs whilst the male forages for food. Once the chicks have hatched their roles shift drastically. At about two weeks into the chicks' lives the female starts to leave the nest for long spans of time (5 hours or more). This span of time is presumably when the female hunts. The male however, will guard the nest diligently until the chicks leave. When predators (usually other [[Bird of prey|raptors]]) fly nearby, the male will sometimes chase them away from the nest if he feels it is necessary. Once the [[owl]]ets have grown to a size which allows less parental supervision, they will leave the nest. This occurs on average after their 21st day, and can begin as early as mid-June. After this the female will provide most of the care. However, the male will remain close and will still feed his young on occasion.<ref name=\"kertell\" />\nThe northern hawk-owl has also been known to nest on cliffsides. It has little fear of humans, and will attack if the young are approached too closely.\n\n==Diet==\nThe northern hawk-owl feeds on a variety of prey, which can include small [[rodents]] to [[mammals]] more robust in size, and a variety of [[birds]],<ref name=\"kertell\" /> a typical diet for many boreal owls.<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> In Eurasia the northern hawk-owl is known to feed primarily on [[voles]] from the [[Microtus]] family. These voles usually follow a 3\u20134 year cycle of abundance. Therefore, ''S. u. ulula'' numbers are affected negatively when the numbers of voles are lowest. In North America the [[subspecies]] ''S. u. caparoch'' also feeds upon [[Microtus|microtine]] voles, but its population is primarily based on the ten year cycling of the [[snowshoe hare]] (''Lepus americanus''). In [[Eurasia]] the northern hawk-owl's biomass consists of about 94% microtine [[vole]]s, whereas in [[North America]] the percentage of [[biomass]] contributed by [[vole]]s can be as low as 20%. Juvenile [[hares]] are considerably more important at 40\u201350%.<ref name=\"Rohner et al. 1995\" />\n\nOther animals that are important prey items for the northern hawk-owl include the [[red squirrel]] (''Sciurus vulgaris'') which has been documented to contribute as much as 20% to the hawk-owl's [[biomass]].<ref name=\"kertell\" /> A long list of others include [[mice]], [[rat]]s, [[vole]]s, [[lemming]]s, the short-tail weasel (''Mustela erminea''), [[partridge]], [[spruce grouse]] (''Falcipennis canadensis''), [[dove]]s, pileated woodpeckers (''Dryocopus pileatus''), [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, [[jay]]s, [[European robin|robin]]s, [[starling]]s, [[buntings]], grackles, and [[finch]]es.<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> In the winter, feeding strategies change; where in summer the main source of food is mammals, in the winter a bigger portion of the hawk-owl's [[biomass]] consists of ground dwelling birds, such as the [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] and the [[grouse]].<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\nThe northern hawk-owl is a partially [[diurnality|diurnal]] hunter, although it has been recorded hunting at varying times and does not appear to have a preferred hunting time.<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> Whether the bird resides in Eurasia or North America, the strategy is usually similar. The northern hawk-owl will perch and scour the immediate area for [[prey]].<ref name=\"kertell\" /> As these [[owl]]s are considered a search-oriented [[species]] they likely do not stay put for long if the site is not producing prey.<ref name=\"son\" /> The hawk-owl prefers open, forest-type environments when perching. These environments include [[sphagnum]] [[bogs]] and partially [[deforested]] areas. The preferred perching tree of the northern hawk-owl is the [[spruce]] tree. When the hawk-owl attacks, it goes from a horizontal posture into a gliding dive. If the prey is further away, the bird will flap its wings a few times during the dive to increase distance.<ref name=\"kertell\" /> The hawk-owl has exceptional hearing and can plunge into [[snow]] to capture [[rodent]]s below the surface.\n\nThe type of [[prey]] the hawk-owl catches will determine its eating strategy. For [[mammal]]ian prey the ritual is generally the same: the northern hawk-owl will [[Disembowelment|eviscerate]] its prey, eats the head first (especially for prey like the [[red squirrel]], whose head is fairly large), and then\u2014when tackling larger prey\u2014it will eat the organs and [[hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]] the remains; with smaller prey, the owl will simply swallow the body whole.<ref name=\"kertell\" />\n\n==Phylogeny==\nNorthern hawk-owls are the only representative of the genus ''Surnia'',<ref name=\"Duncan\" /><ref name=\"Voous and Cameron 1989\">Voous KH, Cameron A.

When attracting a mate the male usually lets out a rolled whistle of ''ulululululululul'' and a sound similar to ''tu-wita-wit, tiwita-tu-wita, wita,'' when [[perch (equilibristic)|perch]]ing at a potential nest site. The female's call is usually less constant and more shrill.<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\nWhen alerting to danger, the northern hawk-owl lets out a sound similar to ''rike, rike, rike, rike''. It also releases a high pitched scream followed by a ''yip'' when an intruder is near to the nest. To warn of impending dangers to a [[fledgling (birds)|fledgling]], the hawk-owl will let out a noise similar to ''ki ki kikikikiki''. Calls can vary in length from 15 s to 2 min.<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\n==Distribution==\nThree [[subspecies]] exist across the northern [[holarctic]].<ref name=\"Voous and Cameron 1989\" /><ref name=\"Konig et al. 2008\">K\u00f6nig C, Weick F, Wink M. 2008. Owls of the world. London: Christopher Helm.</ref> The [[North American]] subspecies ''S. u. caparoch'' spans from eastern [[Alaska]] through Canada to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and in some areas extends south into northern [[United States]].<ref name=\"Duncan\" /><ref name=\"Konig et al. 2008\"/> The other two subspecies are found in [[Euro-Siberian region|Eurosiberia]]: ''S. u. tianschanica'' [[breed]]s in [[Central Asia]] reaching [[Xinjiang]] ([[China]]) and ''S. u. ulula'' resides across reaching [[Siberia]] at its most eastern range.<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\nOccasionally, ''S. u. caparoch'' can extend its territory as far south as northern [[Minnesota]] and many other states in the northern [[United States]] including more central states such as [[West Virginia]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[South Dakota]]. These southern forays into the northern United States are rare and generally occur during winter, or following an explosion in a population of [[prey]].<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> ''S. u. caparoch'' can occasionally be found in more southern areas such as [[Great Britain]], southern Russia and Scandinavia, following explosions of prey.<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\n==Habitat==\nNorthern hawk-owls are unevenly distributed and highly variable throughout the [[boreal forest]].<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> They live mostly in open [[coniferous]] forests, or coniferous forests mixed with [[deciduous]] species such as [[larch]], [[birch]], [[Populus|poplar]], and [[willow]].<ref name=\"Voous and Cameron 1989\" /> They are found in muskegs, clearings, swamp valleys, meadows,<ref name=\"Voous and Cameron 1989\" /> or recently burnt areas,<ref name= \"Hannah and Hoyt 2004\"/> and generally avoid dense spruce-fir forests.<ref name=\"Voous and Cameron 1989\" /> Winter habitat is usually the same as breeding habitat.<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\n==Breeding==\n[[File:Surnia ulula MWNH 0656.JPG|thumb|Eggs, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]\nThe northern hawk-owl generally starts its mating rituals at the beginning of March.<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> After calling and pairing is complete the northern hawk-owl will build a nest and start to lay eggs. On average the northern hawk-owl will lay 3\u201311 eggs per [[brooding|brood]]. The nest sites are usually the tops of hollow stumps of old dead [[spruce]] trees. These nesting sites are usually {{convert|2|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground for the [[North American]] ''S. u. caparoch'' and approximately {{convert|4|-|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground for the [[Eurasia]]n ''S. u. ulala''. The specific dates of egg appearance can be quite variable depending on locality. In central [[Canada]] eggs are usually laid from March 30 to the 5th of June. On [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] the appearance of eggs occurs later, between May 9 and June 11. In [[Finland]] however, eggs can be found anywhere between the 30th of March to the 23rd of June.<ref name=\"kertell\"/>\n\nFor the most part the female northern hawk-owl does the incubating of the eggs whilst the male forages for food. Once the chicks have hatched their roles shift drastically. At about two weeks into the chicks' lives the female starts to leave the nest for long spans of time (5 hours or more). This span of time is presumably when the female hunts. The male however, will guard the nest diligently until the chicks leave. When predators (usually other [[Bird of prey|raptors]]) fly nearby, the male will sometimes chase them away from the nest if he feels it is necessary. Once the [[owl]]ets have grown to a size which allows less parental supervision, they will leave the nest. This occurs on average after their 21st day, and can begin as early as mid-June. After this the female will provide most of the care. However, the male will remain close and will still feed his young on occasion.<ref name=\"kertell\" />\nThe northern hawk-owl has also been known to nest on cliffsides. It has little fear of humans, and will attack if the young are approached too closely.\n\n==Diet==\nThe northern hawk-owl feeds on a variety of prey, which can include small [[rodents]] to [[mammals]] more robust in size, and a variety of [[birds]],<ref name=\"kertell\" /> a typical diet for many boreal owls.<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> In Eurasia the northern hawk-owl is known to feed primarily on [[voles]] from the [[Microtus]] family. These voles usually follow a 3\u20134 year cycle of abundance. Therefore, ''S. u. ulula'' numbers are affected negatively when the numbers of voles are lowest. In North America the [[subspecies]] ''S. u. caparoch'' also feeds upon [[Microtus|microtine]] voles, but its population is primarily based on the ten year cycling of the [[snowshoe hare]] (''Lepus americanus''). In [[Eurasia]] the northern hawk-owl's biomass consists of about 94% microtine [[vole]]s, whereas in [[North America]] the percentage of [[biomass]] contributed by [[vole]]s can be as low as 20%. Juvenile [[hares]] are considerably more important at 40\u201350%.<ref name=\"Rohner et al. 1995\" />\n\nOther animals that are important prey items for the northern hawk-owl include the [[red squirrel]] (''Sciurus vulgaris'') which has been documented to contribute as much as 20% to the hawk-owl's [[biomass]].<ref name=\"kertell\" /> A long list of others include [[mice]], [[rat]]s, [[vole]]s, [[lemming]]s, the short-tail weasel (''Mustela erminea''), [[partridge]], [[spruce grouse]] (''Falcipennis canadensis''), [[dove]]s, pileated woodpeckers (''Dryocopus pileatus''), [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, [[jay]]s, [[European robin|robin]]s, [[starling]]s, [[buntings]], grackles, and [[finch]]es.<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> In the winter, feeding strategies change; where in summer the main source of food is mammals, in the winter a bigger portion of the hawk-owl's [[biomass]] consists of ground dwelling birds, such as the [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] and the [[grouse]].<ref name=\"Duncan\" />\n\nThe northern hawk-owl is a partially [[diurnality|diurnal]] hunter, although it has been recorded hunting at varying times and does not appear to have a preferred hunting time.<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> Whether the bird resides in Eurasia or North America, the strategy is usually similar. The northern hawk-owl will perch and scour the immediate area for [[prey]].<ref name=\"kertell\" /> As these [[owl]]s are considered a search-oriented [[species]] they likely do not stay put for long if the site is not producing prey.<ref name=\"son\" /> The hawk-owl prefers open, forest-type environments when perching. These environments include [[sphagnum]] [[bogs]] and partially [[deforested]] areas. The preferred perching tree of the northern hawk-owl is the [[spruce]] tree. When the hawk-owl attacks, it goes from a horizontal posture into a gliding dive. If the prey is further away, the bird will flap its wings a few times during the dive to increase distance.<ref name=\"kertell\" /> The hawk-owl has exceptional hearing and can plunge into [[snow]] to capture [[rodent]]s below the surface.\n\nThe type of [[prey]] the hawk-owl catches will determine its eating strategy. For [[mammal]]ian prey the ritual is generally the same: the northern hawk-owl will [[Disembowelment|eviscerate]] its prey, eats the head first (especially for prey like the [[red squirrel]], whose head is fairly large), and then\u2014when tackling larger prey\u2014it will eat the organs and [[hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]] the remains; with smaller prey, the owl will simply swallow the body whole.<ref name=\"kertell\" />\n\n==Phylogeny==\nNorthern hawk-owls are the only representative of the genus ''Surnia'',<ref name=\"Duncan\" /><ref name=\"Voous and Cameron 1989\">Voous KH, Cameron A.
