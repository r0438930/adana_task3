Its territories largely correspond with the present-day [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[arrondissement]] [[Arrondissement of Namur|Namur]] plus the northwestern part of the arrondissement [[Arrondissement of Dinant|Dinant]], both part of the modern province of [[Namur (province)|Namur]], and previously part of the [[French Republic]]an department of [[Sambre-et-Meuse]].\n\n== Prehistory to the Roman period ==\nThe city of [[Namur (city)|Namur]] most likely arose around 'the Champeau', a rocky hill between the [[Sambre]] and the [[Meuse]]. Numerous prehistoric flint weapons have been found in the area. During Roman times the region around Namur was first mentioned in [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' in the second half of the 1st century BC. To the west of Namur were the [[Nervii]], and to the east the [[Germani cisrhenani]], but it has been suggested that Namur itself may have been home to the [[Aduatuci]] who Caesar described as descendants of the [[Cimbri]] and [[Teutones]]. (Today it is considered more likely to have been at [[Thuin]].<ref>[http://www.archeonet.be/?p=25829 Oppidum van de Aduatuci ligt in Thuin (Henegouwen)] {{in lang|nl}}</ref>) In Caesar's wars the Roman legions conquered numerous [[Belgae|Belgic]] cities and settlements. After this defeat the Belgae and their territory were incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n== The Medieval period ==\nThe county of Namur ({{lang-la|in pago Namurcensis}}) was first listed as part of the [[Lommegau]] (''{{lang|la|pagus}}'' or ''{{lang|la|comitatus Lommensis}}'') in the year 832 in a document by [[Emperor Louis the Pious]]. In 992, [[Emperor Otto III]] titles [[Albert I, Count of Namur|Albert I]] count of Namur for the first time.<ref>L\u00e9on Vanderkindere, ''La formation territoriale des principaut\u00e9s Belges au Moyen Age'', Tome II, p200</ref>\n\nThe first count of note was [[Albert III, Count of Namur|Albert III]] (1063\u20131102), who acquired [[Vogt|wardship]] over the [[prince-abbacy]] of [[Stavelot-Malm\u00e9dy]]. Until the start of the 12th century, Namur was threatened by its powerful neighbours [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge]]. Important parts of the county were annexed; the city of [[Dinant]], for example, came into possession of Li\u00e8ge. From the 12th century on, the counts of Namur managed to more or less compensate for the losses they had suffered. Count [[Godfrey I, Count of Namur|Godfrey]], for example, acquired the county of Longwy, thanks to his marriage with Ermesinde of Luxembourg. The last important figure from the first house that ruled Namur was [[Henry IV, Count of Luxembourg|Henry I]] (1139\u201396). Henry I inherited the counties of [[Durbuy]], [[La Roche-en-Ardenne]] and [[County of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]]. After Henry's death, a fierce succession war broke out between [[Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut]], and Henry's daughter [[Ermesinde, Countess of Luxembourg|Ermesinde]]. Baldwin V eventually received the county of Namur while Ermesine received Luxembourg, Laroche and Durbuy. The situation remained more or less stable until 1263. In this year, the count of Namur, [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II of Courtenay]], sold his county to the count of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Guy of Dampierre]]. The house of Dampierre would rule until 1421, when the county of Namur was sold to the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] duke [[Philip the Good]].\n\n== The Burgundian and Habsburg periods ==\nAfter the county of Namur was bought by [[Philip the Good]], he integrated it into a large territorial and political union, called the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. From the 15th century on, the [[Southern Netherlands]] (and with it the county of Namur) were ruled by the [[Habsburg]]s. Under their new rule, the military importance of the city of Namur steadily grew. The Burgundians and Habsburgs strengthened the city and built new walls around it. During the 16th and 17th centuries the city became an important military stronghold, and was repeatedly besieged for this reason.\n\n[[Image:HainautNamur1477.png|thumb|right|Hainaut and Namur in 1477]]\n\n== The Spanish period ==\nDuring the Spanish period (16th and 17th century), Namur received a bishopric's seat. The Spanish king [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] wanted to turn Namur into a catholic bastion as a bulwark against the rise of [[Calvinism]]. Thus Philip II required several religious orders to establish themselves in Namur. In consequence the city gained a specific catholic character. Philip II also managed to make considerable re\u00efnforcements to the [[Citadel of Namur]]. In 1577, Philip II sent [[Don Juan of Austria]] to the Netherlands as the new governor. In Namur, Don Juan received [[Margaret of Valois]] (the sister of the French king), and organised a magnificent celebration in her honor.\n\n== Troubled times and changing rulers ==\nNamur has had a crucial military role throughout history. After the Spanish period, the strategically important city was repeatedly besieged. In 1692, the troops of [[Louis XIV of France]] took the city after a lengthy and furious siege. Louis and his legendary military engineer [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban]] personally oversaw the siege. Three years later, in 1695, [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] retook Namur. But the Dutch occupation did not last long. At the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713, the [[Spanish Netherlands|Southern Netherlands]] came under the rule of the Austrian house of [[Habsburg]]. Though the Austrians ruled over the city, the strategically important citadel remained in the hands of the Dutch. The Austrian rule returned peace and calm to the Netherlands.\n\n== The French revolutionists and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands ==\nIn 1790 the county of Namur was one of the founders of the [[United States of Belgium]]. In 1794 the [[French revolution|revolutionary]] [[France]] occupied Namur, immediately introducing a repressive regime. Namur became part of the [[departments of France|French department]] of [[Sambre-et-Meuse]]. The French occupation was abruptly ended following [[Napoleon]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815. In the [[Congress of Vienna]] that followed, the southern and [[Dutch Republic|Northern Netherlands]] were combined to form the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. In this period the citadel was again rebuilt and more or less received its present-day looks. The kingdom of the Netherlands would not last long. In 1830 the [[Belgian revolution]] broke out, in which [[Belgium]] became independent from the Netherlands. The strategically important bastion of Namur played a decisive role in the battles associated with the Belgian revolution.\n\n== Economic activities ==\nThe economic activities of the County of Namur were diverse. Next to the cultivation of [[grapes]] in the river valleys, the agriculture also cultivated [[flax]], that formed the basis of the [[wool]] industry. Clay formed the raw materials for the [[ceramic]]-production and for the making of molds for the so-called [[dinanderie]], the overall name for the yellow copper [[brass]] art objects such as lecterns, candleholders, tableware and others. The [[metal industry]] was also important: In the 16th century the mouth of the [[Meuse]] (Dinant, [[Bouvignes]], Namur, but also [[Huy]] and [[Li\u00e8ge]]) was the central region for [[metallurgy]] in the [[Southern Netherlands]]. Along the banks of the Meuse, [[limestone]] was mined and exported.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Counts of Namur]]\n* [[:Category:Counts of Namur]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Burgundian Circle}}\n\n{{coord missing|Belgium}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Namur, County of}}\n[[Category:States and territories established in the 980s]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1421]]\n[[Category:Seventeen Provinces]]\n[[Category:1420s in the Burgundian Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Medieval Belgium]]\n[[Category:Counties of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name            = ''Comt\u00e9 de Namur'' <small>([[French language|fr]])</small><br>''Graafschap Namen'' <small>([[Dutch language|nl]])</small>\n|conventional_long_name = County of Namur\n|common_name            = Namur\n|\n|today                  = [[Belgium]]\n|status                 = County\n|empire                 = Holy Roman Empire\n|status_text            = [[County]] of the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] Empires\n|era                    = Middle Ages\n|government_type        = County\n|\n|year_start             = {{circa}} 981\n|year_end               = 1797\n|life_span              = {{circa}} 981\u20131795\n|\n|event1                 = Acquired by [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]]\n|date_event1            = 1189\n|event2                 = Sold to [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], joins [[Burgundian Netherlands]]\n|date_event2            = 1421\n|event3                 = Burgundian Neth. inherited by [[Habsburg]]s<br /><small>([[Habsburg Netherlands]])</small>\n|date_event3            = 1482\n|event4                 = Habsburg Neth. inherited by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]]<br /><small>([[Spanish Netherlands]])</small>\n|date_event4            = 1556\n|event5                 = [[Treaty of Rastatt]]<br /><small>(Spanish Neth. \u2192 [[Austrian Netherlands|Austrian Neth.]])</small>\n|date_event5            = 1714\n|event6                 = [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1795|Annexed]] by [[French First Republic|France]]\n|date_event6            = 1795\n|event_end              = [[Treaty of Campo Formio]]: French annexation recognised by Austria\n|event_post             = [[Congress of Vienna|Assigned]] to [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Utd Kgdm of the Netherlands]]\n|date_post              = 1815\n|\n|p1                     = Lower Lorraine\n|flag_p1                = Lothringen-Nieder.PNG\n|border_p1              = no\n|s1                     = Burgundian Netherlands\n|flag_s1                = Flag of the Low Countries.svg\n|\n|image_coat             = Arms of Namur.svg\n|image_map              = Low Countries Locator Namur.svg\n|image_map_caption      = The county of Namur within the Low Countries in 1350\n|\n|capital                = [[Namur (city)|Namur]]\n|common_languages       = [[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[French language|French]]\n|religion               = [[Catholic Church]]\n}}\n'''Namur''' ({{lang-nl|Namen}}) was a county of the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] and later [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the [[Low Countries]].
