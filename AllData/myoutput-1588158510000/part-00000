The single, released on July 10, 1967, was a number-one hit in the US within three weeks of release and a big international seller. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked the record as the No. 3 song of the year.<ref>{{cite journal |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |title=Top Records of 1967 |date=December 30, 1967 |page=42 |volume=79 |issue=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSgEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref> The song notably kept the [[The Supremes|Diana Ross & the Supremes]] number \"[[Reflections (The Supremes song)|Reflections]]\" from becoming the group's 11th number-one single in the U.S. The recording remained on the Billboard chart for 20 weeks and was the Number 1 song for four weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/bobbie-gentry/chart-history/hot-100/song/574965|title=Bobbie Gentry: Chart Performance|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt generated eight [[Grammy]] nominations, resulting in three wins for Gentry and one for arranger [[Jimmie Haskell]].<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=Ode%20to%20Billie%20Joe&winner=&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1 ]{{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> \"Ode to Billie Joe\" has since made ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s lists of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\" and the \"100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time\" and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"200 Best Songs of the 1960s\".<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/100-greatest-country-songs-of-all-time-20140601/47-bobbie-gentry-ode-to-billie-joe-1967-0849545</ref><ref>https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/6405-the-200-greatest-songs-of-the-1960s/?page=3#144</ref>\n\nThe song takes the form of a [[first-person narrative]] performed over sparse acoustic accompaniment, though with strings in the background. It tells of a [[Mississippi Delta|rural Mississippi]] family's reaction to the news of the [[suicide]] of Billie Joe McAllister, a local boy to whom the daughter (and narrator) is connected. Hearsay around the \"Tallahatchie Bridge\" forms the narrative and musical [[hook (music)|hook]]. The song concludes with the demise of the father and the lingering, singular effects of the two deaths on the family. According to Gentry, the song is about \"basic indifference, the casualness of people in moments of tragedy\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Life of a Song: \u2018Ode to Billie Joe\u2019 |date=July 1, 2016 |publisher=Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/38c27b36-3234-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153 |access-date=February 21, 2020 |quote=The atmospheric production\u2019s juxtaposition of banalities against profound loss struck a chord in the America of 1967}}</ref>\n\n==Narrative==\nGentry's song takes the form of [[first-person narrative]] by the young daughter of a white [[Mississippi Delta]] family. It offers fragments of the dinnertime conversation on the day that a local white boy, an acquaintance of the narrator, jumped to his death from a nearby bridge, the account interspersed between everyday, polite, mealtime conversation. The song's final verse conveys the passage of events over the following year.\n\nThe song begins on June 3 with the narrator, her brother and her father returning from farming chores to the family house for dinner.<ref>In much of the American farming community, \"dinner\" is the largest meal of the day, and is served at noon.</ref> After cautioning them about tracking in dirt, Mama says that she \"got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\" that \"Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\". At the dinner table, the father seems unmoved, commenting, \"Billie Joe never had a lick o' sense\", before asking for the biscuits and adding that there's \"five more acres in the lower forty, I've got to [[plowing|plow]].\" Her brother is intrigued (\"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday ... And now you tell me Billie Joe has jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"), but not enough to be distracted from the lunchtime meal. He recalls a prank that he, \"Tom\", and Billie Joe played on the narrator.\n\nThe only person affected is the narrator; one reviewer commented on \"the narrator's family's emotional distance, impassive and unmoved by Billie Joe's death\".<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\">https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/trying-to-unearth-the-story-behind-the-reclusive-bobbie-gentry-s-ode-to-billie-joe-1.2175285</ref> Her mother notices her change of mood following the news (\"Child, what's happened to your appetite? I've been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched a single bite\"). The mother shares the news that a local preacher visited earlier and, as an aside, adds that he mentioned seeing someone looking much like the narrator and Billie Joe \"throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\". In the song's final verse, a year has passed. The narrator's brother has married Becky Thompson and has moved to another town (\"bought a store in Tupelo\"). The father died from a viral infection and the mother is despondent (\"Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything\"). The narrator likewise remains privately affected: she often visits Choctaw Ridge collecting flowers to \"drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge\".<ref>https://www.songfacts.com/facts/bobbie-gentry/ode-to-billie-joe</ref>\n\n===Composer's view===\nQuestions arose among listeners: what did Billie Joe and his girlfriend throw off the Tallahatchie Bridge, and why did Billie Joe commit suicide? Speculation ran rampant after the song hit the airwaves. Gentry said in a November 1967 interview that it was the question most asked of her by everyone she met. She said that the most named items were flowers, an engagement ring, a draft card, a bottle of [[LSD]] pills, and an aborted baby. Although she knew what the item was, she would not reveal it, saying only \"Suppose it was a wedding ring.\"\n\n<blockquote>\"It's in there for two reasons,\" she said. \"First, it locks up a definite relationship between Billie Joe and the girl telling the story, the girl at the table. Second, the fact that Billie Joe was seen throwing something off the bridge \u2013 no matter what it was \u2013 provides a possible motivation as to why he jumped off the bridge the next day.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=5y95FQUaxGgC&dat=19671119&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=An Actress with a Big Secret|newspaper=Oxnard Press-Courier|date=November 19, 1967|page=42|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen [[Herman Raucher]] met Gentry in preparation for writing a novel and screenplay based on the song, she said that she had no idea why Billie Joe killed himself.<ref name=studer/> Gentry has, however, commented elsewhere on the song, saying that it is about indifference:<ref name=odeto>{{cite web |title=Biography |publisher=[[Yahoo!

The story of Billie Joe has two more interesting underlying themes. First, the illustration of a group of people's reactions to the life and death of Billie Joe, and its subsequent effect on their lives, is made. Second, the obvious gap between the girl and her mother is shown when both women experience a common loss (first Billie Joe, and later, Papa), and yet Mama and the girl are unable to recognize their mutual loss or share their grief.}}\n\nA commentary published in 2017 in a British newspaper made this comment: \"Fifty years on we're no wiser as to why Billie Joe did what he did and in the context of the song and Gentry's intentions, that's just as it should be\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=Ross|title=12 essential songs that defined 1967|date=18 May 2017 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/12-essential-songs-that-defined-1967-the-beatles-the-rolling-stones-jimi-hendrix-the-kinks-a7740636.html |work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge mentioned in this song collapsed in June 1972 after a fire.<ref name=NME/>\nIt crossed the [[Tallahatchie River]] at [[Money, Mississippi|Money]], about ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north of [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], and has since been rebuilt.

The original recording of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", with no other musicians backing Gentry's guitar according to some reports, had eleven verses lasting eight minutes,<ref>https://www.ft.com/content/38c27b36-3234-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153</ref> telling more of Billie Joe's story. The executives realized that this song would work best as a single, so they cut the length by almost half and added background music, strings, two cellos and four violins, according to Gentry.<ref name=\"performingsongwriter.com\"/>\n\nThe only surviving draft of the seven-minute version of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", which consists of two handwritten pages, is located in the archive of the University of Mississippi.<ref>\n[http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe].</ref> Gentry donated the draft to the University's Faulkner room in 1973.<ref>\n[https://spinditty.com/artists-bands/ode-to-billie-joe The Story Behind the Song \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry].</ref><ref>[ https://olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe]</ref>\n\nThe first page has been published and includes these words not in the final recording.<ref>[https://olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe]</ref><blockquote>\n\"People don't see Sally Jane in town anymore ...

No one really knows what went on up at Choctaw Ridge ... The day that Billy Jo McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn addition to the iconic lyrics that made the final cut, the unused lyrics may showcase Bobbie Gentry's mindset and possible answer to the mystery of what was thrown from the bridge; as well as the narrator's relationship to Billie Joe.  The shorter version left more of the story to the listener's imagination, and made the single more suitable for radio airplay.<ref>[http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-bobbie-gentry.php Bobbie Gentry artist biography] at CountryPolitan.com, now offline.

The poster's tagline, which treats the film as being based on a true story and gives a date of death for Billy (June 3, 1953), led many to believe that the song was based on actual events.<ref name=studer>{{cite book |last=Studer |first=Wayne |title=Rock on The Wild Side: gay male images in popular music of the rock era |publisher=Leyland Publications |year=1994 |pages=97\u201398}}</ref> In Raucher's novel and screenplay, Billy Joe kills himself after a drunken homosexual experience, and the object thrown from the bridge is the narrator's ragdoll. The film was released in 1976, directed and produced by [[Max Baer, Jr]], and starring [[Robby Benson]] and [[Glynnis O'Connor]]. Only the first, second, and fifth verses were sung by Bobbie Gentry in the film, omitting the third and fourth verses.\n\nIn the novel, the ragdoll is the central character's confidant and advisor.  Tossing it off the bridge symbolizes throwing away her childhood and innocence, becoming a self-contained adult.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/menlikethatsouth00howa|url-access=registration|quote=Ode to billy joe ragdoll.|title=Men Like That: A Southern Queer History |date=November 1999|author=John Howard |page=[https://archive.org/details/menlikethatsouth00howa/page/349 349] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |ISBN=9780226354705 |access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact==\nSoon after the song's chart success, the Tallahatchie Bridge was visited by more individuals who wanted to jump off it.

Hearsay around the \"Tallahatchie Bridge\" forms the narrative and musical [[hook (music)|hook]]. The song concludes with the demise of the father and the lingering, singular effects of the two deaths on the family.

It offers fragments of the dinnertime conversation on the day that a local white boy, an acquaintance of the narrator, jumped to his death from a nearby bridge, the account interspersed between everyday, polite, mealtime conversation. The song's final verse conveys the passage of events over the following year.\n\nThe song begins on June 3 with the narrator, her brother and her father returning from farming chores to the family house for dinner.<ref>In much of the American farming community, \"dinner\" is the largest meal of the day, and is served at noon.</ref> After cautioning them about tracking in dirt, Mama says that she \"got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\" that \"Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\". At the dinner table, the father seems unmoved, commenting, \"Billie Joe never had a lick o' sense\", before asking for the biscuits and adding that there's \"five more acres in the lower forty, I've got to [[plowing|plow]].\" Her brother is intrigued (\"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday ... And now you tell me Billie Joe has jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"), but not enough to be distracted from the lunchtime meal. He recalls a prank that he, \"Tom\", and Billie Joe played on the narrator.\n\nThe only person affected is the narrator; one reviewer commented on \"the narrator's family's emotional distance, impassive and unmoved by Billie Joe's death\".<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\">https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/trying-to-unearth-the-story-behind-the-reclusive-bobbie-gentry-s-ode-to-billie-joe-1.2175285</ref> Her mother notices her change of mood following the news (\"Child, what's happened to your appetite? I've been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched a single bite\"). The mother shares the news that a local preacher visited earlier and, as an aside, adds that he mentioned seeing someone looking much like the narrator and Billie Joe \"throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\". In the song's final verse, a year has passed. The narrator's brother has married Becky Thompson and has moved to another town (\"bought a store in Tupelo\"). The father died from a viral infection and the mother is despondent (\"Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything\"). The narrator likewise remains privately affected: she often visits Choctaw Ridge collecting flowers to \"drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge\".<ref>https://www.songfacts.com/facts/bobbie-gentry/ode-to-billie-joe</ref>\n\n===Composer's view===\nQuestions arose among listeners: what did Billie Joe and his girlfriend throw off the Tallahatchie Bridge, and why did Billie Joe commit suicide? Speculation ran rampant after the song hit the airwaves. Gentry said in a November 1967 interview that it was the question most asked of her by everyone she met. She said that the most named items were flowers, an engagement ring, a draft card, a bottle of [[LSD]] pills, and an aborted baby. Although she knew what the item was, she would not reveal it, saying only \"Suppose it was a wedding ring.\"\n\n<blockquote>\"It's in there for two reasons,\" she said. \"First, it locks up a definite relationship between Billie Joe and the girl telling the story, the girl at the table. Second, the fact that Billie Joe was seen throwing something off the bridge \u2013 no matter what it was \u2013 provides a possible motivation as to why he jumped off the bridge the next day.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=5y95FQUaxGgC&dat=19671119&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=An Actress with a Big Secret|newspaper=Oxnard Press-Courier|date=November 19, 1967|page=42|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen [[Herman Raucher]] met Gentry in preparation for writing a novel and screenplay based on the song, she said that she had no idea why Billie Joe killed himself.<ref name=studer/> Gentry has, however, commented elsewhere on the song, saying that it is about indifference:<ref name=odeto>{{cite web |title=Biography |publisher=[[Yahoo!

The story of Billie Joe has two more interesting underlying themes. First, the illustration of a group of people's reactions to the life and death of Billie Joe, and its subsequent effect on their lives, is made. Second, the obvious gap between the girl and her mother is shown when both women experience a common loss (first Billie Joe, and later, Papa), and yet Mama and the girl are unable to recognize their mutual loss or share their grief.}}\n\nA commentary published in 2017 in a British newspaper made this comment: \"Fifty years on we're no wiser as to why Billie Joe did what he did and in the context of the song and Gentry's intentions, that's just as it should be\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=Ross|title=12 essential songs that defined 1967|date=18 May 2017 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/12-essential-songs-that-defined-1967-the-beatles-the-rolling-stones-jimi-hendrix-the-kinks-a7740636.html |work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge mentioned in this song collapsed in June 1972 after a fire.<ref name=NME/>\nIt crossed the [[Tallahatchie River]] at [[Money, Mississippi|Money]], about ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north of [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], and has since been rebuilt.

The original recording of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", with no other musicians backing Gentry's guitar according to some reports, had eleven verses lasting eight minutes,<ref>https://www.ft.com/content/38c27b36-3234-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153</ref> telling more of Billie Joe's story. The executives realized that this song would work best as a single, so they cut the length by almost half and added background music, strings, two cellos and four violins, according to Gentry.<ref name=\"performingsongwriter.com\"/>\n\nThe only surviving draft of the seven-minute version of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", which consists of two handwritten pages, is located in the archive of the University of Mississippi.<ref>\n[http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe].</ref> Gentry donated the draft to the University's Faulkner room in 1973.<ref>\n[https://spinditty.com/artists-bands/ode-to-billie-joe The Story Behind the Song \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry].</ref><ref>[ https://olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe]</ref>\n\nThe first page has been published and includes these words not in the final recording.<ref>[https://olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe]</ref><blockquote>\n\"People don't see Sally Jane in town anymore ...

No one really knows what went on up at Choctaw Ridge ... The day that Billy Jo McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn addition to the iconic lyrics that made the final cut, the unused lyrics may showcase Bobbie Gentry's mindset and possible answer to the mystery of what was thrown from the bridge; as well as the narrator's relationship to Billie Joe.  The shorter version left more of the story to the listener's imagination, and made the single more suitable for radio airplay.<ref>[http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-bobbie-gentry.php Bobbie Gentry artist biography] at CountryPolitan.com, now offline.

The poster's tagline, which treats the film as being based on a true story and gives a date of death for Billy (June 3, 1953), led many to believe that the song was based on actual events.<ref name=studer>{{cite book |last=Studer |first=Wayne |title=Rock on The Wild Side: gay male images in popular music of the rock era |publisher=Leyland Publications |year=1994 |pages=97\u201398}}</ref> In Raucher's novel and screenplay, Billy Joe kills himself after a drunken homosexual experience, and the object thrown from the bridge is the narrator's ragdoll. The film was released in 1976, directed and produced by [[Max Baer, Jr]], and starring [[Robby Benson]] and [[Glynnis O'Connor]]. Only the first, second, and fifth verses were sung by Bobbie Gentry in the film, omitting the third and fourth verses.\n\nIn the novel, the ragdoll is the central character's confidant and advisor.
