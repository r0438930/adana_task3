Adamski called himself a \"philosopher, teacher, student and [[flying saucer|saucer]] researcher\", although most investigators concluded his claims were an elaborate [[hoax]], and that Adamski himself was a [[con artist]].<ref name=\"tm1\">{{cite journal|date=1 June 1959|title=The Queen & the Saucers|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811123,00.html|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=27 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nAdamski authored three books describing his meetings with Nordic aliens and his travels with them aboard their spaceships: ''Flying Saucers Have Landed'' (co-written with [[Desmond Leslie]]) in 1953, ''Inside the Space Ships'' in 1955, and ''Flying Saucers Farewell'' in 1961.

In 1944, with funding from Alice K. Wells, a student of Adamski, they purchased {{convert|20|acre|ha}} of land at the base of Palomar Mountain, along highway [[County Route S6 (California)|S6]], where they built a new home, a campground called Palomar Gardens, and a small restaurant called Palomar Gardens Cafe.<ref name=\"tm1\"/><ref name=\"sosd1\"/><ref name=\"ps1\"/>\n\nAt the campground and restaurant, Adamski \"often gave lectures on Eastern philosophy and religion, sometimes late into the night\" to students, admirers, and tourists.<ref>Peebles, p. 114</ref> He also built a wooden observatory at the campground to house his six-inch [[telescope]], and visitors and tourists to Palomar Mountain often received the inaccurate impression that Adamski was an astronomer connected to the famed [[Palomar Observatory]] at the top of the mountain.<ref>Moseley, pp. 64-65</ref> Adamski would correct this false impression \"only when pressed to do so.\"<ref>Moseley, p. 65</ref> Although he was frequently called \"Professor\" Adamski by his admirers and followers, he held no graduate or undergraduate degree from any accredited college or university, and in fact had only a [[elementary school|third grade]] education.<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 119\">Peebles, p. 119</ref>\n\n==Ufology==\nOn 9 October 1946, during a [[meteor shower]], Adamski and some friends [[Lie|claimed]] that while they were at the Palomar Gardens campground, they witnessed a large cigar-shaped \"[[mother ship]].\"<ref name=\"sosd1\"/> In early 1947, Adamski took a [[photograph]] of what he claimed was the 1946 cigar-shaped \"mother ship\" crossing in front of the moon over Palomar Gardens.<ref name=\"sosd1\"/> In the summer of 1947, following the first widely publicized UFO sightings in the USA, Adamski claimed he had seen 184 UFOs pass over Palomar Gardens one evening.<ref name=\"Clark, p. 27\">Clark, p. 27</ref>\n\nIn 1949 Adamski began giving his first UFO lectures to civic groups and other organizations in Southern California; he requested, and received, fees for the lectures.

Believing that the ship was looking for him, Adamski is said to have left his friends and to have headed away from the main road. Shortly afterwards, according to Adamski's accounts, a scout ship made of a type of translucent [[metal]] landed close to him, and its pilot, a [[Venusians|Venusian]] called Orthon,<ref>Peebles, pp. 115-16</ref> disembarked and sought him out.

In the mid-1950s Leslie had created a low-budget UFO film entitled ''Them And The Thing'' at his home, [[Castle Leslie]]. The flying saucer in the film had been created by shining mirrors on to a Spanish Renaissance shield suspended from a fishing line. The film was rediscovered in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir Patrick Moore's Irish UFO film identified - BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-10985156|website=BBC.com|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn need of money and keen to create a bestseller, Leslie had written a manuscript about the visitation of Earth by aliens.

It slowly faded out, the way they do.}}\n\n''Flying Saucers Have Landed'' claimed Nordic aliens from Venus and other planets in Earth's solar system routinely visited the Earth. According to the book, Orthon and other aliens were worried that nuclear bomb tests in the Earth's atmosphere would kill all life on Earth, spread radiation into space, and contaminate other planets.<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 115\">Peebles, p. 115</ref> Adamski claimed that Nordic aliens worshiped a \"Creator of All\", but that \"we on Earth know very little about this Creator ... our understanding is shallow.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 115\"/>\n\nIn his 1955 book ''Inside the Space Ships'', Adamski claimed that Orthon arranged for him to be taken on a trip to see the [[Solar System]], including the planet [[Venus]], the location where Orthon said the late Mrs. Adamski had been [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]].<ref name=\"sosd1\"/><ref name=\"tcu1\"/> He claimed that in another voyage he met the 1,000-year-old \"elder philosopher of the space people\", who was called \"the Master\". Adamski said he and the Master discussed philosophy, religion, and the \"Earth's place in the universe\".<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 122\">Peebles, p. 122</ref> Adamski said he learned that he had been selected by Nordic aliens to bring their message of peace to Earth people, and that other humans throughout history had also served as their messengers, including [[Jesus Christ]]. Adamski further claimed that aliens were peacefully living on Earth, and that he had met with them in bars and restaurants in Southern California.<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 122\"/>\n\nAdamski's stories led other people to come forward with their own claims of contact and interplanetary travels with friendly \"Space Brothers\", including such figures as [[Howard Menger]], [[Daniel Fry]], [[George Van Tassel]], and [[Truman Bethurum]]. The message of Adamski and his fellow contactees was one in which the other planets of Earth's solar system were all \"inhabited by physically handsome, spiritually evolved beings who have moved beyond the problems of Earth people ... the reader of ''Inside the Space Ships'' enters a perfect world, the kind we can create here on Earth if we behave ourselves.\"<ref name=\"Clark, p. 28\"/> Through books, lectures, and conventions - particularly the annual [[Giant Rock]] UFO convention in California - the [[contactee]] movement would grow throughout the 1950s.<ref>Peebles, p. 125</ref> However, Adamski would remain the most prominent, and most influential, of the contactees.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nAdamski's claims of traveling aboard a UFO inspired an elaborate hoax perpetrated by British astronomer [[Patrick Moore]] and his friend Peter Davies using the false identity [[Cedric Allingham]].<ref>Clark, pp. 70-71</ref>\n\n===Straith Letter Hoax===\nIn 1957 Adamski received a letter signed \"R.E. Straith,\" alleged representative of the \"Cultural Exchange Committee\" of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]. The letter said the U.S. Government knew that Adamski had spoken to extraterrestrials in a California desert in 1952, and that a group of highly placed government officials planned on public corroboration of Adamski's story. Adamski was proud of this endorsement and exhibited it to support his claims.<ref>Peebles, pp. 133-34</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1985 [[Ufology|ufologist]] [[James W. Moseley]] revealed that the letter was a [[hoax]].<ref>(http://www.debunker.com/historical/GrayBarkerPapers.pdf)</ref> Moseley said he and his friend [[Gray Barker]] had obtained some official State Department letterheads, created the R.E. Straith persona, and then written the letter to Adamski as a prank. According to Moseley, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigated the case and discovered that the letter was a hoax, but charges were not filed against Moseley or Barker.<ref>[[#Moseley & Pflock|Moseley & Pflock]], pp. 124\u201327, 180</ref>\n\nMoseley also wrote that the FBI informed Adamski that the Straith letter was a hoax and asked him to stop using it as evidence in support of his claims, but that Adamski refused and continued to display the letter in his lectures and talks.<ref>[[#Moseley & Pflock|Moseley & Pflock]], p. 126</ref> This was not the first time Adamski had claimed government support for his UFO stories. In 1953 he told a meeting of the Corona, California [[Lions Club]] that his \"material has all been cleared with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and Air Force Intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 117\">Peebles, p. 117</ref>\n\nWhen the FBI learned of Adamski's claims, three agents were sent to talk to Adamski. He denied having stated that the FBI or USAF intelligence supported his claims (even though his remarks were reported in a local newspaper, the ''Riverside Enterprise''), and he agreed to sign a letter stating that \"he understood the implications of making false claims\" and that the FBI \"did not endorse [the claims] of individuals.\" The three FBI agents also signed the letter, and a copy was given to Adamski.<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 117\"/>\n\nHowever, a few months later Adamski told an interviewer that he had been \"cleared\" by the FBI, and displayed the letter as proof. When the Los Angeles [[Better Business Bureau]] complained, more FBI agents were sent to retrieve Adamski's copy of the letter, \"read the riot act to him, and warn him that legal action would be taken if he continued\" to claim FBI or government support for his stories.<ref>Peebles, pp. 117-18</ref> Adamski later said the FBI had \"warned [him] to keep quiet.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 118\">Peebles, p. 118</ref>\n\n===Meeting with Queen Juliana of the Netherlands===\nIn May 1959, the head of the Dutch Unidentified Flying Objects Society told Adamski she had been contacted by officials at the palace of [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] who advised \"that the Queen would like to receive you.\"<ref name=\"tm1\"/>\n\nAdamski informed a London newspaper about the invitation, which prompted the court and cabinet to request that the queen cancel her private audience with Adamski, but the queen went ahead with the audience, saying, \"A hostess cannot slam the door in the face of her guests.\"<ref name=\"tm1\"/> After the audience, Dutch Aeronautical Association president Cornelis Kolff said \"The Queen showed an extraordinary interest in the whole subject.\" The [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Haye Schaper said \"The man's a pathological case.\"<ref name=\"tm1\"/> Wire services such as [[United Press International]] and [[Reuters]] circulated reports of the meeting to newspapers around the world.<ref>Peebles, p. 60</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n[[Image:George Adamski Pope Medal 1.jpg|right|thumb|Adamski's \"Golden Medal of Honor\", which he claimed to have received during a secret audience with [[Pope John XXIII]]]]\nIn 1962, Adamski announced that he would be attending an interplanetary conference held on the planet [[Saturn]].<ref name=\"sosd1\"/> In 1963, Adamski claimed that he had had a secret audience with [[Pope John XXIII]] and that he had received a \"Golden Medal of Honor\" from the pope.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gafintl-adamski.com/html/AboutGA.htm|title=About George Adamski|accessdate=1 May 2007|publisher=George Adamski Foundation}}</ref> However, skeptics noted that the medal was actually a common tourist souvenir made by a company in [[Milan|Milan, Italy]], and that Adamski displayed it to his friends in a cheap plastic box - which is how it was sold in tourist shops in Rome.<ref name=\"skepticreport.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=101|title=Why I can say that Adamski was a Liar - SkepticReport|website=www.skepticreport.com|access-date=25 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194641/http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=101|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Adamski said he met with the Pope at the request of the extraterrestrials he was allegedly in contact with, in order to request a \"final agreement\" from the Pope because of his decision not to communicate directly with any extraterrestrials, and also to offer him a liquid substance in order to save him from the gastric [[enteritis]] that he suffered from, which would later become acute [[peritonitis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufodigest.com/news/1206/omegasecret3.html|title=The Omega Secret|last=Barbato|first=Cristoforo|year=2006|website=UFO Digest|publisher=Dirk Vander Ploeg|location=Port Colborne, Ontario|accessdate=30 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn 23 April 1965, aged 74, Adamski died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at a friend's home in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], after giving a UFO lecture in [[Washington, DC]].<ref name=\"sosd1\"/><ref>(Clark, p. 30)</ref> He is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8789255|title=George Adamski (1891-1965)|publisher=Findagrave.com|date=18 May 2004|accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Investigations and criticism==\nOver the decades numerous critics and skeptics have investigated Adamski's claims. The aliens Adamski claimed to have met in the 1950s were described by him as \"human beings from another world\", usually light-skinned, light-haired humanoids that would later be called [[Nordic aliens]].<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 115\"/> Adamski claimed in his books that these \"alien humans\" came from Venus, Mars, and other planets in Earth's solar system. However, none of the planets he mentioned are capable of supporting human life, due to their environmental conditions. The first alien Adamski claimed to have met was from Venus, yet the atmospheric pressure on the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, it has clouds which rain a toxic substance thought to be [[sulfuric acid]], the atmosphere consists almost entirely of [[carbon dioxide]], with very little [[oxygen]], and the average surface temperature of Venus is 464&nbsp;\u00b0C. In one of his books, Adamski described a trip he took to the [[far side of the Moon]] in a UFO, where he claimed to see cities, trees, and snow-capped mountains; he also claimed that the photographs of the Moon's far side that were taken by the Soviet lunar probe [[Luna 3]] in 1959 were altered to depict a barren, lifeless surface instead of what he saw.<ref name=\"nro1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/205575/spirits-sky/andrew-stuttaford|title=Spirits in the Sky|last=Stuttaford|first=Andrew|date=17 January 2003|work=[[National Review Online]]|publisher=[[National Review]]|location=New York|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> However, all scientific evidence, as well as later lunar trips by American astronauts, clearly showed that the far side of the Moon is barren of life and has no atmosphere.\n\nSome of Adamski's supporters posit that the space people whom Adamski claimed contacted him may have had bases on Venus, Mars, Saturn, etc., and Adamski misunderstood and mistook them for actually living on those planets.<ref name=Louize>{{cite book|last1=Louize|first1=Lucus|title=The UFO Teachings of Adamski, Menger, Fry, Nelson, and Others: A Supplemental Study Guide To Their Books|date=2015|isbn=978-0-692-56940-5|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/290095731/The-UFO-Teachings-of-Adamski-Menger-Fry-Nelson-and-Others-A-Supplemental-Study-Guide-To-Their-Books}}</ref> However, in his writings Adamski described traveling personally to Venus, Mars, and other planets in Earth's solar system, and he clearly stated that they were all capable of supporting humanoid life.<ref name=\"Clark, p. 28\"/> As UFO historian [[Jerome Clark]] noted, \"some Adamski partisans insisted that Venus, Mars, Saturn, and the rest were merely code words for planets in other solar systems; there is, however, nothing in Adamski's public writings to support this interpretation and considerable testimony to the contrary.\"<ref name=\"Clark, p. 31\"/>\n\nAdamski's 1955 book ''Inside the Space Ships'', which describes his claimed travels through Earth's solar system in a UFO, is considered by some critics<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hallet|first=Marc|date=1 May 2005|title=Why I can say that Adamski was a Liar|url=http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=101|journal=SkepticReport|location=Frederikssund, Denmark|publisher=Claus Flodin Larsen|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref> to be a \"remake\" of his 1949 [[science fiction]] book, [[Ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] for Adamski by Lucy McGinnis, and entitled ''Pioneers of Space''. It described a fictional voyage through the solar system that, critics noted, sounded very similar to the space travels described by Adamski in ''Inside the Space Ships''.<ref name=\"skepticreport.com\"/>\n\n===Adamski photographs and Moseley investigation===\nAdamski's photographs of the UFOs he claimed to observe and travel in have also come under scrutiny. His often-published photo of a flying saucer from 1952 has been variously identified as a streetlight or the top of a chicken brooder.<ref>[[#Wilhelmsen|Wilhelmsen 2008]], p. 259</ref> Adamski claimed that movie director [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s top trick photographer, [[Peverell Marley|J. Peverell Marley]], had examined his UFO photos and found a \"spaceman\" in them, and Marley himself declared that if Adamski's pictures were fakes, they were the best he had ever seen. In the United Kingdom, 14 experts from the [[General Film Distributors|J. Arthur Rank company]] concluded that the object photographed was either real or a full-scale model.<ref>[[#Zinsstag & Good 1983|Zinsstag & Good 1983]], p. 176.</ref>\n\nHowever, in his 1955 investigation into Adamski's claims, [[James W. Moseley]] interviewed Marley, who denied that he had enlarged the photos for analysis, found a \"spaceman\" in them, or knew of anyone who had. Moseley also interviewed German rocket scientist Walther Johannes Riedel, who told him that he had analyzed Adamski's UFO photos and found them to be fakes.<ref name=\"Moseley69\">[[#Moseley & Pflock|Moseley & Pflock]], p. 69</ref> Riedel told Moseley that the UFO's \"landing struts\" were actually 100-watt [[General Electric]] light bulbs, and that he had seen the \"GE\" logo printed on them.<ref name=\"Moseley69\"/> In 2012, UFO researcher Joel Carpenter identified the reflector-shade of a widely available 1930s pressurised-gas lantern as an identical visual match to the main portion of Adamski's saucer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beamsinvestigations.org/Adamski%20Scout%20Ship%20Hoax.pdf|title=Preliminary Notes on the Adamski Scout Ship Photos|accessdate=8 June 2017|last=Carpenter|first=Joel}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1955 investigation, Moseley found other flaws in Adamski's story. He interviewed several of the people that Adamski claimed had been with him in his initial 20 November 1952 meeting with Orthon, and found that these witnesses contradicted Adamski's claims.<ref>Peebles, pp. 118-19</ref> One, Al Bailey, denied to Moseley that he had seen a UFO in the desert or the alien Adamski described. Jerrold Baker, who had worked at Palomar Gardens with Adamski, told Moseley that he had overheard \"a tape-recorded account of what was to transpire on the desert, who was to go, etc.\" several days before Adamski's claimed 20 November meeting with Orthon, and Baker stated that Adamski's meeting with Orthon was a \"planned operation.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 118\"/> Baker added that Adamski had tried to convince him not to expose their hoax by telling him that he could make money by charging fees to give UFO lectures, as Adamski was doing: \"Now you know the [UFO] picture connected to your name is in the book (''Flying Saucers Have Landed'') too. And with people knowing that you are connected with flying saucers ... you could do yourself a lot of good. You could give lectures in the evenings. There is a demand for this! You could support yourself by the picture in the book with your name.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 119\"/>\n\nMoseley discovered that [[George Hunt Williamson]], another prominent contactee and friend of Adamski, did not witness any UFO nor Adamski's encounter with Orthon, despite his public statements claiming otherwise. When Irma Baker, Jerrold Baker's wife, accused him of lying about the incident, Williamson told her cryptically that \"sometimes to gain admittance, one has to go around the back door.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 119\"/> In his report on Adamski, Moseley wrote \"I do believe most definitely that Adamski's narrative contains enough flaws to place in very serious doubt both his veracity and his sincerity. The reader will be moved to make for himself a careful re-evaluation of the worth of Adamski's book.\"<ref>Peebles, p. 120</ref>\n\n===Air Force investigation===\nIn the early-to-mid 1950s USAF Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]] was the head of [[Project Blue Book]], the Air Force group assigned to investigate UFO reports. In 1953 Captain Ruppelt decided to investigate Adamski's UFO claims. He traveled to California's Palomar Mountain and, dressed in civilian attire to avoid attracting attention, attended one of Adamski's lectures before a large crowd at his Palomar Gardens Cafe.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nRuppelt concluded that Adamski was a talented [[con artist]] whose UFO stories were designed to make money from his gullible followers and listeners, and he compared Adamski to the famed hoaxer, carnival, and circus showman [[PT Barnum]]. In describing Adamski's speaking style, Ruppelt wrote \"to look at the man and listen to his story you had an immediate urge to believe him ... he was dressed in well-worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly graying hair and the most honest pair of eyes I've ever seen. He spoke softly and naively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that 'most people think I'm crazy, but honestly, I'm really not.'\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/> According to Ruppelt, Adamski had a persuasive effect on his audience, \"you could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop\" in the restaurant as Adamski told of his initial 1952 meeting with Orthon. When Adamski finished his story, Ruppelt noted that many of his listeners purchased copies of Adamski's UFO photos that were on sale in the restaurant. At another lecture led by Adamski and other well-known [[contactees]], Ruppelt wrote that \"people shelled out hard cash to hear Adamski's story.\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nRuppelt believed \"the common undertone to many of these [contactee] stories ... is [[Utopia]]. On these other worlds there is no illness, they've learned how to cure all diseases. There are no wars, they've learned how to live peaceably. There is no poverty, everyone has everything he wants. There is no old age, they have learned the secret of eternal life ... Too many times this subtle pitch can be boiled down to, \"Step right up folks and put a donation in the pot. I'm just on the verge of learning the spaceman's secrets and with a little money to carry out my work I'll give ''you'' the secret.\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nAccording to Ruppelt, by 1960 Adamski's UFO lectures, and in particular his first two books, had made him an affluent man: \"[His] hamburger stand is boarded up and he now lives in a big ranch house. He vacations in Mexico and has his own clerical staff. His two books ''Flying Saucers Have Landed'' and ''Inside the Space Ships'' have sold ... 200,000 copies and have been translated into every language except Russian.\" Ruppelt humorously noted that by 1960 two \"beautiful spacewomen\" who claimed to be Nordic aliens were dating Adamski, a blonde from Saturn called \"Kalna\" and another woman named \"Ilmuth\".<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n* Science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] referred to ufologists as suffering from ''Adamski's disease'' in his novel ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]''.\n* Adamski appears briefly in issue 4 of ''The Bulletproof Coffin - Disinterred'' by [[David Hine]] and [[Shaky Kane]].\n* British House musician [[Adamski]], real name Adam Tinley, adopted the UFO enthusiast's surname as his stagename.\n* In the role playing game ''[[Hunter: The Vigil]]'', Task Force VALKYRIE includes a subgroup called Operation ADAMSKI, dedicated to producing and distributing misinformation about aliens and other \"extra-normal entities\" in order to hide the existence of such beings.\n* In ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', the player character is able to assume a form resembling an Adamski UFO.\n* In ''[[Mega Man 9]]'', there is a UFO-based enemy named Adamski.\n* In the game ''[[Disgaea]]'' in the optional \"[[Prinny]] Commentary Mode\" the commentator makes reference to Adamski UFOs.\n* In the ''[[Transformers]]'' toy line, the Transformer ''[[Cosmos (Transformers)]]'' transforms into an Adamski-style [[Haunebu]] saucer and spoke with an Austrian accent.

In 1944, with funding from Alice K. Wells, a student of Adamski, they purchased {{convert|20|acre|ha}} of land at the base of Palomar Mountain, along highway [[County Route S6 (California)|S6]], where they built a new home, a campground called Palomar Gardens, and a small restaurant called Palomar Gardens Cafe.<ref name=\"tm1\"/><ref name=\"sosd1\"/><ref name=\"ps1\"/>\n\nAt the campground and restaurant, Adamski \"often gave lectures on Eastern philosophy and religion, sometimes late into the night\" to students, admirers, and tourists.<ref>Peebles, p. 114</ref> He also built a wooden observatory at the campground to house his six-inch [[telescope]], and visitors and tourists to Palomar Mountain often received the inaccurate impression that Adamski was an astronomer connected to the famed [[Palomar Observatory]] at the top of the mountain.<ref>Moseley, pp. 64-65</ref> Adamski would correct this false impression \"only when pressed to do so.\"<ref>Moseley, p. 65</ref> Although he was frequently called \"Professor\" Adamski by his admirers and followers, he held no graduate or undergraduate degree from any accredited college or university, and in fact had only a [[elementary school|third grade]] education.<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 119\">Peebles, p. 119</ref>\n\n==Ufology==\nOn 9 October 1946, during a [[meteor shower]], Adamski and some friends [[Lie|claimed]] that while they were at the Palomar Gardens campground, they witnessed a large cigar-shaped \"[[mother ship]].\"<ref name=\"sosd1\"/> In early 1947, Adamski took a [[photograph]] of what he claimed was the 1946 cigar-shaped \"mother ship\" crossing in front of the moon over Palomar Gardens.<ref name=\"sosd1\"/> In the summer of 1947, following the first widely publicized UFO sightings in the USA, Adamski claimed he had seen 184 UFOs pass over Palomar Gardens one evening.<ref name=\"Clark, p. 27\">Clark, p. 27</ref>\n\nIn 1949 Adamski began giving his first UFO lectures to civic groups and other organizations in Southern California; he requested, and received, fees for the lectures.

In the mid-1950s Leslie had created a low-budget UFO film entitled ''Them And The Thing'' at his home, [[Castle Leslie]]. The flying saucer in the film had been created by shining mirrors on to a Spanish Renaissance shield suspended from a fishing line. The film was rediscovered in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir Patrick Moore's Irish UFO film identified - BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-10985156|website=BBC.com|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn need of money and keen to create a bestseller, Leslie had written a manuscript about the visitation of Earth by aliens.

According to the book, Orthon and other aliens were worried that nuclear bomb tests in the Earth's atmosphere would kill all life on Earth, spread radiation into space, and contaminate other planets.<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 115\">Peebles, p. 115</ref> Adamski claimed that Nordic aliens worshiped a \"Creator of All\", but that \"we on Earth know very little about this Creator ... our understanding is shallow.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 115\"/>\n\nIn his 1955 book ''Inside the Space Ships'', Adamski claimed that Orthon arranged for him to be taken on a trip to see the [[Solar System]], including the planet [[Venus]], the location where Orthon said the late Mrs. Adamski had been [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]].<ref name=\"sosd1\"/><ref name=\"tcu1\"/> He claimed that in another voyage he met the 1,000-year-old \"elder philosopher of the space people\", who was called \"the Master\". Adamski said he and the Master discussed philosophy, religion, and the \"Earth's place in the universe\".<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 122\">Peebles, p. 122</ref> Adamski said he learned that he had been selected by Nordic aliens to bring their message of peace to Earth people, and that other humans throughout history had also served as their messengers, including [[Jesus Christ]]. Adamski further claimed that aliens were peacefully living on Earth, and that he had met with them in bars and restaurants in Southern California.<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 122\"/>\n\nAdamski's stories led other people to come forward with their own claims of contact and interplanetary travels with friendly \"Space Brothers\", including such figures as [[Howard Menger]], [[Daniel Fry]], [[George Van Tassel]], and [[Truman Bethurum]]. The message of Adamski and his fellow contactees was one in which the other planets of Earth's solar system were all \"inhabited by physically handsome, spiritually evolved beings who have moved beyond the problems of Earth people ... the reader of ''Inside the Space Ships'' enters a perfect world, the kind we can create here on Earth if we behave ourselves.\"<ref name=\"Clark, p. 28\"/> Through books, lectures, and conventions - particularly the annual [[Giant Rock]] UFO convention in California - the [[contactee]] movement would grow throughout the 1950s.<ref>Peebles, p. 125</ref> However, Adamski would remain the most prominent, and most influential, of the contactees.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nAdamski's claims of traveling aboard a UFO inspired an elaborate hoax perpetrated by British astronomer [[Patrick Moore]] and his friend Peter Davies using the false identity [[Cedric Allingham]].<ref>Clark, pp. 70-71</ref>\n\n===Straith Letter Hoax===\nIn 1957 Adamski received a letter signed \"R.E. Straith,\" alleged representative of the \"Cultural Exchange Committee\" of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]. The letter said the U.S. Government knew that Adamski had spoken to extraterrestrials in a California desert in 1952, and that a group of highly placed government officials planned on public corroboration of Adamski's story. Adamski was proud of this endorsement and exhibited it to support his claims.<ref>Peebles, pp. 133-34</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1985 [[Ufology|ufologist]] [[James W. Moseley]] revealed that the letter was a [[hoax]].<ref>(http://www.debunker.com/historical/GrayBarkerPapers.pdf)</ref> Moseley said he and his friend [[Gray Barker]] had obtained some official State Department letterheads, created the R.E. Straith persona, and then written the letter to Adamski as a prank. According to Moseley, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigated the case and discovered that the letter was a hoax, but charges were not filed against Moseley or Barker.<ref>[[#Moseley & Pflock|Moseley & Pflock]], pp. 124\u201327, 180</ref>\n\nMoseley also wrote that the FBI informed Adamski that the Straith letter was a hoax and asked him to stop using it as evidence in support of his claims, but that Adamski refused and continued to display the letter in his lectures and talks.<ref>[[#Moseley & Pflock|Moseley & Pflock]], p. 126</ref> This was not the first time Adamski had claimed government support for his UFO stories. In 1953 he told a meeting of the Corona, California [[Lions Club]] that his \"material has all been cleared with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and Air Force Intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 117\">Peebles, p. 117</ref>\n\nWhen the FBI learned of Adamski's claims, three agents were sent to talk to Adamski. He denied having stated that the FBI or USAF intelligence supported his claims (even though his remarks were reported in a local newspaper, the ''Riverside Enterprise''), and he agreed to sign a letter stating that \"he understood the implications of making false claims\" and that the FBI \"did not endorse [the claims] of individuals.\" The three FBI agents also signed the letter, and a copy was given to Adamski.<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 117\"/>\n\nHowever, a few months later Adamski told an interviewer that he had been \"cleared\" by the FBI, and displayed the letter as proof. When the Los Angeles [[Better Business Bureau]] complained, more FBI agents were sent to retrieve Adamski's copy of the letter, \"read the riot act to him, and warn him that legal action would be taken if he continued\" to claim FBI or government support for his stories.<ref>Peebles, pp. 117-18</ref> Adamski later said the FBI had \"warned [him] to keep quiet.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 118\">Peebles, p. 118</ref>\n\n===Meeting with Queen Juliana of the Netherlands===\nIn May 1959, the head of the Dutch Unidentified Flying Objects Society told Adamski she had been contacted by officials at the palace of [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] who advised \"that the Queen would like to receive you.\"<ref name=\"tm1\"/>\n\nAdamski informed a London newspaper about the invitation, which prompted the court and cabinet to request that the queen cancel her private audience with Adamski, but the queen went ahead with the audience, saying, \"A hostess cannot slam the door in the face of her guests.\"<ref name=\"tm1\"/> After the audience, Dutch Aeronautical Association president Cornelis Kolff said \"The Queen showed an extraordinary interest in the whole subject.\" The [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Haye Schaper said \"The man's a pathological case.\"<ref name=\"tm1\"/> Wire services such as [[United Press International]] and [[Reuters]] circulated reports of the meeting to newspapers around the world.<ref>Peebles, p. 60</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n[[Image:George Adamski Pope Medal 1.jpg|right|thumb|Adamski's \"Golden Medal of Honor\", which he claimed to have received during a secret audience with [[Pope John XXIII]]]]\nIn 1962, Adamski announced that he would be attending an interplanetary conference held on the planet [[Saturn]].<ref name=\"sosd1\"/> In 1963, Adamski claimed that he had had a secret audience with [[Pope John XXIII]] and that he had received a \"Golden Medal of Honor\" from the pope.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gafintl-adamski.com/html/AboutGA.htm|title=About George Adamski|accessdate=1 May 2007|publisher=George Adamski Foundation}}</ref> However, skeptics noted that the medal was actually a common tourist souvenir made by a company in [[Milan|Milan, Italy]], and that Adamski displayed it to his friends in a cheap plastic box - which is how it was sold in tourist shops in Rome.<ref name=\"skepticreport.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=101|title=Why I can say that Adamski was a Liar - SkepticReport|website=www.skepticreport.com|access-date=25 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194641/http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=101|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Adamski said he met with the Pope at the request of the extraterrestrials he was allegedly in contact with, in order to request a \"final agreement\" from the Pope because of his decision not to communicate directly with any extraterrestrials, and also to offer him a liquid substance in order to save him from the gastric [[enteritis]] that he suffered from, which would later become acute [[peritonitis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufodigest.com/news/1206/omegasecret3.html|title=The Omega Secret|last=Barbato|first=Cristoforo|year=2006|website=UFO Digest|publisher=Dirk Vander Ploeg|location=Port Colborne, Ontario|accessdate=30 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn 23 April 1965, aged 74, Adamski died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at a friend's home in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], after giving a UFO lecture in [[Washington, DC]].<ref name=\"sosd1\"/><ref>(Clark, p. 30)</ref> He is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8789255|title=George Adamski (1891-1965)|publisher=Findagrave.com|date=18 May 2004|accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Investigations and criticism==\nOver the decades numerous critics and skeptics have investigated Adamski's claims. The aliens Adamski claimed to have met in the 1950s were described by him as \"human beings from another world\", usually light-skinned, light-haired humanoids that would later be called [[Nordic aliens]].<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 115\"/> Adamski claimed in his books that these \"alien humans\" came from Venus, Mars, and other planets in Earth's solar system. However, none of the planets he mentioned are capable of supporting human life, due to their environmental conditions. The first alien Adamski claimed to have met was from Venus, yet the atmospheric pressure on the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, it has clouds which rain a toxic substance thought to be [[sulfuric acid]], the atmosphere consists almost entirely of [[carbon dioxide]], with very little [[oxygen]], and the average surface temperature of Venus is 464&nbsp;\u00b0C. In one of his books, Adamski described a trip he took to the [[far side of the Moon]] in a UFO, where he claimed to see cities, trees, and snow-capped mountains; he also claimed that the photographs of the Moon's far side that were taken by the Soviet lunar probe [[Luna 3]] in 1959 were altered to depict a barren, lifeless surface instead of what he saw.<ref name=\"nro1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/205575/spirits-sky/andrew-stuttaford|title=Spirits in the Sky|last=Stuttaford|first=Andrew|date=17 January 2003|work=[[National Review Online]]|publisher=[[National Review]]|location=New York|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> However, all scientific evidence, as well as later lunar trips by American astronauts, clearly showed that the far side of the Moon is barren of life and has no atmosphere.\n\nSome of Adamski's supporters posit that the space people whom Adamski claimed contacted him may have had bases on Venus, Mars, Saturn, etc., and Adamski misunderstood and mistook them for actually living on those planets.<ref name=Louize>{{cite book|last1=Louize|first1=Lucus|title=The UFO Teachings of Adamski, Menger, Fry, Nelson, and Others: A Supplemental Study Guide To Their Books|date=2015|isbn=978-0-692-56940-5|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/290095731/The-UFO-Teachings-of-Adamski-Menger-Fry-Nelson-and-Others-A-Supplemental-Study-Guide-To-Their-Books}}</ref> However, in his writings Adamski described traveling personally to Venus, Mars, and other planets in Earth's solar system, and he clearly stated that they were all capable of supporting humanoid life.<ref name=\"Clark, p. 28\"/> As UFO historian [[Jerome Clark]] noted, \"some Adamski partisans insisted that Venus, Mars, Saturn, and the rest were merely code words for planets in other solar systems; there is, however, nothing in Adamski's public writings to support this interpretation and considerable testimony to the contrary.\"<ref name=\"Clark, p. 31\"/>\n\nAdamski's 1955 book ''Inside the Space Ships'', which describes his claimed travels through Earth's solar system in a UFO, is considered by some critics<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hallet|first=Marc|date=1 May 2005|title=Why I can say that Adamski was a Liar|url=http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=101|journal=SkepticReport|location=Frederikssund, Denmark|publisher=Claus Flodin Larsen|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref> to be a \"remake\" of his 1949 [[science fiction]] book, [[Ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] for Adamski by Lucy McGinnis, and entitled ''Pioneers of Space''. It described a fictional voyage through the solar system that, critics noted, sounded very similar to the space travels described by Adamski in ''Inside the Space Ships''.<ref name=\"skepticreport.com\"/>\n\n===Adamski photographs and Moseley investigation===\nAdamski's photographs of the UFOs he claimed to observe and travel in have also come under scrutiny. His often-published photo of a flying saucer from 1952 has been variously identified as a streetlight or the top of a chicken brooder.<ref>[[#Wilhelmsen|Wilhelmsen 2008]], p. 259</ref> Adamski claimed that movie director [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s top trick photographer, [[Peverell Marley|J. Peverell Marley]], had examined his UFO photos and found a \"spaceman\" in them, and Marley himself declared that if Adamski's pictures were fakes, they were the best he had ever seen. In the United Kingdom, 14 experts from the [[General Film Distributors|J. Arthur Rank company]] concluded that the object photographed was either real or a full-scale model.<ref>[[#Zinsstag & Good 1983|Zinsstag & Good 1983]], p. 176.</ref>\n\nHowever, in his 1955 investigation into Adamski's claims, [[James W. Moseley]] interviewed Marley, who denied that he had enlarged the photos for analysis, found a \"spaceman\" in them, or knew of anyone who had. Moseley also interviewed German rocket scientist Walther Johannes Riedel, who told him that he had analyzed Adamski's UFO photos and found them to be fakes.<ref name=\"Moseley69\">[[#Moseley & Pflock|Moseley & Pflock]], p. 69</ref> Riedel told Moseley that the UFO's \"landing struts\" were actually 100-watt [[General Electric]] light bulbs, and that he had seen the \"GE\" logo printed on them.<ref name=\"Moseley69\"/> In 2012, UFO researcher Joel Carpenter identified the reflector-shade of a widely available 1930s pressurised-gas lantern as an identical visual match to the main portion of Adamski's saucer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beamsinvestigations.org/Adamski%20Scout%20Ship%20Hoax.pdf|title=Preliminary Notes on the Adamski Scout Ship Photos|accessdate=8 June 2017|last=Carpenter|first=Joel}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1955 investigation, Moseley found other flaws in Adamski's story. He interviewed several of the people that Adamski claimed had been with him in his initial 20 November 1952 meeting with Orthon, and found that these witnesses contradicted Adamski's claims.<ref>Peebles, pp. 118-19</ref> One, Al Bailey, denied to Moseley that he had seen a UFO in the desert or the alien Adamski described. Jerrold Baker, who had worked at Palomar Gardens with Adamski, told Moseley that he had overheard \"a tape-recorded account of what was to transpire on the desert, who was to go, etc.\" several days before Adamski's claimed 20 November meeting with Orthon, and Baker stated that Adamski's meeting with Orthon was a \"planned operation.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 118\"/> Baker added that Adamski had tried to convince him not to expose their hoax by telling him that he could make money by charging fees to give UFO lectures, as Adamski was doing: \"Now you know the [UFO] picture connected to your name is in the book (''Flying Saucers Have Landed'') too. And with people knowing that you are connected with flying saucers ... you could do yourself a lot of good. You could give lectures in the evenings. There is a demand for this! You could support yourself by the picture in the book with your name.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 119\"/>\n\nMoseley discovered that [[George Hunt Williamson]], another prominent contactee and friend of Adamski, did not witness any UFO nor Adamski's encounter with Orthon, despite his public statements claiming otherwise. When Irma Baker, Jerrold Baker's wife, accused him of lying about the incident, Williamson told her cryptically that \"sometimes to gain admittance, one has to go around the back door.\"<ref name=\"Peebles, p. 119\"/> In his report on Adamski, Moseley wrote \"I do believe most definitely that Adamski's narrative contains enough flaws to place in very serious doubt both his veracity and his sincerity. The reader will be moved to make for himself a careful re-evaluation of the worth of Adamski's book.\"<ref>Peebles, p. 120</ref>\n\n===Air Force investigation===\nIn the early-to-mid 1950s USAF Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]] was the head of [[Project Blue Book]], the Air Force group assigned to investigate UFO reports. In 1953 Captain Ruppelt decided to investigate Adamski's UFO claims. He traveled to California's Palomar Mountain and, dressed in civilian attire to avoid attracting attention, attended one of Adamski's lectures before a large crowd at his Palomar Gardens Cafe.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nRuppelt concluded that Adamski was a talented [[con artist]] whose UFO stories were designed to make money from his gullible followers and listeners, and he compared Adamski to the famed hoaxer, carnival, and circus showman [[PT Barnum]]. In describing Adamski's speaking style, Ruppelt wrote \"to look at the man and listen to his story you had an immediate urge to believe him ... he was dressed in well-worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly graying hair and the most honest pair of eyes I've ever seen. He spoke softly and naively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that 'most people think I'm crazy, but honestly, I'm really not.'\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/> According to Ruppelt, Adamski had a persuasive effect on his audience, \"you could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop\" in the restaurant as Adamski told of his initial 1952 meeting with Orthon. When Adamski finished his story, Ruppelt noted that many of his listeners purchased copies of Adamski's UFO photos that were on sale in the restaurant. At another lecture led by Adamski and other well-known [[contactees]], Ruppelt wrote that \"people shelled out hard cash to hear Adamski's story.\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nRuppelt believed \"the common undertone to many of these [contactee] stories ... is [[Utopia]]. On these other worlds there is no illness, they've learned how to cure all diseases. There are no wars, they've learned how to live peaceably. There is no poverty, everyone has everything he wants. There is no old age, they have learned the secret of eternal life ... Too many times this subtle pitch can be boiled down to, \"Step right up folks and put a donation in the pot. I'm just on the verge of learning the spaceman's secrets and with a little money to carry out my work I'll give ''you'' the secret.\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nAccording to Ruppelt, by 1960 Adamski's UFO lectures, and in particular his first two books, had made him an affluent man: \"[His] hamburger stand is boarded up and he now lives in a big ranch house. He vacations in Mexico and has his own clerical staff. His two books ''Flying Saucers Have Landed'' and ''Inside the Space Ships'' have sold ... 200,000 copies and have been translated into every language except Russian.\" Ruppelt humorously noted that by 1960 two \"beautiful spacewomen\" who claimed to be Nordic aliens were dating Adamski, a blonde from Saturn called \"Kalna\" and another woman named \"Ilmuth\".<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n* Science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] referred to ufologists as suffering from ''Adamski's disease'' in his novel ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]''.\n* Adamski appears briefly in issue 4 of ''The Bulletproof Coffin - Disinterred'' by [[David Hine]] and [[Shaky Kane]].\n* British House musician [[Adamski]], real name Adam Tinley, adopted the UFO enthusiast's surname as his stagename.\n* In the role playing game ''[[Hunter: The Vigil]]'', Task Force VALKYRIE includes a subgroup called Operation ADAMSKI, dedicated to producing and distributing misinformation about aliens and other \"extra-normal entities\" in order to hide the existence of such beings.\n* In ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', the player character is able to assume a form resembling an Adamski UFO.\n* In ''[[Mega Man 9]]'', there is a UFO-based enemy named Adamski.\n* In the game ''[[Disgaea]]'' in the optional \"[[Prinny]] Commentary Mode\" the commentator makes reference to Adamski UFOs.\n* In the ''[[Transformers]]'' toy line, the Transformer ''[[Cosmos (Transformers)]]'' transforms into an Adamski-style [[Haunebu]] saucer and spoke with an Austrian accent.
