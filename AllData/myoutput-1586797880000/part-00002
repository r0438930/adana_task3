{"title_page": "Nauvoo Illinois Temple", "text_new": "{{for|the original structure on the same site|Nauvoo Temple}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{ LDS Temple/Nauvoo Illinois Temple |format= Infobox LDS Temple }}\n\nThe '''Nauvoo Illinois Temple''' is the 113th dedicated [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). It is the third such temple that has been built in [[Illinois]] (the [[Nauvoo Temple|original Nauvoo Temple]] and [[Chicago Illinois Temple]] being the others).\n\n==History==\nLocated in the town of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], the temple's construction was announced on April 4, 1999, by [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]]. Groundbreaking was conducted on October 24, 1999 and the cornerstones were laid November 5, 2000. The structure itself was built in the [[Greek Revival]] architectural style using limestone block quarried in [[Russellville, Alabama]]. It is built in the same location as the [[Nauvoo Temple|original structure]] that was dedicated in 1846.\n\nThe origins of the temple go back to 1937. In that year, Wilford C. Wood purchased some of the land on behalf of the LDS Church and purchased another piece of land that he later sold to the church. He also organized a group of church members from the Chicago Illinois [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stake]], co-led by Ariel S. Williams, to clear and beautify the recently purchased land. At the time, the Chicago Stake was one of only two east of the Mississippi River.<ref>[https://rsc.byu.edu/es/archived/nauvoo-temple-story-faith/13-temple-rebuilt Don F. Colvin. ''Nauvoo Temple: A Story of Faith''. BYU Religious Studies Center, Chapter 13]</ref>\n\nWood purchased land in 1951 that included a house which was made a visitors center for the temple site. In the late-1950s, and then in 1962, agents for the LDS Church completed the purchase of the temple lot.<ref>Colvin, ''Nauvoo Temple''</ref>\n\n==Exterior design and decoration==\nThe building measures {{convert|130|ft|m}} long, {{convert|90|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|162|ft|m}} tall to the top of the statue of angel Moroni.  It has an area of {{convert|54000|sqft|m2}}.  It is the only temple owned by the LDS Church today that has a bell tower, although the [[Kirtland Temple]] also has a bell tower. The temple spire is surmounted by a standing statue of the [[angel Moroni]] covered in gold leaf, following the pattern of the statue on the Salt Lake temple. The angel on the first Nauvoo temple was a weather vane, sculpted of metal. The figure was positioned horizontally as if it were flying. Clothed in a robe and cap. The angel held a book in one hand and a trumpet in the other.  \n\nChurch leaders and architects carefully worked to replicate the original exterior design of the [[Nauvoo Temple|19th-century temple]], which was damaged by an arson fire in 1848 and by a tornado on May 27, 1850. It was consequently condemned and demolished by the Nauvoo City Council. Construction materials and furniture were derived from the original design as well.\n\n==Interior design and decoration==\nThe interior floor plan of the temple is noticeably different from the original structure in which the endowment ceremony assumed its present format. At the direction of Joseph Smith, the west end of the attic story was divided by cloth partitions into four spaces used to administer the endowment. One of the canvas \"rooms\" was decorated with potted plants to suggest the Garden of Eden. \n\nThe Salt Lake City [[Endowment House]] and early Utah temples, each with a series of four rooms through which patrons moved during the presentation of the endowment, followed this layout. The first three rooms were decorated with murals representing, in succession, the creation of the world, the Garden of Eden, and the world after the fall of Adam and Eve. The fourth room, known as the Terrestrial Room, was ornately decorated but lacked murals. The [[Los Angeles California Temple]], dedicated in 1956, was the last temple with this layout. Temples built after Los Angeles present the endowment in one or two rooms without murals adorning the ordinance rooms. The use of murals resumed again in 2001 with the opening of the [[Columbia River Washington Temple]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}. The Nauvoo Illinois Temple, a throwback to the four room layout, is the sole exception, as it has the four-room progressive format with murals decorating the first three rooms. \n\n==Open house and dedication==\nAfter the temple was completed, a public open house from 6 May to 22 June 2002 attracted over 250,000 visitors to tour the temple. The completion and official dedication took place on June 27, 2002, on the anniversary of the death of [[Joseph Smith]], the church's founder.\n\nUp to 1.5 million visitors a year have visited Nauvoo since the temple opened in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title= Mormon temple a tourism draw for tiny Nauvoo |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-08-22-mormon-temple-tourism_x.htm |first= Jan |last= Dennis |date= August 22, 2006 |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |agency= [[Associated Press|AP]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, like all the church's other temples, the Nauvoo Illinois Temple was closed in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>Stack, Peggy Fletcher.
