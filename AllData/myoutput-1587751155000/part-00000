Her father, [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]], who hailed from [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[New York (state)|New York]], was of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry. {{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Between the world wars he was the chief engineer for the [[New York State]] Department of Public Works, and during [[World War II]] rejoined the [[United States Army]] to become Deputy Commanding General of the [[Manhattan Project]]. Vucanovich's mother, Maria Ynez White, was of [[English people|English]] and [[Hispanic people|Hispanic]] ancestry from [[southern California]], with her maternal grandmother having been a Mexican who became a U.S. citizen upon the transfer of California to the United States in 1848.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8776562/maria-jesus-shorb] FindAGrave.com.

She married James Henry Bugden at the age of 18 but became separated when her husband was assigned overseas during the war. She was employed by several New York businesses during the 1940s. In 1949, she moved to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], Nevada and obtained a divorce. In 1950 she married Kenneth Dillon, a founding partner in the law firm Vargas, Dillon, and Bartlett. Their children were [[Patricia Dillon Cafferata|Patricia]], Michael, Kenneth, Thomas, and Susan. Widowed in 1964, she married George Vucanovich in 1965. They met while working on [[Paul Laxalt]]'s unsuccessful campaign in 1964 for the [[U.S. Senate]].<ref name=\"background\">{{cite book|title=Barbara F. Vucanovich|author=Patricia D.

Dillon introduced her to [[Paul Laxalt]], then a young [[district attorney]] from [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]]. After working on Laxalt's [[governor of Nevada|gubernatorial]] campaigns and his razor-close win in the senatorial election over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Harry Reid]] in 1974, Vucanovich was hired as the district director for the newly elected Senator. When Nevada was split into two congressional districts after [[1980 United States Census]], Laxalt urged Vucanovich to run for the 2nd District, which included the entire state outside of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].\n\nShe won her first term with the slogan, \"What Congress needs is a tough grandmother.\"<ref name=legacy/> Her tenure extended from 1983 until her retirement in 1997. She faced serious opposition once, in 1992, when [[Bill Clinton]] won the [[United States Electoral College|electoral vote]]s of Nevada over [[George Herbert Walker Bush]], Vucanovich's choice. She won just 48% of the vote to 43% to Reno mayor Pete Sferrazza. Shortly after taking office in 1983, she was diagnosed and had surgery for [[breast cancer]]. Motivated in part by her own experience, Vucanovich supported funding for early screening, detection and treatment of breast cancer. She supported equal pay and equal treatment for women. She was a supporter of [[capital punishment]].<ref name=legacy/>\n\nVucanovich served for many years on the House Interior Committee, of which she eventually became the ranking Republican on the Mining and Minerals Subcommittee. She also served on the [[House Administration Committee]] until her appointment in 1991 to the Appropriations Committee. She became Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction when the Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives in 1995. Vucanovich authored the repeal of the 55&nbsp;mph speed limit, particularly popular in the [[American West]] and a measure to prevent more than one state from taxing pensions and retirement benefits.  She campaigned for her seventh term by opposing Clinton administration tax increase proposals on casinos.<ref name=legacy/>\n\nShe launched a campaign to become [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|Secretary of the Republican Conference]] shortly after Congressman [[Bob Michel]] announced he would not seek another term. Michel's retirement created several vacancies in the Republican leadership as [[Newt Gingrich]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and others jockeyed for higher positions. Despite having been a member of the [[Conservative Opportunity Society]], a group led by  subsequent [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] Gingrich with the goal of achieving Republican control of the House, Vucanovich faced serious opposition in her leadership bid from [[Tim Hutchinson]], a second-term member from [[Arkansas]]. She prevailed in a close contest for secretary after a rousing nomination speech by [[Henry Hyde]] (R-IL), a friend and ally in their shared opposition to [[abortion]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nVucanovich positioned herself early in her House career as a conservative leader, having aligned herself with a group of members such as Newt Gingrich, [[Robert Smith Walker|Bob Walker]] and [[Vin Weber]] who were not content with minority status.  She helped draft two of the ten bills that were part of the [[Contract with America]]. She served on the [[Presidential Debate Commission]] from 1987\u201397.<ref name=\"background\"/>\n\n==Retirement==\nAfter her retirement from elected office, Vucanovich continued to work in politics, mainly serving on external committees.
