In 1615, the central panel, the only one by D\u00fcrer alone, was sold to [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian I of Bavaria]]; a copy was ordered to replace the original in its location at the church's high altar. The central panel was destroyed by a fire in Munich in 1729.

Below, around the empty sepulcher, the apostles observe the scene in  astonished postures. D\u00fcrer added a self-portrait in the background, next to a table with his signature and the date.\n\nThe internal side panels were painted by assistants from D\u00fcrer's drawings.

At right is ''Martyrdom of St. Catherine of Alexandria'', with the donor's wife,  Katharina von Melem.
