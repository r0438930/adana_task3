It also inspired [[Seth Lakeman]] to write his 2004 song and album, both called ''[[Kitty Jay (album)|Kitty Jay]]''.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle visited the nearby house, Heatree and he is said to have been inspired by the location of the house and it's proximity to Jay's Grave, Bowerman's nose, Hound Tor and Grimspound to write Hound of the Baskervillles (Legend has it that the house's coachman who ferried Conan Doyle on his visit had the surname Baskerville)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web\n|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/videonation/kitty_jays_grave.shtml\n|title=Devon Video Nation - Kitty Jay's Grave - a Dartmoor Legend\n|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2012-02-18\n|last=Phillips|first=David}}\n\n{{commons category|Jay's Grave, Dartmoor}}\n\n[[Category:Dartmoor]]\n[[Category:Monuments and memorials in Devon]]\n[[Category:Devon folklore]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "it's \u2192 its; copy edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay%27s_Grave"}
