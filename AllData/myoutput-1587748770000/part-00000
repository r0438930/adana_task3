It consists of the elements [[nitrogen]] (N), [[phosphorus]] (P), [[arsenic]] (As), [[antimony]] (Sb), [[bismuth]] (Bi), and perhaps the chemically uncharacterized [[synthetic element]] [[moscovium]] (Mc).\n\nIn modern [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] notation, it is called '''Group 15'''. In [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] and the old IUPAC systems it was called '''Group V<small>A</small>''' and '''Group V<small>B</small>''' respectively (pronounced \"group five A\" and \"group five B\", \"V\" for the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] 5).<ref name=Fluck1988>{{cite journal|last=Fluck|first=E|title=New notations in the periodic table |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=431\u20136 |year=1988 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1988/pdf/6003x0431.pdf |doi=10.1351/pac198860030431}}</ref> In the field of [[semiconductor]] physics, it is still usually called '''Group V'''.<ref name=Adachi2005>{{cite book |editor-last=Adachi |editor-first=S. |title=Properties of Group-IV, III-V and II-VI Semiconductors |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |year=2005 |isbn=978-0470090329 |series=Wiley Series in Materials for Electronic & Optoelectronic Applications |volume=15 |bibcode=2005pgii.book.....A}}</ref> The \"five\" (\"V\") in the historical names comes from the \"[[valence (chemistry)|pentavalency]]\" of nitrogen, reflected by the [[stoichiometry]] of [[Chemical compound|compounds]] such as N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.

Every Pnictogen Metal Is Radioactive.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Chemical===\nLike other groups, the members of this family show similar patterns in [[electron configuration]], especially in the outermost shells, resulting in trends{{clarify|reason=what kind of trends?|date=October 2015}} in chemical behavior. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n![[Atomic number|Z]] !!

They are therefore 3&nbsp;electrons short of filling their outermost electron shell in their non-[[ion]]ized state. The Russell\u2013Saunders [[term symbol]] of the ground state in all elements in the group is <sup>4</sup>S<sub>{{frac|3|2}}</sub>.\n\nThe most important elements of this group are ''[[nitrogen]]'' (N), which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air, and ''[[phosphorus]]'' (P), which, like nitrogen, is essential to all known forms of life.\n\n====Compounds====\n<!-- For those who are considering expanding this section, I recommend reading the first paragraph of [[Moscovium#Chemical]], which is a good summary of the chemical behavior of the entire group, first. -->\nBinary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as '''pnictides'''. Pnictide compounds tend to be [[exotic compound|exotic]]. Various properties that some pnictides have include being [[diamagnetic]] and [[paramagnetic]] at room temperature, being transparent, and generating electricity when heated. Other pnictides include the ternary rare-earth main-group variety of pnictides. These are in the form of RE<sub>a</sub>M<sub>b</sub>Pn<sub>c</sub>, where M is a [[carbon group]] or [[boron group]] element and Pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen. These compounds are between [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bond|covalent]] compounds and thus have unusual bonding properties.<ref name=\"chm.bris.ac.uk\">[http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/pnictogen/pnictogenh.htm \"Pnicogen \u2013 Molecule of the Month\"]. University of Bristol</ref>\n\nThese elements are also noted for their [[chemical stability|stability]] in compounds due to their tendency for forming double and triple [[covalent bond]]s. This is the property of these elements which leads to their potential [[toxicity]], most evident in phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. When these substances react with various chemicals of the body, they create strong [[free radicals]] not easily processed by the liver, where they accumulate.  Paradoxically, it is this strong bonding which causes nitrogen and bismuth's reduced toxicity (when in molecules), as these form strong bonds with other atoms which are difficult to split, creating very unreactive molecules. For example, N<sub>2</sub>, the [[diatomic]] form of nitrogen, is used as an inert gas in situations where using [[argon]] or another [[noble gas]] would be too expensive.\n\nFormation of multiple bonds is facilitated by their ''five'' valence electrons whereas the [[octet rule]] permits a pnictogen for accepting three electrons on covalent bonding. Because 5&nbsp;{{abbr|>|greater than}}&nbsp;3, it leaves unused two electrons in a [[lone pair]] unless there is a positive charge around (like in [[ammonium|{{chem2|NH4+}}]]). When a pnictogen forms only three [[single bond]]s, effects of the lone pair typically result in [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].\n\n====Oxidation states====\nThe light pnictogens (nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic) tend to form \u22123 charges when reduced, completing their octet. When oxidized or ionized, pnictogens typically take an oxidation state of +3 (by losing all three p-shell electrons in the valence shell) or +5 (by losing all three p-shell and both s-shell electrons in the valence shell). However heavier pnictogens are more likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the s-shell electrons becoming more stabalised.<ref name=Boudreaux>Boudreaux, Kevin A.

Going down the group, to [[phosphane]] (phosphine), [[arsane]] (arsine), [[stibane]] (stibine), and finally [[bismuthane]] (bismuthine), each pnictogen hydride becomes progressively less stable/more unstable, more toxic, and has a smaller hydrogen-hydrogen angle (from 107.8\u00b0 in ammonia<ref>{{cite book |last=Greenwood |first= N.N. |last2= Earnshaw |first2=A. | title=Chemistry of the Elements |edition = 2nd | location=Oxford | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann | year=1997 | isbn=0-7506-3365-4 | page = 423 }}</ref> to 90.48\u00b0 in bismuthane<ref>{{ cite journal | journal = Angew.

(Also, technically, only ammonia and phosphane have the pnictogen in the \u22123 oxidation state because for the rest, the pnictogen is less electronegative than hydrogen.)\n\nCrystal solids featuring pnictogens fully reduced include [[yttrium nitride]], [[calcium phosphide]], [[sodium arsenide]], [[indium antimonide]], and even [[double salt]]s like [[aluminium gallium indium phosphide]]. These include [[III-V_semiconductors]], including [[gallium arsenide]], the second-most widely-used semiconductor after silicon.\n\n=====+3 oxidation state=====\n{{see also|nitrite|phosphite|arsenite|antimonite|bismuthite}}\nNitrogen forms a limited number of stable III compounds. [[Nitrogen(III) oxide]] can only be isolated at low temperatures, and [[nitrous acid]] is unstable. [[Nitrogen trifluoride]] is the only stable nitrogen trihalide, with [[nitrogen trichloride]], [[nitrogen tribromide]] and [[nitrogen triiodide]] being explosive\u2014nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it. Phosphorus forms [[Phosphorus trioxide|a +III oxide]] which is stable at room temperature, [[phosphorous acid]], and [[Phosphorus_halide#Oxidation_state_+3_(PX3)|several trihalides]], although the triiodide is unstable. Arsenic forms +III compounds with oxygen as [[arsenite]]s, [[arsenous acid]], and [[arsenic(III) oxide]], and it forms all four trihalides. Antimony forms [[Antimony trioxide|antimony(III) oxide]] and [[antimonite]] but not oxyacids. Its trihalides, [[antimony trifluoride]], [[antimony trichloride]], [[antimony tribromide]], and [[antimony triiodide]], like all pnictogen trihalides, each have [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].\n\nThe +3 oxidation state is bismuth's most common oxidation state because its ability to form the +5 oxidation state is hindered by [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic properties on heavier elements]], effects that are even more pronounced concerning moscovium. Bismuth(III) forms [[Bismuth(III) oxide|an oxide]], [[Bismuth oxychloride|an oxychloride]], [[Bismuth oxynitrate|an oxynitrate]], and [[Bismuth(III) sulfide|a sulfide]]. Moscovium(III) is predicted to behave similarly to bismuth(III). Moscovium is predicted to form all four trihalides, of which all but the trifluoride are predicted to be soluble in water.<!-- Could someone please copy the BFricke reference from [[moscovium]]? I couldn't find the defining instance. --> It is also predicted to form an oxychloride and oxybromide in the +III oxidation state.\n\n=====+5 oxidation state=====\n{{see also|nitrate|phosphate|arsenate|antimonate|bismuthate}}\nFor nitrogen, the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of molecules like [[dinitrogen pentoxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]], as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the electrons to be shared almost evenly.{{clarify|date=August 2019}} Pnictogen compounds with [[coordination number]]&nbsp;5 are [[hypervalent molecule|hypervalent]]. [[Nitrogen pentafluoride|Nitrogen(V) fluoride]] is only theoretical and has not been synthesized. The \"true\" +5 state is more common for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], and [[antimony]], as shown in their oxides, [[phosphorus(V) oxide]], [[arsenic(V) oxide]], and [[antimony(V) oxide]], and their fluorides, [[phosphorus pentafluoride|phosphorus(V) fluoride]], [[arsenic pentafluoride|arsenic(V) fluoride]], [[antimony pentafluoride|antimony(V) fluoride]]. At least two also form related fluoride-anions, [[hexafluorophosphate]] and [[hexafluoroantimonate]], that function as [[non-coordinating anions]]. Phosphorus even forms mixed oxide-halides, known as [[oxyhalides]], like [[phosphorus oxychloride]], and mixed pentahalides, like [[phosphorus trifluorodichloride]]. Pentamethylpnictogen(V) compounds exist for [[Pentamethylarsenic|arsenic]], [[Pentamethylantimony|antimony]], and [[Pentamethylbismuth|bismuth]]. However, for bismuth, the +5 oxidation state becomes rare due to the [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic stabilization]] of the 6s orbitals known as the [[inert pair effect]], so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. This causes [[bismuth(V) oxide]] to be unstable<ref>{{cite book | title = Concise encyclopedia chemistry | url = https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope00eagl | url-access = registration | first1 = Thomas|last1 = Scott | first2 = Mary|last2 = Eagleson | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | date = 1994 | isbn = 978-3-11-011451-5 | page = [https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope00eagl/page/136 136]}}</ref> and [[bismuth pentafluoride|bismuth(V) fluoride]] to be more reactive than the other pnictogen pentafluorides, making it an extremely powerful [[fluorinating agent]].<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|pages=561\u2013563}}</ref> This effect is even more pronounced for moscovium, prohibiting it from attaining a +5 oxidation state.\n\n=====Other oxidation states=====\n* Nitrogen forms [[Nitrogen oxide|a variety of compounds with oxygen]] in which the nitrogen can take on a variety of oxidation states, including +II, +IV, and even some [[mixed-valence compound]]s and very unstable [[nitrate radical|+VI]] oxidation state.\n* In [[hydrazine]], [[diphosphane]], and organic derivatives of the two, the nitrogen/phosphorus atoms have the \u22122 oxidation state. Likewise, [[diimide]], which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other, and [[Diazene|its organic derivatives]] have nitrogen in the oxidation state of \u22121.\n** Similarly, [[realgar]] has arsenic-arsenic bonds, so the arsenic's oxidation state is +II.\n** A corresponding compound for antimony is Sb<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, where the antimony's oxidation state is +II.\n* Phosphorus has the +1 oxidation state in [[hypophosphorous acid]] and the +4 oxidation state in [[hypophosphoric acid]].\n* [[Antimony tetroxide]] is a [[mixed-valence compound]], where half of the antimony atoms are in the +3 oxidation state, and the other half are in the +5 oxidation state.\n* It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons, as the [[binding energy]] of the lone 7p<sub>3/2</sub> electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons. This is predicted to cause +I to be a common oxidation state for moscovium, although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=O.

In the 1760s two scientists, [[Henry Cavendish]] and [[Joseph Priestley]], isolated nitrogen from air, but neither realized the presence of an undiscovered element. It was not until several years later, in 1772, that [[Daniel Rutherford]] realized that the gas was indeed nitrogen.<ref name = \"Emsley\">{{Citation|last = Emsley|first = John|title = Nature's Building Blocks|year = 2011|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7}}</ref>\n\nThe scientist [[Hennig Brandt]] first discovered phosphorus in Hamburg in 1669. Brandt produced the element by heating evaporated urine and condensing the resulting phosphorus vapor in water. Brandt initially thought that he had discovered the [[Philosopher's Stone]], but eventually realized that this was not the case.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nArsenic compounds have been known for at least 5000 years, and the ancient Greek [[Theophrastus]] recognized the arsenic minerals called [[realgar]] and [[orpiment]]. Elemental arsenic was discovered in the 13th century by [[Albertus Magnus]].<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nAntimony was well known to the ancients.

The antimony mineral [[stibnite]] may have been a component of [[Greek fire]].<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nBismuth was first discovered by an [[alchemy|alchemist]] in 1400. Within 80 years of bismuth's discovery, it had applications in [[printing]] and decorated [[caskets]]. The [[Incas]] were also using bismuth in knives by 1500.

In [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] and the old IUPAC systems it was called '''Group V<small>A</small>''' and '''Group V<small>B</small>''' respectively (pronounced \"group five A\" and \"group five B\", \"V\" for the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] 5).<ref name=Fluck1988>{{cite journal|last=Fluck|first=E|title=New notations in the periodic table |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=431\u20136 |year=1988 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1988/pdf/6003x0431.pdf |doi=10.1351/pac198860030431}}</ref> In the field of [[semiconductor]] physics, it is still usually called '''Group V'''.<ref name=Adachi2005>{{cite book |editor-last=Adachi |editor-first=S. |title=Properties of Group-IV, III-V and II-VI Semiconductors |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |year=2005 |isbn=978-0470090329 |series=Wiley Series in Materials for Electronic & Optoelectronic Applications |volume=15 |bibcode=2005pgii.book.....A}}</ref> The \"five\" (\"V\") in the historical names comes from the \"[[valence (chemistry)|pentavalency]]\" of nitrogen, reflected by the [[stoichiometry]] of [[Chemical compound|compounds]] such as N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.

They are therefore 3&nbsp;electrons short of filling their outermost electron shell in their non-[[ion]]ized state. The Russell\u2013Saunders [[term symbol]] of the ground state in all elements in the group is <sup>4</sup>S<sub>{{frac|3|2}}</sub>.\n\nThe most important elements of this group are ''[[nitrogen]]'' (N), which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air, and ''[[phosphorus]]'' (P), which, like nitrogen, is essential to all known forms of life.\n\n====Compounds====\n<!-- For those who are considering expanding this section, I recommend reading the first paragraph of [[Moscovium#Chemical]], which is a good summary of the chemical behavior of the entire group, first. -->\nBinary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as '''pnictides'''. Pnictide compounds tend to be [[exotic compound|exotic]]. Various properties that some pnictides have include being [[diamagnetic]] and [[paramagnetic]] at room temperature, being transparent, and generating electricity when heated. Other pnictides include the ternary rare-earth main-group variety of pnictides. These are in the form of RE<sub>a</sub>M<sub>b</sub>Pn<sub>c</sub>, where M is a [[carbon group]] or [[boron group]] element and Pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen. These compounds are between [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bond|covalent]] compounds and thus have unusual bonding properties.<ref name=\"chm.bris.ac.uk\">[http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/pnictogen/pnictogenh.htm \"Pnicogen \u2013 Molecule of the Month\"]. University of Bristol</ref>\n\nThese elements are also noted for their [[chemical stability|stability]] in compounds due to their tendency for forming double and triple [[covalent bond]]s. This is the property of these elements which leads to their potential [[toxicity]], most evident in phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. When these substances react with various chemicals of the body, they create strong [[free radicals]] not easily processed by the liver, where they accumulate.  Paradoxically, it is this strong bonding which causes nitrogen and bismuth's reduced toxicity (when in molecules), as these form strong bonds with other atoms which are difficult to split, creating very unreactive molecules. For example, N<sub>2</sub>, the [[diatomic]] form of nitrogen, is used as an inert gas in situations where using [[argon]] or another [[noble gas]] would be too expensive.\n\nFormation of multiple bonds is facilitated by their ''five'' valence electrons whereas the [[octet rule]] permits a pnictogen for accepting three electrons on covalent bonding. Because 5&nbsp;{{abbr|>|greater than}}&nbsp;3, it leaves unused two electrons in a [[lone pair]] unless there is a positive charge around (like in [[ammonium|{{chem2|NH4+}}]]). When a pnictogen forms only three [[single bond]]s, effects of the lone pair typically result in [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].\n\n====Oxidation states====\nThe light pnictogens (nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic) tend to form \u22123 charges when reduced, completing their octet. When oxidized or ionized, pnictogens typically take an oxidation state of +3 (by losing all three p-shell electrons in the valence shell) or +5 (by losing all three p-shell and both s-shell electrons in the valence shell). However heavier pnictogens are more likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the s-shell electrons becoming more stabalised.<ref name=Boudreaux>Boudreaux, Kevin A.

(Also, technically, only ammonia and phosphane have the pnictogen in the \u22123 oxidation state because for the rest, the pnictogen is less electronegative than hydrogen.)\n\nCrystal solids featuring pnictogens fully reduced include [[yttrium nitride]], [[calcium phosphide]], [[sodium arsenide]], [[indium antimonide]], and even [[double salt]]s like [[aluminium gallium indium phosphide]]. These include [[III-V_semiconductors]], including [[gallium arsenide]], the second-most widely-used semiconductor after silicon.\n\n=====+3 oxidation state=====\n{{see also|nitrite|phosphite|arsenite|antimonite|bismuthite}}\nNitrogen forms a limited number of stable III compounds. [[Nitrogen(III) oxide]] can only be isolated at low temperatures, and [[nitrous acid]] is unstable. [[Nitrogen trifluoride]] is the only stable nitrogen trihalide, with [[nitrogen trichloride]], [[nitrogen tribromide]] and [[nitrogen triiodide]] being explosive\u2014nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it. Phosphorus forms [[Phosphorus trioxide|a +III oxide]] which is stable at room temperature, [[phosphorous acid]], and [[Phosphorus_halide#Oxidation_state_+3_(PX3)|several trihalides]], although the triiodide is unstable. Arsenic forms +III compounds with oxygen as [[arsenite]]s, [[arsenous acid]], and [[arsenic(III) oxide]], and it forms all four trihalides. Antimony forms [[Antimony trioxide|antimony(III) oxide]] and [[antimonite]] but not oxyacids. Its trihalides, [[antimony trifluoride]], [[antimony trichloride]], [[antimony tribromide]], and [[antimony triiodide]], like all pnictogen trihalides, each have [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].\n\nThe +3 oxidation state is bismuth's most common oxidation state because its ability to form the +5 oxidation state is hindered by [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic properties on heavier elements]], effects that are even more pronounced concerning moscovium. Bismuth(III) forms [[Bismuth(III) oxide|an oxide]], [[Bismuth oxychloride|an oxychloride]], [[Bismuth oxynitrate|an oxynitrate]], and [[Bismuth(III) sulfide|a sulfide]]. Moscovium(III) is predicted to behave similarly to bismuth(III). Moscovium is predicted to form all four trihalides, of which all but the trifluoride are predicted to be soluble in water.<!-- Could someone please copy the BFricke reference from [[moscovium]]? I couldn't find the defining instance. --> It is also predicted to form an oxychloride and oxybromide in the +III oxidation state.\n\n=====+5 oxidation state=====\n{{see also|nitrate|phosphate|arsenate|antimonate|bismuthate}}\nFor nitrogen, the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of molecules like [[dinitrogen pentoxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]], as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the electrons to be shared almost evenly.{{clarify|date=August 2019}} Pnictogen compounds with [[coordination number]]&nbsp;5 are [[hypervalent molecule|hypervalent]]. [[Nitrogen pentafluoride|Nitrogen(V) fluoride]] is only theoretical and has not been synthesized. The \"true\" +5 state is more common for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], and [[antimony]], as shown in their oxides, [[phosphorus(V) oxide]], [[arsenic(V) oxide]], and [[antimony(V) oxide]], and their fluorides, [[phosphorus pentafluoride|phosphorus(V) fluoride]], [[arsenic pentafluoride|arsenic(V) fluoride]], [[antimony pentafluoride|antimony(V) fluoride]]. At least two also form related fluoride-anions, [[hexafluorophosphate]] and [[hexafluoroantimonate]], that function as [[non-coordinating anions]]. Phosphorus even forms mixed oxide-halides, known as [[oxyhalides]], like [[phosphorus oxychloride]], and mixed pentahalides, like [[phosphorus trifluorodichloride]]. Pentamethylpnictogen(V) compounds exist for [[Pentamethylarsenic|arsenic]], [[Pentamethylantimony|antimony]], and [[Pentamethylbismuth|bismuth]]. However, for bismuth, the +5 oxidation state becomes rare due to the [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic stabilization]] of the 6s orbitals known as the [[inert pair effect]], so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. This causes [[bismuth(V) oxide]] to be unstable<ref>{{cite book | title = Concise encyclopedia chemistry | url = https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope00eagl | url-access = registration | first1 = Thomas|last1 = Scott | first2 = Mary|last2 = Eagleson | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | date = 1994 | isbn = 978-3-11-011451-5 | page = [https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope00eagl/page/136 136]}}</ref> and [[bismuth pentafluoride|bismuth(V) fluoride]] to be more reactive than the other pnictogen pentafluorides, making it an extremely powerful [[fluorinating agent]].<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|pages=561\u2013563}}</ref> This effect is even more pronounced for moscovium, prohibiting it from attaining a +5 oxidation state.\n\n=====Other oxidation states=====\n* Nitrogen forms [[Nitrogen oxide|a variety of compounds with oxygen]] in which the nitrogen can take on a variety of oxidation states, including +II, +IV, and even some [[mixed-valence compound]]s and very unstable [[nitrate radical|+VI]] oxidation state.\n* In [[hydrazine]], [[diphosphane]], and organic derivatives of the two, the nitrogen/phosphorus atoms have the \u22122 oxidation state. Likewise, [[diimide]], which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other, and [[Diazene|its organic derivatives]] have nitrogen in the oxidation state of \u22121.\n** Similarly, [[realgar]] has arsenic-arsenic bonds, so the arsenic's oxidation state is +II.\n** A corresponding compound for antimony is Sb<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, where the antimony's oxidation state is +II.\n* Phosphorus has the +1 oxidation state in [[hypophosphorous acid]] and the +4 oxidation state in [[hypophosphoric acid]].\n* [[Antimony tetroxide]] is a [[mixed-valence compound]], where half of the antimony atoms are in the +3 oxidation state, and the other half are in the +5 oxidation state.\n* It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons, as the [[binding energy]] of the lone 7p<sub>3/2</sub> electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons. This is predicted to cause +I to be a common oxidation state for moscovium, although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=O.

The term \"pnictogen\" was suggested by the Dutch chemist [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] in the early 1950s. It is also spelled \"pnicogen\" or \"pnigogen\". The term \"pnicogen\" is rarer than the term \"pnictogen\", and the ratio of academic research papers using \"pnictogen\" to those using \"pnicogen\" is 2.5 to 1.<ref name=\"chm.bris.ac.uk\"/> It comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] \u03c0\u03bd\u03b9\u03b3- (choke, strangle), and thus the word \"pnictogen\" is also a reference to the Dutch and German names for nitrogen (''Stikstoff'', and ''Stickstoff'' respectively, \"suffocating substance\": i.e., substance in air, unsupportive of breathing). Hence, \"pnictogen\" could be translated as \"suffocation maker\". The word \"pnictide\" also comes from the same root.<ref name=\"pnictogen-origin\">{{cite journal |last1=Girolami |first1=Gregory S. |year=2009 |title=Origin of the Terms Pnictogen and Pnictide |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=86 |issue=10 |pages=1200 |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |doi=10.1021/ed086p1200 |bibcode = 2009JChEd..86.1200G }}</ref>\n\nThe name '''pentels''' (from Greek ''\u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5'', ''p\u00e9nte'', five) also was at one time stood for this group.<ref name=Holleman>{{Holleman&Wiberg|page=586}}</ref>\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:Stickstoff-gruppe.jpg|right|thumb|A collection of pnictogen samples]]\n\nNitrogen makes up 25 parts per million of the [[earth's crust]], 5 parts per million of soil on average, 100 to 500 parts per trillion of seawater, and 78% of dry air. The majority of nitrogen on earth is in the form of nitrogen gas, but some [[nitrate mineral]]s do exist. Nitrogen makes up 2.5% of a typical human by weight.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nPhosphorus makes up 0.1% of the earth's crust, making it the 11th [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most abundant element there]]. Phosphorus makes up 0.65 parts per million of soil, and 15 to 60 parts per billion of seawater. There are 200 million metric tons of accessible [[phosphates]] on earth. Phosphorus makes up 1.1% of a typical human by weight.<ref name=Emsley/> Phosphorus occurs in minerals of the [[Apatite|apatite]] family which are the main components of the phosphate rocks.\n\nArsenic makes up 1.5 parts per million of the earth's crust, making it the 53rd most abundant element there. The soils contain 1 to 10 parts per million of arsenic, and seawater contains 1.6 parts per billion of arsenic. Arsenic makes up 100 parts per billion of a typical human by weight. Some arsenic exists in elemental form, but most arsenic is found in the arsenic minerals [[orpiment]], [[realgar]], [[arsenopyrite]], and [[enargite]].<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nAntimony makes up 0.2 parts per million of the earth's crust, making it the 63rd most abundant element there. The soils contain 1 part per million of antimony on average, and seawater contains 300 parts per trillion of antimony on average. A typical human contains 28 parts per billion of antimony by weight. Some elemental antimony occurs in silver deposits.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nBismuth makes up 48 parts per billion of the earth's crust, making it the 70th most abundant element there. The soils contain approximately 0.25 parts per million of bismuth, and seawater contains 400 parts per trillion of bismuth. Bismuth most commonly occurs as the mineral [[bismuthinite]], but bismuth also occurs in elemental form or in sulfide ores.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nMoscovium is produced several atoms at a time in particle accelerators.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\n==Production==\n===Nitrogen===\nNitrogen can be produced by [[fractional distillation]] of air.<ref name=BritannicaN>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416180/nitrogen-N \"nitrogen (N) | chemical element\"].

''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.</ref>\n\n===Arsenic===\nMost arsenic is prepared by heating the mineral [[arsenopyrite]] in the presence of air. This forms [[arsenic trioxide|As<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>]], from which arsenic can be extracted via carbon reduction. However, it is also possible to make metallic arsenic by heating arsenopyrite at 650 to 700&nbsp;\u00b0C without oxygen.<ref name=BritannicaAs>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36266/arsenic-As \"arsenic (As) | chemical element\"]. ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.</ref>\n\n===Antimony===\nWith sulfide ores, the method by which antimony is produced depends on the amount of antimony in the raw ore. If the ore contains 25% to 45% antimony by weight, then crude antimony is produced by smelting the ore in a [[blast furnace]]. If the ore contains 45% to 60% antimony by weight, antimony is obtained by heating the ore, also known as liquidation. Ores with more than 60% antimony by weight are chemically displaced with iron shavings from the molten ore, resulting in impure metal.\n\nIf an oxide ore of antimony contains less than 30% antimony by weight, the ore is reduced in a blast furnace. If the ore contains closer to 50% antimony by weight, the ore is instead reduced in a [[reverberatory furnace]].\n\nAntimony ores with mixed sulfides and oxides are smelted in a blast furnace.<ref name=Butterman2003>Butterman, C.; Carlin, Jr., J.F.

[[Nitrates]] occur in some plants, due to bacteria present in the nodes of the plant. This is seen in leguminous plants such as  peas {{clarify|date=October 2015}} or spinach and lettuce.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} A typical 70-kilogram human contains 1.8 kilograms of nitrogen.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nPhosphorus in the form of [[phosphates]] occur in compounds important to life, such as DNA and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Humans consume approximately 1 grams of phosphorus per day.<ref name=NLM002424>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002424.htm Phosphorus in diet]. nlm.nih.gov</ref> Phosphorus is found in foods such as fish, liver, turkey, chicken, and eggs. Phosphate deficiency is a problem known as [[hypophosphatemia]]. A typical 70-kilogram human contains 480 grams of phosphorus.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nArsenic promotes growth in chickens and rats, and may be [[Micronutrient|essential for humans in small quantities]]. Arsenic has been shown to be helpful in metabolizing the amino acid [[arginine]]. There are 7 milligrams of arsenic in a typical 70-kilogram human.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nAntimony is not known to have a biological role. Plants take up only trace amounts of antimony. There are approximately 2 milligrams of antimony in a typical 70-kilogram human.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nBismuth is not known to have a biological role. Humans ingest on average less than 20 micrograms of bismuth per day. There is less than 500 micrograms of bismuth in a typical 70-kilogram human.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\n===Toxicity===\nNitrogen gas is completely [[nontoxic]], but breathing in pure nitrogen gas is deadly, because it causes [[nitrogen asphyxiation]].<ref name = \"The Disappearing Spoon\"/> The buildup of nitrogen bubbles in the blood, such as those that may occur during [[scuba diving]], can cause a condition known as the \"bends\" ([[decompression sickness]]). Many nitrogen compounds such as [[hydrogen cyanide]] and nitrogen-based [[explosive]]s are also highly dangerous.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\n[[White phosphorus]], an [[allotrope]] of phosphorus, is toxic, with 1 milligram per kilo bodyweight being a lethal dose.<ref name = \"The Elements\"/> White phosphorus usually kills humans within a week of ingestion by attacking the [[liver]]. Breathing in phosphorus in its gaseous form can cause an [[industrial disease]] called \"[[phossy jaw]]\", which eats away the jawbone. White phosphorus is also highly flammable. Some organophosphorus compounds can fatally block certain [[enzyme]]s in the human body.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nElemental arsenic is toxic, as are many of its [[inorganic compound]]s; however some of its organic compounds can promote growth in chickens.<ref name = \"The Elements\"/> The lethal dose of arsenic for a typical adult is 200 milligrams and can cause diarrhea, vomiting, colic, dehydration, and coma. Death from arsenic poisoning typically occurs within a day.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nAntimony is mildly toxic.<ref name = \"The Disappearing Spoon\"/> Additionally, [[wine]] steeped in antimony containers can [[Emetic|induce vomiting]].<ref name = \"The Elements\"/> When taken in large doses, antimony causes [[vomiting]] in a victim, who then appears to recover before dying several days later. Antimony attaches itself to certain enzymes and is difficult to dislodge. [[Stibine]], or SbH<sub>3</sub> is far more toxic than pure antimony.<ref name=Emsley/>\n\nBismuth itself is largely [[nontoxic]], although consuming too much of it can damage the liver. Only one person has ever been reported to have died from bismuth poisoning.<ref name=Emsley/> However, consumption of soluble bismuth salts can turn a person's gums black.<ref name=\"The Elements\">{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Theodore|title=The Elements|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nMoscovium is too unstable to conduct any toxicity chemistry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oxypnictide]], including superconductors discovered in 2008.\n*[[Ferropnictide]], including oxypnictide superconductors.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Compact periodic table}}\n{{Navbox periodic table}}\n{{Pnictogens}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Pnictogens| ]]\n[[Category:Periodic table]]\n[[Category:Groups (periodic table)]]\n", "name_user": "71.178.186.131", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Every Pnictogen Metal Is Radioactive.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnictogen"}
