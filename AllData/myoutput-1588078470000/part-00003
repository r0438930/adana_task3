{"title_page": "Relics of Sariputta and Moggallana", "text_new": "[[Image:Moggallana - paranibbana.jpg|thumb|A depiction of Mahamoggallana's death.]]\nThe '''relics of Sariputta and Moggallana''' refers to the cremated remains of the Buddhist disciples [[Sariputta]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: ''\u015a\u0101riputra''; [[Pali]]: ''S\u0101riputta'') and [[Moggallana]] (Sanskrit: ''Maudgaly\u0101yana''; Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''). Sariputta and Moggallana (also called Maha Moggallana) were the two chief disciples of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], often stylized as the right hand and left hand disciples of the Buddha respectively. The two disciples were childhood friends who ordained under the Buddha together and are said to have become enlightened as [[arahants]]. The Buddha declared them his two chief disciples, after which they assumed leadership roles in the Buddha's ministry. Both of the chief disciples died a few months before the Buddha near the ancient Indian city of [[Rajagaha|R\u0101jagaha]] and were cremated. According to Buddhist texts, the cremated remains of the disciples were then enshrined in ''[[Stupa|stupas]]'' at notable monasteries of the time, with Sariputta's remains being enshrined at [[Jetavana|Jetavana monastery]] and Moggallana's remains being enshrined at Ve\u1e37uvana monastery. However, as of 1999 no modern archaeological reports had confirmed this, although in 1851 discoveries were made at other sites.  \n\nIn 1851, British [[archaeologists]] Major [[Alexander Cunningham]] and Captain Fredrick Maisey discovered relics attributed to the chief disciples during excavations of ''stupas'' in the Indian cities of [[Sanchi]] and [[Satdhara]]. Scholars have theorized that the relics were enshrined in ''stupas'' near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths but were redistributed by later Indian kings such as King [[Ashoka|Asoka]]. Following the discovery, the Satdhara relics were sent to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London in 1866, while the Sanchi relics are said to have been lost when a ship carrying the remains sank. Following a Buddhist [[History_of_Buddhism_in_India#Revival_of_Buddhism_in_India|revival movement]] in South Asia in the late 19th century, Buddhist organizations including the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] began pressuring the British government to return the relics to Asia so they can be properly venerated, with the British government eventually conceding. The relics were sent to [[Sri Lanka]] in 1947, where they were on display for almost two years, and then were put on tour around parts of Asia starting in 1949. The relics were then permanently relocated in 1952, with portions of the relics being enshrined at sites in India, Burma and Sri Lanka.  \n\n== Sariputta and Moggallana ==\nSariputta and Moggallana were considered to have been the two chief disciples of the Buddha. Sariputta was considered the disciple who was foremost in [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|wisdom]] and Moggallana was considered the disciple who was foremost in [[Iddhi|psychic powers]].{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=67}} Buddhist texts relate that Sariputta and Moggallana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=411}} After having searched for spiritual truth under different contemporary masters, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples, together described in the ''Mah\u0101pad\u0101na Sutta,'' as \"the chief pair of disciples, the excellent pair\" (Pali: ''s\u0101vakayuga\u1e41 agga\u1e41 bhaddayuga\u1e41'').{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=65}}{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=31-32,57}}{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=1903}} Texts describe that the two friends became [[Arhat|arahants]] and played a key leadership role in the Buddha's ministry, including being tasked with the training of the Buddha's other disciples.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1937|p=}}{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=68-69}} Sariputta was considered the Buddha's right hand disciple, while Moggallana was considered his left hand disciple.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=67}} \n\nAccording to Buddhist texts, Sariputta and Moggallana both died a few months before the Buddha.

However, a 19th century British excavation did result in the discovery of relics attributed to the chief disciples in other locations.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104-105}} In 1851, British [[archaeologists]] Major [[Alexander Cunningham]] and Captain Fredrick Maisey were exploring a site in [[Sanchi Town|Sanchi]], near [[Bhopal]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] in [[India]], which was known for its many [[Sanchi|Buddhist ''stupas'']] dating back to the 3rd century BCE. During the visit, Cunningham and Maisey excavated ''Stupa'' number 3 of the site and discovered an undisturbed chamber with two sandstone boxes. Each of the boxes contained a [[steatite]] casket containing human bone fragments.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106}} The lids of the boxes bore [[Br\u0101hm\u012b|Br\u0101hm\u012b]] script, the southern box bore the inscription ''Sariputasa'', meaning \"(relics) of Sariputta\" while the lid of the northern box bore the inscription ''Maha Mogalanasa'' meaning \"(relics) of Maha Moggallana\", identifying the bone fragments as belonging to the two chief disciples.{{sfn|Le|2010|p=148}}{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=297}} The relative positioning of the boxes also had religious significance. Cunningham states that {{quote|Sariputra and Mahamoggallana were the principal followers of the Buddha, and were usually styled his right and left hand disciples. Their ashes thus preserved after death the same positions to the right and left of Buddha which they had themselves occupied in life.{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=300}}}} According to Cunningham, people in ancient India sat facing the east during religious ceremonies and even used the word east (''para'') for \"front\", as well as the word south (''dakshina'') for \"right\" and the word north (''vami'') for \"left\", meaning the position of Sariputta's casket toward the south symbolized his role as the right hand disciple of the Buddha, while the position of Moggallana's casket toward the north symbolized his position as the left hand disciple of the Buddha.{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=299}} This has also been explained by the fact that the Buddha traditionally sat facing the east, which would make the south his right hand side, and the north his left hand side.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe box attributed to Sariputta contained a round white steatite casket, more than six inches in diameter and three inches in height.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106}}{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=297}} The surface was polished and hard, and the box is believed to have been turned on a [[lathe]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=297}} Surrounding the casket were two pieces of [[sandalwood]], which Cunningham believed was from Sariputta's [[funeral pyre]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=297,305}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=274}} Inside the casket was one single bone fragment nearly one inch in length, and seven beads made up of precious stones and metals.{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=297-298}} The box attributed to Moggallana contained a slightly smaller steatite casket made up of a slightly softer substance. Inside the casket were two bone fragments, the larger one being less than half an inch in length.{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=299}} Each of the caskets had a single ink Br\u0101hm\u012b character inscribed on the inner surface of the lid: the Br\u0101hm\u012b character \"Sa\" (\ud804\udc32\ud804\udc38) on the casket attributed to Sariputta and the Br\u0101hm\u012b character \"Ma\" (\ud804\udc2b) in the casket attributed to Mahamoggallana.{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=299}} Cunningham theorized that the relics were enshrined in ''stupas'' near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of Emperor Asoka, who then redistributed them in ''stupas'' throughout India.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=275}} Scholars have also theorized that a [[Shunga Empire|Sunga]] king may have also done a similar redistribution and built ''stupas'' such as the one in Sanchi to enshrine them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=105-106}} \n\nFollowing the discovery, Cunningham and Maisey excavated several nearby sites. During an excavation at the city of [[Satdhara]] a few miles west of Sanchi, the archaeologists found another pair of steatite relic caskets at Satdhara's ''Stupa'' Number 2. The caskets were smaller than the Sanchi ones, about three inches in diameter and two inches in height, and each contained several human bone fragments. Inscriptions on these caskets also attributed the remains to Sariputta and Moggallana.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=107}}\n\n==Display in Britain==\n{{Buddhism}}\nCunningham and Maisey later divided their findings among each other, with Maisey bringing the Satdh\u0101ra relics to Britain and loaning them to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London in 1866 along with several other artifacts from Asia.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} The relics were eventually purchased by the Museum in 1921 from Maisley's son, whose ownership devolved.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}} Cunningham brought his findings to Britain on two ships, one of which sank, thus the Sanchi relics are believed to have been lost.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277-278}} Historian Torkel Brekke, however, argues that Maisey took all the relics with him, and thus the Sanchi relics went to Britain along with the Satdh\u0101ra ones.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} \n\nIn the late 19th century, a Buddhist [[History_of_Buddhism_in_India#Revival_of_Buddhism_in_India|revival movement]] led by the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] began taking place in South Asia. The revival efforts led several Buddhist organizations to begin pressuring the British government starting in the 1920s to return the relics of the chief disciples to India, where they can be properly venerated.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=109}} In 1937, the British government and Victoria and Albert Museum conceded and agreed to return the relics. However, the transfer was delayed due to the outbreak of [[World War II]], due to fear of the relics being lost in wartime transport.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110}} After the war ended, the transfer was officially made in 1947 with the relics first being transported to predominantly Buddhist [[Sri Lanka]] in accordance with an agreement made with Buddhist organizations.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}}\n\n==Tour of Asia==\nFollowing the transfer of the relics from the British, they were put on display at the [[National Museum of Colombo|Colombo Museum]] in Sri Lanka, where they were visited by an estimated two million people across different faiths.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel090.html#app|title=The Life of Sariputta, compiled and translated from the Pali texts by Nyanaponika Thera.|last=Thera|first=Nyanaponika|date=|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref> The relics remained in Sri Lanka for nearly two years before being transported to Calcutta, India in 1949, where they were formally received by Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and officially handed over to the Maha Bodhi Society of India. The relics were then put on tour around northern India.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}} \n\nIn 1950 the relics were sent to Burma for a two month visit.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-113}} The relics were received in the Burmese city of [[Rangoon]], coinciding with the arrival of other Buddhist relics from Sri Lanka. According to reports of the occasion, most of the city had turned out for the arrival of the relics and the relics received a constant stream of visiting devotees for the month that they were in the city.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-112}} In the second month of the visit, the relics were put on tour around Burma and also received warm welcome throughout the country.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=112-113}} According to art historian Jack Daulton, the visit of the relics to Burma played a significant political role in the country. The newly independent Burmese state promoted a revival of Buddhism in the country during a period of widespread civil strife. The relics helped establish the new Burmese government's legitimacy and had a unifying effect on the country.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=113-114}} After the relics visited Burma, Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] stated that \"at every place where the relics have been exhibited, most of all in the neighborhoods of disturbed areas, public morale greatly improved.\"{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=114}} The relics were also taken for exposition in Nepal, Tibet and Cambodia.{{sfn|Maha Thera Tripitakavagisvaracarya|1892|p=118}}\n\n==Re-enshrinement==\nFollowing the tour of the relics in Burma in 1950, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu asked India for a portion of the relics for Burma to keep permanently. Later that year, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to make a \"permanent loan\" of a portion of the relics to Burma in what was seen as a gesture of goodwill toward its newly independent neighbor.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-121}}  Burma's portion of the relics arrived from Calcutta in 1951, on the same day as some relics from the Buddha himself. Like the first visit, they were received by a large crowd and were put on tour around the Burma. The relics were then housed in a shrine near Botatuang Pagoda, which was destroyed in World War II and was being reconstructed. Although the Burmese government originally intended to house the relics at the Botatuang Pagoda after reconstruction, following the completion of the [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] in 1952, Prime Minister U Nu decided to permanently house them at Kaba Aye Pagoda instead.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-121}} Sri Lanka also obtained a portion of the relics, which were brought from Sanchi in 1952 and kept at the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catholicphilly.com/2015/01/news/world-news/buddhist-center-breaks-tradition-shows-pope-revered-relic/|title=Buddhist center breaks tradition, shows pope revered relic|last=Akkara|first=Anto|date=|website=Catholic Philly|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> The portion of the relics that stayed in India were enshrined in Sanchi, also in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}} \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Ainsworth |first1=William Harrison |title=Ainsworth's Magazine: A Miscellany of Romance, General Literature, & Art |date=1854 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ainsworth_s_Magazine/5j0FAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 |accessdate=19 April 2020 |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.

However, a 19th century British excavation did result in the discovery of relics attributed to the chief disciples in other locations.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104-105}} In 1851, British [[archaeologists]] Major [[Alexander Cunningham]] and Captain Fredrick Maisey were exploring a site in [[Sanchi Town|Sanchi]], near [[Bhopal]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] in [[India]], which was known for its many [[Sanchi|Buddhist ''stupas'']] dating back to the 3rd century BCE. During the visit, Cunningham and Maisey excavated ''Stupa'' number 3 of the site and discovered an undisturbed chamber with two sandstone boxes. Each of the boxes contained a [[steatite]] casket containing human bone fragments.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106}} The lids of the boxes bore [[Br\u0101hm\u012b|Br\u0101hm\u012b]] script, the southern box bore the inscription ''Sariputasa'', meaning \"(relics) of Sariputta\" while the lid of the northern box bore the inscription ''Maha Mogalanasa'' meaning \"(relics) of Maha Moggallana\", identifying the bone fragments as belonging to the two chief disciples.{{sfn|Le|2010|p=148}}{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=297}} The relative positioning of the boxes also had religious significance. Cunningham states that {{quote|Sariputra and Mahamoggallana were the principal followers of the Buddha, and were usually styled his right and left hand disciples. Their ashes thus preserved after death the same positions to the right and left of Buddha which they had themselves occupied in life.{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=300}}}} According to Cunningham, people in ancient India sat facing the east during religious ceremonies and even used the word east (''para'') for \"front\", as well as the word south (''dakshina'') for \"right\" and the word north (''vami'') for \"left\", meaning the position of Sariputta's casket toward the south symbolized his role as the right hand disciple of the Buddha, while the position of Moggallana's casket toward the north symbolized his position as the left hand disciple of the Buddha.{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=299}} This has also been explained by the fact that the Buddha traditionally sat facing the east, which would make the south his right hand side, and the north his left hand side.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe box attributed to Sariputta contained a round white steatite casket, more than six inches in diameter and three inches in height.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106}}{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=297}} The surface was polished and hard, and the box is believed to have been turned on a [[lathe]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=297}} Surrounding the casket were two pieces of [[sandalwood]], which Cunningham believed was from Sariputta's [[funeral pyre]].{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=297,305}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=274}} Inside the casket was one single bone fragment nearly one inch in length, and seven beads made up of precious stones and metals.{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=297-298}} The box attributed to Moggallana contained a slightly smaller steatite casket made up of a slightly softer substance. Inside the casket were two bone fragments, the larger one being less than half an inch in length.{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=299}} Each of the caskets had a single ink Br\u0101hm\u012b character inscribed on the inner surface of the lid: the Br\u0101hm\u012b character \"Sa\" (\ud804\udc32\ud804\udc38) on the casket attributed to Sariputta and the Br\u0101hm\u012b character \"Ma\" (\ud804\udc2b) in the casket attributed to Mahamoggallana.{{sfn|Cunningham|1854|p=299}} Cunningham theorized that the relics were enshrined in ''stupas'' near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of Emperor Asoka, who then redistributed them in ''stupas'' throughout India.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=275}} Scholars have also theorized that a [[Shunga Empire|Sunga]] king may have also done a similar redistribution and built ''stupas'' such as the one in Sanchi to enshrine them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=105-106}} \n\nFollowing the discovery, Cunningham and Maisey excavated several nearby sites. During an excavation at the city of [[Satdhara]] a few miles west of Sanchi, the archaeologists found another pair of steatite relic caskets at Satdhara's ''Stupa'' Number 2. The caskets were smaller than the Sanchi ones, about three inches in diameter and two inches in height, and each contained several human bone fragments. Inscriptions on these caskets also attributed the remains to Sariputta and Moggallana.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=107}}\n\n==Display in Britain==\n{{Buddhism}}\nCunningham and Maisey later divided their findings among each other, with Maisey bringing the Satdh\u0101ra relics to Britain and loaning them to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London in 1866 along with several other artifacts from Asia.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} The relics were eventually purchased by the Museum in 1921 from Maisley's son, whose ownership devolved.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}} Cunningham brought his findings to Britain on two ships, one of which sank, thus the Sanchi relics are believed to have been lost.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277-278}} Historian Torkel Brekke, however, argues that Maisey took all the relics with him, and thus the Sanchi relics went to Britain along with the Satdh\u0101ra ones.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} \n\nIn the late 19th century, a Buddhist [[History_of_Buddhism_in_India#Revival_of_Buddhism_in_India|revival movement]] led by the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] began taking place in South Asia. The revival efforts led several Buddhist organizations to begin pressuring the British government starting in the 1920s to return the relics of the chief disciples to India, where they can be properly venerated.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=109}} In 1937, the British government and Victoria and Albert Museum conceded and agreed to return the relics. However, the transfer was delayed due to the outbreak of [[World War II]], due to fear of the relics being lost in wartime transport.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110}} After the war ended, the transfer was officially made in 1947 with the relics first being transported to predominantly Buddhist [[Sri Lanka]] in accordance with an agreement made with Buddhist organizations.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}}\n\n==Tour of Asia==\nFollowing the transfer of the relics from the British, they were put on display at the [[National Museum of Colombo|Colombo Museum]] in Sri Lanka, where they were visited by an estimated two million people across different faiths.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel090.html#app|title=The Life of Sariputta, compiled and translated from the Pali texts by Nyanaponika Thera.|last=Thera|first=Nyanaponika|date=|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref> The relics remained in Sri Lanka for nearly two years before being transported to Calcutta, India in 1949, where they were formally received by Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and officially handed over to the Maha Bodhi Society of India. The relics were then put on tour around northern India.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}} \n\nIn 1950 the relics were sent to Burma for a two month visit.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-113}} The relics were received in the Burmese city of [[Rangoon]], coinciding with the arrival of other Buddhist relics from Sri Lanka. According to reports of the occasion, most of the city had turned out for the arrival of the relics and the relics received a constant stream of visiting devotees for the month that they were in the city.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-112}} In the second month of the visit, the relics were put on tour around Burma and also received warm welcome throughout the country.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=112-113}} According to art historian Jack Daulton, the visit of the relics to Burma played a significant political role in the country. The newly independent Burmese state promoted a revival of Buddhism in the country during a period of widespread civil strife. The relics helped establish the new Burmese government's legitimacy and had a unifying effect on the country.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=113-114}} After the relics visited Burma, Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] stated that \"at every place where the relics have been exhibited, most of all in the neighborhoods of disturbed areas, public morale greatly improved.\"{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=114}} The relics were also taken for exposition in Nepal, Tibet and Cambodia.{{sfn|Maha Thera Tripitakavagisvaracarya|1892|p=118}}\n\n==Re-enshrinement==\nFollowing the tour of the relics in Burma in 1950, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu asked India for a portion of the relics for Burma to keep permanently. Later that year, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to make a \"permanent loan\" of a portion of the relics to Burma in what was seen as a gesture of goodwill toward its newly independent neighbor.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-121}}  Burma's portion of the relics arrived from Calcutta in 1951, on the same day as some relics from the Buddha himself. Like the first visit, they were received by a large crowd and were put on tour around the Burma. The relics were then housed in a shrine near Botatuang Pagoda, which was destroyed in World War II and was being reconstructed. Although the Burmese government originally intended to house the relics at the Botatuang Pagoda after reconstruction, following the completion of the [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] in 1952, Prime Minister U Nu decided to permanently house them at Kaba Aye Pagoda instead.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-121}} Sri Lanka also obtained a portion of the relics, which were brought from Sanchi in 1952 and kept at the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catholicphilly.com/2015/01/news/world-news/buddhist-center-breaks-tradition-shows-pope-revered-relic/|title=Buddhist center breaks tradition, shows pope revered relic|last=Akkara|first=Anto|date=|website=Catholic Philly|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> The portion of the relics that stayed in India were enshrined in Sanchi, also in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}} \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Ainsworth |first1=William Harrison |title=Ainsworth's Magazine: A Miscellany of Romance, General Literature, & Art |date=1854 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ainsworth_s_Magazine/5j0FAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 |accessdate=19 April 2020 |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.
