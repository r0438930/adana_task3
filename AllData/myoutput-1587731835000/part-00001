It is best known for its pre-World War II luxury cars and aviation engines. In 1923, its French subsidiary became a semi-autonomous partnership with the Spanish parent company. In 1946, the Spanish parent company sold all its Spanish automotive assets to [[Enasa]]. In 1968, the French arm was taken over by the aerospace company [[Snecma]], now a part of the French [[Safran|Safran Group]] and [[Peralada Group]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forum-auto.com/automobiles-mythiques-exception/section5/sujet381347.htm |title=La Hispano-Suiza \u2013 Anciennes Oldies \u2013 FORUM Anciennes \u2013 FORUM auto mythiques et d'exception |publisher=Forum-auto.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613010259/http://www.forum-auto.com/automobiles-mythiques-exception/section5/sujet381347.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nIn 1898 a Spanish artillery captain, [[Emilio de la Cuadra]], started electric automobile production in [[Barcelona]] under the name of '''La Cuadra'''. In [[Paris]], De la Cuadra met the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] engineer [[Marc Birkigt]] and hired him to work for the company in Spain. Under his direction two types of La Cuadra gasoline-powered engine cars were started immediately, one equipped with a 4.5 hp single-cylinder explosion engine and another 7-cylinder two-cylinder model, 5 hp. In 1900, these two explosion engines were the first designed and built in Spain by La Cuadra from a Birkigt design. These cars had four wheels, the previous two directional, clutch mechanisms, 3-speed gearbox, chain drive and suspension by crossbows. Two complete vehicles were completed, and there were some more under construction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aeha.cat/hispano-suiza|title=Hispano Suiza|website=Associaci\u00f3 d'Estudis His\u00f2rics de l'automoci\u00f3 {{!}} AEHA|language=es-ES|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> At some point in 1902, the ownership changed hands to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Castro Fern\u00e1ndez and became '''''F\u00e1brica Hispano-Suiza de Autom\u00f3viles''''' (''Spanish-Swiss Automobile Factory'') but this company went [[bankrupt]] in December 1903.\n\nYet another restructuring took place in 1904, creating '''''La Hispano-Suiza F\u00e1brica de Autom\u00f3viles''''', under Castro's direction, also based in Barcelona. Four new engines were introduced in the next year and a half; a 3.8-litre and 7.4-litre four-cylinder and a pair of big six-cylinder engines were produced. This company managed to avoid bankruptcy and its largest operations remained in Barcelona until 1946, where cars, trucks, buses, aero engines and weapons were produced. Other factories in Spain were at [[Ripoll]], [[Seville]], and [[Guadalajara (Spain)|Guadalajara]].\n\nIn 1910 [[Jean Chassagne]] competed with a Hispano-Suiza together with works drivers Pilleveridier and Zucarelli in the Coupe des Voiturettes Boulogne and the Catalan Cup Races, gaining second and fourth places respectively. France was soon proving to be a larger market for Hispano-Suiza's luxury cars than Spain. In 1911, an assembly factory called '''''Hispano France''''' began operating in the Paris suburb of [[Levallois-Perret]]. Production was moved to larger factories at [[Bois-Colombes]], under the name Hispano-Suiza in 1914 and soon became Hispano-Suiza's main plant for producing the largest, most costly models.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Hispano Suiza 8 A Brussel.jpg|thumb|A Brussels museum-preserved Hispano-Suiza HS.8A SOHC aviation engine from World War I]]\nWith the start of [[World War I]], Hispano-Suiza turned to the design and production of [[aircraft engine]]s under the direction of [[Marc Birkigt]]. His chief engineer during this period was another Swiss, [[Louis Massuger]]. Traditionally, aircraft engines were manufactured by machining separate steel cylinders and then bolting these assemblies directly to the crankcase. Birkigt's [[Hispano-Suiza 8|novel solution]] called for the engine block to be formed from a single piece of cast aluminum, and into which thin steel liners were secured. Manufacturing an engine in this way simplified construction and resulted in a lighter, yet stronger more durable engine. Thus, Birkigt's new construction method created the first practical, and what are commonly known today as, \"cast block\" engines. His aluminum cast block V-8 design was also noteworthy for incorporating overhead camshafts, propeller reduction gearing and other desirable features that would not appear together on competitors' engines until the late 1920s. Another major design feature, for the later HS.8B line was the use of a hollow propeller shaft for [[Hispano-Suiza 8#Variants|both the 8B and 8C gear-reduction versions]], which when used for the HS.8C versions specifically engineered to accommodate one, to allow heavy calibre (usually 37&nbsp;mm) projectiles firing through the hollow propeller shaft, avoiding the need for a [[synchronization gear]], a feature used in future Hispano-Suiza military engines. Hispano-Suiza's aero engines, produced at its own factories and under license, became the most commonly used aero engines in the French and British air forces, powering over half the alliance's fighter aircraft.<ref>Browne, T.C. \"Retrospect: 1924 Hispano-Suiza H6c Speedster\", ''Motor Trend'', 4/84, p.118.</ref>\n\n===1918\u20131936===\n[[File:Hispano Suiza 1918.jpg|thumb|Share of the Hispano-Suiza Fabrica de Automoviles SA, issued December 21, 1918]]\nAfter World War I, Hispano-Suiza returned to automobile manufacturing and in 1919 they introduced the [[Hispano-Suiza H6]]. The H6 featured an inline 6-cylinder [[overhead camshaft engine]] based on the features of its V8 aluminium World War I aircraft engines and had coachwork done by well known coachbuilders like [[Hibbard & Darrin]] and [[D'Ieteren]].<ref>[[Georgano, G. N.]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''. London: Grange-Universal, 1985</ref>\n\nLicences for Hispano-Suiza patents were much in demand from prestige car manufacturers world-wide. [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] used a number of Hispano-Suiza patents. For instance, for many years Rolls Royce installed Hispano-Suiza designed power brakes in its vehicles.\n\nIn 1923 the French arm of Hispano-Suiza was incorporated as the '''''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise Hispano-Suiza''''', the Spanish parent company retaining control with 71% of the share capital. The French subsidiary was granted a large degree of financial and project independence to bring design and production direction into closer contact with its main markets but overall direction remained at Barcelona. This arrangement increased the importance of the Bois-Colombes plant near Paris as Hispano-Suiza's premier luxury car plant, and while the Spanish operations continued to produce luxury cars, mostly the smaller, less expensive models, production in Spain moved increasingly to the production of buses, trucks, and aircraft engines at several plants located around the country.\n\nThrough the 1920s and into the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza built a series of luxury cars with overhead camshaft engines of increasing performance. On the other hand, in the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza's V-12 car engines reverted to pushrod valve actuation to reduce engine noise.\n\nDuring this time, Hispano-Suiza released the 37.2 Hispano-Suiza car built at the Bois-Colombes works.[[File:Hispano-suiza-hood-ornament.JPG|thumb|right|Hispano-Suiza stork hood ornament.]]\n\nThe mascot statuette atop the radiator after World War I was the [[stork]], the symbol of the French province of [[Alsace]], taken from the squadron emblem painted on the side of a Hispano-Suiza powered fighter aircraft that had been flown by the World War I French ace [[Georges Guynemer]].\n\nThe [[Hispano-Suiza T49]] was also designed and made by the Spanish company between 1924 and 1944; it was the Spanish version of the French H6B model with a 6-cylinder engine of 8,000 cm3, 160 hp and a maximum speed of 177 km / h.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/motor/reportajes/abci-modelos-hispano-suiza-entre-vehiculos-mas-bellos-historia-201810311241_noticia.html|title=Hispano-Suiza cl\u00e1sicos, entre los veh\u00edculos m\u00e1s bellos de la historia|date=2018-10-31|website=abc|language=es|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1925, Carlos Ballester obtained permission to represent Hispano-Suiza in Argentina. The agreement consisted of a phase in which the chassis were imported, followed by complete domestic production in Argentina. Thus '''''[[Hispano Argentina F\u00e1brica de Autom\u00f3viles]]''''' (HAFDASA) was born, for the production of Hispano-Suiza motors and automobiles, and also the production of spare parts for other car, truck, and bus manufacturers.\n\n===Spanish Civil War and WWII===\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936, the regional government of Catalonia, on behalf of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], collectivized control of Hispano-Suiza's Spanish factories and placed the company on a war footing. The company was divided into three sections:\n* aircraft engines and cannons\n* cars and trucks\n* machine tools\nBecause of the international isolation of the Spanish republic, the Spanish arm of the company suffered from shortages.\n\nIn 1937, the French government took control of the French subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza with a 51 per cent share of the capital for the provision of war materiel, renaming the company ''La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019exploitation des mat\u00e9riels Hispano-Suiza''. In 1938, the French company ceased automobile production and concentrated on aircraft engine production. At the time, Hispano-Suiza had just introduced a new series of water-cooled [[V12 engine|V-12]] engines and the [[Hispano-Suiza 12Y]] was in great demand for practically every type of French aircraft. However, without the Spanish factories, Hispano-Suiza lacked the capacity to deliver enough engines for the rapidly growing French air force, and many new French fighter aircraft remained grounded for the lack of an engine when World War II began.\n\nA development of the era were a series of 20&nbsp;mm [[autocannon]], first the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.9]], followed by the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]]. The 404 was licensed for production in Britain and equipped almost all [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighter aircraft during the war. Production was also set up in the US, but these versions never matured even though the [[USAAC]] and [[US Navy]] both wanted to use it in place of their existing [[.50 BMG]] weapons. A lesser-known success was the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.820]], a higher performance 20&nbsp;mm design that was also used in the US as the M139. A variation of the 20&nbsp;mm guns used on the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] aircraft were produced by [[International Harvester]].<ref name=\"International Harvester Corporation\">International Harvester Corporation. \"Mr. Dealer Plan Now for the Future\", Harvester World, Volume 34, Number 11, November 1943, p.16. Harvester Press, Chicago, 1943.</ref> In 1970 Hispano-Suiza sold their armaments division to [[Oerlikon Contraves|Oerlikon]], the HS.820 becoming the KAD.\n\nIn 1940, Hispano-Suiza, together with the Spanish bank Banco Urquijo and a group of Spanish industrial companies, founded the 'Sociedad Ib\u00e9rica de Autom\u00f3viles de Turismo' (S.I.A.T.). This led to Spain's first mass-production car maker, [[SEAT]]. After the civil war, Hispano-Suiza in Spain was severely affected by the devastated economy and the trade embargoes imposed by the allies. In 1946, Hispano-Suiza sold off its Spanish automotive assets to ENASA, a public company belonging to the [[Instituto Nacional de Industria]], the maker of Pegaso trucks.\n[[File:Hispano-Suiza Carmen Genf 2019 1Y7A5641.jpg|thumb|1,005 hp Hispano Suiza Carmen in Geneva Motor Show 2019]]\n\n===1950s\u2013Today===\nAfter the Second World War, the French arm of Hispano-Suiza continued primarily as an aerospace firm. Between 1945 and 1955, it was building the [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] under license, designing [[landing gear]] in 1950 and [[Martin-Baker]] [[ejection seat]]s in 1955. The company's attention turned increasingly to turbine manufacturing and, in 1968, it was taken over and became a division of [[SNECMA]]. In 1999, Hispano-Suiza moved its turbine operations to a new factory in [[Bezons]], outside [[Paris]], using the original factories for power transmissions and accessory systems for jet engines. In 2005, SNECMA merged with [[SAGEM]] to form [[SAFRAN]].\n\nThe brand saw an attempt at a revival in the automotive sector with the showing of a model at the 2010 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. However the planned production never materialised.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lieberman |first=Jonny |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/03/02/geneva-2010-hispano-suiza-debuts-the-hispano-suiza/ |title=Geneva 2010: Hispano Suiza debuts the...

engine and components manufacturer. It is best known for its pre-World War II luxury cars and aviation engines. In 1923, its French subsidiary became a semi-autonomous partnership with the Spanish parent company. In 1946, the Spanish parent company sold all its Spanish automotive assets to [[Enasa]]. In 1968, the French arm was taken over by the aerospace company [[Snecma]], now a part of the French [[Safran|Safran Group]] and [[Peralada Group]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forum-auto.com/automobiles-mythiques-exception/section5/sujet381347.htm |title=La Hispano-Suiza \u2013 Anciennes Oldies \u2013 FORUM Anciennes \u2013 FORUM auto mythiques et d'exception |publisher=Forum-auto.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613010259/http://www.forum-auto.com/automobiles-mythiques-exception/section5/sujet381347.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nIn 1898 a Spanish artillery captain, [[Emilio de la Cuadra]], started electric automobile production in [[Barcelona]] under the name of '''La Cuadra'''. In [[Paris]], De la Cuadra met the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] engineer [[Marc Birkigt]] and hired him to work for the company in Spain. Under his direction two types of La Cuadra gasoline-powered engine cars were started immediately, one equipped with a 4.5 hp single-cylinder explosion engine and another 7-cylinder two-cylinder model, 5 hp. In 1900, these two explosion engines were the first designed and built in Spain by La Cuadra from a Birkigt design. These cars had four wheels, the previous two directional, clutch mechanisms, 3-speed gearbox, chain drive and suspension by crossbows. Two complete vehicles were completed, and there were some more under construction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aeha.cat/hispano-suiza|title=Hispano Suiza|website=Associaci\u00f3 d'Estudis His\u00f2rics de l'automoci\u00f3 {{!}} AEHA|language=es-ES|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> At some point in 1902, the ownership changed hands to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Castro Fern\u00e1ndez and became '''''F\u00e1brica Hispano-Suiza de Autom\u00f3viles''''' (''Spanish-Swiss Automobile Factory'') but this company went [[bankrupt]] in December 1903.\n\nYet another restructuring took place in 1904, creating '''''La Hispano-Suiza F\u00e1brica de Autom\u00f3viles''''', under Castro's direction, also based in Barcelona. Four new engines were introduced in the next year and a half; a 3.8-litre and 7.4-litre four-cylinder and a pair of big six-cylinder engines were produced. This company managed to avoid bankruptcy and its largest operations remained in Barcelona until 1946, where cars, trucks, buses, aero engines and weapons were produced. Other factories in Spain were at [[Ripoll]], [[Seville]], and [[Guadalajara (Spain)|Guadalajara]].\n\nIn 1910 [[Jean Chassagne]] competed with a Hispano-Suiza together with works drivers Pilleveridier and Zucarelli in the Coupe des Voiturettes Boulogne and the Catalan Cup Races, gaining second and fourth places respectively. France was soon proving to be a larger market for Hispano-Suiza's luxury cars than Spain. In 1911, an assembly factory called '''''Hispano France''''' began operating in the Paris suburb of [[Levallois-Perret]]. Production was moved to larger factories at [[Bois-Colombes]], under the name Hispano-Suiza in 1914 and soon became Hispano-Suiza's main plant for producing the largest, most costly models.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Hispano Suiza 8 A Brussel.jpg|thumb|A Brussels museum-preserved Hispano-Suiza HS.8A SOHC aviation engine from World War I]]\nWith the start of [[World War I]], Hispano-Suiza turned to the design and production of [[aircraft engine]]s under the direction of [[Marc Birkigt]]. His chief engineer during this period was another Swiss, [[Louis Massuger]]. Traditionally, aircraft engines were manufactured by machining separate steel cylinders and then bolting these assemblies directly to the crankcase. Birkigt's [[Hispano-Suiza 8|novel solution]] called for the engine block to be formed from a single piece of cast aluminum, and into which thin steel liners were secured. Manufacturing an engine in this way simplified construction and resulted in a lighter, yet stronger more durable engine. Thus, Birkigt's new construction method created the first practical, and what are commonly known today as, \"cast block\" engines. His aluminum cast block V-8 design was also noteworthy for incorporating overhead camshafts, propeller reduction gearing and other desirable features that would not appear together on competitors' engines until the late 1920s. Another major design feature, for the later HS.8B line was the use of a hollow propeller shaft for [[Hispano-Suiza 8#Variants|both the 8B and 8C gear-reduction versions]], which when used for the HS.8C versions specifically engineered to accommodate one, to allow heavy calibre (usually 37&nbsp;mm) projectiles firing through the hollow propeller shaft, avoiding the need for a [[synchronization gear]], a feature used in future Hispano-Suiza military engines. Hispano-Suiza's aero engines, produced at its own factories and under license, became the most commonly used aero engines in the French and British air forces, powering over half the alliance's fighter aircraft.<ref>Browne, T.C. \"Retrospect: 1924 Hispano-Suiza H6c Speedster\", ''Motor Trend'', 4/84, p.118.</ref>\n\n===1918\u20131936===\n[[File:Hispano Suiza 1918.jpg|thumb|Share of the Hispano-Suiza Fabrica de Automoviles SA, issued December 21, 1918]]\nAfter World War I, Hispano-Suiza returned to automobile manufacturing and in 1919 they introduced the [[Hispano-Suiza H6]]. The H6 featured an inline 6-cylinder [[overhead cam]] engine based on the features of its V8 aluminium World War I aircraft engines and had coachwork done by well known coachbuilders like [[Hibbard & Darrin]] and [[D'Ieteren]].<ref>[[Georgano, G. N.]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''. London: Grange-Universal, 1985</ref>\n\nLicences for Hispano-Suiza patents were much in demand from prestige car manufacturers world-wide. [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] used a number of Hispano-Suiza patents. For instance, for many years Rolls Royce installed Hispano-Suiza designed power brakes in its vehicles.\n\nIn 1923 the French arm of Hispano-Suiza was incorporated as the '''''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise Hispano-Suiza''''', the Spanish parent company retaining control with 71% of the share capital. The French subsidiary was granted a large degree of financial and project independence to bring design and production direction into closer contact with its main markets but overall direction remained at Barcelona. This arrangement increased the importance of the Bois-Colombes plant near Paris as Hispano-Suiza's premier luxury car plant, and while the Spanish operations continued to produce luxury cars, mostly the smaller, less expensive models, production in Spain moved increasingly to the production of buses, trucks, and aircraft engines at several plants located around the country.\n\nThrough the 1920s and into the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza built a series of luxury cars with overhead camshaft engines of increasing performance. On the other hand, in the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza's V-12 car engines reverted to pushrod valve actuation to reduce engine noise.\n\nDuring this time, Hispano-Suiza released the 37.2 Hispano-Suiza car built at the Bois-Colombes works.[[File:Hispano-suiza-hood-ornament.JPG|thumb|right|Hispano-Suiza stork hood ornament.]]\n\nThe mascot statuette atop the radiator after World War I was the [[stork]], the symbol of the French province of [[Alsace]], taken from the squadron emblem painted on the side of a Hispano-Suiza powered fighter aircraft that had been flown by the World War I French ace [[Georges Guynemer]].\n\nThe [[Hispano-Suiza T49]] was also designed and made by the Spanish company between 1924 and 1944; it was the Spanish version of the French H6B model with a 6-cylinder engine of 8,000 cm3, 160 hp and a maximum speed of 177 km / h.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/motor/reportajes/abci-modelos-hispano-suiza-entre-vehiculos-mas-bellos-historia-201810311241_noticia.html|title=Hispano-Suiza cl\u00e1sicos, entre los veh\u00edculos m\u00e1s bellos de la historia|date=2018-10-31|website=abc|language=es|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1925, Carlos Ballester obtained permission to represent Hispano-Suiza in Argentina. The agreement consisted of a phase in which the chassis were imported, followed by complete domestic production in Argentina. Thus '''''[[Hispano Argentina F\u00e1brica de Autom\u00f3viles]]''''' (HAFDASA) was born, for the production of Hispano-Suiza motors and automobiles, and also the production of spare parts for other car, truck, and bus manufacturers.\n\n===Spanish Civil War and WWII===\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936, the regional government of Catalonia, on behalf of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], collectivized control of Hispano-Suiza's Spanish factories and placed the company on a war footing. The company was divided into three sections:\n* aircraft engines and cannons\n* cars and trucks\n* machine tools\nBecause of the international isolation of the Spanish republic, the Spanish arm of the company suffered from shortages.\n\nIn 1937, the French government took control of the French subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza with a 51 per cent share of the capital for the provision of war materiel, renaming the company ''La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019exploitation des mat\u00e9riels Hispano-Suiza''. In 1938, the French company ceased automobile production and concentrated on aircraft engine production. At the time, Hispano-Suiza had just introduced a new series of water-cooled [[V12 engine|V-12]] engines and the [[Hispano-Suiza 12Y]] was in great demand for practically every type of French aircraft. However, without the Spanish factories, Hispano-Suiza lacked the capacity to deliver enough engines for the rapidly growing French air force, and many new French fighter aircraft remained grounded for the lack of an engine when World War II began.\n\nA development of the era were a series of 20&nbsp;mm [[autocannon]], first the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.9]], followed by the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]]. The 404 was licensed for production in Britain and equipped almost all [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighter aircraft during the war. Production was also set up in the US, but these versions never matured even though the [[USAAC]] and [[US Navy]] both wanted to use it in place of their existing [[.50 BMG]] weapons. A lesser-known success was the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.820]], a higher performance 20&nbsp;mm design that was also used in the US as the M139. A variation of the 20&nbsp;mm guns used on the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] aircraft were produced by [[International Harvester]].<ref name=\"International Harvester Corporation\">International Harvester Corporation. \"Mr. Dealer Plan Now for the Future\", Harvester World, Volume 34, Number 11, November 1943, p.16. Harvester Press, Chicago, 1943.</ref> In 1970 Hispano-Suiza sold their armaments division to [[Oerlikon Contraves|Oerlikon]], the HS.820 becoming the KAD.\n\nIn 1940, Hispano-Suiza, together with the Spanish bank Banco Urquijo and a group of Spanish industrial companies, founded the 'Sociedad Ib\u00e9rica de Autom\u00f3viles de Turismo' (S.I.A.T.). This led to Spain's first mass-production car maker, [[SEAT]]. After the civil war, Hispano-Suiza in Spain was severely affected by the devastated economy and the trade embargoes imposed by the allies. In 1946, Hispano-Suiza sold off its Spanish automotive assets to ENASA, a public company belonging to the [[Instituto Nacional de Industria]], the maker of Pegaso trucks.\n[[File:Hispano-Suiza Carmen Genf 2019 1Y7A5641.jpg|thumb|1,005 hp Hispano Suiza Carmen in Geneva Motor Show 2019]]\n\n===1950s\u2013Today===\nAfter the Second World War, the French arm of Hispano-Suiza continued primarily as an aerospace firm. Between 1945 and 1955, it was building the [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] under license, designing [[landing gear]] in 1950 and [[Martin-Baker]] [[ejection seat]]s in 1955. The company's attention turned increasingly to turbine manufacturing and, in 1968, it was taken over and became a division of [[SNECMA]]. In 1999, Hispano-Suiza moved its turbine operations to a new factory in [[Bezons]], outside [[Paris]], using the original factories for power transmissions and accessory systems for jet engines. In 2005, SNECMA merged with [[SAGEM]] to form [[SAFRAN]].\n\nThe brand saw an attempt at a revival in the automotive sector with the showing of a model at the 2010 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. However the planned production never materialised.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lieberman |first=Jonny |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/03/02/geneva-2010-hispano-suiza-debuts-the-hispano-suiza/ |title=Geneva 2010: Hispano Suiza debuts the...
