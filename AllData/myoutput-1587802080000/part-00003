In 1930, all sections ([[Tachikawa Station|Tachikawa]] - [[Haijima Station|Haijima]] - [[Musashi-Itsukaichi Station|Musashi-Itsukaichi]] - Musashi-Iwai) were opened. There were two competing railways between Tachikawa and Haijima: the \u014cme Electric Railway (now the [[\u014cme Line]]) and the Itsukaichi Railway. In 1940, the Itsukaichi Railway was taken over by the Nambu Railway, becoming the Nambu Railway Itsukaichi Line. In 1944, Nambu Railway was nationalized and this line became the [[Japanese Government Railways|JGR]] Itsukaichi Line. At the same time, the section of the line between Tachikawa and Haijima was deemed non-essential and closed. However, the Tachikawa - Musashi-Uenohara and Musahi-Uenohara - [[Nishi-Tachikawa Station|Nishi-Tachikawa]] sections of the former Nambu Railway are still used by [[Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line]] and [[Nambu Line]] trains traveling to and from the southern area of Tachikawa Station.\n\n===Chronology===\n*24 April 1925: Itsukaichi Railway opens between Haijima (temporary) and Itsukaichi (6.6&nbsp;mi, 10.62&nbsp;km) stations.
