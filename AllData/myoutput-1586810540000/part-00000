A famous example is Nightwish's cover of \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" from the album \"Century Child.\"\n\nDuring Nightwish's shows, Turunen would take a break halfway through the set. Before Hietala joined the band, the band would perform an instrumental song during this time. After Hietala joined the band, they performed covers of well-known songs, with Hietala singing the lead vocal part in this break. The band has performed [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s \"[[Crazy Train]]\", [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]'s \"Wild Child\", [[Dio (band)|Dio]]'s \"Don't Talk to Strangers\", [[Megadeth]]'s \"[[Symphony of Destruction]]\" and [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]\". Some of these songs have been put up for sale as well on various Nightwish album releases. Following Turunen's departure from Nightwish, Hietala was much more involved with the production of ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'', which was released in September 2007. He sang some songs, completely, and wrote the music for the song \"[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]\", on which he also plays acoustic guitar instead of bass. Hietala is also credited alongside [[Tuomas Holopainen|Holopainen]] for co-writing the song \"[[The Crow, the Owl and the Dove]]\" from Nightwish's 2011 album, ''[[Imaginaerum]]''.\n\nIn [[Delain]], Hietala played bass for the album ''[[Lucidity (album)|Lucidity]]'' and was also the main male vocalist on the album with featured vocals on the song ''The Gathering''. He is also featured as vocalist in two of the songs on [[Delain]]'s second album ''[[April Rain]]'' and two songs from [[Delain]]'s fourth album ''[[The Human Contradiction]]''.\n\nIn March 2009, Hietala joined the band [[Sapattivuosi]]. They cover [[Black Sabbath]] songs in Finnish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122574 |title=Marco Hietala's Black Sabbath Tribute Band To Play in Poland |date=June 25, 2009 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]] |accessdate=March 19, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In this band, however, Hietala does not play bass; he only performs vocals.\n\nOn 1 April 2010 it was said that Hietala would leave the band to concentrate on a [[choir]] career.  This was identified as an April Fool's joke, but was also a reference to his participation in ''Kuorosota'' (the localized Finnish version of ''[[Clash of the Choirs]]'') in 2010.  Hietala was the master of the [[Kuopio]] choir in the program's second season.  He came second in the contest, losing in the finals to the [[Joensuu]] choir, headed by pop rock singer [[Ilkka Alanko]].  Tarot's single \"I Walk Forever,\" from the ''[[Gravity of Light (Tarot album)|Gravity of Light]]'' album, was performed for the first time by Hietala, [[Tommi Salmela|Tommi \"Tuple\" Salmela]] and the Kuopio choir during Kuorosota 2010; other songs performed included \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]],\" which Hietala has covered with Nightwish as well.\n\nIn June 2010, Hietala joined the heavy metal supergroup HAIL! on two occasions, performing [[Black Sabbath]]'s [[Neon Knights]] with [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens|Ripper Owens]], [[Andreas Kisser]], [[James LoMenzo]] and [[Paul Bostaph]] at two of their shows in [[Finland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HAIL!

He also owns a Warwick Buzzard JE with a rusty finish equipped with a detuner (Used, among others, in the music videoes for Elan and Endless Forms Most Beautiful), and a Kramer bass. He uses Warwick's Hellborg amplifier and cabs. After joining Nightwish he used a SansAmp GT2 distortion pedal for some time. \u00a8\u00a8\n\nHietala also uses a custom made Warwick/Framus doubleneck bass/electric guitar, based on the Warwick Infinity.\n\nFrom Century Child until the End of an Era Hietala used an Infinity almost exclusively for live and studio applications. Later, the Vampyre became his axe of choice (almost for the whole period with Anette as Nightwish's vocalist). The first time he can be seen with a Vampyre is the Bye Bye Beautiful music video. From the Imaginaerum tour going forward Buzzard became his preferred brand, but occasionally he still can be seen with an Infinity.\n\n==Influences==\nHietala has stated that the biggest influence on him as a bassist is [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Bob Daisley]], while [[Ronnie James Dio]] and [[Rob Halford]] are his biggest influence as a vocalist. He has also stated that he listens to wide array of music ranging from \"really sensitive stuff to a lot of really hard stuff\", saying that he \"tend[s] to soak up almost everything\" which \"somehow ends up being used\" when he writes his own music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaQgZtMjhVE|title=Marco Hietala interview|date=July 5, 2009|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wingsofdarkness.net/php/profile_marco.php |title=~ Wings of Darkness ~ The Official Tarot Website |publisher=Wingsofdarkness.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>\n{{cquote|''How is your musical taste towards metal music / other genres?''|author=Question on the official Tarot website (2006)}}\n{{cquote|''Anything works for me, if it's good enough.

A famous example is Nightwish's cover of \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" from the album \"Century Child.\"\n\nDuring Nightwish's shows, Turunen would take a break halfway through the set. Before Hietala joined the band, the band would perform an instrumental song during this time. After Hietala joined the band, they performed covers of well-known songs, with Hietala singing the lead vocal part in this break. The band has performed [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s \"[[Crazy Train]]\", [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]'s \"Wild Child\", [[Dio (band)|Dio]]'s \"Don't Talk to Strangers\", [[Megadeth]]'s \"[[Symphony of Destruction]]\" and [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]\". Some of these songs have been put up for sale as well on various Nightwish album releases. Following Turunen's departure from Nightwish, Hietala was much more involved with the production of ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'', which was released in September 2007. He sang some songs, completely, and wrote the music for the song \"[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]\", on which he also plays acoustic guitar instead of bass. Hietala is also credited alongside [[Tuomas Holopainen|Holopainen]] for co-writing the song \"[[The Crow, the Owl and the Dove]]\" from Nightwish's 2011 album, ''[[Imaginaerum]]''.\n\nIn [[Delain]], Hietala played bass for the album ''[[Lucidity (album)|Lucidity]]'' and was also the main male vocalist on the album with featured vocals on the song ''The Gathering''. He is also featured as vocalist in two of the songs on [[Delain]]'s second album ''[[April Rain]]'' and two songs from [[Delain]]'s fourth album ''[[The Human Contradiction]]''.\n\nIn March 2009, Hietala joined the band [[Sapattivuosi]]. They cover [[Black Sabbath]] songs in Finnish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122574 |title=Marco Hietala's Black Sabbath Tribute Band To Play in Poland |date=June 25, 2009 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]] |accessdate=March 19, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In this band, however, Hietala does not play bass; he only performs vocals.\n\nOn 1 April 2010 it was said that Hietala would leave the band to concentrate on a [[choir]] career.  This was identified as an April Fool's joke, but was also a reference to his participation in ''Kuorosota'' (the localized Finnish version of ''[[Clash of the Choirs]]'') in 2010.  Hietala was the master of the [[Kuopio]] choir in the program's second season.  He came second in the contest, losing in the finals to the [[Joensuu]] choir, headed by pop rock singer [[Ilkka Alanko]].  Tarot's single \"I Walk Forever,\" from the ''[[Gravity of Light (Tarot album)|Gravity of Light]]'' album, was performed for the first time by Hietala, [[Tommi Salmela|Tommi \"Tuple\" Salmela]] and the Kuopio choir during Kuorosota 2010; other songs performed included \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]],\" which Hietala has covered with Nightwish as well.\n\nIn June 2010, Hietala joined the heavy metal supergroup HAIL! on two occasions, performing [[Black Sabbath]]'s [[Neon Knights]] with [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens|Ripper Owens]], [[Andreas Kisser]], [[James LoMenzo]] and [[Paul Bostaph]] at two of their shows in [[Finland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HAIL!

He also owns a Warwick Buzzard JE with a rusty finish equipped with a detuner (Used, among others, in the music videoes for Elan and Endless Forms Most Beautiful), and a Kramer bass. He uses Warwick's Hellborg amplifier and cabs. After joining Nightwish he used a SansAmp GT2 distortion pedal for some time. \u00a8\u00a8\n\nHietala also uses a custom made Warwick/Framus doubleneck bass/electric guitar, based on the Warwick Infinity.\n\nFrom Century Child until the End of an Era Hietala used an Infinity almost exclusively for live and studio applications. Later, the Vampyre became his axe of choice (almost for the whole period with Anette as Nightwish's vocalist). The first time he can be seen with a Vampyre is the Bye Bye Beautiful music video. From the Imaginaerum tour going forward Buzzard became his preferred brand, but occasionally he still can be seen with an Infinity.\n\n==Influences==\nHietala has stated that the biggest influence on him as a bassist is [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Bob Daisley]], while [[Ronnie James Dio]] and [[Rob Halford]] are his biggest influence as a vocalist. He has also stated that he listens to wide array of music ranging from \"really sensitive stuff to a lot of really hard stuff\", saying that he \"tend[s] to soak up almost everything\" which \"somehow ends up being used\" when he writes his own music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaQgZtMjhVE|title=Marco Hietala interview|date=July 5, 2009|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wingsofdarkness.net/php/profile_marco.php |title=~ Wings of Darkness ~ The Official Tarot Website |publisher=Wingsofdarkness.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>\n{{cquote|''How is your musical taste towards metal music / other genres?''|author=Question on the official Tarot website (2006)}}\n{{cquote|''Anything works for me, if it's good enough.
