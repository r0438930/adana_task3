A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he represented [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[United States Senate]] and served as an adviser to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]. \n\nBorn in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], Moynihan moved at a young age to [[New York City]]. Following a stint in the navy, he earned a Ph.D. in history from [[Tufts University]]. He worked on the staff of New York Governor [[W. Averell Harriman]] before joining President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration in 1961. He served as an Assistant Secretary of Labor under Kennedy and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], devoting much of his time to the [[War on Poverty]]. In 1965, he published the controversial [[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action|Moynihan Report]]. Moynihan left the Johnson administration in 1965 and became a professor at [[Harvard University]].\n\nIn 1969, he accepted Nixon's offer to serve as an Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and he was elevated to the position of [[Counselor to the President]] later that year. He left the administration at the end of 1970, and accepted appointment as [[United States Ambassador to India]] in 1973. He accepted President [[Gerald Ford]]'s appointment to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1975, holding that position until 1976, when he won election to the Senate.\n\nMoynihan represented New York in the Senate from 1977 to 2001. He served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment Committee]] from 1992 to 1993 and as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] from 1993 to 1995. He also led the [[Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy|Moynihan Secrecy Commission]], which studied the regulation of classified information. He emerged as a strong critic of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s foreign policy and opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]]. He frequently broke with [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] positions, but opposed welfare reform in the 1990s. He also voted against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the Congressional authorization for the [[Gulf War]]. He is tied with [[Jacob K. Javits]] as the longest-serving Senator from the state of New York.<ref>[[Chuck Schumer]] will join them when he completes the term to which he was elected in 2016.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nMoynihan was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], the son of Margaret Ann (n\u00e9e Phipps), a homemaker, and John Henry Moynihan, a reporter for a daily newspaper in Tulsa.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Current Biography Yearbook|author=H.W.

Moynihan briefly worked as a [[longshoreman]] before entering the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), which at that time provided free [[higher education]] to city residents.\n\nFollowing a year at CCNY, Moynihan joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1944. He was assigned to the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] at [[Middlebury College]] from 1944 to 1945 and then enrolled as a [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] student at [[Tufts University]], where he received an undergraduate degree in naval science in 1946. He completed active service as [[Gun|gunnery officer]] of the [[USS Quirinus (ARL-39)|USS ''Quirinus'']] at the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] in 1947. Moynihan then returned to Tufts, where he completed a second undergraduate degree in [[sociology]]<ref name=\"nixonlibrary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/central/smof/moynihan.php|publisher=nixonlibrary.gov|title=Daniel Patrick Moynihan|accessdate=2017-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170504/https://nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/central/smof/moynihan.php|archive-date=2016-12-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''cum laude'' in 1948 and earned an [[M.A.]] from the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] in 1949.\n\nAfter failing the [[Foreign Service Officer]] exam, he continued his doctoral studies at the Fletcher School as a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellow]] at the [[London School of Economics]] from 1950 to 1953. During this period, Moynihan struggled with writer's block and began to fashion himself as a \"[[dandy]],\" cultivating \"a taste for [[Savile Row tailoring|Savile Row]] suits, rococo conversational riffs and Churchillian oratory\" even as he maintained that \"nothing and no one at LSE ever disposed me to be anything but a New York Democrat who had some friends who worked on the docks and drank beer after work.\"<ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism|author=Troy, G.|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199920303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyOoaxtz6KoC&pg=PA44|page=44|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\nHe ultimately received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[history]] (with a dissertation on the relationship between the United States and the [[International Labour Organization]]) from the Fletcher School in 1961 while serving as an assistant professor of [[political science]] and director of a government research project centered around [[Averell Harriman]]'s papers at [[Syracuse University]]'s [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]].<ref name=\"proquest\">{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302084811/|title=The United States and the International Labor Organization, 1889\u20131934 \u2013 ProQuest|accessdate=2017-01-26|via=ProQuest}}</ref><ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\">{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002530045|publisher=search.marquiswhoswho.com|title=Marquis Biographies Online|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Political career and return to academia==\nMoynihan's political career started in the 1950s, when he served as a member of New York Governor [[Averell Harriman]]'s staff in a variety of positions (including speechwriter and acting secretary to the governor). He met his future wife, Elizabeth (Liz) Brennan, who also worked on Harriman's staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/27/archives/elizabeth-moynihan-leaves-the-sidelines-for-an-active-role-in.html|title=Elizabeth Moynihan Leaves the Sidelines for an Active Role in Senate Race|website=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThis period ended following Harriman's loss to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the 1958 general election. Moynihan returned to academia, serving as a lecturer for brief periods at [[Russell Sage College]] (1957\u20131958) and the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] (1959) before taking a tenure-track position at Syracuse University (1959\u20131961). During this period, Moynihan was a delegate to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] as part of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s delegate pool.\n\n===Kennedy and Johnson Administrations; controversy over the War on Poverty===\nMoynihan first served in the Kennedy administration as special (1961\u20131962) and executive (1962\u20131963) assistant to [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretaries]] [[Arthur J. Goldberg]] and [[W. Willard Wirtz]]. In 1962, he authored the directive \"Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture\", which discouraged use of an official style for [[Federal building|federal buildings,]] and has been credited with enabling \"a wide ranging set of innovative public building projects\" in subsequent decades, including the [[San Francisco Federal Building]] and the [[United States Courthouse (Austin, Texas, 2012)|United States Courthouse in Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/news/article/150182232/new-executive-order-could-make-classical-architecture-the-preferred-and-default-style-for-america-s-public-buildings|title=New executive order could make classical architecture \"the preferred and default style\" for America's public buildings|last=Pacheco|first=Antonio|date=2020-02-04|website=Archinect|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\nHe was then appointed as [[United States Department of Labor|Assistant Secretary of Labor]] for Policy, Planning and Research, serving from 1963 to 1965 under Kennedy and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In this capacity, he did not have operational responsibilities. He devoted his time to trying to formulate national policy for what would become the [[War on Poverty]]. His small staff included [[Ralph Nader]].\n\nThey took inspiration from historian [[Stanley Elkins]]'s ''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' (1959). Elkins essentially contended that [[slavery]] had made black Americans dependent on the dominant society, and that such dependence still existed a century later after the American Civil War. Moynihan and his staff believed that government must go beyond simply ensuring that members of minority groups have the same rights as the majority and must also \"act affirmatively\" in order to counter the problem of historic discrimination.\n\nMoynihan's research of Labor Department data demonstrated that even as fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments in certain parts of the United States.\n\nMoynihan issued his research in 1965 under the title ''[[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action]]'', now commonly known as ''The Moynihan Report''. Moynihan's report<ref name=\"dol\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|publisher=dol.gov|title=U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 History \u2013 The Negro Family \u2013 The Case for National Action (Moynihan's War on Poverty report)|accessdate=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120102028/https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|archive-date=2017-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> fueled a debate over the proper course for government to take with regard to the economic underclass, especially blacks. Critics on the left attacked it as \"[[Victim blaming|blaming the victim]]\",<ref>''The National Review''; March 27, 2003</ref> a slogan coined by psychologist [[William Ryan (psychologist)|William Ryan]].<ref>See William Ryan, ''Blaming the Victim,'' Random House, 1971</ref> Some suggested that Moynihan was propagating the views of racists<ref>Graebner, William. \"The End of Liberalism: Narrating Welfare's Decline, from the Moynihan Report (1965) to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (1996)\", ''Journal of Policy History'', Vol. 14, Number 2, 2002, pp. 170\u2013190</ref> because much of the press coverage of the report focused on the discussion of children being born out of wedlock. Despite Moynihan's warnings, the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) program included rules for payments only if no \"Man [was] in the house.\"<ref>http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Man-in-the-House+Rule</ref> Critics said that the nation was paying poor women to throw their husbands out of the house.\n\nAfter the 1994 [[Republican Revolution|Republican sweep of Congress]], Moynihan agreed that correction was needed for a welfare system that possibly encouraged women to raise their children without fathers: \"The Republicans are saying we have a hell of a problem, and we do.\"<ref name=\"time1994\">{{cite magazine |first=Richard|last=Lacayo|title= Down on the Downtrodden |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982006,00.html |magazine=Time Magazine |date=December 19, 1994 |accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>\n\n===Local New York City politics and ongoing academic career===\nBy the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], Moynihan was recognized as a political ally of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. For this reason he was not favored by then-President Johnson, and he left the Johnson Administration in 1965. He ran for office in the Democratic Party primary for the presidency of the [[New York City Council]], a position now known as the [[New York City Public Advocate]]. However, he was defeated by Queens District Attorney [[Frank D. O'Connor]].\n\nDuring this transitional period, Moynihan maintained an academic affiliation as a fellow at [[Wesleyan University]]'s Center for Advanced Studies from 1964 to 1967. In 1966, he was appointed to the faculties of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education]] and [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Graduate School of Public Administration]] as a full professor of education and urban politics. After commencing a second extended leave because of his public service in 1973, his faculty line was transferred to the University's Department of Government, where he remained until 1977. From 1966 to 1969, he also held a secondary administrative appointment as director of the [[Harvard\u2013MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]].<ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\"/> With turmoil and [[riots]] in the United States, Moynihan, \"a national board member of [[Americans for Democratic Action|ADA]] incensed at the radicalism of the current [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] and [[Black Power]] movements\", decided to \"call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives,\"<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]]. [https://www.mises.org/story/1842 Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal], ''[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]''</ref> and wrote that the next administration would have to be able to unite the nation again.\n\n===Nixon Administration===\nConnecting with [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968, Moynihan joined the [[Executive Office of the President]] in January 1969 as Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and executive secretary of the Council of Urban Affairs (later the Urban Affairs Council), a forerunner of the [[Domestic Policy Council]] envisaged as an analog to the [[United States National Security Council]]. As one of the few people in Nixon's inner circle who had done academic research related to social policies, he was very influential in the early months of the administration. However, his disdain for \"traditional budget-conscious positions\" (including his proposed Family Assistance Plan, a \"[[negative income tax]] or [[guaranteed minimum income]]\" for families that met work requirements or demonstrated that they were seeking work which ultimately stalled in the Senate despite prefiguring the later [[Supplemental Security Income]] program) led to frequent clashes (belying their unwavering mutual respect) with Nixon's principal domestic policy advisor, conservative economist and [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet-rank]] [[Counselor to the President]] [[Arthur F. Burns]].<ref name=\"bloomberg\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-28/when-nixon-listened-to-liberal-moynihan|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=When Nixon Listened to Liberal Moynihan \u2013 Bloomberg View|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref>\n\nWhile formulating Nixon's [[Guaranteed minimum income|Guaranteed Annual Income]] (GAI) proposal, Moynihan conducted significant discussions concerning a [[Basic Income Guarantee]] with [[Russell B. Long]] and [[Louis O. Kelso]].\n\nAlthough Moynihan was promoted to Counselor to the President for Urban Affairs with Cabinet rank shortly after Burns was nominated by Nixon to serve as [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] in October 1969, it was concurrently announced that Moynihan would be returning to Harvard (a stipulation of his leave from the University) at the end of 1970. Accordingly, operational oversight of the Urban Affairs Council was given to Moynihan's nominal successor as Domestic Policy Assistant, former [[White House Counsel]] [[John Ehrlichman]]. This decision was instigated by [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H.R. Haldeman]],<ref name=\"google4\">{{cite book|title=The Professor and the President: Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the Nixon White House|author=Hess, S.|date=2014|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815726166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU2aBAAAQBAJ|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref> a close friend of Ehrlichman since college and his main patron in the administration.

NATO was chosen, since the organization had suitable expertise in the field, as well as experience with international research coordination. The German government was skeptical and saw the initiative as an attempt by the US to regain international terrain after the lost [[Vietnam War]]. The topics gained momentum in civil conferences and institutions.<ref name=\"H\u00fcne\">Die Fr\u00fchgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950\u20131973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950\u20131973), [[Kai F.

The relationship between the two countries was at a low point following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Ambassador Moynihan was alarmed that two great democracies were cast as antagonists, and set out to fix things. He proposed that part of the burdensome debt be written off, part used to pay for US embassy expenses in India, and the remaining converted into Indian [[Indian rupee|rupees]] to fund an Indo-US cultural and educational exchange program that lasted for a quarter century. On February 18, 1974, he presented to the Government of India a check for 16,640,000,000 rupees, then equivalent to $2,046,700,000, which was the greatest amount paid by a single check in the history of banking.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/11/moynihan-letters-201011 An American Original], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', October 2010</ref> The \"Rupee Deal\" is logged in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the world's largest check, written by Ambassador Moynihan to Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]].<ref>[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/america-can-learn-from-india/1/119060.html America can learn from India], ''[[India Today]]'', November 6, 2010</ref>\n\nIn June 1975, Moynihan accepted his third offer to serve as United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a position (including a rotation as President of the [[United Nations Security Council]]) that he would only hold until February 1976.

[[Gerald Ford]] considered Indonesia, then under a military dictatorship, a key ally against [[Communism]], which was influential in East Timor. Moynihan ensured that the [[UN Security Council]] took no action against the larger nation's annexation of a small country. The Indonesian invasion caused the deaths of 100,000\u2013200,000 Timorese through violence, illness, and hunger.<ref name=CAVR>[http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/Brief.htm Chega!

The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. This task was given to me, and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ON2TPWZkiCIC ''A Dangerous Place''], Little Brown, 1980, p. 247</ref>}}\n\nLater, he said he had defended a \"shameless\" [[Cold War]] policy toward East Timor.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/pandaemoniumethn00moyn ''Pandaemonium: Ethnicity in International Politics''], Oxford University Press 1993, page 153</ref>\n\nMoynihan's thinking began to change during his tenure at the UN. In his 1993 book on nationalism, ''Pandaemonium'', he wrote that as time progressed, he began to view the [[Soviet Union]] in less ideological terms. He regarded it less as an expansionist, [[imperialist]] [[Marxist]] state, and more as a weak [[political realism|realist]] state in decline. He believed it was most motivated by self-preservation. This view would influence his thinking in subsequent years, when he became an outspoken proponent of the then-unpopular view that the Soviet Union was a [[failed state]] headed for implosion.\n\nNevertheless, Moynihan's tenure at the UN marked the beginnings of a more bellicose, [[neoconservative]] American foreign policy that turned away from Kissinger's unabashedly covert, [[d\u00e9tente]]-driven [[realpolitik]].<ref>''Moynihan's Moment'', p. 159</ref> Although it was never substantiated, Moynihan initially believed that Kissinger directed [[Ivor Richard, Baron Richard]] (then [[British Ambassador to the United Nations]]) to publicly denounce his actions as \"[[Wyatt Earp]]\" diplomacy. Demoralized, Moynihan resigned from what he would subsequently characterize as an \"abbreviated posting\" in February 1976. In ''Pandaemonium'', Moynihan expounded upon this decision, maintaining that he was \"something of an embarrassment to my own government, and fairly soon left before I was fired.\"\n\n===Career in the Senate===\nIn November 1976, Moynihan was elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] from the State of New York, defeating U.S. Representative [[Bella Abzug]], former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]], New York City Council President [[Paul O'Dwyer]] and businessman [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] in the Democratic primary, and [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] incumbent [[James L. Buckley]] in the general election. Shortly after election, Moynihan analyzed the State of New York's budget to determine whether it was paying out more in [[Federal spending and taxation across states|federal taxes than it received in spending]]. Finding that it was, he produced a yearly report known as the ''[[Fisc]]'' (from the French<ref>[http://fiscreport.org/index02a7.html?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=26 \"The History of the Fisc\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, on the Fisc Report website.

A. Farber]], Moynihan stated the possibility of Congress having to become involved with securing press freedom and that the Senate should be aware of the issue's seriousness.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-moynihan-sees-need-for-bill-to-guarantee-freedom.html|title=Moynihan Sees Need For Bill to Guarantee Freedom of the Press|date=August 8, 1978|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nMoynihan's strong advocacy for New York's interests in the Senate, buttressed by the ''Fisc'' reports and recalling his strong advocacy for US positions in the UN, did at least on one occasion allow his advocacy to escalate into a physical attack. Senator [[Kit Bond]], nearing retirement in 2010, recalled with some embarrassment in a conversation on [[civility]] in political discourse that Moynihan had once \"slugged [Bond] on the Senate floor after Bond denounced an [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] Moynihan had slipped into a [[highway]] appropriations bill. Some months later Moynihan apologized, and the two occasionally would relax in Moynihan's office after a long day to discuss their shared interest in [[urban renewal]] over a glass of port.\"<ref>[http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2010/06/02/pages/3628/index.xml?page=2& \"Uncivil society: Jim Leach '64 leads an effort to restore respectful discourse to our national life, but it's tough going\"], by Mark F. Bernstein, ''[[Princeton Alumni Weekly]]'', June 2, 2010. Retrieved 2010-06-17.</ref>\n\nMoynihan continued to be interested in foreign policy as a Senator, sitting on the Select Committee on Intelligence. His strongly anti-Soviet views became far more moderate, as he emerged as a critic of the [[Ronald Reagan]] Administration's hawkish [[Cold War]] policies, such as support for the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Moynihan argued there was no active Soviet-backed conspiracy in [[Latin America]], or anywhere. He suggested the Soviets were suffering from massive internal problems, such as rising [[ethnic]] [[nationalism]] and a collapsing economy. In a December 21, 1986, editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Moynihan predicted the replacement on the world stage of Communist expansion with ethnic conflicts. He criticized the Reagan Administration's \"consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism \u2013 which is not in fact going on.\" In a September 8, 1990, letter to [[Erwin Griswold]], Moynihan wrote: \"I have one purpose left in life; or at least in the Senate. It is to try to sort out what would be involved in reconstituting the American government in the aftermath of the cold war. Huge changes took place, some of which we hardly notice.\"<ref>[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]].

He said of the procedure: \"I think this is just too close to [[infanticide]]. A child has been born and it has exited the [[uterus]]. What on Earth is this procedure?\" Earlier in his career in the Senate, Moynihan had expressed his annoyance with the adamantly pro-choice interest groups petitioning him and others on the issue. He challenged them saying, \"you women are ruining the Democratic Party with your insistence on [[abortion]].\"<ref>''Human Life Review'', Summer 2003, page 13.</ref><ref>Chapter4: Too close to infanticide [https://books.google.com/books?id=WS7IqNEKUFQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT51#v=onepage GB link] at [[Google Books]]</ref>\n\nMoynihan broke with orthodox liberal positions of his party on numerous occasions. As chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]] in the 1990s, he strongly opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s proposal to expand health care coverage to all Americans. Seeking to focus the debate over health insurance on the financing of health care, Moynihan garnered controversy by stating that \"there is no health care crisis in this country.\"\n\nOn other issues though, he was much more progressive. He voted against the [[death penalty]]; the [[flag desecration amendment]];<ref>{{USBill|106|SJ|14}}, 106th Congress, 2nd Session, [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&session=2&vote=00048#position Record Vote Number: 48]</ref> the [[balanced budget amendment]], the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]]; the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]; the [[Communications Decency Act]]; and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. He was critical of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a [[flat tax]]. Moynihan also voted against authorization of the [[Gulf War]]. Despite his earlier writings on the negative effects of the welfare state, he ended by voting against [[welfare reform]] in 1996, a bill that removed unemployment benefits. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who crossed party lines to support it.\n\n==Public speaker==\nMoynihan was a popular public speaker with a distinctly [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] style. He had some peculiar mannerisms of speech, in the form of slight stuttering and drawn-out vowels for emphasis. Linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] compared his speaking style to that of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|title=William F.

Moynihan chaired the Commission, which studied and made recommendations on the \"culture of secrecy\" that pervaded the United States government and its intelligence community for 80 years, beginning with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], and made recommendations on the statutory regulation of classified information.\n\nThe Commission's findings and recommendations were presented to the President in 1997. As part of the effort, Moynihan secured release from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] of its classified [[Venona]] file. This file documents the FBI's joint [[counterintelligence]] investigation, with the United States [[Arlington Hall|Signals Intelligence Service]], into Soviet espionage within the United States. Much of the information had been collected and classified as secret information for over 50 years.\n\nAfter release of the information, Moynihan authored ''Secrecy: The American Experience''<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300080794|title= Secrecy: The American Experience |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref> where he discussed the impact government secrecy has had on the domestic politics of America for the past half century, and how myths and suspicion created an unnecessary partisan chasm.\n\n==Career as scholar==\nAs a [[public intellectual]], Moynihan published articles on urban ethnic politics and on the problems of the poor in cities of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] in numerous publications, including ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and ''[[The Public Interest]]''.\n\nMoynihan coined the term \"professionalization of reform,\" by which the government bureaucracy thinks up problems for government to solve rather than simply responding to problems identified elsewhere.<ref>''The Public Interest'', volume 1, Issue 1 1965</ref>\n\nIn 1983, he was awarded the [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] Award given by the [[American Political Science Association]] \"in recognition of notable public service by a political scientist.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} He wrote 19 books, leading his personal friend, columnist and former professor [[George F.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he represented [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[United States Senate]] and served as an adviser to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]. \n\nBorn in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], Moynihan moved at a young age to [[New York City]]. Following a stint in the navy, he earned a Ph.D. in history from [[Tufts University]]. He worked on the staff of New York Governor [[W. Averell Harriman]] before joining President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration in 1961. He served as an Assistant Secretary of Labor under Kennedy and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], devoting much of his time to the [[War on Poverty]]. In 1965, he published the controversial [[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action|Moynihan Report]]. Moynihan left the Johnson administration in 1965 and became a professor at [[Harvard University]].\n\nIn 1969, he accepted Nixon's offer to serve as an Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and he was elevated to the position of [[Counselor to the President]] later that year. He left the administration at the end of 1970, and accepted appointment as [[United States Ambassador to India]] in 1973. He accepted President [[Gerald Ford]]'s appointment to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1975, holding that position until 1976, when he won election to the Senate.\n\nMoynihan represented New York in the Senate from 1977 to 2001. He served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment Committee]] from 1992 to 1993 and as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] from 1993 to 1995. He also led the [[Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy|Moynihan Secrecy Commission]], which studied the regulation of classified information. He emerged as a strong critic of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s foreign policy and opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]]. He frequently broke with [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] positions, but opposed welfare reform in the 1990s. He also voted against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the Congressional authorization for the [[Gulf War]]. He is tied with [[Jacob K.

Moynihan briefly worked as a [[longshoreman]] before entering the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), which at that time provided free [[higher education]] to city residents.\n\nFollowing a year at CCNY, Moynihan joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1944. He was assigned to the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] at [[Middlebury College]] from 1944 to 1945 and then enrolled as a [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] student at [[Tufts University]], where he received an undergraduate degree in naval science in 1946. He completed active service as [[Gun|gunnery officer]] of the [[USS Quirinus (ARL-39)|USS ''Quirinus'']] at the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] in 1947.

During this period, Moynihan struggled with writer's block and began to fashion himself as a \"[[dandy]],\" cultivating \"a taste for [[Savile Row tailoring|Savile Row]] suits, rococo conversational riffs and Churchillian oratory\" even as he maintained that \"nothing and no one at LSE ever disposed me to be anything but a New York Democrat who had some friends who worked on the docks and drank beer after work.\"<ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism|author=Troy, G.|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199920303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyOoaxtz6KoC&pg=PA44|page=44|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\nHe ultimately received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[history]] (with a dissertation on the relationship between the United States and the [[International Labour Organization]]) from the Fletcher School in 1961 while serving as an assistant professor of [[political science]] and director of a government research project centered around [[Averell Harriman]]'s papers at [[Syracuse University]]'s [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]].<ref name=\"proquest\">{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302084811/|title=The United States and the International Labor Organization, 1889\u20131934 \u2013 ProQuest|accessdate=2017-01-26|via=ProQuest}}</ref><ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\">{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002530045|publisher=search.marquiswhoswho.com|title=Marquis Biographies Online|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Political career and return to academia==\nMoynihan's political career started in the 1950s, when he served as a member of New York Governor [[Averell Harriman]]'s staff in a variety of positions (including speechwriter and acting secretary to the governor). He met his future wife, Elizabeth (Liz) Brennan, who also worked on Harriman's staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/27/archives/elizabeth-moynihan-leaves-the-sidelines-for-an-active-role-in.html|title=Elizabeth Moynihan Leaves the Sidelines for an Active Role in Senate Race|website=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThis period ended following Harriman's loss to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the 1958 general election. Moynihan returned to academia, serving as a lecturer for brief periods at [[Russell Sage College]] (1957\u20131958) and the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] (1959) before taking a tenure-track position at Syracuse University (1959\u20131961). During this period, Moynihan was a delegate to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] as part of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s delegate pool.\n\n===Kennedy and Johnson Administrations; controversy over the War on Poverty===\nMoynihan first served in the Kennedy administration as special (1961\u20131962) and executive (1962\u20131963) assistant to [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretaries]] [[Arthur J. Goldberg]] and [[W. Willard Wirtz]]. In 1962, he authored the directive \"Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture\", which discouraged use of an official style for [[Federal building|federal buildings,]] and has been credited with enabling \"a wide ranging set of innovative public building projects\" in subsequent decades, including the [[San Francisco Federal Building]] and the [[United States Courthouse (Austin, Texas, 2012)|United States Courthouse in Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/news/article/150182232/new-executive-order-could-make-classical-architecture-the-preferred-and-default-style-for-america-s-public-buildings|title=New executive order could make classical architecture \"the preferred and default style\" for America's public buildings|last=Pacheco|first=Antonio|date=2020-02-04|website=Archinect|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\nHe was then appointed as [[United States Department of Labor|Assistant Secretary of Labor]] for Policy, Planning and Research, serving from 1963 to 1965 under Kennedy and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In this capacity, he did not have operational responsibilities. He devoted his time to trying to formulate national policy for what would become the [[War on Poverty]]. His small staff included [[Ralph Nader]].\n\nThey took inspiration from historian [[Stanley Elkins]]'s ''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' (1959). Elkins essentially contended that [[slavery]] had made black Americans dependent on the dominant society, and that such dependence still existed a century later after the American Civil War. Moynihan and his staff believed that government must go beyond simply ensuring that members of minority groups have the same rights as the majority and must also \"act affirmatively\" in order to counter the problem of historic discrimination.\n\nMoynihan's research of Labor Department data demonstrated that even as fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments in certain parts of the United States.\n\nMoynihan issued his research in 1965 under the title ''[[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action]]'', now commonly known as ''The Moynihan Report''. Moynihan's report<ref name=\"dol\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|publisher=dol.gov|title=U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 History \u2013 The Negro Family \u2013 The Case for National Action (Moynihan's War on Poverty report)|accessdate=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120102028/https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|archive-date=2017-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> fueled a debate over the proper course for government to take with regard to the economic underclass, especially blacks. Critics on the left attacked it as \"[[Victim blaming|blaming the victim]]\",<ref>''The National Review''; March 27, 2003</ref> a slogan coined by psychologist [[William Ryan (psychologist)|William Ryan]].<ref>See William Ryan, ''Blaming the Victim,'' Random House, 1971</ref> Some suggested that Moynihan was propagating the views of racists<ref>Graebner, William. \"The End of Liberalism: Narrating Welfare's Decline, from the Moynihan Report (1965) to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (1996)\", ''Journal of Policy History'', Vol. 14, Number 2, 2002, pp. 170\u2013190</ref> because much of the press coverage of the report focused on the discussion of children being born out of wedlock. Despite Moynihan's warnings, the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) program included rules for payments only if no \"Man [was] in the house.\"<ref>http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Man-in-the-House+Rule</ref> Critics said that the nation was paying poor women to throw their husbands out of the house.\n\nAfter the 1994 [[Republican Revolution|Republican sweep of Congress]], Moynihan agreed that correction was needed for a welfare system that possibly encouraged women to raise their children without fathers: \"The Republicans are saying we have a hell of a problem, and we do.\"<ref name=\"time1994\">{{cite magazine |first=Richard|last=Lacayo|title= Down on the Downtrodden |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982006,00.html |magazine=Time Magazine |date=December 19, 1994 |accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>\n\n===Local New York City politics and ongoing academic career===\nBy the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], Moynihan was recognized as a political ally of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. For this reason he was not favored by then-President Johnson, and he left the Johnson Administration in 1965. He ran for office in the Democratic Party primary for the presidency of the [[New York City Council]], a position now known as the [[New York City Public Advocate]]. However, he was defeated by Queens District Attorney [[Frank D. O'Connor]].\n\nDuring this transitional period, Moynihan maintained an academic affiliation as a fellow at [[Wesleyan University]]'s Center for Advanced Studies from 1964 to 1967. In 1966, he was appointed to the faculties of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education]] and [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Graduate School of Public Administration]] as a full professor of education and urban politics. After commencing a second extended leave because of his public service in 1973, his faculty line was transferred to the University's Department of Government, where he remained until 1977. From 1966 to 1969, he also held a secondary administrative appointment as director of the [[Harvard\u2013MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]].<ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\"/> With turmoil and [[riots]] in the United States, Moynihan, \"a national board member of [[Americans for Democratic Action|ADA]] incensed at the radicalism of the current [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] and [[Black Power]] movements\", decided to \"call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives,\"<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]].

As one of the few people in Nixon's inner circle who had done academic research related to social policies, he was very influential in the early months of the administration. However, his disdain for \"traditional budget-conscious positions\" (including his proposed Family Assistance Plan, a \"[[negative income tax]] or [[guaranteed minimum income]]\" for families that met work requirements or demonstrated that they were seeking work which ultimately stalled in the Senate despite prefiguring the later [[Supplemental Security Income]] program) led to frequent clashes (belying their unwavering mutual respect) with Nixon's principal domestic policy advisor, conservative economist and [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet-rank]] [[Counselor to the President]] [[Arthur F. Burns]].<ref name=\"bloomberg\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-28/when-nixon-listened-to-liberal-moynihan|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=When Nixon Listened to Liberal Moynihan \u2013 Bloomberg View|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref>\n\nWhile formulating Nixon's [[Guaranteed minimum income|Guaranteed Annual Income]] (GAI) proposal, Moynihan conducted significant discussions concerning a [[Basic Income Guarantee]] with [[Russell B.

Accordingly, operational oversight of the Urban Affairs Council was given to Moynihan's nominal successor as Domestic Policy Assistant, former [[White House Counsel]] [[John Ehrlichman]].

The relationship between the two countries was at a low point following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Ambassador Moynihan was alarmed that two great democracies were cast as antagonists, and set out to fix things. He proposed that part of the burdensome debt be written off, part used to pay for US embassy expenses in India, and the remaining converted into Indian [[Indian rupee|rupees]] to fund an Indo-US cultural and educational exchange program that lasted for a quarter century. On February 18, 1974, he presented to the Government of India a check for 16,640,000,000 rupees, then equivalent to $2,046,700,000, which was the greatest amount paid by a single check in the history of banking.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/11/moynihan-letters-201011 An American Original], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', October 2010</ref> The \"Rupee Deal\" is logged in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the world's largest check, written by Ambassador Moynihan to Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]].<ref>[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/america-can-learn-from-india/1/119060.html America can learn from India], ''[[India Today]]'', November 6, 2010</ref>\n\nIn June 1975, Moynihan accepted his third offer to serve as United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a position (including a rotation as President of the [[United Nations Security Council]]) that he would only hold until February 1976.

[[Gerald Ford]] considered Indonesia, then under a military dictatorship, a key ally against [[Communism]], which was influential in East Timor. Moynihan ensured that the [[UN Security Council]] took no action against the larger nation's annexation of a small country. The Indonesian invasion caused the deaths of 100,000\u2013200,000 Timorese through violence, illness, and hunger.<ref name=CAVR>[http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/Brief.htm Chega!

In his 1993 book on nationalism, ''Pandaemonium'', he wrote that as time progressed, he began to view the [[Soviet Union]] in less ideological terms. He regarded it less as an expansionist, [[imperialist]] [[Marxist]] state, and more as a weak [[political realism|realist]] state in decline. He believed it was most motivated by self-preservation. This view would influence his thinking in subsequent years, when he became an outspoken proponent of the then-unpopular view that the Soviet Union was a [[failed state]] headed for implosion.\n\nNevertheless, Moynihan's tenure at the UN marked the beginnings of a more bellicose, [[neoconservative]] American foreign policy that turned away from Kissinger's unabashedly covert, [[d\u00e9tente]]-driven [[realpolitik]].<ref>''Moynihan's Moment'', p. 159</ref> Although it was never substantiated, Moynihan initially believed that Kissinger directed [[Ivor Richard, Baron Richard]] (then [[British Ambassador to the United Nations]]) to publicly denounce his actions as \"[[Wyatt Earp]]\" diplomacy. Demoralized, Moynihan resigned from what he would subsequently characterize as an \"abbreviated posting\" in February 1976. In ''Pandaemonium'', Moynihan expounded upon this decision, maintaining that he was \"something of an embarrassment to my own government, and fairly soon left before I was fired.\"\n\n===Career in the Senate===\nIn November 1976, Moynihan was elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] from the State of New York, defeating U.S. Representative [[Bella Abzug]], former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]], New York City Council President [[Paul O'Dwyer]] and businessman [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] in the Democratic primary, and [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] incumbent [[James L. Buckley]] in the general election. Shortly after election, Moynihan analyzed the State of New York's budget to determine whether it was paying out more in [[Federal spending and taxation across states|federal taxes than it received in spending]]. Finding that it was, he produced a yearly report known as the ''[[Fisc]]'' (from the French<ref>[http://fiscreport.org/index02a7.html?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=26 \"The History of the Fisc\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, on the Fisc Report website.

Senator [[Kit Bond]], nearing retirement in 2010, recalled with some embarrassment in a conversation on [[civility]] in political discourse that Moynihan had once \"slugged [Bond] on the Senate floor after Bond denounced an [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] Moynihan had slipped into a [[highway]] appropriations bill.

His strongly anti-Soviet views became far more moderate, as he emerged as a critic of the [[Ronald Reagan]] Administration's hawkish [[Cold War]] policies, such as support for the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Moynihan argued there was no active Soviet-backed conspiracy in [[Latin America]], or anywhere. He suggested the Soviets were suffering from massive internal problems, such as rising [[ethnic]] [[nationalism]] and a collapsing economy. In a December 21, 1986, editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Moynihan predicted the replacement on the world stage of Communist expansion with ethnic conflicts. He criticized the Reagan Administration's \"consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism \u2013 which is not in fact going on.\" In a September 8, 1990, letter to [[Erwin Griswold]], Moynihan wrote: \"I have one purpose left in life; or at least in the Senate. It is to try to sort out what would be involved in reconstituting the American government in the aftermath of the cold war.

He said of the procedure: \"I think this is just too close to [[infanticide]]. A child has been born and it has exited the [[uterus]]. What on Earth is this procedure?\" Earlier in his career in the Senate, Moynihan had expressed his annoyance with the adamantly pro-choice interest groups petitioning him and others on the issue.

As chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]] in the 1990s, he strongly opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s proposal to expand health care coverage to all Americans. Seeking to focus the debate over health insurance on the financing of health care, Moynihan garnered controversy by stating that \"there is no health care crisis in this country.\"\n\nOn other issues though, he was much more progressive. He voted against the [[death penalty]]; the [[flag desecration amendment]];<ref>{{USBill|106|SJ|14}}, 106th Congress, 2nd Session, [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&session=2&vote=00048#position Record Vote Number: 48]</ref> the [[balanced budget amendment]], the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]]; the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]; the [[Communications Decency Act]]; and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. He was critical of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a [[flat tax]]. Moynihan also voted against authorization of the [[Gulf War]]. Despite his earlier writings on the negative effects of the welfare state, he ended by voting against [[welfare reform]] in 1996, a bill that removed unemployment benefits. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who crossed party lines to support it.\n\n==Public speaker==\nMoynihan was a popular public speaker with a distinctly [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] style. He had some peculiar mannerisms of speech, in the form of slight stuttering and drawn-out vowels for emphasis. Linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] compared his speaking style to that of [[William F.

Moynihan chaired the Commission, which studied and made recommendations on the \"culture of secrecy\" that pervaded the United States government and its intelligence community for 80 years, beginning with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], and made recommendations on the statutory regulation of classified information.\n\nThe Commission's findings and recommendations were presented to the President in 1997. As part of the effort, Moynihan secured release from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] of its classified [[Venona]] file. This file documents the FBI's joint [[counterintelligence]] investigation, with the United States [[Arlington Hall|Signals Intelligence Service]], into Soviet espionage within the United States. Much of the information had been collected and classified as secret information for over 50 years.\n\nAfter release of the information, Moynihan authored ''Secrecy: The American Experience''<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300080794|title= Secrecy: The American Experience |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref> where he discussed the impact government secrecy has had on the domestic politics of America for the past half century, and how myths and suspicion created an unnecessary partisan chasm.\n\n==Career as scholar==\nAs a [[public intellectual]], Moynihan published articles on urban ethnic politics and on the problems of the poor in cities of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] in numerous publications, including ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and ''[[The Public Interest]]''.\n\nMoynihan coined the term \"professionalization of reform,\" by which the government bureaucracy thinks up problems for government to solve rather than simply responding to problems identified elsewhere.<ref>''The Public Interest'', volume 1, Issue 1 1965</ref>\n\nIn 1983, he was awarded the [[Hubert H.

Will]], to remark that Moynihan \"wrote more books than most senators have read.\" After retiring from the Senate, he rejoined the faculty of the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] at [[Syracuse University]], where he began his academic career in 1959.\n\nMoynihan's scholarly accomplishments led [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]], writing in  ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' to describe the senator as \"the nation's best thinker among politicians since [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and its best politician among thinkers since [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]].\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Almanac of American Politics 2000 |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit) |author2=Grant Ujifusa |year=1999 |publisher=National Journal |location=Washington D.C. |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/1090 1090\u20131091] |quote=Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson, now approaches the end of a long career in public office. |url=https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/1090 }}</ref> Moynihan's 1993 article, \"Defining Deviancy Down\",<ref>''The American Scholar'', vol. 62, no. 1, winter 1993, pp. 17\u20133</ref> was notably controversial.<ref name=\"sunysuffolk\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/formans/DefiningDeviancy.htm|publisher=www2.sunysuffolk.edu|title=Defining Deviancy|accessdate=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128102459/http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/formans/DefiningDeviancy.htm|archive-date=2017-01-28|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"barrypopik\">{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/defining_deviancy_down_daniel_patrick_moynihan|publisher=barrypopik.com|title=The Big Apple: \"Defining deviancy down\" (Daniel Patrick Moynihan)|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===Selected books===\n* ''Beyond the Melting Pot'', an influential study of [[American (ethnicity)|American ethnicity]], which he co-authored with [[Nathan Glazer]] (1963)\n* ''[[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action]]'', known as the ''Moynihan Report'' (1965)\n* ''Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding: Community Action in the War on Poverty'' (1969) {{ISBN|0-02-922000-9}}\n* ''Violent Crimes'' (1970) {{ISBN|0-8076-6053-1}}\n* ''Coping: Essays on the Practice of Government'' (1973) {{ISBN|0-394-48324-3}}\n* ''The Politics of a Guaranteed Income: The Nixon Administration and the Family Assistance Plan'' (1973) {{ISBN|0-394-46354-4}}.\n* ''Business and Society in Change'' (1975) {{OCLC|1440432}}\n* ''A Dangerous Place'' coauthor [[Suzanne Garment]],  (1978) {{ISBN|0-316-58699-4}}\n* ''Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year'', 1980 (1980) {{ISBN|1-56554-516-8}}\n* ''Family and Nation: The Godkin Lectures'' (1986) {{ISBN|0-15-630140-7}}\n* ''Came the Revolution'' (1988)\n* ''On the Law of Nations'' (1990) {{ISBN|0-674-63576-0}}\n* ''Pandaemonium: Ethnicity in International Politics'' (1994) {{ISBN|0-19-827946-9}}\n* ''Miles to Go: A Personal History of Social Policy'' (1996) {{ISBN|0-674-57441-9}}\n* ''Secrecy: The American Experience'' (1998) {{ISBN|0-300-08079-4}}\n* ''Future of the Family'' (2003) {{ISBN|0-87154-628-0}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n* The 5th Annual [[Heinz Award]] in Public Policy (1999)<ref name=\"heinzawards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/daniel-patrick-moynihan|publisher=heinzawards.net|title=The Heinz Awards :: Daniel Patrick Moynihan |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n* [[honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from Tufts, his alma mater.\n* 1989 [[Honor Award]] from the [[National Building Museum]]<ref>[http://www.nbm.org/support-us/awards_honors/honor-award/ Award: Daniel Patrick Moynihan], National Building Museum</ref>\n* In 1989, Moynihan received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].<ref name=\"jeffersonawards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|publisher=jeffersonawards.org|title=Jefferson Awards FoundationNational \u2013 Jefferson Awards Foundation|accessdate=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124043935/http://jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|archive-date=November 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* On August 9, 2000, he was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[William Clinton|Clinton]].<ref name=\"usinfo\">{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.org/wf-archive/2000/000810/epf405.htm|publisher=usinfo.org|title=American Spaces &#8211;
