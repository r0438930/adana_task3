The style of the show is slower-paced and more observational than traditional comedies, with elements of drama, surrealism, and philosophy throughout.

He wrote an article on [[IndieWire]] detailing his process.<ref name=\"keithpowell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/30-rock-star-keith-powell-secret-to-making-a-great-web-series-on-a-tiny-budget-20150918|title='30 Rock' Star Keith Powell's Secret to Making a Great Se \u2013 Indiewire|author=Keith Powell|date=18 September 2015|work=Indiewire}}</ref>\n\nThe series is filmed on location in [[Los Angeles, California]] in Powell's real life home.  Additionally, the home was featured on [[HGTV]]'s \"[[House Hunters]] Renovation\" and \"House Hunters Where Are They Now?\"\n\nThe color palette of the show is highly saturated, highlighting the colors blue and red.  Powell has stated that the entire production time took longer than usual due to the low budget of the series.  In addition, Powell employed the use of drone cameras to take the place of cranes and dollies, and the series was shot exclusively on DSLR cameras.<ref name=\"keithpowell\"/>\n\nThe theme song is composed by [[30 Rock]] co-composer Giancarlo Vulcano, inspired by the Motown sound of the 1960s.

He wrote an article on [[IndieWire]] detailing his process.<ref name=\"keithpowell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/30-rock-star-keith-powell-secret-to-making-a-great-web-series-on-a-tiny-budget-20150918|title='30 Rock' Star Keith Powell's Secret to Making a Great Se \u2013 Indiewire|author=Keith Powell|date=18 September 2015|work=Indiewire}}</ref>\n\nThe series is filmed on location in [[Los Angeles, California]] in Powell's real life home.  Additionally, the home was featured on [[HGTV]]'s \"[[House Hunters]] Renovation\" and \"House Hunters Where Are They Now?\"\n\nThe color palette of the show is highly saturated, highlighting the colors blue and red.  Powell has stated that the entire production time took longer than usual due to the low budget of the series.  In addition, Powell employed the use of drone cameras to take the place of cranes and dollies, and the series was shot exclusively on DSLR cameras.<ref name=\"keithpowell\"/>\n\nThe theme song is composed by [[30 Rock]] co-composer Giancarlo Vulcano, inspired by the Motown sound of the 1960s.  Vulcano also collaborated with Powell for the score of ''[[My Name Is David]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giancarlovulcano.com/|title=GIANCARLOVULCANO.COM|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nAfter the release of the first six episodes, [[Tubefilter]] called the series a \"sleek, well shot, reasonably funny web series\" and concluded \"it's a nice way to spend an hour.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2015/08/25/keith-powell-broke-his-leg-web-series/|title=Keith Powell Of \u201830 Rock\u2019 Breaks A Leg In New Web Series|work=Tubefilter}}</ref>  [[TV Insider]] stated \"For seven seasons, Keith Powell was 30 Rock\u2019s uptight and under-appreciated \u201cToofer\u201d Spurlock, but now, the man who battled Frank Rossitano for the right to wear Harvard gear and battled Tracy Jordan over a certain word is stepping, with the help of crutches, into his own spotlight.\"<ref name=\"tvinsider.com\"/>  Review & Roast pointed out that Powell and Knox \"played well off each other and it was obvious they had real chemistry.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewandroast.com/keith-broke-his-leg/review/|title=Review \u2013 Review and Roast|work=Review and Roast}}</ref> Reviewing the show at the [[Raindance Film Festival]], Vodzilla noted the show's dry pace, stating, \"That mundane approach makes for a relatable series which lacks in laugh-out-loud moments but builds up to them with a restraint and gentle tone that makes them more satisfying... there\u2019s surprising substance here.\" <ref>http://vodzilla.co/reviews/raindance-web-fest-2016-reviews-il-sonnambulo-keith-broke-his-leg-match-not-found-almost-asian/</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\nIn 2016, Powell won the Best Actor (Comedy) award at the [[New York Television Festival]].<ref>http://www.indiewire.com/2016/10/new-york-television-festival-award-winners-nytvf-1201741579/</ref>\n\nThe series was nominated for seven 2016 [[Indie Series Awards]], winning two, including Best Web Series \u2013 Comedy.<ref name=\"7th Indie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.indieseriesawards.com/2016/02/nominations-announced-for-7th-annual.html |date=February 3, 2016 |title=Nominations Announced For 7th Annual ISAs |publisher=Indie Series Awards |accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref>  In 2017, it was nominated for an additional six [[Indie Series Awards]].<ref>http://www.indieseriesnetwork.org/2017/02/nominees-announced-for-8th-annual-indie.html</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable  style=\"width:100%\"\n! style=\"background:#6495ED;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#6495ED;\"| Award\n! style=\"background:#6495ED;\"| Category\n! style=\"background:#6495ED;\"| Nominee(s)\n! style=\"background:#6495ED;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"| 2016\n| rowspan=\"7\" align=\"left\"| [[7th Indie Series Awards]]\n| Best Web Series \u2014 Comedy\n|\n| {{Won}} <ref name=\"7th Indie\"/>\n|-\n| Best Lead Actor \u2014 Comedy\n| [[Keith Powell]] as Keith\n| {{Won}} <ref name=\"7th Indie\"/>\n|-\n| Best Directing \u2014 Comedy\n| [[Keith Powell]]\n| {{nom}} <ref name=\"7th Indie\"/>\n|-\n| Best Writing \u2014 Comedy\n| [[Keith Powell]]\n| {{nom}} <ref name=\"7th Indie\"/>\n|-\n| Best Lead Actress \u2014 Comedy\n| Jill Knox as Jill\n| {{nom}} <ref name=\"7th Indie\"/>\n|-\n| Best Guest Actress \u2014 Comedy\n|  [[Alexandra Krosney]] as Alex\n| {{nom}} <ref name=\"7th Indie\"/>\n|-\n| Best Sound Design\n|  Richard Sheehan\n| {{nom}} <ref name=\"7th Indie\"/>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 2017\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"left\"| [[8th Indie Series Awards]]\n| Best Web Series \u2014 Comedy\n|\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Writing \u2014 Comedy\n| [[Keith Powell]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Lead Actor \u2014 Comedy\n| [[Keith Powell]] as Keith\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actress \u2014 Comedy\n| Jill Knox as Jill\n| {{Won}}\n|-\n| Best Guest Actor \u2014 Comedy\n|  Nic Few as Nic\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Production Design\n|  Jill Knox\n| {{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=tt5339506|name=Keith Broke His Leg}}\n\n[[Category:2015 web series debuts]]\n[[Category:American comedy web series]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Broke_His_Leg"}
