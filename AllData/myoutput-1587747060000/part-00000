According to the writer of [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] (7:13-17) Jesus is considered a priest in the order of Melchizedek because, like Melchizedek, Jesus was not a [[Kohen|descendant of Aaron]], and thus would not qualify for the Jewish priesthood under the [[Law of Moses]].\n\nMelchizedek is referred to again in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 5:6-10; Hebrews 6:20; Hebrews 7:1-21: \"Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek\"; and Hebrews 8:1.\n\n<blockquote>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises\" (Hebrews 7:5-6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law\" (Hebrews 7:11-12).</blockquote>\n\nThe author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] in the [[New Testament]] discussed this subject considerably, listing the following reasons for why the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the Aaronic priesthood:\n\n#Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek; later, the Levites would receive tithes from their countrymen. Since Aaron was in Abraham's loins then, it was as if the Aaronic priesthood were paying tithes to Melchizedek. (Heb. 7:4-10)\n#The one who blesses is always greater than the one being blessed. Thus, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham.  As Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham, it follows that Melchizedek is greater than Levi. (Heb. 7:7-10)\n#If the priesthood of Aaron were effective, God would not have called a new priest in a different order in Psalm 110. (Heb. 7:11)\n#The basis of the Aaronic priesthood was ancestry; the basis of the priesthood of Melchizedek is everlasting life. That is, there is no interruption due to a priest's death. (Heb. 7:8,15-16,23-25)\n#Christ, being sinless, does not need a sacrifice for his own sins. (Heb. 7:26-27)\n#The priesthood of Melchizedek is more effective because it required a single sacrifice once and for all (Jesus), while the Levitical priesthood made endless sacrifices. (Heb. 7:27)\n#The [[kohen|Aaronic priests]] serve (or, rather, served) in an earthly copy and shadow of the heavenly Temple, which Jesus serves in. (Heb. 8:5)\n\nThe epistle goes on to say that the [[New Covenant (theology)|covenant]] of Jesus is superior to the [[Mosaic Covenant|covenant]] the Levitical priesthood is under. Some Christians hold that Melchizedek was a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ, and some other Christians hold that Melchizedek indeed ''was'' Christ. Reasons provided include that Melchizedek's name means \"king of righteousness\" according to the author of Hebrews, and that being king of Salem makes Melchizedek the \"king of peace\". Heb. 7:3 states, \"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he (Melchizedek) remains a priest forever.\" Melchizedek gave Abraham bread and wine, which some Christians consider symbols of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice to confirm a covenant.\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[Catholicism|Catholics]] find the roots of their priesthood in the tradition of Melchizedek (CCC 1544).<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722004028/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM |date=July 22, 2016 }} \"The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, \"priest of God Most High,\" as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the unique \"high priest after the order of Melchizedek\";16 \"holy, blameless, unstained,\"</ref> In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18, Melchizedek offers a sacrifice of bread and wine.
