{"title_page": "History of science and technology", "text_new": "{{For|historical accounts of the development of science and technology|History of science|History of technology}}\n\nThe '''history of science and technology''' ('''HST''') is a field of [[history]] which examines how understanding of the natural world (science) and ability to manipulate it ([[technology]]) have changed over the centuries.  This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.\n\n[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with [[William Whewell]], as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian [[Boris Hessen]], was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After [[World War&nbsp;II]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by [[Thomas Kuhn]], the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. \n\n== Universities with HST programs ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n* [[Buenos Aires Institute of Technology]], Argentina, has been offering courses on History of the Technology and the Science.\n* [[National Technological University]], Argentina, has a complete history program on its offered careers.\n\n=== Australia ===\n* [[The University of Sydney]] offers both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the History and Philosophy of Science, run by the Unit for the History and Philosophy of Science, within the Science Faculty. Undergraduate coursework can be completed as part of either a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts Degree.  Undergraduate study can be furthered by completing an additional Honours year. For postgraduate study, the Unit offers both coursework and research based degrees. The two course-work based postgraduate degrees are the Graduate Certificate in Science (HPS) and the Graduate Diploma in Science (HPS). The two research based postgraduate degrees are a Master of Science (MSc) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).<ref>{{cite web | author = The University of Sydney | title = History and Philosophy of Science | url = http://www.usyd.edu.au/hps | accessdate = December 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n=== Belgium ===\n* [[University of Li\u00e8ge]], has a Department called Centre d'histoire des Sciences et Techniques.<ref>{{cite web | author = Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge | title = CHST | url = http://chst.european-is.net/ | accessdate = January 3, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100205103256/http://chst.european-is.net/ | archive-date = February 5, 2010 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Canada ===\n* [[Carleton University]] Ottawa offer courses in Ancient Science and Technology in its Technology, Society and Environment program.\n* [[University of Toronto]] has a program in History and Philosophy of Science and Technology.<ref>{{cite web | author = University of Toronto | title = History and Philosophy of Science and Technology | url = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/ihpst/ | accessdate = July 30, 2006 }}</ref>\n* [[University of King's College]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia has a History of Science and Technology Program.<ref>{{cite web | author = University of King's College | title = History of Science & Technology | date = 8 September 2016 | url = http://ukings.ca/area-of-study/history-of-science-and-technology | accessdate = November 14, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n=== France ===\n* [[Nantes University]] has a dedicated Department called [http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/cfv/ Centre Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te].\n* [[Paris 7 - Denis Diderot University|Paris Diderot University]] (Paris 7) has a Department of History and Philosophy of Science.\n* A CNRS research center in History and Philosophy of Science [http://www.sphere.univ-paris-diderot.fr/spip.php?rubrique48 SPHERE], affiliated with Paris Diderot University, has a dedicated [http://www.rehseis.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article958 history of technology] section.\n* [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne|Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] (Paris 1)  has a dedicated [https://web.archive.org/web/20090416200543/http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/ Institute of History and Philosophy of Science and Technics].\n* The [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] de Paris has a history of science Department.\n\n=== Germany ===\n* [[Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin]], has a program in the History of Science and Technology.<ref>{{cite web|author=Berlin Technical University |title=Philosophy, Theory of Science, and History of Science and Technology |url=http://www.tu-berlin.de/fak1/philosophie/ |accessdate=July 30, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719212353/http://www.tu-berlin.de/fak1/philosophie/ |archivedate=July 19, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Greece ===\n* The [[University of Athens]] has a Department of Philosophy and History of Science [https://web.archive.org/web/20100220020924/http://www.phs.uoa.gr/node.php?n=home&lang=en]\n\n=== India ===\nHistory of science and technology is a well developed field in India.

Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.<ref>Nathan Reingold, \"History of Science Today, 1.

This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.\n\n[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with [[William Whewell]], as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian [[Boris Hessen]], was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After [[World War&nbsp;II]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by [[Thomas Kuhn]], the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. \n\n== Universities with HST programs ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n* [[Buenos Aires Institute of Technology]], Argentina, has been offering courses on History of the Technology and the Science.\n* [[National Technological University]], Argentina, has a complete history program on its offered careers.\n\n=== Australia ===\n* [[The University of Sydney]] offers both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the History and Philosophy of Science, run by the Unit for the History and Philosophy of Science, within the Science Faculty.

For postgraduate study, the Unit offers both coursework and research based degrees. The two course-work based postgraduate degrees are the Graduate Certificate in Science (HPS) and the Graduate Diploma in Science (HPS). The two research based postgraduate degrees are a Master of Science (MSc) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).<ref>{{cite web | author = The University of Sydney | title = History and Philosophy of Science | url = http://www.usyd.edu.au/hps | accessdate = December 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n=== Belgium ===\n* [[University of Li\u00e8ge]], has a Department called Centre d'histoire des Sciences et Techniques.<ref>{{cite web | author = Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge | title = CHST | url = http://chst.european-is.net/ | accessdate = January 3, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100205103256/http://chst.european-is.net/ | archive-date = February 5, 2010 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Canada ===\n* [[Carleton University]] Ottawa offer courses in Ancient Science and Technology in its Technology, Society and Environment program.\n* [[University of Toronto]] has a program in History and Philosophy of Science and Technology.<ref>{{cite web | author = University of Toronto | title = History and Philosophy of Science and Technology | url = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/ihpst/ | accessdate = July 30, 2006 }}</ref>\n* [[University of King's College]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia has a History of Science and Technology Program.<ref>{{cite web | author = University of King's College | title = History of Science & Technology | date = 8 September 2016 | url = http://ukings.ca/area-of-study/history-of-science-and-technology | accessdate = November 14, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n=== France ===\n* [[Nantes University]] has a dedicated Department called [http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/cfv/ Centre Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te].\n* [[Paris 7 - Denis Diderot University|Paris Diderot University]] (Paris 7) has a Department of History and Philosophy of Science.\n* A CNRS research center in History and Philosophy of Science [http://www.sphere.univ-paris-diderot.fr/spip.php?rubrique48 SPHERE], affiliated with Paris Diderot University, has a dedicated [http://www.rehseis.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article958 history of technology] section.\n* [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne|Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] (Paris 1)  has a dedicated [https://web.archive.org/web/20090416200543/http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/ Institute of History and Philosophy of Science and Technics].\n* The [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] de Paris has a history of science Department.\n\n=== Germany ===\n* [[Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin]], has a program in the History of Science and Technology.<ref>{{cite web|author=Berlin Technical University |title=Philosophy, Theory of Science, and History of Science and Technology |url=http://www.tu-berlin.de/fak1/philosophie/ |accessdate=July 30, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719212353/http://www.tu-berlin.de/fak1/philosophie/ |archivedate=July 19, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Greece ===\n* The [[University of Athens]] has a Department of Philosophy and History of Science [https://web.archive.org/web/20100220020924/http://www.phs.uoa.gr/node.php?n=home&lang=en]\n\n=== India ===\nHistory of science and technology is a well developed field in India.

Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.<ref>Nathan Reingold, \"History of Science Today, 1.
