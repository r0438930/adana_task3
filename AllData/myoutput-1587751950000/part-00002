Five of these inlets are natural and have mobility characteristics.  The sixth is an artificial inlet that was opened with the purpose of allowing easier access to the port of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].\n\nPresently the main inlet of the system is the Faro-Olh\u00e3o inlet, which was artificially opened. The process started in 1927 but only in 1952 were the engineering works completed and it assumed the present configuration.\n\nWithin the Ria Formosa system, different and sometimes antagonistic uses may be found. Part of the system is a Natural Park but Ria Formosa also plays an important role in the region's economy.  Beyond the tourist use the system also supports other economic activities like seafood farms (including [[grooved carpet shell]] harvesting) and the port of Faro.\n\nThe Ria Formosa is also a designated [[Conservation areas of Portugal|Natural Park]] of over 170 km\u00b2 and a stopping place for hundreds of different birds during the spring and autumn migratory periods.\n\nThe most important cities near the Ria Formosa are [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]], [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] and [[Olh\u00e3o]].\n\nThere are also some towns in this area, whose names are: [[Fuzeta]] (which belongs to the municipality of [[Olh\u00e3o]]), [[Santa Luzia (Tavira)|Santa Luzia]], [[Cabanas de Tavira]] (these last two belonging to [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) and [[Cacela Velha]] (which belongs to [[Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Municipality|Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio]]).\n\nSeveral buses run from Tavira to Cabanas and back each weekday, but there are no buses on Saturday afternoons nor all day Sundays and Holidays, even in summer.  The nearest train station is in nearby [[Concei\u00e7\u00e3o (Tavira)|Concei\u00e7\u00e3o]] which is on the Tavira to Vila Real line. That's about {{convert|1|mi|km}} and an easy walk. Trains stop there daily, but at very irregular intervals of 1-3 h.\n\n== Entertainment ==\nLittle villages and towns in the area, such as [[Cabanas de Tavira]], have a large number of bars, caf\u00e9s and restaurants which run along the riverfront and are also dotted around a couple of blocks inland.\nAnnually, about 30'000 birds can be observed from Ria Formosa, since the region serves as a migratory corridor and contains some the last remaining nesting grounds in Europe for some bird species.\n\n== Beaches ==\n\nThe coast of east Algarve has a remarkably mild climate, with sunny days all year round.  Winters are usually mild and summers are not very hot.  Because of these features, beaches in the Ria Formosa area are well known, like [[Vale do Lobo]], [[Faro Island]], [[Culatra]], [[Barril (Tavira)|Barril]], [[Tavira Island]], [[Cabanas de Tavira]], [[Cacela Velha]] and [[Manta Rota]].  Barril attracts a good number of [[naturist]]s.
