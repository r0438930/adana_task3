These monarchies are united by the [[personal union]] of their [[monarch]], but they are independent states. The concept of the Crown developed first in [[Kingdom of England|England]] as a separation of the literal crown and property of the kingdom from the person and personal property of the monarch. It spread through English and later [[British Empire|British colonisation]] and is now rooted in the legal lexicon of the United Kingdom, its Crown dependencies, and the other 15 independent realms.

The monarch can act in an official capacity (as the Crown) and in a private capacity.  This duality of characterization can be illustrated in several ways.  In property ownership for example, although both are [[List of British royal residences|royal residences]], [[Buckingham Palace]] is the property of the Crown via the [[Crown Estate]] (an organ of government) whilst [[Balmoral Castle]] is the property of Elizabeth II personally, and not of the Crown.  The latter property can be freely alienated by the Queen, whereas any disposition of the former property would need to be done via instrument of government as an act of state.  Similarly, the Queen's bank accounts at [[Coutts]] (a private entity, albeit whose parent entity, [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], is coincidentally majority-owned by the state as a result of a bail-out of the bank during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]])  contain components of her private wealth only, whilst the resources of the monarch acting as the Crown are dispensed from [[HM Treasury]] and the Crown Estate to the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]].  A third example is in employment relationships; Elizabeth II can use her private resources to employ persons to run her private affairs (even if in practice it is likely that her private enterprises such as the Balmoral and Sandringham estates are structured as companies, which as entities with separate legal personality in Scots and English law would be the true hirer of an employee, which makes this unlikely in practice). However those who assist as employees of the monarch as the Crown (e.g. the staff at Buckingham Palace) do so on employment from the Royal Household, the official department charged with supporting the monarch.  Those who are directly appointed to official positions by the monarch (commissions in the Army, judges of the courts of England and Wales, governors of Canadian provinces to take discrete examples) form a third category, where the Crown as monarch begins to blend into the Crown as state.  Strictly speaking, government officials are for the service of the monarch acting officially, whilst she might hire private advocates to pursue actions in her private life.  Thus the monarch's main lawyer as to English law is the government's lawyer, the [[Attorney General of England and Wales|Attorney General]], but in her private capacity she instructs [[Farrer & Co]], an independent law firm.\n\nNote that whilst there is a distinction between the monarch's two capacities, official and private, there is an exception to this rule, where there is unity of capacities; this being the style and form of address of the monarch.  As described in ''[[MacCormick v Lord Advocate]]'', amongst the [[royal prerogative]]s is the right and authority of the monarch to style themselves, and command others to so style them, with such combination of name and [[regnal number]] as they wish (thus Albert, Duke of York designated himself [[George VI]] on his accession to the throne).  Accompanying this style is the form of address of the monarch.  This varies across commonwealth realms, but in all is the monarch addressed as \"Your Majesty\".  This royal prerogative, and the various [[Letters Patent]] which buttress it, derive entirely from the monarch acting or existing in an official capacity.  However it is also transcribed over into the monarch's private sphere as well: Elizabeth II is never correctly referred to as Elizabeth Windsor in any capacity.\n\nThe Crown, when referencing the monarch as opposed to the state, can only refer to the monarch alone.  It does not refer to any other member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], though such royals typically represent the Crown in engagements, and hold (usually ceremonial) Crown positions.  In this manner they are agents and servants of the Crown in similar manner to ministers, judges, soldiers, and civil servants.\n\n==Divisibility of the Crown==\nHistorically, the Crown was considered to be indivisible. Two judgments\u2014''Ex parte'' Indian Association of Alberta ([[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|EWCA]], 1982) and ''Ex parte'' Quark ([[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|House of Lords]], 2005)\u2014challenged that view. Today, the Crown is considered separate in every country, province, state, or territory, regardless of its degree of independence, that has the shared monarch as part of the local government, though limitations on the power of the monarch in right of each territory vary according to relevant laws, thus making the difference between full sovereignty, semi-sovereignty, dependency, etc. The Lords of Appeal wrote: \"The Queen is as much the Queen of New South Wales and Mauritius and other territories acknowledging her as head of state as she is of England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom.\"<ref>Lords of Appeal, [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd051013/quark-1.htm ''Ex parte'' Quark, 2005]</ref>\n\n===Commonwealth realms===\n[[File:Queen Elizabeth II in March 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Elizabeth II]] is the living embodiment of the Crown in each of her [[Commonwealth realm]]s]]\nThe Crown in each of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s is a similar, but separate, legal concept.

The reserve powers of the Crown for each territory are no longer considered to be exercisable on the advice of the UK government.  To comply with the court's decision, the territorial governors now act on the advice of each territory's executive and the UK government can no longer disallow legislation passed by territorial legislatures.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HhsZSMEH5DoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Overseas Territories: Seventh Report of Session 2007\u201308, Vol. 2: Oral and Written Evidence''].  London UK: The Stationery Office, 6 July 2008, pp. 49, 296\u2013297</ref>\n\n==In the courts==\nIn [[criminal law|criminal proceedings]], the state is the prosecuting party and is usually designated on the title or name of a case as \"R v\" \u2013 where ''R'' can stand for either ''Rex'' (if the current monarch is male) or ''Regina'' (if the monarch is female) against the [[defendant]]; for example, a criminal case against Smith might be referred to as ''R v Smith'', and verbally read as \"the Crown against Smith\". On the indictment notice, it may state \"The Queen - v - ''Defendant''\" as well as \"R v ''Defendant''\".\n\nOften cases are brought by the Crown according to the complaint of a [[plaintiff|claimant]]. The titles of these case now follow the pattern of \"R (on the application of X) v Y\", notated as \"R (X) v Y\" for short. Thus ''[[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]]'' is ''R (on the application of Miller and other) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union'', where \"Miller\" is [[Gina Miller]], a citizen. Until the end of the twentieth century, such case titles used the pattern ''R v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, [[ex parte]] Miller''.\n\nIn Scotland, criminal prosecutions are undertaken by the [[Lord Advocate]] (or the relevant [[Procurator Fiscal]]) in the name of the Crown. Accordingly, the abbreviation HMA is used in the [[High Court of Justiciary]] for \"His/Her Majesty's Advocate\" in place of ''Rex'' or ''Regina'', as in ''[[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial|HMA v Al Megrahi and Fahima]]''.\n\nIn Australia, each state uses ''R'' in the title of criminal cases and ''The Queen'' (or ''The King'') in criminal appeal cases (i.e., the case name at trial would be ''R v Smith''; if appealed, the case name would be ''Smith v The Queen''). Judges usually refer to the prosecuting party as simply \"the prosecution\" in the text of judgments (only rarely is ''The Crown'' used in the text, and never ''R''). In civil cases where the Crown is a party, it is a customary to list the appropriate government Minister as the party instead. When a case is announced in court, the Clerk or Bailiff refers to the crown orally as \"Our Sovereign Lady the Queen\" (or \"Our Sovereign Lord the King\").\n\nIn [[New Zealand]] court reporting, news reports will refer to the prosecuting lawyer (often called a ''Crown prosecutor'', as in Canada and the United Kingdom) as representing the Crown, usages such as \"For the Crown, Joe Bloggs argued...\" being common.\n\nThis practice of using the seat of [[sovereignty]] as the injured party is analogous with criminal cases in the United States, where the format is \"the People\" or \"the State v. [defendant]\" (e.g., ''[[People v. LaValle|People of the State of New York v. LaValle]]'' or ''[[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Brady]]'') under the doctrine of [[popular sovereignty]]. In Federal criminal cases, it is \"United States v. [defendant],\" as in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]''.\n\nThe Crown can also be a plaintiff or defendant in civil actions to which the government of the Commonwealth realm in question is a party. Such [[Crown proceedings]] are often subject to specific rules and limitations, such as the enforcement of judgments against the Crown.\n\n''[[Qui tam]]'' lawsuits on behalf of the Crown were once common but have been unusual since the [[Common Informers Act 1951]] ended the practice of allowing such suits by common informers.\n\n== Crown forces ==\n{{anchor|Crown forces}}<!-- [[Crown forces]] redirects here-->\nThe term ''crown forces'' has been applied by [[physical force Irish republicanism|militant Irish republicans]] to British-authorised [[security forces]] on the island of [[Ireland]], including the [[British Armed Forces]] and armed police such as the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], which are seen as [[enemy combatant]]s or an [[Military occupation|occupation]] force.{{NoteTag|In [[Danny Morrison (author)|Danny Morrison]]'s words, \"[t]he term 'security forces' suggests [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], which is why republicans prefer terms like 'the Brits' or 'the Crown Forces', which undermines their authority.\"<ref>{{cite web |url  =http://www.irlandinit-hd.de/sub_misc/bsands.htm#Analysis:%20Words%20of%20Freedom |title=Saving 'Bobby Sands Street' > Words of Freedom |last=Morrison |first=Danny |date=24\u201326 January 2004 |work=Irish History |publisher=Irlandinitiative Heidelberg |accessdate=25 August 2015}}</ref>|name=Morrison}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes-Bilger |first=Cordula |title = War Zone Language: Linguistic Aspects of the Conflict in Northern Ireland |year=2007 |publisher=Francke |isbn=9783772082009 |page=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Neill |first=Conor |year=2004 |title=Terrorism, insurgency and the military response from South Armagh to Falluja |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=149 |issue=5 |pages=22\u201325 |issn=0307-1847 |doi = 10.1080/03071840408523120 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Tomaney |first=John |year=2000 |title=End of the Empire State?

These monarchies are united by the [[personal union]] of their [[monarch]], but they are independent states. The concept of the Crown developed first in [[Kingdom of England|England]] as a separation of the literal crown and property of the kingdom from the person and personal property of the monarch. It spread through English and later [[British Empire|British colonisation]] and is now rooted in the legal lexicon of the United Kingdom, its Crown dependencies, and the other 15 independent realms.

The monarch can act in an official capacity (as the Crown) and in a private capacity.  This duality of characterization can be illustrated in several ways.  In property ownership for example, although both are [[List of British royal residences|royal residences]], [[Buckingham Palace]] is the property of the Crown via the [[Crown Estate]] (an organ of government) whilst [[Balmoral Castle]] is the property of Elizabeth II personally, and not of the Crown.  The latter property can be freely alienated by the Queen, whereas any disposition of the former property would need to be done via instrument of government as an act of state.  Similarly, the Queen's bank accounts at [[Coutts]] (a private entity, albeit whose parent entity, [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], is coincidentally majority-owned by the state as a result of a bail-out of the bank during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]])  contain components of her private wealth only, whilst the resources of the monarch acting as the Crown are dispensed from [[HM Treasury]] and the Crown Estate to the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]].  A third example is in employment relationships; Elizabeth II can use her private resources to employ persons to run her private affairs (even if in practice it is likely that her private enterprises such as the Balmoral and Sandringham estates are structured as companies, which as entities with separate legal personality in Scots and English law would be the true hirer of an employee, which makes this unlikely in practice). However those who assist as employees of the monarch as the Crown (e.g. the staff at Buckingham Palace) do so on employment from the Royal Household, the official department charged with supporting the monarch.  Those who are directly appointed to official positions by the monarch (commissions in the Army, judges of the courts of England and Wales, governors of Canadian provinces to take discrete examples) form a third category, where the Crown as monarch begins to blend into the Crown as state.  Strictly speaking, government officials are for the service of the monarch acting officially, whilst she might hire private advocates to pursue actions in her private life.  Thus the monarch's main lawyer as to English law is the government's lawyer, the [[Attorney General of England and Wales|Attorney General]], but in her private capacity she instructs [[Farrer & Co]], an independent law firm.\n\nNote that whilst there is a distinction between the monarch's two capacities, official and private, there is an exception to this rule, where there is unity of capacities; this being the style and form of address of the monarch.  As described in ''[[MacCormick v Lord Advocate]]'', amongst the [[royal prerogative]]s is the right and authority of the monarch to style themselves, and command others to so style them, with such combination of name and [[regnal number]] as they wish (thus Albert, Duke of York designated himself [[George VI]] on his accession to the throne).  Accompanying this style is the form of address of the monarch.  This varies across commonwealth realms, but in all is the monarch addressed as \"Your Majesty\".  This royal prerogative, and the various [[Letters Patent]] which buttress it, derive entirely from the monarch acting or existing in an official capacity.  However it is also transcribed over into the monarch's private sphere as well: Elizabeth II is never correctly referred to as Elizabeth Windsor in any capacity.\n\nThe Crown, when referencing the monarch as opposed to the state, can only refer to the monarch alone.  It does not refer to any other member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], though such royals typically represent the Crown in engagements, and hold (usually ceremonial) Crown positions.  In this manner they are agents and servants of the Crown in similar manner to ministers, judges, soldiers, and civil servants.\n\n==Divisibility of the Crown==\nHistorically, the Crown was considered to be indivisible. Two judgments\u2014''Ex parte'' Indian Association of Alberta ([[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|EWCA]], 1982) and ''Ex parte'' Quark ([[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|House of Lords]], 2005)\u2014challenged that view. Today, the Crown is considered separate in every country, province, state, or territory, regardless of its degree of independence, that has the shared monarch as part of the local government, though limitations on the power of the monarch in right of each territory vary according to relevant laws, thus making the difference between full sovereignty, semi-sovereignty, dependency, etc. The Lords of Appeal wrote: \"The Queen is as much the Queen of New South Wales and Mauritius and other territories acknowledging her as head of state as she is of England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom.\"<ref>Lords of Appeal, [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd051013/quark-1.htm ''Ex parte'' Quark, 2005]</ref>\n\n===Commonwealth realms===\n[[File:Queen Elizabeth II in March 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Elizabeth II]] is the living embodiment of the Crown in each of her [[Commonwealth realm]]s]]\nThe Crown in each of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s is a similar, but separate, legal concept.

The reserve powers of the Crown for each territory are no longer considered to be exercisable on the advice of the UK government.  To comply with the court's decision, the territorial governors now act on the advice of each territory's executive and the UK government can no longer disallow legislation passed by territorial legislatures.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HhsZSMEH5DoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Overseas Territories: Seventh Report of Session 2007\u201308, Vol. 2: Oral and Written Evidence''].  London UK: The Stationery Office, 6 July 2008, pp. 49, 296\u2013297</ref>\n\n==In the courts==\nIn [[criminal law|criminal proceedings]], the state is the prosecuting party and is usually designated on the title or name of a case as \"R v\" \u2013 where ''R'' can stand for either ''Rex'' (if the current monarch is male) or ''Regina'' (if the monarch is female) against the [[defendant]]; for example, a criminal case against Smith might be referred to as ''R v Smith'', and verbally read as \"the Crown against Smith\". On the indictment notice, it may state \"The Queen - v - ''Defendant''\" as well as \"R v ''Defendant''\".\n\nOften cases are brought by the Crown according to the complaint of a [[plaintiff|claimant]]. The titles of these case now follow the pattern of \"R (on the application of X) v Y\", notated as \"R (X) v Y\" for short. Thus ''[[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]]'' is ''R (on the application of Miller and other) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union'', where \"Miller\" is [[Gina Miller]], a citizen. Until the end of the twentieth century, such case titles used the pattern ''R v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, [[ex parte]] Miller''.\n\nIn Scotland, criminal prosecutions are undertaken by the [[Lord Advocate]] (or the relevant [[Procurator Fiscal]]) in the name of the Crown. Accordingly, the abbreviation HMA is used in the [[High Court of Justiciary]] for \"His/Her Majesty's Advocate\" in place of ''Rex'' or ''Regina'', as in ''[[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial|HMA v Al Megrahi and Fahima]]''.\n\nIn Australia, each state uses ''R'' in the title of criminal cases and ''The Queen'' (or ''The King'') in criminal appeal cases (i.e., the case name at trial would be ''R v Smith''; if appealed, the case name would be ''Smith v The Queen''). Judges usually refer to the prosecuting party as simply \"the prosecution\" in the text of judgments (only rarely is ''The Crown'' used in the text, and never ''R''). In civil cases where the Crown is a party, it is a customary to list the appropriate government Minister as the party instead. When a case is announced in court, the Clerk or Bailiff refers to the crown orally as \"Our Sovereign Lady the Queen\" (or \"Our Sovereign Lord the King\").\n\nIn [[New Zealand]] court reporting, news reports will refer to the prosecuting lawyer (often called a ''Crown prosecutor'', as in Canada and the United Kingdom) as representing the Crown, usages such as \"For the Crown, Joe Bloggs argued...\" being common.\n\nThis practice of using the seat of [[sovereignty]] as the injured party is analogous with criminal cases in the United States, where the format is \"the People\" or \"the State v. [defendant]\" (e.g., ''[[People v. LaValle|People of the State of New York v. LaValle]]'' or ''[[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Brady]]'') under the doctrine of [[popular sovereignty]]. In Federal criminal cases, it is \"United States v. [defendant],\" as in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]''.\n\nThe Crown can also be a plaintiff or defendant in civil actions to which the government of the Commonwealth realm in question is a party. Such [[Crown proceedings]] are often subject to specific rules and limitations, such as the enforcement of judgments against the Crown.\n\n''[[Qui tam]]'' lawsuits on behalf of the Crown were once common but have been unusual since the [[Common Informers Act 1951]] ended the practice of allowing such suits by common informers.\n\n== Crown forces ==\n{{anchor|Crown forces}}<!-- [[Crown forces]] redirects here-->\nThe term ''crown forces'' has been applied by [[physical force Irish republicanism|militant Irish republicans]] to British-authorised [[security forces]] on the island of [[Ireland]], including the [[British Armed Forces]] and armed police such as the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], which are seen as [[enemy combatant]]s or an [[Military occupation|occupation]] force.{{NoteTag|In [[Danny Morrison (author)|Danny Morrison]]'s words, \"[t]he term 'security forces' suggests [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], which is why republicans prefer terms like 'the Brits' or 'the Crown Forces', which undermines their authority.\"<ref>{{cite web |url  =http://www.irlandinit-hd.de/sub_misc/bsands.htm#Analysis:%20Words%20of%20Freedom |title=Saving 'Bobby Sands Street' > Words of Freedom |last=Morrison |first=Danny |date=24\u201326 January 2004 |work=Irish History |publisher=Irlandinitiative Heidelberg |accessdate=25 August 2015}}</ref>|name=Morrison}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes-Bilger |first=Cordula |title = War Zone Language: Linguistic Aspects of the Conflict in Northern Ireland |year=2007 |publisher=Francke |isbn=9783772082009 |page=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Neill |first=Conor |year=2004 |title=Terrorism, insurgency and the military response from South Armagh to Falluja |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=149 |issue=5 |pages=22\u201325 |issn=0307-1847 |doi = 10.1080/03071840408523120 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Tomaney |first=John |year=2000 |title=End of the Empire State?
