Two ski lodges were destroyed and 18 people died.\n\n==Landslide==\nThere were 18 deaths when the Bimbadeen and Carinya Lodges were destroyed at Thredbo Alpine Village at 11:35 pm on Wednesday, 30 July 1997. About {{convert|1000|tonne}} of liquefied earth and debris came down the slope.\n\nAs the unstable slope above the four-storey Carinya Lodge (owned by the Brindabella Ski Club) slipped downhill, it hit the east wing of the Carinya Ski Lodge, tearing it in two. This initial landslide removed the support for the Alpine Way road which in turn collapsed, shearing the western half of Carinya from its foundations, allowing it to slide downhill and crossing a road before colliding with the Bimbadeen Ski Lodge at high speed, destroying both. Bimbadeen Staff Lodge was then hit, and it, too, collapsed. Witnesses reported hearing \"a whoosh of air, a crack and a sound like a freight train rushing down the hill\". John Cameron, a member of Brindabella Ski Club, who was alone in Carinya, along with 17 residents in Bimbadeen, lost their lives when the Lodges were destroyed.\n\nAt 11:37 pm, New South Wales Fire Brigades Communication Centre at [[Wollongong]] received emergency calls from the lodge at Thredbo. The local fire brigades had responded to reports of a 'small explosion' in the village. The first report to come through said that 100 people had been trapped.\n\nPolice arrived at 12:30 am and evacuated the area. A regional disaster was declared, with [[Goulburn]] established as the disaster coordination centre for the region, with [[Sydney]] also notified. Medical staff were sent from [[Cooma]] to [[Thredbo]], and also from [[Canberra]] to [[Jindabyne, New South Wales|Jindabyne]], which was a point for [[triage]]. Four specialists were flown from St George Hospital in Sydney to Thredbo. By 2:30 am, there were 100 professional services on the scene, and many volunteers such as from the Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA) of New South Wales, the [[State Emergency Service]] (SES) of New South Wales and the [[Australian Red Cross]].\n\n===Thursday, 31 July===\n[[File:Thredbo landslide.jpg|right|300px|thumb|SES volunteers (orange) and firemen (yellow) assist at the Thredbo debris slope 1997]]\nAt 7:30 am, a forward medical command post was established, set up in a lodge located 50 metres (164 feet) from the site of the disaster.\n\nInspector Rory O'Driscoll of the [[New South Wales Police|NSW Police]] arrived at 8:15 am. At 10:00 am, geophysicists who had been flown to the area from Sydney declared that the site was safe enough to begin an excavation of the top layers, but was still very unstable with a now exposed underground stream flowing through the debris at the rate of 6,120 litres per hour. At 10:30 am, a medical team inspected the disaster site. Many of the rescue workers themselves required treatment of minor injuries and the medical team realised they had to be prepared to treat exhaustion and hypothermia among the workers.\n\nThe first body was recovered at 4:20 pm. At 6:30 pm, a second specialist medical team arrived from the [[Royal North Shore Hospital]]. The State Emergency Service rotated 1350 rescue crew with about 250 on the site at any one time.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe slope of the hillside, which ranged from 20 to 40 degrees and the sub-zero temperatures made rescue efforts difficult. By midnight, 24 hours after the landslide had occurred, just one body had been discovered. During the night, the temperature at Thredbo dropped to \u221214&nbsp;\u00b0C (7&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\n===Friday, 1 August===\nOn 1 August, one more body was discovered in the early morning, and two more later during the day. A large slab of concrete which had been part of the Bimbadeen carpark made rescue efforts difficult. At 3:00 pm, doctors met the relatives of the missing.\n\nDuring the day, several environmental issues were identified such as water and sewerage being cut off to the site, and some diesel fuel seeping into Thredbo Creek.\n\nRescue workers announced on Friday that there was little hope in finding any survivors. They had not completely given up hope, but Assistant Police Commissioner [[Ken Moroney]] told reporters; \"I think at this stage the chances are quite remote.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/01/australia.landslide/index.html |title=Australia landslide toll rises, hopes fading |publisher=CNN |date= 1 August 1997  |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Stuart Diver==\nAt 5:37 am on 2 August, digging finished and rescue workers dropped sound equipment into a hole they had been digging, as was the standard procedure. This time, they detected some movement underneath the concrete slab.\n\nFive minutes later, rescue expert fire-fighter Steve Hirst, who used monitoring equipment to confirm the movement, yelled out \"Rescue team working overhead, can anyone hear me?\" to which a voice called back \"I can hear you.\" When asked if he had sustained any injuries, the voice replied \"No, but my feet are bloody cold!\"\n\nHe was identified as ski instructor [[Stuart Diver]]. A pipe was then passed down the gap to provide warmer air which would increase his low body temperature. Another tube was put down which carried fluids from which he could have two sips every 20 minutes.\n\nHirst explained to the press that Diver said he was uninjured, just extremely cold. Police Superintendent Charlie Sanderson explained to the press the difficulty of extracting Diver because they could not risk the concrete slab falling on top of him.\n\nHis position was two metres below the surface, beneath three concrete slabs. He was lying in water, wearing only a pair of underpants. Due to the risk of the overlaying concrete crushing Diver, rescuers began digging a 16-metre long tunnel from the eastern side of the slope. Five hours later, rescuers had removed enough of the rubble for them to be able to touch Diver. Paul Featherstone was the [[paramedic]] who kept talking to Diver for 11 hours until he was freed. When the site had to be evacuated each time the rubble shifted, Featherstone would stay below ground to keep Diver talking and distract him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icmi.com.au/paul-featherstone |title=Paul Featherstone |publisher=ICMI Speakers Bureau |accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nDiver was pulled from the wreckage later in the evening.

They did not find any, and the last body was recovered on the following Thursday.\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn 1998, three terraces with [[gabion]]s and reinforced fill were constructed on the site and the Alpine Way was rebuilt with upslope retaining walls. The site along with a section of the Alpine Way is now monitored with 25 [[inclinometer]]s, to detect any slope movement, and 12 [[piezometer]]s, to keep track of water flow in the soil.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBrindabella Ski Club opened its new lodge on 5 June 2004.\n\nThe Coroner's report released on 29 June 2000 said that the landslide was caused by water from heavy rain, melting snow and a leaking water main.
