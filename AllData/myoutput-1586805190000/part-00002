In 2014, the band released their debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'' and spawned the single \"Gooey\", which was eventually certified Platinum in the United States. Their second full album, ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]'', received critical acclaim and won in two categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize shortlist. Outside of his work for Glass Animals, Bayley has written and produced for a number of artists including [[6lack]], [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]], [[Joey Badass]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], [[Flume (musician)|Flume]] and [[Denzel Curry]].\n \nThe band has become known for their live shows, playing re-worked, dance-heavy versions of their songs. They have performed on international TV shows including late night shows with [[Jools Holland]], [[James Corden]] and [[Jimmy Kimmel]]. Glass Animals has played at a number of venues and festivals around the world including [[Radio City Music Hall]], Red Rocks, Brixton Academy, [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Lollapalooza]], Glastonbury, Latitude, Reading and Leeds, and Falls.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== 2012\u20132015: ''Zaba'' and various EPs  ===\nThe band released their debut EP, ''Leaflings'', on 28 May 2012, which included the single \"Cocoa Hooves\". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of [[XL Recordings]] (part of the [[Beggars Group]] of labels). At the time, lead singer and guitarist Dave Bayley was attending medical school at King's College, London but left after [[Adele]]'s producer [[Paul Epworth]] saw Glass Animals performing in London and signed them to his label Wolf Tone.\n\nIn 2013, the band released ''Black Mambo / Exxus EP'' in Europe, and ''Glass Animals EP'' in the US. The digital release of the track \"Black Mambo\" brought the band their first attention through online reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypem.com/track/1wegy/Glass+Animals+-+Black+Mambo|title=Black Mambo|website=Hype Machine|accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> The ''Glass Animals'' EP also saw the band collaborating with Jean Deaux, a soulful hip-hop teenager from Chicago, on a song titled \"Woozy\".\n\nIn 2014, the band made their first visit to the USA, performing at ''[[South by Southwest]]'' in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: \"Pools\", \"Gooey\", and \"Hazey\", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer [[Tei Shi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAll five singles were included on the band's debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'', which was released on 6 June 2014. The band performed the single \"Gooey\" on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals Get \"Gooey\" Again on Late Night With Seth Meyers {{!}} The Lefort Report|url = http://www.thelefortreport.com/blog/2014-10/watch-glass-animals-get-gooey-again-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers/|website = www.thelefortreport.com|access-date = 21 January 2016}}</ref> in 2014, and again on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' with [[David Letterman]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals play 'Gooey' on Letterman|url = http://diymag.com/2015/02/26/watch-glass-animals-play-gooey-on-letterman|website = DIY|access-date = 21 January 2016}}</ref> on 24 February 2015, and toured extensively after ''Zaba'', visiting both hemispheres and played over 130 shows in 2015 alone. Their October 2015 US tour included two sold out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the [[Midland Theatre]] in [[Kansas City]].\n\nA collaboration with American rapper [[Joey Badass|Joey Bada$$]], titled \"Lose Control\", was released on 6 October 2015. The idea for the song was apparently sparked during a randomly shared studio session. Following the collaboration, Bayley remarked that he would be interested in working with Joey again in the future. \n\nBayley also worked with DJ Dahi, resulting in a writing cut on the track \"The Middle Finger\" on Wale's ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number one album, ''[[The Album About Nothing]]'' in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Wale - The Middle Finger Lyrics {{!}} Genius Lyrics |url= https://genius.com/Wale-the-middle-finger-lyrics |website= genius.com}}</ref>\n\n=== 2016\u20132018: ''How to Be a Human Being'' and tour ===\n[[File:Dave Studio.jpg|thumb|Glass Animals frontman Dave Bayley]]\nOn 16 May 2016, the band released the lead single, \"Life Itself\", from their second album ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/glass-animals-tickle-the-feet-with-new-single-life-itself-listen/|title=Glass Animals tickle the feet with new single \"Life Itself\" \u2014 listen|date=2016-05-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref> \"Life Itself\" peaked at number 14 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Alternative Songs chart and spent 26 weeks on Sirius XM's Alt-18 chart, peaking at number one.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/glass-animals-track-by-track-guide-to-how-to-be-a.html|title=Glass Animals: Track-By-Track Guide to How To Be A Human Being|newspaper=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref> A music video for the song was released on 7 June 2016.

The album received critical acclaim for its \"sense of wonder\" and \"immediate impression\", though it was also met with some mixed reactions, for critics felt that it was somewhat premature. They played [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway Festivals]] in six different cities (Singapore, Sydney, and Auckland, among others). During their time in Australia, their three singles from ''How to Be a Human Being''\u2014\"Youth\", \"Life Itself\", and \"Season 2 Episode 3\", respectively\u2014came in at 38, 63 and 98 on [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2016|Triple J's Hottest 100]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn July 2018, drummer Joe Seaward was seriously injured when he was hit by a [[lorry]] while cycling in [[Dublin]].

In 2014, the band released their debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'' and spawned the single \"Gooey\", which was eventually certified Platinum in the United States. Their second full album, ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]'', received critical acclaim and won in two categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize shortlist. Outside of his work for Glass Animals, Bayley has written and produced for a number of artists including [[6lack]], [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]], [[Joey Badass]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], [[Flume (musician)|Flume]] and [[Denzel Curry]].\n \nThe band has become known for their live shows, playing re-worked, dance-heavy versions of their songs. They have performed on international TV shows including late night shows with [[Jools Holland]], [[James Corden]] and [[Jimmy Kimmel]]. Glass Animals has played at a number of venues and festivals around the world including [[Radio City Music Hall]], Red Rocks, Brixton Academy, [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Lollapalooza]], Glastonbury, Latitude, Reading and Leeds, and Falls.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== 2012\u20132015: ''Zaba'' and various EPs  ===\nThe band released their debut EP, ''Leaflings'', on 28 May 2012, which included the single \"Cocoa Hooves\". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of [[XL Recordings]] (part of the [[Beggars Group]] of labels). At the time, lead singer and guitarist Dave Bayley was attending medical school at King's College, London but left after [[Adele]]'s producer [[Paul Epworth]] saw Glass Animals performing in London and signed them to his label Wolf Tone.\n\nIn 2013, the band released ''Black Mambo / Exxus EP'' in Europe, and ''Glass Animals EP'' in the US. The digital release of the track \"Black Mambo\" brought the band their first attention through online reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypem.com/track/1wegy/Glass+Animals+-+Black+Mambo|title=Black Mambo|website=Hype Machine|accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> The ''Glass Animals'' EP also saw the band collaborating with Jean Deaux, a soulful hip-hop teenager from Chicago, on a song titled \"Woozy\".\n\nIn 2014, the band made their first visit to the USA, performing at ''[[South by Southwest]]'' in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: \"Pools\", \"Gooey\", and \"Hazey\", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer [[Tei Shi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAll five singles were included on the band's debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'', which was released on 6 June 2014.

Their October 2015 US tour included two sold out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the [[Midland Theatre]] in [[Kansas City]].\n\nA collaboration with American rapper [[Joey Badass|Joey Bada$$]], titled \"Lose Control\", was released on 6 October 2015. The idea for the song was apparently sparked during a randomly shared studio session. Following the collaboration, Bayley remarked that he would be interested in working with Joey again in the future. \n\nBayley also worked with DJ Dahi, resulting in a writing cut on the track \"The Middle Finger\" on Wale's ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number one album, ''[[The Album About Nothing]]'' in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Wale - The Middle Finger Lyrics {{!}} Genius Lyrics |url= https://genius.com/Wale-the-middle-finger-lyrics |website= genius.com}}</ref>\n\n=== 2016\u20132018: ''How to Be a Human Being'' and tour ===\n[[File:Dave Studio.jpg|thumb|Glass Animals frontman Dave Bayley]]\nOn 16 May 2016, the band released the lead single, \"Life Itself\", from their second album ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/glass-animals-tickle-the-feet-with-new-single-life-itself-listen/|title=Glass Animals tickle the feet with new single \"Life Itself\" \u2014 listen|date=2016-05-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref> \"Life Itself\" peaked at number 14 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Alternative Songs chart and spent 26 weeks on Sirius XM's Alt-18 chart, peaking at number one.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/glass-animals-track-by-track-guide-to-how-to-be-a.html|title=Glass Animals: Track-By-Track Guide to How To Be A Human Being|newspaper=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref> A music video for the song was released on 7 June 2016.

The album received critical acclaim for its \"sense of wonder\" and \"immediate impression\", though it was also met with some mixed reactions, for critics felt that it was somewhat premature. They played [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway Festivals]] in six different cities (Singapore, Sydney, and Auckland, among others).
