{"title_page": "Porter's five forces analysis", "text_new": "[[File:Elements of Industry Structure.svg|thumb|350px|A graphical representation of Porter's five forces]]\n'''Porter's Five Forces Framework''' is a method for analyzing [[Competition (economics)|competition]] of a business. It draws from [[Industrial organization|industrial organization (IO) economics]] to derive five forces that determine the competitive intensity and, therefore, the attractiveness (or lack of it) of an industry in terms of its profitability. An \"unattractive\" industry is one in which the effect of these five forces reduces overall profitability. The most unattractive industry would be one approaching \"pure competition\", in which available profits for all firms are driven to [[Profit (economics)#Normal profit|normal profit levels]]. The five-forces perspective is associated with its originator, [[Michael E. Porter]] of [[Harvard University]]. This framework was first published in ''Harvard Business Review'' in 1979.<ref>Michael E. Porter, [https://hbr.org/1979/03/how-competitive-forces-shape-strategy \"How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy\"], ''Harvard Business Review'', May 1979 (Vol. 57, No. 2), pp. 137-145.</ref>\n\nPorter refers to these forces as the [[Market_environment#Micro-environment|microenvironment]], to contrast it with the more general term [[environmental scanning|macroenvironment]]. They consist of those forces close to a [[company]] that affect its ability to serve its customers and make a [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. A change in any of the forces normally requires a business unit to re-assess the [[marketplace]] given the overall change in [[industry information]]. The overall industry attractiveness does not imply that every [[firm]] in the industry will return the same profitability. Firms are able to apply their [[core competencies]], [[business model]] or network to achieve a profit above the industry average. A clear example of this is the airline [[industry]]. As an industry, profitability is low because the industry's underlying structure of high fixed costs and low variable costs afford enormous latitude in the price of airline travel. Airlines tend to compete on cost, and that drives down the profitability of individual carriers as well as the industry itself because it simplifies the decision by a customer to buy or not buy a ticket. A few carriers--[[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Atlantic]] {{citation needed}} is one--have tried, with limited success, to use sources of differentiation in order to increase profitability.\n\nPorter's five forces include three forces from 'horizontal' competition--the threat of substitute products or services, the threat of established rivals, and the threat of new entrants--and two others from 'vertical' competition--the [[bargaining power]] of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers.\n\nPorter developed his five forces framework in reaction to the then-popular [[SWOT analysis]], which he found both lacking in rigor and ''ad hoc''.<ref>Michael Porter, Nicholas Argyres and Anita M. McGahan, \"An Interview with Michael Porter\", ''The Academy of Management Executive'' '''16''':2:44 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4165839 at JSTOR]</ref> Porter's five-forces framework is based on the [[structure\u2013conduct\u2013performance paradigm]] in [[Industrial organization|industrial organizational economics]]. Other Porter strategy tools include the [[value chain]] and [[Porter generic strategies|generic competitive strategies]].\n\n== Five Forces ==\n{{strategy}}\n\n===1* Threat of new entrants ===\nProfitable industries that yield high returns will attract new entities. New entrants eventually will decrease profitability for other firms in the industry. Unless the entry of new firms can be made more difficult by [[incumbents]], abnormal profitability will fall towards zero ([[perfect competition]]), which is the minimum level of profitability required to keep an industry in business.\n\nThe following factors can have an effect on how much of a threat new entrants may pose:{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n* The existence of [[barriers to entry]] ([[patents]], [[rights]], etc.). The most attractive segment is one in which entry barriers are high and exit barriers are low. It's worth noting, however, that high barriers to entry almost always make exit more difficult.\n* [[Government]] policy such as sanctioned monopolies, legal franchise requirements, or [[regulatory authority|regulatory requirements]].\n* [[Capital requirements]] - clearly the Internet has influenced this factor dramatically. Web sites and apps can be launched cheaply and easily as opposed to the brick and mortar industries of the past. \n* Absolute cost\n* Cost advantage independent of size\n* [[Economies of scale]]\n* [[Product differentiation]]\n* [[Brand equity]]\n* Switching costs are well illustrated by structural market characteristics such as supply chain integration but also can be created by firms. Airline frequent flyer programs are an example. \n* Expected retaliation - For example, a specific characteristics of [[oligopoly]] markets is that prices generally settle at an equilibrium because any price rises or cuts are easily matched by the competition.\n* Access to distribution channels\n* [[Customer loyalty]] to established brands. This can be accompanied by large brand advertising expenditures or similar mechanisms of maintained brand equity.\n* Industry profitability (the more profitable the industry, the more attractive it will be to new competitors){{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===2* Threat of substitutes ===\nA substitute product uses a different technology to try to solve the same economic need. Examples of substitutes are meat, poultry, and fish; landlines and cellular telephones; airlines, automobiles, trains, and ships; beer and wine; and so on. For example, tap water is a substitute for Coke, but Pepsi is a product that uses the same technology (albeit different ingredients) to compete head-to-head with Coke, so it is not a substitute. Increased marketing for drinking tap water might \"shrink the pie\" for both Coke and Pepsi, whereas increased Pepsi advertising would likely \"grow the pie\" (increase consumption of all soft drinks), while giving Pepsi a larger market share at Coke's expense. \n\nPotential factors:\n* Buyer propensity to substitute. This aspect incorporated both tangible and intangible factors. Brand loyalty can be very important as in the Coke and Pepsi example above; however contractual and legal barriers are also effective.\n* Relative price performance of substitute\n* Buyer's [[switching costs]]. This factor is well illustrated by the mobility industry. [[Uber]] and its many competitors took advantage of the incumbent taxi industry's dependence on legal barriers to entry and when those fell away, it was trivial for customers to switch. There were no costs as every transaction was atomic, with no incentive for customers not to try another product. \n* Perceived level of [[product differentiation]] which is classic [[Michael Porter]] in the sense that there are only two basic mechanisms for competition - lowest price or differentiation. Developing multiple products for niche markets is one way to mitigate this factor. \n* Number of substitute products available in the market\n* Ease of substitution\n* Availability of close substitute\n\n===3* Bargaining power of customers ===\nThe bargaining power of customers is also described as the market of outputs: the ability of customers to put the [[firm]] under pressure, which also affects the customer's sensitivity to price changes. Firms can take measures to reduce buyer power, such as implementing a loyalty program. Buyers' power is high if buyers have many alternatives. It is low if they have few choices. \n\nPotential factors:\n* Buyer concentration to [[firm]] [[concentration ratio]]\n* Degree of dependency upon existing channels of distribution\n* Bargaining leverage, particularly in industries with high [[fixed cost]]s\n* Buyer switching costs\n* Buyer information availability\n* Availability of existing substitute products\n* Buyer [[price sensitivity]]\n* Differential advantage (uniqueness) of industry products\n* [[RFM (customer value)]] Analysis\n\n===4* Bargaining power of suppliers ===\nThe bargaining power of suppliers is also described as the market of inputs. Suppliers of raw materials, components, labor, and services (such as expertise) to the [[firm]] can be a source of power over the firm when there are few substitutes. If you are making biscuits and there is only one person who sells flour, you have no alternative but to buy it from them. Suppliers may refuse to work with the firm or charge excessively high prices for unique resources.\n\nPotential factors are:\n* Supplier switching costs relative to [[firm]] switching costs\n* Degree of differentiation of inputs\n* Impact of inputs on cost and differentiation\n* Presence of substitute inputs\n* Strength of distribution channel\n* Supplier concentration to [[firm]] concentration ratio\n* Employee solidarity (e.g. [[labor unions]])\n* Supplier competition: the ability to forward vertically integrate and cut out the buyer.\n\n===5*  Competitive rivalry ===\nFor most industries the intensity of competitive rivalry is the major determinant of the competitiveness of the industry. Having an understanding of industry rivals is vital to successfully marketing a product. Positioning pertains to how the public perceives a product and distinguishes it from competitors\u2018. An organization must be aware of its competitors' marketing strategies and pricing and also be reactive to any changes made. Rivalry among competitors tends to be cutthroat and industry profitability low while having the potential factors below:\n\nPotential factors:\n* Sustainable [[competitive advantage]] through [[innovation]]\n* Competition between online and offline organizations\n* Level of [[advertising]] expense\n* Powerful competitive strategy which could potentially be realized by adhering to Porter\u2018s work on low cost versus differentiation.\n* Firm [[concentration ratio]]\n\n==Usage==\nStrategy consultants occasionally use Porter's five forces [[Conceptual framework|framework]] when making a qualitative evaluation of a [[firm]]'s strategic position. However, for most consultants, the framework is only a starting point and [[value chain]] analysis or another type of analysis may be used in conjunction with this model.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://flevy.com/blog/introduction-to-strategy-development-and-strategy-execution/ | title=Introduction to Strategy Development and Strategy Execution | publisher=Flevy | date=21 October 2014 | accessdate=2 November 2014 | author=Tang, David}}</ref> Like all general frameworks, an analysis that uses it to the exclusion of specifics about a particular situation is considered na\u00efve {{by whom|date=December 2018}}.\n\nAccording to Porter, the five forces framework should be used at the line-of-business industry level; it is not designed to be used at the industry group or industry sector level. An industry is defined at a lower, more basic level: a market in which similar or closely related products and/or services are sold to buyers (see [[industry information]]). A [[firm]] which competes in a single industry should develop, at a minimum, one five forces analysis for its industry. Porter makes clear that for diversified companies, the primary issue in [[corporate strategy]] is the selection of [[Industry|industries]] ([[Industry|lines of business]]) in which the company will compete. The average ''Fortune Global 1,000'' company competes in 52 industries <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-management/chapter/external-inputs-to-strategy/|title=External Inputs to Strategy {{!}} Boundless Management|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>.\n\n== Criticisms ==\nPorter's framework has been challenged by other academics and strategists. For instance, Kevin P. Coyne and Somu Subramaniam claim that three dubious assumptions underlie the five forces:\n* That buyers, competitors, and suppliers are unrelated and do not interact and [[collusion|collude]].\n* That the source of value is structural advantage (creating barriers to entry).\n* That uncertainty is low, allowing participants in a market to plan for and respond to changes in competitive behavior.<ref>Kevin P. Coyne and Somu Subramaniam, \"Bringing Discipline to Strategy, ''[[McKinsey Quarterly]]'', 1996, (Vol. 33, No. 4), pp. 14-25.</ref>\n\nAlso, the last chapter of the book: \"Age of agile\" attributes the bankruptcy of Porter's firm to the outdated nature of his model around competitiveness instead of creating customer value and not making the customers at the center of the universe, i.e customer centricity.\n\nAn important extension to Porter's work came from Adam Brandenburger and [[Barry Nalebuff]] of [[Yale School of Management]] in the mid-1990s. Using [[game theory]], they added the concept of [[complementors]] (also called \"the 6th force\") to try to explain the reasoning behind strategic alliances. Complementors are known as the impact of related products and services already in the market.<ref>Brandenburger, A. M., & Nalebuff, B. J. (1995). The Right Game: Use Game Theory to Shape Strategy.
