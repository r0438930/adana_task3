McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the Senate [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1984|in 1984]] and has been re-elected five times since. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate Majority Leader.\n\nMcConnell was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career but shifted to the right over time. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2009. During the [[Obama administration]], McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives, made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. Under McConnell's leadership of the Senate, Obama saw the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the final two years of a presidency since 1951\u201352. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court. McConnell was included in the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] list of the most influential people in the world in 2015.\n\n==Early life and education (1942\u20131967)==\nMcConnell was born February 20, 1942, to Addison Mitchell McConnell, Sr. (1917-1990) and Julia Odene \"Dean\" ([[n\u00e9e]] Shockley) McConnell (1919-1993).<ref name=\"memoir\">{{Cite book |title=The Long Game: a Memoir |last=McConnell |first=Mitch|publisher=Sentinel|year=2016|isbn=9780399564123|location=New York, NY|chapter=Chapter One: A fighting spirit |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cO3CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |page=9 |quote=She'd been known her whole life not by her first name, Julia, which she loved, but by her middle name, Odene, which she detested.

He was allowed to leave post just five days later, though McConnell maintains that no one helped him with his enlistment into or discharge from the reserves.

is an American politician serving as Kentucky's [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States senator]] and as [[Senate Majority Leader]]. McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the Senate [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1984|in 1984]] and has been re-elected five times since. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate Majority Leader.\n\nMcConnell was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career but shifted to the right over time. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2009. During the [[Obama administration]], McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives, made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. Under McConnell's leadership of the Senate, Obama saw the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the final two years of a presidency since 1951\u201352. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court. McConnell was included in the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] list of the most influential people in the world in 2015.\n\n==Early life and education (1942\u20131967)==\nMcConnell was born February 20, 1942, to Addison Mitchell McConnell, Sr. (1917-1990) and Julia Odene \"Dean\" ([[n\u00e9e]] Shockley) McConnell (1919-1993).<ref name=\"memoir\">{{Cite book |title=The Long Game: a Memoir |last=McConnell |first=Mitch|publisher=Sentinel|year=2016|isbn=9780399564123|location=New York, NY|chapter=Chapter One: A fighting spirit |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cO3CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |page=9 |quote=She'd been known her whole life not by her first name, Julia, which she loved, but by her middle name, Odene, which she detested.

He was allowed to leave post just five days later, though McConnell maintains that no one helped him with his enlistment into or discharge from the reserves.
