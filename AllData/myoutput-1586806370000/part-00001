Larger airports may have [[airport apron]]s, [[taxiway bridge]]s, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and [[Airport lounge|lounges]], and [[emergency service]]s. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more [[fixed-base operator]]s, serving general aviation.\n\nAn airport solely serving helicopters is called a [[heliport]]. An airport for use by [[seaplane]]s and [[amphibious aircraft]] is called a [[seaplane base]]. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for [[takeoff]]s and [[landing]]s, and seaplane docks for tying-up.  \n\nAn [[international airport]] has additional facilities for customs and [[Border control|passport control]] as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements.

For example, in the UK the state-owned [[Heathrow Airport Holdings|British Airports Authority]] originally operated eight of the nation's major commercial airports \u2013 it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the Spanish [[Ferrovial]] consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just Heathrow. Germany's [[Frankfurt Airport]] is managed by the quasi-private firm [[Fraport]]. While in India [[GMR Group]] operates, through joint ventures, [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] and [[Rajiv Gandhi International Airport]]. [[Bengaluru International Airport]] and [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]] are controlled by GVK Group. The rest of India's airports are managed by the [[Airports Authority of India]]. In Pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the [[Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority]] except for [[Sialkot International Airport]] which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in Pakistan and South Asia{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.\n\nIn the US, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created [[Airport authority|airport authorities]] (also known as [[Port authority|port authorities]]), such as the [[Los Angeles World Airports]] authority that oversees several airports in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], including [[Los Angeles International Airport]]{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.\n\nIn Canada, the federal authority, Transport Canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000.

Aeronautical revenue makes up 56%, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 40%, and non-operating revenue makes up 4% of the total revenue of airports.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simpleflying.com/how-airports-make-money/|title=How Airports Actually Make Money|date=July 21, 2018|website=Simple Flying|access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref><!--This is for US airports? It needs to specify.-->\n\n==== Aeronautical revenue ====\nAeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. Landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guides.erau.edu/c.php?g=153797&p=1009544|title=Landing fees|website=guides.erau.edu}}</ref> [[Landing fee]]s are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://assets.flysfo.com.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/investor/SummaryChargesFY1617.pdf|title=SUMMARY OF AIRPORT CHARGES|last=Farooqui|first=Aaryan|website=assest.flysfo}}</ref> Passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, [[Wi-Fi|wifi]] and shows which is paid while paying for an [[airline ticket]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} Aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports.

Kennedy International Airport}}</ref>\n\n==== Non-aeronautical revenue ====\nNon-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. It includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/14275/chapter/4|title=Read \"Guidebook for Managing Small Airports - Second Edition\" at NAP.edu|language=en}}</ref> Concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through [[Duty-free shop|duty free]], bookstores, Restaurants and [[Foreign exchange market|money exchange]].<ref name=\"researchgate.net\"/> Car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the [[Parking lot|parking facilities]] of the airport.

The landside area is open to the public, while access to the airside area is tightly controlled. The airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are accessible only to passengers and staff. Passengers and staff must be checked by [[airport security|security]] before being permitted to enter the airside area. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through [[border control]] and customs to access the landside area, where they can exit the airport. Many major airports will issue a secure [[keycard]] called an [[airside pass]] to employees, as some roles require employees to frequently move back and forth between landside and airside as part of their duties.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n[[File:T3TransitArea.JPG|thumb|Singapore's [[Singapore Changi Airport]] Terminal 3 ]]\nA [[Airport terminal|terminal]] is a building with passenger facilities. Small airports have one terminal. Large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] still have one terminal. The terminal has a series of [[Gate (airport)|gates]], which provide passengers with access to the plane.\n\nThe following facilities are essential for departing passengers:\n*[[Airport check-in|Check-in facilities]], including a baggage drop-off\n*[[Airport security|Security clearance gates]]\n*Passport control (for some international flights)\n*[[Gate (airport)|Gates]]\n*Waiting areas\n\nThe following facilities are essential for arriving passengers:\n*Passport control (international arrivals only)\n*Baggage reclaim facilities, often in the form of a [[Baggage carousel|carousel]]\n*Customs (international arrivals only)\n*A landside meeting place\n\nFor both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as [[jet bridge]]s or [[airstair]]s. There also needs to be a [[baggage handling system]], to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.\n\nThe area where the aircraft park to load passengers and baggage is known as an ''apron'' or ''ramp'' (or incorrectly{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}, \"the tarmac\").\n\n[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 114 Airport international terminal interior.jpg|thumb|Terminal 2 at [[Mumbai]]'s [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]].]]\nAirports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. However, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. International flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel.\n\n\"[[Floating airport]]s\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as [[pneumatic stabilized platform]] technology.\n\n===Airport security===\n{{Main|Airport security}}\n{{See also|Airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks}}\n[[File:Flughafenkontrolle.jpg|thumb|Baggage is scanned using [[X-ray generator|X-ray machines]] as passengers walk through [[metal detector]]s]]\nAirport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. Since the [[September 11 attacks]] and the Real ID Act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before.\n\n===Products and services===\n[[File:HFX Airport 5.jpg|left|thumb|Food court and shops, [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport]], Canada]]\n[[File:Duty Free - Suvarnabhumi Airport.jpg|thumb|Duty-free shop at [[Suvarnabhumi International Airport]] in [[Bangkok]], Thailand]]\nMost major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the US amounted to $4.2&nbsp;billion in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel|title=Your Misery at the Airport Is Great for Business|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/metropolis/2017/09/why_airport_retail_is_booming.html|accessdate=September 8, 2017|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers' [[suggested retail price]] (MSRP) but are almost never discounted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nApart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food or culture without leaving the airport.<ref>USA Today newspaper, October 17, 2006, p. 2D</ref>\n\nSome airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.\n\nMajor airports in such countries as Russia and Japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. The smallest type is the [[capsule hotel]] popular in Japan. A slightly larger variety is known as a [[sleep box]]. An even larger type is provided by the company [[YOTEL]].\n\n=== Premium and VIP services ===\n[[File:ZiaAirportVIP-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shahjalal International Airport]]'s [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Airport terminal|Terminal]], [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh ]]\nAirports may also contain premium and VIP services. The premium and VIP services may include express [[Airport check-in|check-in]] and dedicated check-in counters.\nThese services are usually reserved for [[First class (aviation)|first]] and [[business class]] passengers, premium [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flyers]], and members of the airline's clubs. Premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline's frequent flyer program. This can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.\n\nSometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.\n\nAirline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Lounges themselves typically have [[airport chair|seating]], showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, [[Wi-Fi]] and Internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. Some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.\n\nAirlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. Multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.\n\n=== Cargo and freight service ===\nIn addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. [[Cargo airline]]s often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.\n\nCargo Terminal Facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading on the aircraft. Similarly import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. Areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. Designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.\n\nEvery cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. The landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. In addition cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas \u2013 export, import and interline or transshipment.\n[[File:Aeroporto Internacional de Guararapes.jpg|thumb|[[Recife International Airport]] in [[Recife]], Brazil.]]\n\n=== Access and onward travel ===\nAirports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. Large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.\n\nMany large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of [[multimodal transport]], for instance [[Frankfurt Airport]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], [[London Heathrow Airport]], [[Tokyo Haneda Airport]], [[Tokyo Narita Airport]], [[London Gatwick Airport]] and [[London Stansted Airport]]. It is also common to connect an airport and a city with [[rapid transit]], [[light rail]] lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the [[AirTrain JFK]] at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[Transportation in New York City|New York]], [[Link Light Rail]] that runs from the heart of downtown [[Seattle]] to [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]], and the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|T]] at [[Boston]]'s [[Logan International Airport]] by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to [[traffic congestion]]. Large airports usually have access also through [[controlled-access highway]]s ('freeways' or 'motorways') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.\n\n=== Internal transport ===\nThe distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. It is common for airports to provide [[moving walkway]]s, buses, and rail transport systems. Some airports like [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] and [[London Stansted Airport]] have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. Airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], [[Mexico City International Airport]] and [[London Gatwick Airport]].\n\n== Airport operations ==\n[[File:HFX Airport 4.jpg|left|thumb|The apron from the top floor observation room, Halifax International Airport, Canada]]\n\nThere are three types of surface that aircraft operate on:\n*Runways, for takeoff and landing\n*[[Taxiway]]s, where planes \"taxi\" (transfer to and from a runway)\n*[[Airport apron|Apron]] or ramp: a surface where planes are parked, loaded, unloaded or refuelled.\n\n=== Air traffic control ===\n[[File:Torre de controle Rio de Janeiro (Galeao).jpg|thumb|Airport tower]]\n[[Air traffic control]] (ATC) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. At the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.\n\nA \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a [[Air traffic control#Air traffic control tower|control tower]] where the air traffic controllers are based. Pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. A \"[[non-towered airport|non-towered]]\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport's [[common traffic advisory frequency]] (CTAF) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency.\n\nThe majority of the world's airports are small facilities without a tower. Not all towered airports have [[24/7]] ATC operations. In those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. Non-towered airports come under [[Area control center|area (en-route) control]]. [[Remote and virtual tower]] (RVT) is a system in which ATC is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.\n\nAir traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ''ground'' and ''tower'', though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with ''clearance delivery'', ''apron control'', and/or other specialized ATC stations.\n\n====Ground control====\nGround control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"[[maneuvering area|movement areas]]\", except the traffic on runways. This includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. Ground Control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. When a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. Conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from Tower to Ground Control.\n\n====Tower control====\nTower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the [[controlled airspace]] immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft's position in 3D space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.\n\n=== Traffic pattern ===\n{{Main|Airfield traffic pattern}}\n[[File:Airport Traffic Pattern with Upwind Leg.svg|frameless|upright=1.8|right|Left-hand circuit pattern]]\nAt all airports the use of a [[Airfield traffic pattern|traffic pattern]] (often called a ''traffic circuit'' outside the US) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, ''provided there is no queue''. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the [[glidepath]], without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] equipment, things are very different though.\n\nGenerally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually {{convert|800|or|1000|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[above ground level]] (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are ''left-handed'', meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a [[mid-air collision]].\n\nAt controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.\n\n=== Navigational aids ===\n[[File:Vasi-1.JPG|left|thumb|Standard [[Visual Approach Slope Indicator]]]]\nThere are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. A [[visual approach slope indicator]] (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a [[distance measuring equipment]] (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.\n\nLarger airports sometimes offer [[precision approach radar]] (PAR), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft's horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the [[Final approach (aviation)|approach slope]]. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.\n\n=== Taxiway signs ===\n{{Further|Taxiway#Taxiway signs}}\nAirport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.\n\n=== Lighting ===\n{{Further|Taxiway#Taxiway lights|Runway#Runway lighting}}\n\n[[File:ATL TWY B - RWY Crossing (13534655025).jpg|thumb|Airport lighting]]\nMany airports have [[Runway lighting|lighting]] that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.\n\nOn runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. [[Runway edge lights|Runway edge lighting]] consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an [[approach lighting system]], or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use [[pilot-controlled lighting]] to save electricity and staffing costs.\n\nAlong taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway's edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.\n\n=== Weather observations ===\n{{See also|Surface weather observation|Weather station|Automated airport weather station|Automatic weather station}}\n\n[[File:2008-07-09 Eureka Airport AWOS viewed from the south.jpg|thumb|Automated weather system]]\nWeather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. In the US and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of [[automated airport weather station]], whether an AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS, a human observer or a combination of the two. These weather observations, predominantly in the [[METAR]] format, are available over the radio, through [[automatic terminal information service]] (ATIS), via the ATC or the [[flight service station]].\n\nPlanes take-off and land ''into'' the wind to achieve maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a [[windsock]] can also be kept in view of the runway. Aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. Because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.piggottsflagsandbranding.co.uk/updates/interesting-facts-industrial-windsocks/|title=Why do airports have windsocks?|date=|website=Piggotts Flags And Branding|access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Airport ground crew (ground handling) ===\n{{Main|Ground support equipment}}\n[[File:KLM 777 pushback.jpg|thumb|An aircraft tow tractor moving a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 777]]]]\n[[File:20140308 Airport ground operations.jpg|thumb|left|Ground operations at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]]]]\nMost airports have [[groundcrew]] handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport.\n\nAmong the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:\n*A tow tractor to move the aircraft in and out of the berth.\n*A [[jet bridge]] (in some airports) or stairs unit to allow passengers to embark and disembark.\n*A ground power unit for supplying electricity. As the engines will be switched off, they will not be generating electricity as they do in flight.\n*A cleaning service.\n*A catering service to deliver food and drinks for a flight.\n*A toilet waste truck to empty the tank which holds the waste from the toilets in the aircraft.\n*A water truck to fill the water tanks of the aircraft.\n*A refueling vehicle. The fuel may come from a tanker, or from underground fuel tanks.\n*A conveyor belt unit for loading and unloading luggage.\n*A vehicle to transport luggage to and from the terminal.\nThe length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"[[turnaround time]]\". Airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.\n\n=== Maintenance management ===\nLike industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.<ref name=Mothes/>\n\nTo manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: [[Computerized maintenance management system|CMMS (computerized maintenance management system)]] predominate, and mainly enable a company's maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.<ref name=Mothes>{{cite web |first=Daphn\u00e9 |last=Mothes |title=Improve your airport maintenance with your CMMS |url=https://www.mobility-work.com/blog/improve-your-airport-maintenance-your-cmms |work=Mobility Work |date=January 15, 2019 |access-date=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Safety management ===\n[[File:Altenburg-Nobitz Airport Rosenbauer Panther.jpg|thumb|\"FLF Panther\" airport crash tender in Germany]]\n[[File:Sumburgh Airport Barrier.webm|thumb|Road crossing of ([[Shetland]]) A970 with [[Sumburgh Airport|Sumburgh]] airport's runway. The movable barrier closes when aircraft land or take off.]]\n[[Aviation safety]] is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. [[Airport crash tender]] crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable [[aviation fuel]]. The crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]], and terrorist activities.\n\nHazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is [[airfield rubber removal]] which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see [[foreign object damage]]). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. For waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special [[deicing]] fluids on the wings.\n\nMany airports are built near open fields or [[wetland]]s. These tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of [[bird strike]]s. Airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.\n\nSome airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. Other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.\n\nAn airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. Records are kept of any [[runway incursion|incursions]] where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. These locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the FAA in the US) and airport administrators.\n\nDuring the 1980s, a phenomenon known as [[microburst]] became a growing concern due to [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aircraft accidents]] caused by microburst [[wind shear]], such as [[Delta Air Lines Flight 191]]. Microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.\n\nSome airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway ([[Blast pad|stopway]] or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like [[styrofoam]], bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.\n\nAirports often have [[Aircraft rescue and firefighting|on-site firefighters]] to respond to emergencies. These use specialized vehicles, known as [[airport crash tender]]s.\n\n== Environmental concerns and sustainability ==\n[[File:Pista Congonhas01.jpg|thumb|Runway at [[Congonhas-S\u00e3o Paulo Airport]] in Brazil.]]\n[[Aircraft noise]] is a major cause of [[Noise pollution|noise disturbance]] to residents living near airports. Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. Aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings, but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. Noise can have other [[Health effects from noise|noise health effects]]. Other noise and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading the airport.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, local flora and fauna. Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://catsr.ite.gmu.edu/SYST460/IntroAirportsWorkbook.pdf|title=Introduction to Airports Design and Operations|last=Sherry|first=Lance|year=2009|website=George Mason University Center for Air Transportation Systems Research|access-date=}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nSome of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. These reports contain all [[environmental protection]] measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.\n\nA 2019 report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US [[Transportation Research Board]] showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction initiatives. Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a providing ground for their feasibility. Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=National Academies of Sciences|first=Engineering|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25609/airport-greenhouse-gas-reduction-efforts|title=Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts|date=October 23, 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA growing number of airports are installing solar [[photovoltaic]] arrays to offset their electricity use.<ref>Anurag et al.

Kandt and R. Romero . Implementing Solar Technologies at Airports. NREL Report. Available:\nhttps://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62349.pdf</ref>\n\nThe world's first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at [[Cochin International Airport|Kochi]], India. Another airport known for considering environmental parameters is the [[Seymour Airport]] at Galapagos Islands.\n\n== {{anchor|Military airbase}} Military air base ==\n{{Main|Air base}}\n[[File:French Air Contingent, NATO Baltic Air-policing.jpg|thumb|[[Fighter aircraft]] at an airbase in [[Lithuania]]]]\nAn airbase, sometimes referred to as an ''air station'' or ''airfield'', provides basing and support of [[military aircraft]]. Some airbases, known as ''military airports'', provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. For example, [[RAF Brize Norton]] in the UK has a terminal which caters to passengers for the [[Royal Air Force]]'s scheduled flights to the [[Falkland Islands]]. Some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same ATC facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. [[Bardufoss Airport]], [[Bardufoss Air Station]] in Norway and [[Pune Airport]] in India are examples of this.\n\nAn [[aircraft carrier]] is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. Aircraft carriers allow a [[Navy|naval force]] to project [[Aerial warfare|air power]] without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. After their development in World War I, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during World War II.\n\n== Airport designation and naming ==\n{{Further|List of airports}}\n\nAirports are uniquely represented by their [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA airport code]] and [[International Civil Aviation Organization airport code|ICAO airport code]].\n\nMost airport names include the location. Many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]], [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]), a monarch (e.g. [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]], [[King Abdulaziz International Airport]]), a cultural leader (e.g. [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]], [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport]], [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]]) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. [[Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport]]), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. [[Allama Iqbal International Airport]]) and explorers (e.g. [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]]).\n\nSome airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nSome airport names include the word \"International\" to indicate their ability to handle [[International airport|international air traffic]]. This includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. [[Albany International Airport]]).\n\n== History and development ==\n[[File:Kharkov Airport Sokolniki.jpg|thumb|The Kharkiv Airport in Sokolniki, [[Ukraine]] (1924).]]\nThe earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1JcWmb9Ik8C&pg=PA154|title=Soft Landing: Airline Industry Strategy, Service, and Safety|last=Thomas|first=Andrew R.|date=2011|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-3677-1|page=154}}</ref> The plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. A slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. However, these functioned well only in dry conditions. Later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.\n\nThe title of \"world's oldest airport\" is disputed. [[College Park Airport]] in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by [[Wright brothers|Wilbur Wright]], is generally agreed to be the world's oldest continuously operating airfield,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgparks.com/places/historic/cpairport.html |title=College Park Airport |publisher=Pgparks.com |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531180243/http://pgparks.com/places/historic/cpairport.html |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> although it serves only [[general aviation]] traffic. \n\n[[Beijing Nanyuan Airport]] in China, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910.<ref>http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2019/09/25/629668.html</ref> It was in operation until September 2019. [[Pearson Field Airport]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]], United States, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of January 2020.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n[[Hamburg Airport]] opened in January 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. [[Bremen Airport]] opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] opened on September 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted [[Civil aviation|civil aircraft]] only since December 17, 1920, allowing [[Sydney Airport]]\u2014which started operations in January 1920\u2014to claim to be one of the world's oldest continuously operating commercial airports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/353DC91E-A259-449B-8B68-C8E88CB58691/0/FactSheetHistory1.pdf |title=Sydney Airport history |format=PDF |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401043447/http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/353DC91E-A259-449B-8B68-C8E88CB58691/0/FactSheetHistory1.pdf |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}</ref> [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport]] in the US opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. [[Rome Ciampino Airport]], opened 1916, is also a contender, as well as the [[Don Mueang International Airport]] near Bangkok, Thailand, which opened in 1914.\nIncreased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.\n[[File:New Orleans postcard Moissant Airport 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New Orleans International Airport]] passenger terminal building in [[New Orleans]] (1960s).]]\nFollowing the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. One of the earliest such fields was [[Paris \u2013 Le Bourget Airport]] at [[Le Bourget]], near Paris. The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] in August 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by [[Croydon Airport]] in March 1920.<ref>Bluffield (2009)</ref> In 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at [[Kaliningrad Devau Airport|Flughafen Devau]] near what was then [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], East Prussia. The airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.\n\nThe first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s [[Approach lighting system|approach lighting]] came into use. These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). In the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft's position on the [[Instrument landing system|glideslope]]. Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.\n[[File:Bosasairp.jpg|thumb|The [[Bender Qassim International Airport]] in [[Bosaso]], Somalia (2007).]]\nAfter [[World War II]], airport design became more sophisticated. Passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. This arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. But it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.\n\nAn improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. These run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane's wheels.\n\nAirport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in [[jet aircraft]] traffic. Runways were extended out to {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}}. The fields were constructed out of [[reinforced concrete]] using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. The early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. These systems became commonplace in the United States by the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe malicious use of UAVs has led to the deployment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare#Anti-UAV defences|counter unmanned air system]] (C-UAS) technologies such as the Aaronia [[AARTOS]] which have been installed on major international airports<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/uv-online/heathrows-picks-new-c-uas-combat-drone-disruption/ |title=Heathrow picks C-UAS to combat drone disruption |accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unmannedairspace.info/counter-uas-systems-and-policies/muscat-international-airport-install-usd10-million-aaronia-counter-uas-system/ |title=Muscat International Airport to install USD10&nbsp;million Aaronia counter-UAS system |accessdate=January 21, 2019}}</ref>.\n\n== Airports in entertainment ==\n[[File:Washington Dulles International Airport at Dusk.jpg|thumb|[[Washington Dulles International Airport]], ostensibly the setting for ''[[Die Hard 2]]''; the movie was actually filmed at [[Los Angeles International Airport]]]]\nAirports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is ''[[The Terminal]]'', a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'', ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), ''[[Die Hard 2]]'', ''[[Soul Plane]]'', ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'', ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', ''[[Liar Liar]]'', ''[[Passenger 57]]'', ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'' (2000), ''[[Unaccompanied Minors]]'', ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', ''[[Rendition (film)|Rendition]]'' and ''[[The Langoliers (TV miniseries)|The Langoliers]]''. They have also played important parts in television series like ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model, Cycle 10]]'' which have significant parts of their story set within airports. In other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''.\n\nSeveral computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport.

An airport for use by [[seaplane]]s and [[amphibious aircraft]] is called a [[seaplane base]]. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for [[takeoff]]s and [[landing]]s, and seaplane docks for tying-up.  Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport in USA is the busiest and biggest airport in the world. \n\nAn [[international airport]] has additional facilities for customs and [[Border control|passport control]] as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements.

While in India [[GMR Group]] operates, through joint ventures, [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] and [[Rajiv Gandhi International Airport]]. [[Bengaluru International Airport]] and [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]] are controlled by GVK Group. The rest of India's airports are managed by the [[Airports Authority of India]].

The landside area is open to the public, while access to the airside area is tightly controlled. The airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are accessible only to passengers and staff. Passengers and staff must be checked by [[airport security|security]] before being permitted to enter the airside area. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through [[border control]] and customs to access the landside area, where they can exit the airport. Many major airports will issue a secure [[keycard]] called an [[airside pass]] to employees, as some roles require employees to frequently move back and forth between landside and airside as part of their duties.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n[[File:T3TransitArea.JPG|thumb|Singapore's [[Singapore Changi Airport]] Terminal 3 ]]\nA [[Airport terminal|terminal]] is a building with passenger facilities. Small airports have one terminal. Large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] still have one terminal. The terminal has a series of [[Gate (airport)|gates]], which provide passengers with access to the plane.\n\nThe following facilities are essential for departing passengers:\n*[[Airport check-in|Check-in facilities]], including a baggage drop-off\n*[[Airport security|Security clearance gates]]\n*Passport control (for some international flights)\n*[[Gate (airport)|Gates]]\n*Waiting areas\n\nThe following facilities are essential for arriving passengers:\n*Passport control (international arrivals only)\n*Baggage reclaim facilities, often in the form of a [[Baggage carousel|carousel]]\n*Customs (international arrivals only)\n*A landside meeting place\n\nFor both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as [[jet bridge]]s or [[airstair]]s. There also needs to be a [[baggage handling system]], to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.\n\nThe area where the aircraft park to load passengers and baggage is known as an ''apron'' or ''ramp'' (or incorrectly{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}, \"the tarmac\").\n\n[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 114 Airport international terminal interior.jpg|thumb|Terminal 2 at [[Mumbai]]'s [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]].]]\nAirports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. However, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. International flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel.\n\n\"[[Floating airport]]s\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as [[pneumatic stabilized platform]] technology.\n\n===Airport security===\n{{Main|Airport security}}\n{{See also|Airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks}}\n[[File:Flughafenkontrolle.jpg|thumb|Baggage is scanned using [[X-ray generator|X-ray machines]] as passengers walk through [[metal detector]]s]]\nAirport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. Since the [[September 11 attacks]] and the Real ID Act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before.\n\n===Products and services===\n[[File:HFX Airport 5.jpg|left|thumb|Food court and shops, [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport]], Canada]]\n[[File:Duty Free - Suvarnabhumi Airport.jpg|thumb|Duty-free shop at [[Suvarnabhumi International Airport]] in [[Bangkok]], Thailand]]\nMost major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the US amounted to $4.2&nbsp;billion in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel|title=Your Misery at the Airport Is Great for Business|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/metropolis/2017/09/why_airport_retail_is_booming.html|accessdate=September 8, 2017|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers' [[suggested retail price]] (MSRP) but are almost never discounted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nApart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food or culture without leaving the airport.<ref>USA Today newspaper, October 17, 2006, p. 2D</ref>\n\nSome airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.\n\nMajor airports in such countries as Russia and Japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. The smallest type is the [[capsule hotel]] popular in Japan. A slightly larger variety is known as a [[sleep box]]. An even larger type is provided by the company [[YOTEL]].\n\n=== Premium and VIP services ===\n[[File:ZiaAirportVIP-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shahjalal International Airport]]'s [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Airport terminal|Terminal]], [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh ]]\nAirports may also contain premium and VIP services. The premium and VIP services may include express [[Airport check-in|check-in]] and dedicated check-in counters.\nThese services are usually reserved for [[First class (aviation)|first]] and [[business class]] passengers, premium [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flyers]], and members of the airline's clubs. Premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline's frequent flyer program. This can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.\n\nSometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.\n\nAirline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Lounges themselves typically have [[airport chair|seating]], showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, [[Wi-Fi]] and Internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. Some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.\n\nAirlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. Multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.\n\n=== Cargo and freight service ===\nIn addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. [[Cargo airline]]s often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.\n\nCargo Terminal Facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading on the aircraft. Similarly import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. Areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. Designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.\n\nEvery cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. The landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. In addition cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas \u2013 export, import and interline or transshipment.\n[[File:Aeroporto Internacional de Guararapes.jpg|thumb|[[Recife International Airport]] in [[Recife]], Brazil.]]\n\n=== Access and onward travel ===\nAirports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. Large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.\n\nMany large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of [[multimodal transport]], for instance [[Frankfurt Airport]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], [[London Heathrow Airport]], [[Tokyo Haneda Airport]], [[Tokyo Narita Airport]], [[London Gatwick Airport]] and [[London Stansted Airport]]. It is also common to connect an airport and a city with [[rapid transit]], [[light rail]] lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the [[AirTrain JFK]] at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[Transportation in New York City|New York]], [[Link Light Rail]] that runs from the heart of downtown [[Seattle]] to [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]], and the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|T]] at [[Boston]]'s [[Logan International Airport]] by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to [[traffic congestion]]. Large airports usually have access also through [[controlled-access highway]]s ('freeways' or 'motorways') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.\n\n=== Internal transport ===\nThe distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. It is common for airports to provide [[moving walkway]]s, buses, and rail transport systems. Some airports like [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] and [[London Stansted Airport]] have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. Airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], [[Mexico City International Airport]] and [[London Gatwick Airport]].\n\n== Airport operations ==\n[[File:HFX Airport 4.jpg|left|thumb|The apron from the top floor observation room, Halifax International Airport, Canada]]\n\nThere are three types of surface that aircraft operate on:\n*Runways, for takeoff and landing\n*[[Taxiway]]s, where planes \"taxi\" (transfer to and from a runway)\n*[[Airport apron|Apron]] or ramp: a surface where planes are parked, loaded, unloaded or refuelled.\n\n=== Air traffic control ===\n[[File:Torre de controle Rio de Janeiro (Galeao).jpg|thumb|Airport tower]]\n[[Air traffic control]] (ATC) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. At the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.\n\nA \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a [[Air traffic control#Air traffic control tower|control tower]] where the air traffic controllers are based. Pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. A \"[[non-towered airport|non-towered]]\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport's [[common traffic advisory frequency]] (CTAF) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency.\n\nThe majority of the world's airports are small facilities without a tower. Not all towered airports have [[24/7]] ATC operations. In those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. Non-towered airports come under [[Area control center|area (en-route) control]]. [[Remote and virtual tower]] (RVT) is a system in which ATC is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.\n\nAir traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ''ground'' and ''tower'', though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with ''clearance delivery'', ''apron control'', and/or other specialized ATC stations.\n\n====Ground control====\nGround control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"[[maneuvering area|movement areas]]\", except the traffic on runways. This includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. Ground Control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. When a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. Conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from Tower to Ground Control.\n\n====Tower control====\nTower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the [[controlled airspace]] immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft's position in 3D space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.\n\n=== Traffic pattern ===\n{{Main|Airfield traffic pattern}}\n[[File:Airport Traffic Pattern with Upwind Leg.svg|frameless|upright=1.8|right|Left-hand circuit pattern]]\nAt all airports the use of a [[Airfield traffic pattern|traffic pattern]] (often called a ''traffic circuit'' outside the US) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, ''provided there is no queue''. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the [[glidepath]], without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] equipment, things are very different though.\n\nGenerally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually {{convert|800|or|1000|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[above ground level]] (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are ''left-handed'', meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a [[mid-air collision]].\n\nAt controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.\n\n=== Navigational aids ===\n[[File:Vasi-1.JPG|left|thumb|Standard [[Visual Approach Slope Indicator]]]]\nThere are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. A [[visual approach slope indicator]] (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a [[distance measuring equipment]] (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.\n\nLarger airports sometimes offer [[precision approach radar]] (PAR), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft's horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the [[Final approach (aviation)|approach slope]]. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.\n\n=== Taxiway signs ===\n{{Further|Taxiway#Taxiway signs}}\nAirport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.\n\n=== Lighting ===\n{{Further|Taxiway#Taxiway lights|Runway#Runway lighting}}\n\n[[File:ATL TWY B - RWY Crossing (13534655025).jpg|thumb|Airport lighting]]\nMany airports have [[Runway lighting|lighting]] that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.\n\nOn runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. [[Runway edge lights|Runway edge lighting]] consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an [[approach lighting system]], or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use [[pilot-controlled lighting]] to save electricity and staffing costs.\n\nAlong taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway's edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.\n\n=== Weather observations ===\n{{See also|Surface weather observation|Weather station|Automated airport weather station|Automatic weather station}}\n\n[[File:2008-07-09 Eureka Airport AWOS viewed from the south.jpg|thumb|Automated weather system]]\nWeather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. In the US and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of [[automated airport weather station]], whether an AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS, a human observer or a combination of the two. These weather observations, predominantly in the [[METAR]] format, are available over the radio, through [[automatic terminal information service]] (ATIS), via the ATC or the [[flight service station]].\n\nPlanes take-off and land ''into'' the wind to achieve maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a [[windsock]] can also be kept in view of the runway. Aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. Because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.piggottsflagsandbranding.co.uk/updates/interesting-facts-industrial-windsocks/|title=Why do airports have windsocks?|date=|website=Piggotts Flags And Branding|access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Airport ground crew (ground handling) ===\n{{Main|Ground support equipment}}\n[[File:KLM 777 pushback.jpg|thumb|An aircraft tow tractor moving a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 777]]]]\n[[File:20140308 Airport ground operations.jpg|thumb|left|Ground operations at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]]]]\nMost airports have [[groundcrew]] handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport.\n\nAmong the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:\n*A tow tractor to move the aircraft in and out of the berth.\n*A [[jet bridge]] (in some airports) or stairs unit to allow passengers to embark and disembark.\n*A ground power unit for supplying electricity. As the engines will be switched off, they will not be generating electricity as they do in flight.\n*A cleaning service.\n*A catering service to deliver food and drinks for a flight.\n*A toilet waste truck to empty the tank which holds the waste from the toilets in the aircraft.\n*A water truck to fill the water tanks of the aircraft.\n*A refueling vehicle. The fuel may come from a tanker, or from underground fuel tanks.\n*A conveyor belt unit for loading and unloading luggage.\n*A vehicle to transport luggage to and from the terminal.\nThe length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"[[turnaround time]]\". Airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.\n\n=== Maintenance management ===\nLike industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.<ref name=Mothes/>\n\nTo manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: [[Computerized maintenance management system|CMMS (computerized maintenance management system)]] predominate, and mainly enable a company's maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.<ref name=Mothes>{{cite web |first=Daphn\u00e9 |last=Mothes |title=Improve your airport maintenance with your CMMS |url=https://www.mobility-work.com/blog/improve-your-airport-maintenance-your-cmms |work=Mobility Work |date=January 15, 2019 |access-date=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Safety management ===\n[[File:Altenburg-Nobitz Airport Rosenbauer Panther.jpg|thumb|\"FLF Panther\" airport crash tender in Germany]]\n[[File:Sumburgh Airport Barrier.webm|thumb|Road crossing of ([[Shetland]]) A970 with [[Sumburgh Airport|Sumburgh]] airport's runway. The movable barrier closes when aircraft land or take off.]]\n[[Aviation safety]] is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. [[Airport crash tender]] crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable [[aviation fuel]]. The crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]], and terrorist activities.\n\nHazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is [[airfield rubber removal]] which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see [[foreign object damage]]). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. For waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special [[deicing]] fluids on the wings.\n\nMany airports are built near open fields or [[wetland]]s. These tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of [[bird strike]]s. Airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.\n\nSome airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. Other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.\n\nAn airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. Records are kept of any [[runway incursion|incursions]] where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. These locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the FAA in the US) and airport administrators.\n\nDuring the 1980s, a phenomenon known as [[microburst]] became a growing concern due to [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aircraft accidents]] caused by microburst [[wind shear]], such as [[Delta Air Lines Flight 191]]. Microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.\n\nSome airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway ([[Blast pad|stopway]] or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like [[styrofoam]], bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.\n\nAirports often have [[Aircraft rescue and firefighting|on-site firefighters]] to respond to emergencies. These use specialized vehicles, known as [[airport crash tender]]s.\n\n== Environmental concerns and sustainability ==\n[[File:Pista Congonhas01.jpg|thumb|Runway at [[Congonhas-S\u00e3o Paulo Airport]] in Brazil.]]\n[[Aircraft noise]] is a major cause of [[Noise pollution|noise disturbance]] to residents living near airports. Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. Aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings, but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. Noise can have other [[Health effects from noise|noise health effects]]. Other noise and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading the airport.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, local flora and fauna. Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://catsr.ite.gmu.edu/SYST460/IntroAirportsWorkbook.pdf|title=Introduction to Airports Design and Operations|last=Sherry|first=Lance|year=2009|website=George Mason University Center for Air Transportation Systems Research|access-date=}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nSome of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. These reports contain all [[environmental protection]] measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.\n\nA 2019 report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US [[Transportation Research Board]] showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction initiatives. Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a providing ground for their feasibility. Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=National Academies of Sciences|first=Engineering|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25609/airport-greenhouse-gas-reduction-efforts|title=Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts|date=October 23, 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA growing number of airports are installing solar [[photovoltaic]] arrays to offset their electricity use.<ref>Anurag et al.

Another airport known for considering environmental parameters is the [[Seymour Airport]] at Galapagos Islands.\n\n== {{anchor|Military airbase}} Military air base ==\n{{Main|Air base}}\n[[File:French Air Contingent, NATO Baltic Air-policing.jpg|thumb|[[Fighter aircraft]] at an airbase in [[Lithuania]]]]\nAn airbase, sometimes referred to as an ''air station'' or ''airfield'', provides basing and support of [[military aircraft]]. Some airbases, known as ''military airports'', provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. For example, [[RAF Brize Norton]] in the UK has a terminal which caters to passengers for the [[Royal Air Force]]'s scheduled flights to the [[Falkland Islands]]. Some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same ATC facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. [[Bardufoss Airport]], [[Bardufoss Air Station]] in Norway and [[Pune Airport]] in India are examples of this.\n\nAn [[aircraft carrier]] is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. Aircraft carriers allow a [[Navy|naval force]] to project [[Aerial warfare|air power]] without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. After their development in World War I, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during World War II.\n\n== Airport designation and naming ==\n{{Further|List of airports}}\n\nAirports are uniquely represented by their [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA airport code]] and [[International Civil Aviation Organization airport code|ICAO airport code]].\n\nMost airport names include the location. Many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]], [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]), a monarch (e.g. [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]], [[King Abdulaziz International Airport]]), a cultural leader (e.g. [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]], [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport]], [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]]) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. [[Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport]]), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. [[Allama Iqbal International Airport]]) and explorers (e.g. [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]]).\n\nSome airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nSome airport names include the word \"International\" to indicate their ability to handle [[International airport|international air traffic]]. This includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. [[Albany International Airport]]).\n\n== History and development ==\n[[File:Kharkov Airport Sokolniki.jpg|thumb|The Kharkiv Airport in Sokolniki, [[Ukraine]] (1924).]]\nThe earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1JcWmb9Ik8C&pg=PA154|title=Soft Landing: Airline Industry Strategy, Service, and Safety|last=Thomas|first=Andrew R.|date=2011|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-3677-1|page=154}}</ref> The plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. A slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. However, these functioned well only in dry conditions. Later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.\n\nThe title of \"world's oldest airport\" is disputed. [[College Park Airport]] in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by [[Wright brothers|Wilbur Wright]], is generally agreed to be the world's oldest continuously operating airfield,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgparks.com/places/historic/cpairport.html |title=College Park Airport |publisher=Pgparks.com |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531180243/http://pgparks.com/places/historic/cpairport.html |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> although it serves only [[general aviation]] traffic. \n\n[[Beijing Nanyuan Airport]] in China, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910.<ref>http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2019/09/25/629668.html</ref> It was in operation until September 2019. [[Pearson Field Airport]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]], United States, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of January 2020.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n[[Hamburg Airport]] opened in January 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. [[Bremen Airport]] opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] opened on September 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted [[Civil aviation|civil aircraft]] only since December 17, 1920, allowing [[Sydney Airport]]\u2014which started operations in January 1920\u2014to claim to be one of the world's oldest continuously operating commercial airports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/353DC91E-A259-449B-8B68-C8E88CB58691/0/FactSheetHistory1.pdf |title=Sydney Airport history |format=PDF |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401043447/http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/353DC91E-A259-449B-8B68-C8E88CB58691/0/FactSheetHistory1.pdf |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}</ref> [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport]] in the US opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. [[Rome Ciampino Airport]], opened 1916, is also a contender, as well as the [[Don Mueang International Airport]] near Bangkok, Thailand, which opened in 1914.\nIncreased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.\n[[File:New Orleans postcard Moissant Airport 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New Orleans International Airport]] passenger terminal building in [[New Orleans]] (1960s).]]\nFollowing the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. One of the earliest such fields was [[Paris \u2013 Le Bourget Airport]] at [[Le Bourget]], near Paris. The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] in August 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by [[Croydon Airport]] in March 1920.<ref>Bluffield (2009)</ref> In 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at [[Kaliningrad Devau Airport|Flughafen Devau]] near what was then [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], East Prussia. The airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.\n\nThe first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s [[Approach lighting system|approach lighting]] came into use. These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). In the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft's position on the [[Instrument landing system|glideslope]]. Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.\n[[File:Bosasairp.jpg|thumb|The [[Bender Qassim International Airport]] in [[Bosaso]], Somalia (2007).]]\nAfter [[World War II]], airport design became more sophisticated. Passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. This arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. But it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.\n\nAn improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. These run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane's wheels.\n\nAirport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in [[jet aircraft]] traffic. Runways were extended out to {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}}. The fields were constructed out of [[reinforced concrete]] using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. The early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. These systems became commonplace in the United States by the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe malicious use of UAVs has led to the deployment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare#Anti-UAV defences|counter unmanned air system]] (C-UAS) technologies such as the Aaronia [[AARTOS]] which have been installed on major international airports<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/uv-online/heathrows-picks-new-c-uas-combat-drone-disruption/ |title=Heathrow picks C-UAS to combat drone disruption |accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unmannedairspace.info/counter-uas-systems-and-policies/muscat-international-airport-install-usd10-million-aaronia-counter-uas-system/ |title=Muscat International Airport to install USD10&nbsp;million Aaronia counter-UAS system |accessdate=January 21, 2019}}</ref>.\n\n== Airports in entertainment ==\n[[File:Washington Dulles International Airport at Dusk.jpg|thumb|[[Washington Dulles International Airport]], ostensibly the setting for ''[[Die Hard 2]]''; the movie was actually filmed at [[Los Angeles International Airport]]]]\nAirports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is ''[[The Terminal]]'', a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'', ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), ''[[Die Hard 2]]'', ''[[Soul Plane]]'', ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'', ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', ''[[Liar Liar]]'', ''[[Passenger 57]]'', ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'' (2000), ''[[Unaccompanied Minors]]'', ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', ''[[Rendition (film)|Rendition]]'' and ''[[The Langoliers (TV miniseries)|The Langoliers]]''. They have also played important parts in television series like ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model, Cycle 10]]'' which have significant parts of their story set within airports. In other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''.\n\nSeveral computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport.
