It was born through fiery eruptions and has solidified lava streams as well as extravagant rock formations. The island emerged about 15 million years ago as product of the [[Canary hotspot]]. The island, along with others, emerged after the breakup of the African and the American continental plates. The greatest recorded eruptions occurred between 1730 and 1736 in the area now designated [[Timanfaya National Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Timanfaya|url=https://www.lanzaroteguide.com/timanfaya/|website=Lanzarote Guide|accessdate=1 August 2017|ref=20}}</ref>\n\n==Biodiversity==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:La Geria vines.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Malvasia]] grape vines growing in topsoil covered in [[lapilli]], in [[La Geria]]. The low, curved walls protect the vines from the constant, drying wind.]]\n\n===Plants===\nThere are five hundred different kinds of plants on the island, of which 17 species are [[endemism|endemic]]. These plants have adapted to the relative scarcity of water in the same way as [[succulent]]s. They include the [[Canary Island date palm]] (''Phoenix canariensis''), which is found in damper areas of the north, the [[Canary Island pine]] (''Pinus canariensis''), [[fern]]s, and [[Olea europaea|wild olive trees]] (''Olea europaea''). ''[[Laurisilva]]'' trees, which once covered the highest parts of Risco de Famara, are rarely found today. After winter rainfall, the vegetation comes to a colourful bloom between February and March.\n\nThe [[vineyard]]s of La Ger\u00eda, [[Lanzarote (DO)|Lanzarote]] ''[[Denominaci\u00f3n de origen|DO]]'' wine region, are a protected area. Single vines are planted in pits {{convert|4|-|5|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|2|-|3|m|abbr=off}} deep, with small stone walls around each pit. This agricultural technique is designed to harvest rainfall and overnight dew and to protect the plants from the winds.<!-- NO World Heritage Site on Lanzarote ! see [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain]]: The vineyards, with their traditional methods of cultivation, are part of the [[World Heritage Site]], as well as other sites on the island. -->\n\nPoo\nEar \nPop\n\n===Animals===\nApart from the native bats and the mammals which accompanied humans to the island (including the [[dromedary]], which was used for agriculture and is now a tourist attraction), there are few vertebrate species on Lanzarote. These include birds (such as [[falcon]]s) and reptiles. Some interesting endemic animals are the ''[[Gallotia]]'' lizards and the blind ''[[Munidopsis polymorpha]]'' crabs found in the Jameos del Agua lagoon, which was formed by a volcanic eruption. The island is also home to one of two surviving populations of the threatened [[Canarian Egyptian vulture]].\n\n== Natural symbols ==\n{{Main|List of animal and plant symbols of the Canary Islands}}\nThe official natural symbols associated with Lanzarote are ''[[Munidopsis polymorpha]]'' (Blind crab) and ''[[Euphorbia balsamifera]]'' (Tabaiba dulce).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gobcan.es/boc/1991/061/001.html|title=BOC \u2013 1991/061.

In 1768, drought affected the deforested island, and winter rains did not fall. Much of the population was forced to emigrate to [[Cuba]] and the [[Americas]], including a group which formed a significant addition to the Spanish settlers in [[Texas]] at [[San Antonio de Bexar]] in 1731. Another volcanic eruption occurred within the range of Tiagua in 1824, which was less violent than the major eruption between 1730 and 1736.\n\nIn 1927, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura became part of the province of [[Las Palmas]].

It was born through fiery eruptions and has solidified lava streams as well as extravagant rock formations. The island emerged about 15 million years ago as product of the [[Canary hotspot]]. The island, along with others, emerged after the breakup of the African and the American continental plates. The greatest recorded eruptions occurred between 1730 and 1736 in the area now designated [[Timanfaya National Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Timanfaya|url=https://www.lanzaroteguide.com/timanfaya/|website=Lanzarote Guide|accessdate=1 August 2017|ref=20}}</ref>\n\n==Biodiversity==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:La Geria vines.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Malvasia]] grape vines growing in topsoil covered in [[lapilli]], in [[La Geria]]. The low, curved walls protect the vines from the constant, drying wind.]]\n\n===Plants===\nThere are five hundred different kinds of plants on the island, of which 17 species are [[endemism|endemic]]. These plants have adapted to the relative scarcity of water in the same way as [[succulent]]s. They include the [[Canary Island date palm]] (''Phoenix canariensis''), which is found in damper areas of the north, the [[Canary Island pine]] (''Pinus canariensis''), [[fern]]s, and [[Olea europaea|wild olive trees]] (''Olea europaea''). ''[[Laurisilva]]'' trees, which once covered the highest parts of Risco de Famara, are rarely found today. After winter rainfall, the vegetation comes to a colourful bloom between February and March.\n\nThe [[vineyard]]s of La Ger\u00eda, [[Lanzarote (DO)|Lanzarote]] ''[[Denominaci\u00f3n de origen|DO]]'' wine region, are a protected area. Single vines are planted in pits {{convert|4|-|5|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|2|-|3|m|abbr=off}} deep, with small stone walls around each pit. This agricultural technique is designed to harvest rainfall and overnight dew and to protect the plants from the winds.<!-- NO World Heritage Site on Lanzarote ! see [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain]]: The vineyards, with their traditional methods of cultivation, are part of the [[World Heritage Site]], as well as other sites on the island. -->\n\n===Fungi===\nThere are 180 different species of [[lichen|lichen-forming fungi]]. These survive in the suitable areas like rock surfaces, and promote weathering.\n\n===Animals===\nApart from the native bats and the mammals which accompanied humans to the island (including the [[dromedary]], which was used for agriculture and is now a tourist attraction), there are few vertebrate species on Lanzarote. These include birds (such as [[falcon]]s) and reptiles. Some interesting endemic animals are the ''[[Gallotia]]'' lizards and the blind ''[[Munidopsis polymorpha]]'' crabs found in the Jameos del Agua lagoon, which was formed by a volcanic eruption. The island is also home to one of two surviving populations of the threatened [[Canarian Egyptian vulture]].\n\n== Natural symbols ==\n{{Main|List of animal and plant symbols of the Canary Islands}}\nThe official natural symbols associated with Lanzarote are ''[[Munidopsis polymorpha]]'' (Blind crab) and ''[[Euphorbia balsamifera]]'' (Tabaiba dulce).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gobcan.es/boc/1991/061/001.html|title=BOC \u2013 1991/061.
