These were constructed from 3300 to 900 BCE in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]].{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} It has been estimated that around 4,000 of these monuments were originally constructed in this part of north-western Europe during this period.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} Around 1,300 of them are recorded, the others having been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=9}}\n\nAlthough [[stone circles]] have been erected throughout history by a variety of societies and for a variety of reasons, in the [[Late Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age Britain|Early Bronze Ages]], this particular tradition was limited to Britain, Ireland and the neighbouring area of continental Europe now known as [[Brittany]]. The rings were not distributed equally across this area, but were concentrated in several highland regions: north-eastern and central Scotland, the [[Lake District]], the south-west peninsula of England, and the north and south-west of Ireland. Sparser groupings can also be found in [[Caithness]], the [[Outer Hebrides]], the [[Peak District]], the [[Wicklow Mountains]], [[Wales]] and [[Wessex]].{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=9}}\n\nTheir original purpose is not fully known, but archaeological investigation has shed some light on it. It is widely thought that they served a ritual or ceremonial purpose, particularly in relation to solar and/or lunar alignments. In a minority of cases, some were also used as cemeteries, with burials being made in and around the circle.\n\nAntiquarian investigation into the circles began in the Early Modern period, intensifying after the publications of notable English antiquarian [[William Stukeley]] in the 18th century. At the time, scholars understood little of prehistoric Britain, with the megalithic circles typically being ascribed either to the [[druid]]s of the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] or to the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Danish settlers]] of [[Early Medieval]] times.\n\nIn the 20th century, with the development of [[archaeology]], archaeologists could investigate the circles in more detail. They dated them to the Late Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Since the late 20th century, many of these monuments were adopted as \"sacred sites\" by adherents of [[Paganism (contemporary religious movements)|contemporary pagan]] religions such as [[Neo-Druidism]], [[Wicca]] and the [[Goddess movement]], and they had used the sites as places to conduct their magico-religious rites.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Early Neolithic===\n[[File:WKLB Mittelgang DB.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of [[West Kennet Long Barrow]]. Long barrows such as this one were the dominant form of megalithic architecture before the development of the stone circle tradition.]]\n\nDuring the Neolithic, or 'New Stone Age', there were extensive cultural changes across north-western Europe. The introduction of [[agriculture]] ended the [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle which had dominated in the preceding Palaeolithic ('Old Stone Age') and Mesolithic ('Middle Stone Age') periods.\n\nDuring the Early Neolithic in Brittany and the British Isles, the megalithic tradition of building [[chambered tomb]]s for the dead had waxed and waned. The chambered tomb tradition lasted between about 4000 and 3500 BCE, although an earlier example, at [[Carrowmore]] in County Sligo, has been disputably dated to 5000 BCE.<ref name=\"Pearson 2005. p. 34\">[[#Par05|Parker Pearson 2005]]. p. 34.</ref><ref name=\"Burl 2000 24\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 24.</ref> The length of this tradition led prehistorian [[Mike Parker Pearson]] to note that it was \"a relatively short-lived fashion in archaeological terms.\"<ref name=\"Pearson 2005. p. 34\"/> In southern England, 84% of chambered tombs were built in a north-east to south-east orientation, which probably had some special significance for their builders.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=23}}\n\nIn some parts of the British Isles, architectural changes were made to the style of chambered tomb, which may have been a forerunner of the later circular design of the stone rings.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 26-27\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. pp. 26-27.</ref> In the later Clyde tombs of south-western Scotland and the court-cairns of northern Ireland, crescent-shaped forecourts were constructed inside the tombs. This would have enabled more people to enter the tomb and take part in any rites there in sunlight.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 26-27\"/>\n\nDuring the Early Neolithic another form of monument was also constructed in the British Isles, now known by archaeologists as [[causewayed enclosure]]s.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 25.</ref> These  consisted of massive circular ditch-and-bank earthworks. Construction of causewayed enclosures in the lowland regions of Southern England flourished around 3800 BCE, but by 3200 BCE almost all of them had been abandoned by their users.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/> No equivalents have been found in the highland areas of northern Britain.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/> Despite having excavated a number of these sites across southern Britain, archaeologists do not know their exact purpose. It has been suggested that they were camps, markets, cattle kraals or occasional settlements, or perhaps ritual centres for the celebration of seasonal festivals or cemeteries.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/>\n\n===Late Neolithic===\n\nAs the transition from the [[Neolithic|Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic]] took place in around 3000 BCE, there was much economic and technological continuity. But there was considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} By that date, the [[long barrow]]s, [[causewayed enclosure]]s, and [[cursus]]es which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased to be built. They were replaced by circular monuments of various kinds.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} These include not only stone circles, but also earthen [[henge]]s and [[timber circles]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=91\u201394}} This transition toward circular monuments had symbolic associations. As the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]] stated, \"There was a change from the cramped, gloomy chamber of a tomb to the unroofed, wide ring, a change from darkness to light, from the dead to the living, from the grave to the sky.\"{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=38}} Similar observations were made by the historian Ronald Hutton, who commented that the circular shape of the rings \"mirrors the sun, the full moon and the bounds of the horizon\" and that such a shape can also be \"profoundly egalitarian\".{{sfn|Hutton|1991|p=52}}\n\n[[File:Maumbury Rings center.jpg|thumb|left|Alongside the stone circles, earthen henges (such as [[Maumbury Rings]] in Dorset) were erected in Late Neolithic Britain]]\n\nThis transition was, according to historian [[Ronald Hutton]], \"as fundamental as that from the Mesolithic had been.\"<ref name=\"Hutton 1991 52\">[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 52.</ref> Archaeological pollen analysis has shown that it was a period when scrub and weeds were spreading over what had formerly been cultivated fields, and forests that had previously been cleared began to grow back.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 29.</ref> Chambered tombs were blocked up and abandoned, implying that people were ceasing to use them as cultic sites.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/> Several former causewayed enclosures were converted into defensive structures with gateways and walls, and in some cases they were attacked. Evidence for conflict has been found at [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] in Cornwall, [[Hambledon Hill]] in Dorset, and Crickley Hill in Gloucestershire.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/> Various archaeologists have suggested that this was a period of particular turmoil within the British Isles, perhaps caused by an overuse of land, the failure of crops, famine, plague, climatic change, or an increase in population that was not supported by the food supply.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/>\n\n===Early Bronze Age===\nThe start of the Bronze Age in Britain was signalled by the introduction of [[bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and usually [[tin]]. Ideologically, there is no evidence for a change in Brittany and the British Isles at this time, with communities continuing to construct megalithic stone circles. The archaeologists J.M. Coles and A.F. Harding noted that across western Europe, the Bronze Age was \"closely and logically connected\" with the Late Neolithic which preceded it, and that the marker that is applied between the two by contemporary archaeologists is \"arbitrary\".{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=213}}\n\n==Description==\n\nThe historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that, along with the [[chambered long barrow]]s of the Early Neolithic, stone circles are one of the most prominent forms of monument produced in prehistoric Britain.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} Despite the commonly used term \"stone circles\", many of these monuments are not true circles, but are instead ellipses or ovals.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=91}} The stone circles are not always found in isolation from other forms of monument and often intersect with timber and earth structures.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=132}} For this reason, the archaeologist [[Richard Bradley (archaeologist)|Richard Bradley]] cautioned against understanding stone circles, timber circles, and earthen henges as distinct \"types\" of monument.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=132}}\n\nThe archaeologist Alexander Thom suggested that the stone circles fell into four broad classes: circles, flattened circles, egg-shaped rings, and ellipses.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}\n\nSome stone circles, such as that at [[Stanton Drew stone circles|Stanton Drew]] in [[Somerset]], are approached by a short alignment of paired stones.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=123}} There are also stone avenues that link different monuments in the landscape, such as the [[West Kennet Avenue]] which links the Avebury henge to [[The Sanctuary]].{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=124}} In some cases, the stone circles survive in such a damaged state that it is not possible to know what they originally looked like.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}\n\nIn some examples, timber posts were replaced with stone ones, perhaps with the intention of making the monument more durable and protecting it from decay.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=125}} In others, it is possible that both wooden and stone features of the circle were contemporary with each other.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=124}}\n\nLike henges, the stone circles are almost exclusively found in the British Isles. The distribution of the stone circles is distinctive as it is broader than that of the henges.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} They are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, except the island's south-eastern corner.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}}\nThey are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and near [[Aberdeen]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} There is much diversity in the design of these circles, both between different regions and within them.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} According to Mike Parker Pearson, this is \"perhaps unsurprising for a thousand-year fashion\".{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:LongMegAndHerDaughters(SimonLedingham)May2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Long Meg and Her Daughters]], the largest example of Alexander Thom's Type B Flattened Circle]]\nThe archaeologist and stone circle specialist Aubrey Burl noted that the stone circle builders would have had to undertake \"careful planning\" before they erected these monuments. There was much that they had to take into consideration: the choice of location, the size of the ring, the transport of the heavy stones, the laying out of the circle or ellipse, and the preparation of stone holes. They may have also had to plot astronomical alignments, making the task more difficult.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=43}}\n\nMost stone circles were constructed upon flat ground, although some were instead built on a slope. At some sites, such as [[Kiltierney]] in [[County Fermanagh]], the land was flattened especially for this purpose, although in other cases it is clear that the land had been flattened by earlier communities, who had used the land for settlement or agriculture.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=43}}\n\nAaron Watson has argued that various circles were located in a particular position to give the appearance of occupying the centre of the world, representing a microcosm of the surrounding area.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\nIn some instances it appears that the choice of material used was important.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} For instance, at the [[Ring of Brodgar]] the stones used in the circle were produced from a variety of different sources.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}}\n\nVery little is known about the process of quarrying the stone and transporting it to the sites of the circles.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} One exception is at [[Vestra Fiold]] in [[Orkney]], where [[Colin Richards]] led an excavation that determined that the stones used for the Orcadian stone circles were cut from a horizontal seam of bedrock that was located just below the surface.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} These had been eased over a large pit and supported on stone trestles, after which wooden rollers and a sled were likely positioned underneath, allowing the megalith to be moved.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} One of these stones, which weighed over 10 tonnes, had been left in its original position poised on stone supports, to be discovered by the archaeological excavators.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|pp=59\u201360}}\n\n===Dating, number and size===\nBurl noted that archaeologists assumed that for every stone circle that survived to the late 20th century,  there would have been two lost. From the 1300 surviving examples, Burl calculated that there might have originally been around 4000 stone circles across Britain, Ireland and Brittany.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}\n\nSince the 1950s, archaeologists have been able to use [[radiocarbon dating]] of the material around the stones in order to accurately date their original construction.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} As of 2000, the earliest known radiocarbon dating of a stone circle was from the [[Lochmaben Stone]] in [[Dumfriesshire]], which was dated to 2525 \u00b1 85 BCE, whilst the latest examples came from Sandy Road in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] (1200 \u00b1 150 BCE), from [[Dromberg]] in [[County Cork]] (790 \u00b1 80 BCE), and from the Five-Stone ring of [[Cashelkeety]] in [[County Kerry]] (715 \u00b1 50 BCE).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} Burl said that, the calibration of these dates indicated that the stone circle tradition existed between 3300 and 900 BCE.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}\n\n[[File:Avebury Stone Circles.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Avebury in Wiltshire is the largest example of a stone circle from the British Isles, and is physically situated within an earlier henge.]]\nThe size of the megalithic rings varied, perhaps according to the number of people who would be using it during ceremonies.{{sfn|Burl|2000|pp=44\u201345}} Burl calculated that the largest stone circle in terms of both diameter and area was [[Stanton Drew stone circles|Stanton Drew]] in Somerset, with a diameter of {{convert|112.2|m|ft}} and an area of 9,887 m\u00b2 (2.44 acres). Second came the [[Ring of Brodgar]] in Orkney at {{convert|103.6|m|ft}} in diameter and 8,430 m\u00b2 (2.08 acres) in area, whilst third was [[Avebury]] in Wiltshire, which had a diameter of {{convert|102.4|m|ft}} and an area of 8,236m\u00b2 (2.04 acres).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=46}} However, Burl did not count the outer stone circle at Avebury, which has a diameter of {{convert|331.6|m|ft}}, making it Britain's largest stone circle. All of the largest circles were found in or near earlier henge monuments.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=45}} Such gargantuan monuments were rare. Burl calculated that most of the megalithic rings (92%) had an average diameter of {{convert|13.7|m|ft}}, with an average area of 150 m\u00b2 (1615&nbsp;ft\u00b2).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=46}}\n\n===Megalithic yard===\nThe archaeologist [[Alexander Thom]] proposed that the stone circles were built using a unit of measurement which he called the \"[[megalithic yard]]\",{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} about {{convert|2.72|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}} He came to this conclusion following more than forty years of surveying the monuments, aided by his son Archibald Stevenson Thom.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}\nParker Pearson stated that \"the idea of a standard unit of measurement is very plausible\" but perhaps not as regular as Thom and others have argued.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} In 1980, Burl noted that the idea of Thom's Megalithic Yard \"remain[ed] contentious\".{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}\n\n===Astronomical alignments===\n\nThom also argued that the builders of these circles were accomplished astronomers and deliberately included astronomical alignments in the rings.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}\nAccording to Parker Pearson, however, many of the circles do not appear to be based on any astronomical alignment.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} Pearson cautioned that Late Neolithic/Bronze Age conceptions of cosmology were likely very different from modern understandings of astronomy.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} However, it has been found that the earliest standing stone monuments in the British Isles, the great circles such as Callanish on the Isle of Lewis and Stenness on the Isle of Orkney, were specifically constructed to align with the sun and moon, and the movements of the sun and moon across the local landscape.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.05.025|title = Origins of Standing Stone Astronomy in Britain: New quantitative techniques for the study of archaeoastronomy|journal = Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|volume = 9|pages = 249\u2013258|year = 2016|last1 = Higginbottom|first1 = Gail|last2 = Clay|first2 = Roger}}</ref>\n\n==Purposes==\n[[File:Rollrights King's Men.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The largest stone in the King's Men, a stone circle that is the dominant part of the [[Rollright Stones]] complex in the [[Cotswolds]].]]\n\nThere has been much analysis and debate about these monuments.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} No simple explanations have emerged.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} The original purposes of the stone ring monuments has been widely debated by antiquarians and archaeologists for several centuries.\n\nThese stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=97}} This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence. They may have been deliberately left as \"silent and empty monuments\".{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}} The archaeologists [[Mike Parker Pearson]] and Ramilsonina suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead and wood with the living.{{sfnm|1a1=Bradley|1y=2007|1p=126|2a1=Hutton|2y=2013|2pp=97\u201398}} Bradley noted that this interpretation was \"consistent with the archaeological evidence from Britain\",{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} where evidence for feasting and other human activities have been found at a range of timber sites but not at their stone counterparts. At the latter sites, there has been evidence of human remains.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} Bradley suggested that the stone circles may have been spaces \"devoted to the dead\".{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}}\n\n==Regional distribution==\nAubrey Burl's gazetteer lists 1,303 stone circles in Britain, Ireland and Brittany. The largest number of these are found in Scotland, with 508 sites recorded. There are 316 in England; 187 in Ireland; 156 in Northern Ireland; 81 in Wales; 49 in Brittany; and 6 in the Channel Isles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=395}}\n\n===South-west Britain===\n\nThere are 13 to be found on [[Dartmoor]], including [[Brisworthy stone circle]] and [[Scorhill]], and numerous examples to be found in Cornwall such as [[The Merry Maidens]], [[The Hurlers]] and [[Boscawen-Un]].\n\nIn contrast to the over 70 stone circles known from Dartmoor, there are only two known from [[Exmoor]]:{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=150}} [[Porlock Stone Circle]] and [[Withypool Stone Circle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=150|2a1=Riley|2a2=Wilson-North|2y=2001|2p=24|3a1=Gillings|3y=2015a|3p=1}} The contrast between the number of rings on the two moors may be because Dartmoor has abundant natural [[granite]] while Exmoor has none, instead having [[Devonian]] slates and [[Exmoor Group#Hangman Sandstone Formation|Hangman Grits]], both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=150}} The two Exmoor stones are made from smaller stones, which archaeologists have termed ''miniliths''. However, the presence of other Exmoor constructions, such as the [[clapper bridge]] at [[Tarr Steps]] and the three-metre Long Stone at [[Challacombe]], which do use locally sourced large megaliths, suggests that larger stones would have been available had the sites' builders desired, and that the use of miniliths was perhaps deliberate.{{sfn|Gillings|2015b|p=210}}\n\n===Wessex===\nWessex contains the two best known, though most atypical stone circles, [[Avebury]] and [[Stonehenge]].{{fact|date=January 2020}} All of the other Wiltshire circles are in a heavily ruined state and in some cases have been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} As noted by the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]], these examples have left behind \"only frustrating descriptions and vague positions\".{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} Most of the known Wiltshire examples were erected on low-lying positions in the landscape.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} \nIn northern Wiltshire, in the area to the south of [[Swindon]], at least seven stone circles are reported as having existed, often only a few miles distant from one another;{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} of these, the [[Day House Lane Stone Circle]] is the only example to survive.{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} The stones of the [[Fir Clump Stone Circle]] were for instance removed during construction of the [[M4 motorway]] in 1969.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=311|2a1=Burl|2y=2004|2p=205|3a1=Field|3a2=McOmish|3y=2017|3p=78}}\n\n[[File:Nine Stones, Dorset.jpg|thumb|left|The Nine Stones near Winterbourne Abbas, Dorset]]\n\nThe area of modern Dorset has a \"thin scatter\" of stone circles,{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=307}} with nine possible examples known within its boundaries: [[Hampton Down Stone Circle]], [[Kingston Russell Stone Circle]], [[Nine Stones, Winterbourne Abbas|Nine Stones]], and [[Rempstone Stone Circle]] remain visible.{{sfn|Gale|2003|p=72}} The archaeologist John Gale described these as \"a small but significant group\" of such monuments.{{sfn|Gale|2003|p=72}} All are located within five miles of the sea.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=308}} All but Rempstone\u2014which is on the [[Isle of Purbeck]]\u2014are located on the chalk hills west of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]].{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=138}} The Dorset circles have a simplistic typology, being of comparatively small size, with none exceeding 28 metres in diameter.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1a2=Piggott|1y=1939|1p=139|2a1=Burl|2y=2000|2p=308|3a1=Gale|3y=2003|3p=72}} All are oval in shape, although perhaps have been altered from their original form.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=308|2a1=Gale|2y=2003|2p=72}}\n\nWith the exception of the sandstone Rempstone circle, all consist of sarsen boulders.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=138}} Much of this may have been obtained from the \"Valley of Stones\", a location at the foot of Crow Hill near to [[Littlebredy]], which is located within the vicinity of many of these circles.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=308|2a1=Gale|2y=2003|2pp=182\u2013183}} With the exception of the circle at [[Litton Cheney]], none display evidence of any outlying stones or earthworks around the stone circle.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=139}} The archaeologists [[Stuart Piggott|Stuart]] and [[Margaret Guido|Cecily Piggott]] believed that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin,{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}} a view endorsed by Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} It is possible that they were not all constructed around the same date.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=141}} The Piggotts suggested that while they may well be Early Bronze Age in date, it is also possible that \"their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age\".{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}}\nTheir nearest analogies are the circles found on [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] to the west, and the [[Stanton Drew stone circles]] to the north.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=140}} It is also possible that the stone circles were linked to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}} On average Dorset's earthen henges are four times larger than the stone circles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=308}}\n\n===Northern England===\nIn what is now northern England, there was a particularly rich stone circle tradition in Cumbria. Several large megalithic rings were constructed here, such as [[Castlerigg stone circle]], [[Swinside]], and [[Long Meg and Her Daughters]].\n\n===Scotland===\n[[Image:Ring of Brodgar 3.jpg|thumb|The Ring of Brodgar, a Neolithic stone circle on [[Orkney]], Scotland.]]\nStone circles exist throughout Scotland, from [[Ninestane Rig]] in the far south to more famous examples in the far north and particularly in the islands (where several form part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]]). The [[Callanish Stones]] are one of the best-known examples in the [[Outer Hebrides]], while [[Orkney]] is known for its [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney|Neolithic monuments]], including the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and the [[Standing Stones of Stenness]].\n\n==Later history==\n\nIn some cases, the stones were removed from the rings for use as a building material.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}} In others, the site has been disrupted by natural causes such as trees, the roots of which have shifted the location of the megaliths.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}\n\n===Late Bronze and Iron Ages===\nEvidence for the destruction of stone circles first comes from the Late Bronze Age.\n\n===Medieval period===\n\nFollowing the Christianisation of Britain in the Early Medieval period, various Christian clergyman denounced those pagans who continued to venerate at stones in the landscape, which in some cases perhaps implied stone circles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=14}}\n\nBy the Late Mediaeval period, references to prehistoric monuments in the British Isles were rare, and were usually only to note down practical matters, such as that a judicial court would be held near to one or that a farmer's land lay near to one.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=15}}\nA rare exception is found in the fictionalised ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (c.1136), in which the chronicle's author [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] claimed that Stonehenge had once been the Giants' Ring, and that it had originally been located on [[Mount Killaraus]] in Ireland, until the wizard [[Merlin]] moved it to Salisbury Plain.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=15}}\n\n===Antiquarian and archaeological investigation===\n\nMany 19th century antiquarians produced plans of the circles which were \"inaccurate and slipshod.\"{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}\n\n==Folklore==\nIn the Mediaeval and Early Modern period onward, much folklore developed around the subject of the stone circles.\n\nIn Britain, several stone circles have been connected to the [[countless stones]] motif in folklore. The earliest recorded account comes from [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''The 7 Wonders of England'', written prior to 1586. Sidney linked the motif to Stonehenge.{{sfn|Menefee|1975|p=146}} Subsequently, the antiquary [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] mentioned the story in his book, ''The Survey of Cornwall'', published in 1602, noting that it was applied both the Stonehenge and to The Hurlers in Cornwall.{{sfn|Menefee|1975|pp=146, 155}}\nThe countless stones motif has been attributed to over five different stone circles, as well as several ruined long barrows such as [[Little Kit's Coty House]] in Kent.{{sfn|Grinsell|1976|p=63}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of stone circles]]\n*[[List of Stone Age art]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book |last=Barnatt |first=J. |year=1989 |title=Stone Circles of Britain |location=Oxford |publisher=British Archaeological Reports |ref=harv}}\n\n:{{cite book |last=Barrett |first=John C. |year=1994 |title=Fragments from Antiquity: An Archaeology of Social Life in Britain, 2900-1200 BC |location=Oxford, UK and Cambridge, USA |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-18954-1 |ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite book |title= Rings of Stone |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |authorlink=Aubrey Burl |year=1979 |publisher=Francis Lincoln |location=London |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite book |title=The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |url= https://archive.org/details/stonecirclesofbr0000burl |url-access= registration |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |authorlink=Aubrey Burl |year=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |isbn=978-0-300-08347-7 |ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite journal |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |author-link=Aubrey Burl |year=2004 |title=A.

These were constructed from 3300 to 900 BCE in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]].{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} It has been estimated that around 4,000 of these monuments were originally constructed in this part of north-western Europe during this period.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} Around 1,300 of them are recorded, the others having been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=9}}\n\nAlthough [[stone circles]] have been erected throughout history by a variety of societies and for a variety of reasons, in the [[Late Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age Britain|Early Bronze Ages]], this particular tradition was limited to Britain, Ireland and the neighbouring area of continental Europe now known as [[Brittany]]. The rings were not distributed equally across this area, but were concentrated in several highland regions: north-eastern and central Scotland, the [[Lake District]], the south-west peninsula of England, and the north and south-west of Ireland. Sparser groupings can also be found in [[Caithness]], the [[Outer Hebrides]], the [[Peak District]], the [[Wicklow Mountains]], [[Wales]] and [[Wessex]].{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=9}}\n\nTheir original purpose is not fully known, but archaeological investigation has shed some light on it. It is widely thought that they served a ritual or ceremonial purpose, particularly in relation to solar and/or lunar alignments. In a minority of cases, some were also used as cemeteries, with burials being made in and around the circle.\n\nAntiquarian investigation into the circles began in the Early Modern period, intensifying after the publications of notable English antiquarian [[William Stukeley]] in the 18th century. At the time, scholars understood little of prehistoric Britain, with the megalithic circles typically being ascribed either to the [[druid]]s of the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] or to the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Danish settlers]] of [[Early Medieval]] times.\n\nIn the 20th century, with the development of [[archaeology]], archaeologists could investigate the circles in more detail. They dated them to the Late Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Since the late 20th century, many of these monuments were adopted as \"sacred sites\" by adherents of [[Paganism (contemporary religious movements)|contemporary pagan]] religions such as [[Neo-Druidism]], [[Wicca]] and the [[Goddess movement]], and they had used the sites as places to conduct their magico-religious rites.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Early Neolithic===\n[[File:WKLB Mittelgang DB.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of [[West Kennet Long Barrow]]. Long barrows such as this one were the dominant form of megalithic architecture before the development of the stone circle tradition.]]\n\nDuring the Neolithic, or 'New Stone Age', there were extensive cultural changes across north-western Europe. The introduction of [[agriculture]] ended the [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle which had dominated in the preceding Palaeolithic ('Old Stone Age') and Mesolithic ('Middle Stone Age') periods.\n\nDuring the Early Neolithic in Brittany and the British Isles, the megalithic tradition of building [[chambered tomb]]s for the dead had waxed and waned. The chambered tomb tradition lasted between about 4000 and 3500 BCE, although an earlier example, at [[Carrowmore]] in County Sligo, has been disputably dated to 5000 BCE.<ref name=\"Pearson 2005. p. 34\">[[#Par05|Parker Pearson 2005]]. p. 34.</ref><ref name=\"Burl 2000 24\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 24.</ref> The length of this tradition led prehistorian [[Mike Parker Pearson]] to note that it was \"a relatively short-lived fashion in archaeological terms.\"<ref name=\"Pearson 2005. p. 34\"/> In southern England, 84% of chambered tombs were built in a north-east to south-east orientation, which probably had some special significance for their builders.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=23}}\n\nIn some parts of the British Isles, architectural changes were made to the style of chambered tomb, which may have been a forerunner of the later circular design of the stone rings.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 26-27\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. pp. 26-27.</ref> In the later Clyde tombs of south-western Scotland and the court-cairns of northern Ireland, crescent-shaped forecourts were constructed inside the tombs. This would have enabled more people to enter the tomb and take part in any rites there in sunlight.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 26-27\"/>\n\nDuring the Early Neolithic another form of monument was also constructed in the British Isles, now known by archaeologists as [[causewayed enclosure]]s.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 25.</ref> These  consisted of massive circular ditch-and-bank earthworks. Construction of causewayed enclosures in the lowland regions of Southern England flourished around 3800 BCE, but by 3200 BCE almost all of them had been abandoned by their users.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/> No equivalents have been found in the highland areas of northern Britain.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/> Despite having excavated a number of these sites across southern Britain, archaeologists do not know their exact purpose. It has been suggested that they were camps, markets, cattle kraals or occasional settlements, or perhaps ritual centres for the celebration of seasonal festivals or cemeteries.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/>\n\n===Late Neolithic===\n\nAs the transition from the [[Neolithic|Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic]] took place in around 3000 BCE, there was much economic and technological continuity. But there was considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} By that date, the [[long barrow]]s, [[causewayed enclosure]]s, and [[cursus]]es which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased to be built. They were replaced by circular monuments of various kinds.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} These include not only stone circles, but also earthen [[henge]]s and [[timber circles]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=91\u201394}} This transition toward circular monuments had symbolic associations. As the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]] stated, \"There was a change from the cramped, gloomy chamber of a tomb to the unroofed, wide ring, a change from darkness to light, from the dead to the living, from the grave to the sky.\"{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=38}} Similar observations were made by the historian Ronald Hutton, who commented that the circular shape of the rings \"mirrors the sun, the full moon and the bounds of the horizon\" and that such a shape can also be \"profoundly egalitarian\".{{sfn|Hutton|1991|p=52}}\n\n[[File:Maumbury Rings center.jpg|thumb|left|Alongside the stone circles, earthen henges (such as [[Maumbury Rings]] in Dorset) were erected in Late Neolithic Britain]]\n\nThis transition was, according to historian [[Ronald Hutton]], \"as fundamental as that from the Mesolithic had been.\"<ref name=\"Hutton 1991 52\">[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 52.</ref> Archaeological pollen analysis has shown that it was a period when scrub and weeds were spreading over what had formerly been cultivated fields, and forests that had previously been cleared began to grow back.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 29.</ref> Chambered tombs were blocked up and abandoned, implying that people were ceasing to use them as cultic sites.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/> Several former causewayed enclosures were converted into defensive structures with gateways and walls, and in some cases they were attacked. Evidence for conflict has been found at [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] in Cornwall, [[Hambledon Hill]] in Dorset, and Crickley Hill in Gloucestershire.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/> Various archaeologists have suggested that this was a period of particular turmoil within the British Isles, perhaps caused by an overuse of land, the failure of crops, famine, plague, climatic change, or an increase in population that was not supported by the food supply.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/>\n\n===Early Bronze Age===\nThe start of the Bronze Age in Britain was signalled by the introduction of [[bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and usually [[tin]]. Ideologically, there is no evidence for a change in Brittany and the British Isles at this time, with communities continuing to construct megalithic stone circles. The archaeologists J.M. Coles and A.F. Harding noted that across western Europe, the Bronze Age was \"closely and logically connected\" with the Late Neolithic which preceded it, and that the marker that is applied between the two by contemporary archaeologists is \"arbitrary\".{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=213}}\n\n==Description==\n\nThe historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that, along with the [[chambered long barrow]]s of the Early Neolithic, stone circles are one of the most prominent forms of monument produced in prehistoric Britain.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} Despite the commonly used term \"stone circles\", many of these monuments are not true circles, but are instead ellipses or ovals.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=91}} The stone circles are not always found in isolation from other forms of monument and often intersect with timber and earth structures.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=132}} For this reason, the archaeologist [[Richard Bradley (archaeologist)|Richard Bradley]] cautioned against understanding stone circles, timber circles, and earthen henges as distinct \"types\" of monument.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=132}}\n\nThe archaeologist Alexander Thom suggested that the stone circles fell into four broad classes: circles, flattened circles, egg-shaped rings, and ellipses.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}\n\nSome stone circles, such as that at [[Stanton Drew stone circles|Stanton Drew]] in [[Somerset]], are approached by a short alignment of paired stones.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=123}} There are also stone avenues that link different monuments in the landscape, such as the [[West Kennet Avenue]] which links the Avebury henge to [[The Sanctuary]].{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=124}} In some cases, the stone circles survive in such a damaged state that it is not possible to know what they originally looked like.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}\n\nIn some examples, timber posts were replaced with stone ones, perhaps with the intention of making the monument more durable and protecting it from decay.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=125}} In others, it is possible that both wooden and stone features of the circle were contemporary with each other.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=124}}\n\nLike henges, the stone circles are almost exclusively found in the British Isles. The distribution of the stone circles is distinctive as it is broader than that of the henges.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} They are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, except the island's south-eastern corner.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}}\nThey are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and near [[Aberdeen]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} There is much diversity in the design of these circles, both between different regions and within them.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} According to Mike Parker Pearson, this is \"perhaps unsurprising for a thousand-year fashion\".{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:LongMegAndHerDaughters(SimonLedingham)May2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Long Meg and Her Daughters]], the largest example of Alexander Thom's Type B Flattened Circle]]\nThe archaeologist and stone circle specialist Aubrey Burl noted that the stone circle builders would have had to undertake \"careful planning\" before they erected these monuments. There was much that they had to take into consideration: the choice of location, the size of the ring, the transport of the heavy stones, the laying out of the circle or ellipse, and the preparation of stone holes. They may have also had to plot astronomical alignments, making the task more difficult.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=43}}\n\nMost stone circles were constructed upon flat ground, although some were instead built on a slope. At some sites, such as [[Kiltierney]] in [[County Fermanagh]], the land was flattened especially for this purpose, although in other cases it is clear that the land had been flattened by earlier communities, who had used the land for settlement or agriculture.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=43}}\n\nAaron Watson has argued that various circles were located in a particular position to give the appearance of occupying the centre of the world, representing a microcosm of the surrounding area.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\nIn some instances it appears that the choice of material used was important.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} For instance, at the [[Ring of Brodgar]] the stones used in the circle were produced from a variety of different sources.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}}\n\nVery little is known about the process of quarrying the stone and transporting it to the sites of the circles.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} One exception is at [[Vestra Fiold]] in [[Orkney]], where [[Colin Richards]] led an excavation that determined that the stones used for the Orcadian stone circles were cut from a horizontal seam of bedrock that was located just below the surface.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} These had been eased over a large pit and supported on stone trestles, after which wooden rollers and a sled were likely positioned underneath, allowing the megalith to be moved.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} One of these stones, which weighed over 10 tonnes, had been left in its original position poised on stone supports, to be discovered by the archaeological excavators.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|pp=59\u201360}}\n\n===Dating, number and size===\nBurl noted that archaeologists assumed that for every stone circle that survived to the late 20th century,  there would have been two lost. From the 1300 surviving examples, Burl calculated that there might have originally been around 4000 stone circles across Britain, Ireland and Brittany.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}\n\nSince the 1950s, archaeologists have been able to use [[radiocarbon dating]] of the material around the stones in order to accurately date their original construction.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} As of 2000, the earliest known radiocarbon dating of a stone circle was from the [[Lochmaben Stone]] in [[Dumfriesshire]], which was dated to 2525 \u00b1 85 BCE, whilst the latest examples came from Sandy Road in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] (1200 \u00b1 150 BCE), from [[Dromberg]] in [[County Cork]] (790 \u00b1 80 BCE), and from the Five-Stone ring of [[Cashelkeety]] in [[County Kerry]] (715 \u00b1 50 BCE).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} Burl said that, the calibration of these dates indicated that the stone circle tradition existed between 3300 and 900 BCE.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}\n\n[[File:Avebury Stone Circles.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Avebury in Wiltshire is the largest example of a stone circle from the British Isles, and is physically situated within an earlier henge.]]\nThe size of the megalithic rings varied, perhaps according to the number of people who would be using it during ceremonies.{{sfn|Burl|2000|pp=44\u201345}} Burl calculated that the largest stone circle in terms of both diameter and area was [[Stanton Drew stone circles|Stanton Drew]] in Somerset, with a diameter of {{convert|112.2|m|ft}} and an area of 9,887 m\u00b2 (2.44 acres). Second came the [[Ring of Brodgar]] in Orkney at {{convert|103.6|m|ft}} in diameter and 8,430 m\u00b2 (2.08 acres) in area, whilst third was [[Avebury]] in Wiltshire, which had a diameter of {{convert|102.4|m|ft}} and an area of 8,236m\u00b2 (2.04 acres).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=46}} However, Burl did not count the outer stone circle at Avebury, which has a diameter of {{convert|331.6|m|ft}}, making it Britain's largest stone circle. All of the largest circles were found in or near earlier henge monuments.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=45}} Such gargantuan monuments were rare. Burl calculated that most of the megalithic rings (92%) had an average diameter of {{convert|13.7|m|ft}}, with an average area of 150 m\u00b2 (1615&nbsp;ft\u00b2).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=46}}\n\n===Megalithic yard===\nThe archaeologist [[Alexander Thom]] proposed that the stone circles were built using a unit of measurement which he called the \"[[megalithic yard]]\",{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} about {{convert|2.72|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}} He came to this conclusion following more than forty years of surveying the monuments, aided by his son Archibald Stevenson Thom.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}\nParker Pearson stated that \"the idea of a standard unit of measurement is very plausible\" but perhaps not as regular as Thom and others have argued.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} In 1980, Burl noted that the idea of Thom's Megalithic Yard \"remain[ed] contentious\".{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}\n\n===Astronomical alignments===\n\nThom also argued that the builders of these circles were accomplished astronomers and deliberately included astronomical alignments in the rings.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}\nAccording to Parker Pearson, however, many of the circles do not appear to be based on any astronomical alignment.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} Pearson cautioned that Late Neolithic/Bronze Age conceptions of cosmology were likely very different from modern understandings of astronomy.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} However, it has been found that the earliest standing stone monuments in the British Isles, the great circles such as Callanish on the Isle of Lewis and Stenness on the Isle of Orkney, were specifically constructed to align with the sun and moon, and the movements of the sun and moon across the local landscape.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.05.025|title = Origins of Standing Stone Astronomy in Britain: New quantitative techniques for the study of archaeoastronomy|journal = Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|volume = 9|pages = 249\u2013258|year = 2016|last1 = Higginbottom|first1 = Gail|last2 = Clay|first2 = Roger}}</ref>\n\n==Purposes==\n[[File:Rollrights King's Men.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The largest stone in the King's Men, a stone circle that is the dominant part of the [[Rollright Stones]] complex in the [[Cotswolds]].]]\n\nThere has been much analysis and debate about these monuments.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} No simple explanations have emerged.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} The original purposes of the stone ring monuments has been widely debated by antiquarians and archaeologists for several centuries.\n\nThese stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=97}} This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence. They may have been deliberately left as \"silent and empty monuments\".{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}} The archaeologists [[Mike Parker Pearson]] and Ramilsonina suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead and wood with the living.{{sfnm|1a1=Bradley|1y=2007|1p=126|2a1=Hutton|2y=2013|2pp=97\u201398}} Bradley noted that this interpretation was \"consistent with the archaeological evidence from Britain\",{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} where evidence for feasting and other human activities have been found at a range of timber sites but not at their stone counterparts. At the latter sites, there has been evidence of human remains.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} Bradley suggested that the stone circles may have been spaces \"devoted to the dead\".{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}}\n\n==Regional distribution==\nAubrey Burl's gazetteer lists 1,303 stone circles in Britain, Ireland and Brittany. The largest number of these are found in Scotland, with 508 sites recorded. There are 316 in England; 187 in Ireland; 156 in Northern Ireland; 81 in Wales; 49 in Brittany; and 6 in the Channel Isles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=395}}\n\n===South-west Britain===\n\nThere are 13 to be found on [[Dartmoor]], including [[Brisworthy stone circle]] and [[Scorhill]], and numerous examples to be found in Cornwall such as the [[The Merry Maidens]], [[The Hurlers ]] and [[Boscawen-Un]].\n\nIn contrast to the over 70 stone circles known from Dartmoor, there are only two known from [[Exmoor]]:{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=150}} [[Porlock Stone Circle]] and [[Withypool Stone Circle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=150|2a1=Riley|2a2=Wilson-North|2y=2001|2p=24|3a1=Gillings|3y=2015a|3p=1}} The contrast between the number of rings on the two moors may be because Dartmoor has abundant natural [[granite]] while Exmoor has none, instead having [[Devonian]] slates and [[Exmoor Group#Hangman Sandstone Formation|Hangman Grits]], both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=150}} The two Exmoor stones are made from smaller stones, which archaeologists have termed ''miniliths''. However, the presence of other Exmoor constructions, such as the [[clapper bridge]] at [[Tarr Steps]] and the three-metre Long Stone at [[Challacombe]], which do use locally sourced large megaliths, suggests that larger stones would have been available had the sites' builders desired, and that the use of miniliths was perhaps deliberate.{{sfn|Gillings|2015b|p=210}}\n\n===Wessex===\nWessex contains the two best known, though most atypical stone circles, [[Avebury]] and [[Stonehenge]].{{fact|date=January 2020}} All of the other Wiltshire circles are in a heavily ruined state and in some cases have been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} As noted by the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]], these examples have left behind \"only frustrating descriptions and vague positions\".{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} Most of the known Wiltshire examples were erected on low-lying positions in the landscape.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} \nIn northern Wiltshire, in the area to the south of [[Swindon]], at least seven stone circles are reported as having existed, often only a few miles distant from one another;{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} of these, the [[Day House Lane Stone Circle]] is the only example to survive.{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} The stones of the [[Fir Clump Stone Circle]] were for instance removed during construction of the [[M4 motorway]] in 1969.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=311|2a1=Burl|2y=2004|2p=205|3a1=Field|3a2=McOmish|3y=2017|3p=78}}\n\n[[File:Nine Stones, Dorset.jpg|thumb|left|The Nine Stones near Winterbourne Abbas, Dorset]]\n\nThe area of modern Dorset has a \"thin scatter\" of stone circles,{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=307}} with nine possible examples known within its boundaries: [[Hampton Down Stone Circle]], [[Kingston Russell Stone Circle]], [[Nine Stones, Winterbourne Abbas|Nine Stones]], and [[Rempstone Stone Circle]] remain visible.{{sfn|Gale|2003|p=72}} The archaeologist John Gale described these as \"a small but significant group\" of such monuments.{{sfn|Gale|2003|p=72}} All are located within five miles of the sea.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=308}} All but Rempstone\u2014which is on the [[Isle of Purbeck]]\u2014are located on the chalk hills west of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]].{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=138}} The Dorset circles have a simplistic typology, being of comparatively small size, with none exceeding 28 metres in diameter.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1a2=Piggott|1y=1939|1p=139|2a1=Burl|2y=2000|2p=308|3a1=Gale|3y=2003|3p=72}} All are oval in shape, although perhaps have been altered from their original form.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=308|2a1=Gale|2y=2003|2p=72}}\n\nWith the exception of the sandstone Rempstone circle, all consist of sarsen boulders.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=138}} Much of this may have been obtained from the \"Valley of Stones\", a location at the foot of Crow Hill near to [[Littlebredy]], which is located within the vicinity of many of these circles.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=308|2a1=Gale|2y=2003|2pp=182\u2013183}} With the exception of the circle at [[Litton Cheney]], none display evidence of any outlying stones or earthworks around the stone circle.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=139}} The archaeologists [[Stuart Piggott|Stuart]] and [[Margaret Guido|Cecily Piggott]] believed that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin,{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}} a view endorsed by Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} It is possible that they were not all constructed around the same date.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=141}} The Piggotts suggested that while they may well be Early Bronze Age in date, it is also possible that \"their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age\".{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}}\nTheir nearest analogies are the circles found on [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] to the west, and the [[Stanton Drew stone circles]] to the north.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=140}} It is also possible that the stone circles were linked to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}} On average Dorset's earthen henges are four times larger than the stone circles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=308}}\n\n===Northern England===\nIn what is now northern England, there was a particularly rich stone circle tradition in Cumbria. Several large megalithic rings were constructed here, such as [[Castlerigg stone circle]], [[Swinside]], and [[Long Meg and Her Daughters]].\n\n===Scotland===\n[[Image:Ring of Brodgar 3.jpg|thumb|The Ring of Brodgar, a Neolithic stone circle on [[Orkney]], Scotland.]]\nStone circles exist throughout Scotland, from [[Ninestane Rig]] in the far south to more famous examples in the far north and particularly in the islands (where several form part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]]). The [[Callanish Stones]] are one of the best-known examples in the [[Outer Hebrides]], while [[Orkney]] is known for its [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney|Neolithic monuments]], including the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and the [[Standing Stones of Stenness]].\n\n==Later history==\n\nIn some cases, the stones were removed from the rings for use as a building material.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}} In others, the site has been disrupted by natural causes such as trees, the roots of which have shifted the location of the megaliths.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}\n\n===Late Bronze and Iron Ages===\nEvidence for the destruction of stone circles first comes from the Late Bronze Age.\n\n===Medieval period===\n\nFollowing the Christianisation of Britain in the Early Medieval period, various Christian clergyman denounced those pagans who continued to venerate at stones in the landscape, which in some cases perhaps implied stone circles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=14}}\n\nBy the Late Mediaeval period, references to prehistoric monuments in the British Isles were rare, and were usually only to note down practical matters, such as that a judicial court would be held near to one or that a farmer's land lay near to one.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=15}}\nA rare exception is found in the fictionalised ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (c.1136), in which the chronicle's author [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] claimed that Stonehenge had once been the Giants' Ring, and that it had originally been located on [[Mount Killaraus]] in Ireland, until the wizard [[Merlin]] moved it to Salisbury Plain.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=15}}\n\n===Antiquarian and archaeological investigation===\n\nMany 19th century antiquarians produced plans of the circles which were \"inaccurate and slipshod.\"{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}\n\n==Folklore==\nIn the Mediaeval and Early Modern period onward, much folklore developed around the subject of the stone circles.\n\nIn Britain, several stone circles have been connected to the [[countless stones]] motif in folklore. The earliest recorded account comes from [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''The 7 Wonders of England'', written prior to 1586. Sidney linked the motif to Stonehenge.{{sfn|Menefee|1975|p=146}} Subsequently, the antiquary [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] mentioned the story in his book, ''The Survey of Cornwall'', published in 1602, noting that it was applied both the Stonehenge and to The Hurlers in Cornwall.{{sfn|Menefee|1975|pp=146, 155}}\nThe countless stones motif has been attributed to over five different stone circles, as well as several ruined long barrows such as [[Little Kit's Coty House]] in Kent.{{sfn|Grinsell|1976|p=63}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of stone circles]]\n*[[List of Stone Age art]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book |last=Barnatt |first=J. |year=1989 |title=Stone Circles of Britain |location=Oxford |publisher=British Archaeological Reports |ref=harv}}\n\n:{{cite book |last=Barrett |first=John C. |year=1994 |title=Fragments from Antiquity: An Archaeology of Social Life in Britain, 2900-1200 BC |location=Oxford, UK and Cambridge, USA |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-18954-1 |ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite book |title= Rings of Stone |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |authorlink=Aubrey Burl |year=1979 |publisher=Francis Lincoln |location=London |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite book |title=The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |url= https://archive.org/details/stonecirclesofbr0000burl |url-access= registration |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |authorlink=Aubrey Burl |year=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |isbn=978-0-300-08347-7 |ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite journal |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |author-link=Aubrey Burl |year=2004 |title=A.
