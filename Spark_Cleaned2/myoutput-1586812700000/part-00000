This poll queried whether the respondent knew of global warming. Those who had a basic concept of global warming didn\u2019t necessarily connect it to human activities, revealing that knowledge of global warming and the knowledge that it\u2019s human-induced are two separate things. Over a third of the world's population were unaware of global warming. [[Developing country|Developing countrie]]<nowiki/>s have less awareness than [[Developed country|developed]], and Africa the least aware. Of those aware, residents of [[Latin America]] and developed countries in Asia led the belief that climate change is a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] led in the opposite.

The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies. People in China, Russia, and the United States, while varying in awareness, have expressed a similar proportion of aware individuals concerned.
