Following his 1903 graduation, he specialized in [[microbiology]] and [[pathology]]. He organized and briefly directed the [[lazaretto|quarantine facility]] for [[cholera]]-stricken seafarers and immigrants on [[Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda Island]], and then performed his [[medical residency]] in a number of European hospitals before earning his degree of [[Doctor of Medicine]] and returning to Argentina, in 1910.  He then met a fellow [[Italian Argentine]], Clorinda Br\u00edgida Razori, and they married in 1914\u2014creating a lasting professional partnership, as well as marriage.<ref name=chagas/>\n\nThe onset of [[World War I]] returned Mazza to [[Europe]], where he was commissioned in 1916 by the [[Argentine Army]] to study the crisis of infectious disease in the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]s. There, he befriended a well-known [[Brazil]]ian epidemiologist, [[Carlos Chagas]], who in 1909 had discovered [[American trypanosomiasis]]. Mazza was named Laboratories Director of the Clinical Hospital and Dean of the [[Bacteriology]] Course at the UBA, in 1920. Traveling to [[France]] in 1923, he and his wife accepted noted bacteriologist [[Charles Nicolle]]'s invitation to the [[Pasteur Institute]]'s [[Algiers]] branch, where they studied Dr. Nicolle's methods in the treatment of [[typhus]] (Nicolle was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for his efforts). Returning to Argentina in 1925, Mazza was given a prominent post in the UBA Surgical Clinic and shortly afterwards invited Nicolle to Buenos Aires, where they discussed the need for more vigorous action against the contagious diseases affecting the country's poor.<ref name=chagas/>\n\n===Struggle against disease and indifference===\nThese discussions resulted in support from the school's Dean of Anatomy, Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Arce]], for the establishment of a medical mission in Argentina's underdeveloped north. The Regional Pathologies Study Mission (MEPRA) was established in then-feudal [[Jujuy Province]], in February 1926. Installed in a railway car, Mazza laboratory undertook studies on trypanosomiasis and [[leishmaniasis]], among other diseases. Publishing regular reports, the mobile lab traveled from village to village to not only inform the then-mostly illiterate population of the nature of their common diseases; but also to help control the known disease vector ''[[Triatoma infestans]]'', a true bug ([[Hemiptera]]) known locally as the ''winchuka''<ref>{{Ref Laime}}</ref> ''(vinchuca)''. The death of a symptomatic [[dog]] in 1926 ultimately led to Mazza's confirmation of the existence of the causal pathogen,''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', in Argentina, in 1927.<ref name=chagas/>\n\nMazza established Scientific Societies in seven northern provinces in 1926-27 to help coordinate his studies and diffuse information. He was assisted by, among others, Dr. Guillermo Paterson, an [[English Argentine]] epidemiologist known for his work on [[malaria]]. His efforts, however, encountered indifference and, then, resistance from the area's landed gentry, who generally saw squalor and contagious disease as an externality, and feared that Mazza's efforts might trigger a peasant revolt. His campaign to incinerate rural [[thatch]]ed roofs, a habitat for vinchucas, was particularly controversial. A fascist, 1930 [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the aging President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen]], moreover, led to the elimination of funding for the MEPRA the following year, after which Mazza maintained the facility with donations and his own funds. His efforts forced the South American medical community to accept the validity of trypanosomiasis (making it the special topic of the prestigious VI National Congress of Medicine, in 1939), and yielded the first detailed description of the dynamic between living conditions, trypanosomiasis, and its insect vector.<ref name=fac/>\n\nA letter in 1942 to the renowned Scottish scientist, Dr. [[Alexander Fleming]], led to his cooperation in the 1943 establishment of the first Argentine [[penicillin]] manufacturer - despite ongoing government refusal of support.  The struggling MEPRA had, by 1944, published 551 articles in peer-reviewed journals (including 482 by Mazza, himself).
