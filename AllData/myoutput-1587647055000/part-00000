Males and females at Mas\u0142om\u0119cz were found to be more closely related to each other than those at Kowalewko. They also carried fewer samples of U5b, and displayed fewer strong genetic links to the steppe populations than earlier Wielbark samples from Kowalewko. The results appeared to support the theory that the Goths originated in southern Scandinavia and expanded southwards through the Wielbark culture towards the [[Black Sea]], where they mixed with local populations and established the Chernyakhov culture.{{sfn|Stolarek|2019}}\n\nA genetic study published in ''Scientific Reports'' in 2019 examined the mtDNA of three Gothic females from the Chernyakhov culture.

The genetic makeup of these individuals differed significantly from that of previous populations of the area, being distinguished by showing a higher amount of ancestry from western and northern Europe.

In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths.

These Goths would form the  [[Visigoths]], and under their king [[Alaric I]] they began a long migration, eventually establishing a [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in Spain at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Meanwhile, Goths under Hunnic rule gained their independence in the 5th century, most importantly the [[Ostrogoths]].
