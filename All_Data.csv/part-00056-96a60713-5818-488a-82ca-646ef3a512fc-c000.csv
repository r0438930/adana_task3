'''Mary Ann Britland''' (''née'' '''Hague''', born 1847 – 9 August 1886) was an English [[serial killer]]. She was the first woman to be executed by hanging at [[Strangeways Prison]] in [[Manchester]] by [[James Berry (executioner)|James Berry]].

==Early life==
Mary Ann was born in 1847 in [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]], the second eldest daughter of Joseph and Hannah (née Lees) Hague.<ref>{{cite web|title=England and Wales Birth Registration Index|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:26Y7-HZH|website=FamilySearch|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=3 August 2015|page=Vol 21; P 86; Line 16}}</ref> She married Thomas Britland at St Michael's Church, [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] in 1866.<ref>{{cite web|title=England Marriages, 1538–1973|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NFF5-6V6|website=FamilySearch|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=3 August 2015|ref=reference 2:3M1BVBF; FHL microfilm 1,550,976}}</ref>  They lived in a rented house at 133 Turner Lane, Ashton-under-Lyne with their two daughters Elizabeth Hannah and Susannah.<ref> ''Census Returns of England and Wales, 1881''. Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK (TNA): Public Record Office (PRO), 1881.Class: RG11; Piece: 4038; Folio: 68; Page: 8; GSU roll: 1341965; ''133, Turner Lane, Ashton under Lyne, Lancashire, England; BRITLAND Thomas, Mary Ann, Elizabeth, Susannah''.</ref>  Britland held two jobs; she was a factory worker by day and barmaid by night.

==Criminal career==
In February 1886, Britland went to a nearby chemist's and, claiming to have had some mice infest her home, bought some packets of \"Harrison's Vermin Killer\". As this contained both [[strychnine]] and [[arsenic]], she was required to sign the poison register. 

Britland's first victim was her eldest daughter, 19-year-old Elizabeth Hannah, in March 1886. Elizabeth's death was attributed to natural causes by the doctor who was called to attend the teenager. Mary Ann Britland then claimed [[£]]10 on Elizabeth's [[life insurance]] policy. Her next victim was her husband, Thomas, aged 44. His death on 3 May was diagnosed as [[epilepsy]], and once again Mary Ann claimed on the insurance.<ref name=\"Capital Punishment UK\">{{cite web |title=Mary Ann Britland |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/Britland.html |website=Capital Punishment UK |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

Mary Ann had been having an affair with her neighbour, Thomas Dixon, and after her own husband's death was invited to stay at the Dixons' house just across the street at number 128 by Thomas's 29-year-old wife, Mary. On 14 May, Mary Dixon was to become Britland's third and final victim.

==Trial and sentencing==
The three deaths, all with their near identical and somewhat unusual symptoms, raised suspicion; Mary Ann Britland was finally interviewed by the police in connection with Mary Dixon's death and her body was examined by a pathologist. It was found to contain a lethal quantity of the two poisons and Britland was immediately arrested along with Thomas Dixon. She confessed to Ashton Police that she had wanted to marry Dixon and that she had first poisoned her daughter, Elizabeth, because she believed that she suspected her intentions. She then killed her husband, and finally Mary Dixon. 

Britland was charged with the murder of the three victims, but Thomas Dixon was found to have played no part in the murder of his wife. Britland came to trial on 22 July 1886, before Mr. Justice Cave at [[Manchester Assize Courts|Manchester Assizes]].<ref>Home Office: Calendar of Prisoners; HO 140 piece 89; [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C9004 National Archives]; ''Britland Mary Ann, 3 victims, 22 July 1866, Manchester, Lancashire</ref>  Since there was an absence of motive, in her defence she argued that the small sum of money from the insurance payouts were in no way compensation for the loss of her husband and daughter. According to an eyewitness<ref>What The Judge Saw by Edward Abbott Parry. Smith, Elder & Co., 15, Waterloo Place. 1912</ref> at the trial:

{{quote|''The case lasted two days...The evidence was overwhelming. The three deceased persons had been poisoned by strychnine. Mrs. Britland had purchased 'mouse powder' in sufficient quantities to kill them all, and there was no evidence of any mice on whom it could have been legitimately used. The case of the poisoning of Mrs. Dixon was the one actually tried, but the deaths of the others were proved to show 'system' and rebut the defence of accident. Even if there had not been sufficient evidence to secure a conviction, Mrs. Britland had many indiscreet conversations about 'mouse powder' and poisoning, and had been anxious to discover whether such poisoning could be traced after death''...}}

It took the jury some time to convict her, although eventually they found her guilty. After she was sentenced, she declared to the court: \"I am quite innocent, I am not guilty at all.\"<ref name=\"Capital Punishment UK\"/>

==Execution==
[[File:Strangeways Prison.jpg|thumb|Strangeways Prison]]
On the morning of 9 August 1886, Britland was in a state of collapse and had to be heavily assisted to the [[gallows]] by two female wardens.  Britland was screaming and asking for mercy.<ref name=\"Papers Past, Newspapers\">{{cite web |title=New Zealand Herald, 2 Oct 1886 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH18861002.2.40.25 |website=National Library of New Zealand, Papers Past, Newspapers |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>  The women who held her on the trapdoors while [[James Berry (executioner)|James Berry]] prepared her for execution. Two male wardens then took the place of the female wardens.  On signal from the executioner they quickly stepped back, the trap door released and Britland dropped.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=James|title=My Experiences as an Executioner|url=https://archive.org/stream/MyExperiencesAsAnExecutioner/Berry#page/n38/mode/1up|website=archive.org|publisher=London : P.

Mary Ann was born in 1847 in [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]], the second eldest daughter of Joseph and Hannah (née Lees) Hague.<ref>{{cite web|title=England and Wales Birth Registration Index|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:26Y7-HZH|website=FamilySearch|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=3 August 2015|page=Vol 21; P 86; Line 16}}</ref> She married Thomas Britland at St Michael's Church, [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] in 1866.<ref>{{cite web|title=England Marriages, 1538–1973|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NFF5-6V6|website=FamilySearch|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=3 August 2015|ref=reference 2:3M1BVBF; FHL microfilm 1,550,976}}</ref>  They lived in a rented house at 133 Turner Lane, Ashton-under-Lyne with their two daughters Elizabeth Hannah and Susannah.<ref> ''Census Returns of England and Wales, 1881''. Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK (TNA): Public Record Office (PRO), 1881.Class: RG11; Piece: 4038; Folio: 68; Page: 8; GSU roll: 1341965; ''133, Turner Lane, Ashton under Lyne, Lancashire, England; BRITLAND Thomas, Mary Ann, Elizabeth, Susannah''.</ref>  Britland held two jobs; she was a factory worker by day and barmaid by night.

==Criminal career==
In February 1886, Britland went to a nearby chemist's and, claiming to have had some mice infest her home, bought some packets of \"Harrison's Vermin Killer\". As this contained both [[strychnine]] and [[arsenic]], she was required to sign the poison register. 

Britland's first victim was her eldest daughter, 19-year-old Elizabeth Hannah, in March 1886. Elizabeth's death was attributed to natural causes by the doctor who was called to attend the teenager. Mary Ann Britland then claimed [[£]]10 on Elizabeth's [[life insurance]] policy. Her next victim was her husband, Thomas, aged 44. His death on 3 May was diagnosed as [[epilepsy]], and once again Mary Ann claimed on the insurance.<ref name=\"Capital Punishment UK\">{{cite web |title=Mary Ann Britland |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/Britland.html |website=Capital Punishment UK |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

Mary Ann had been having an affair with her neighbour, Thomas Dixon, and after her own husband's death was invited to stay at the Dixons' house just across the street at number 128 by Thomas's 29-year-old wife, Mary. On 14 May, Mary Dixon was to become Britland's third and final victim.

==Trial and sentencing==
The three deaths, all with their near identical and somewhat unusual symptoms, raised suspicion; Mary Ann Britland was finally interviewed by the police in connection with Mary Dixon's death and her body was examined by a pathologist. It was found to contain a lethal quantity of the two poisons and Britland was immediately arrested along with Thomas Dixon. She confessed to Ashton Police that she had wanted to marry Dixon and that she had first poisoned her daughter, Elizabeth, because she believed that she suspected her intentions. She then killed her husband, and finally Mary Dixon. 

Britland was charged with the murder of the three victims, but Thomas Dixon was found to have played no part in the murder of his wife. Britland came to trial on 22 July 1886, before Mr. Justice Cave at [[Manchester Assize Courts|Manchester Assizes]].<ref>Home Office: Calendar of Prisoners; HO 140 piece 89; [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C9004 National Archives]; ''Britland Mary Ann, 3 victims, 22 July 1866, Manchester, Lancashire</ref>  Since there was an absence of motive, in her defence she argued that the small sum of money from the insurance payouts were in no way compensation for the loss of her husband and daughter. According to an eyewitness<ref>What The Judge Saw by Edward Abbott Parry. Smith, Elder & Co., 15, Waterloo Place. 1912</ref> at the trial:

{{quote|''The case lasted two days...The evidence was overwhelming. The three deceased persons had been poisoned by strychnine. Mrs. Britland had purchased 'mouse powder' in sufficient quantities to kill them all, and there was no evidence of any mice on whom it could have been legitimately used. The case of the poisoning of Mrs. Dixon was the one actually tried, but the deaths of the others were proved to show 'system' and rebut the defence of accident. Even if there had not been sufficient evidence to secure a conviction, Mrs. Britland had many indiscreet conversations about 'mouse powder' and poisoning, and had been anxious to discover whether such poisoning could be traced after death''...}}

It took the jury some time to convict her, although eventually they found her guilty. After she was sentenced, she declared to the court: \"I am quite innocent, I am not guilty at all.\"<ref name=\"Capital Punishment UK\"/>

==Execution==
[[File:Strangeways Prison.jpg|thumb|Strangeways Prison]]
On the morning of 13 September 1886, Britland was in a state of collapse and had to be heavily assisted to the [[gallows]] by two female wardens.  Britland was screaming and asking for mercy.<ref name=\"Papers Past, Newspapers\">{{cite web |title=New Zealand Herald, 2 Oct 1886 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH18861002.2.40.25 |website=National Library of New Zealand, Papers Past, Newspapers |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>  The women who held her on the trapdoors while [[James Berry (executioner)|James Berry]] prepared her for execution. Two male wardens then took the place of the female wardens.  On signal from the executioner they quickly stepped back, the trap door released and Britland dropped.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=James|title=My Experiences as an Executioner|url=https://archive.org/stream/MyExperiencesAsAnExecutioner/Berry#page/n38/mode/1up|website=archive.org|publisher=London : P.

In the winter of 1965/66 the pub become predominantly known for a homosexual clientele, and in the later 20th century it became known for its [[drag queen]] cabaret,<ref>Senelick, L. The Changing Room: Sex, Drag, and Theatre, p 231</ref> and promoted itself as the \"Palladium of drag\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/7582/patrick-newley|title=Patrick Newley|publisher=The Stage|accessdate=2009-07-24 |date=28 April 2005|last=|first=}}</ref><ref>Sullivan, Evening Standard London

A notable regular performer at The Black Cap was Rex Jameson's drag persona, Mrs Shufflewick. A performance was recorded there in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/MrsShufflewick

The character Mrs Shufflewick was celebrated by artists such as Danny La Rue, [[Roy Hudd]], [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Barry Cryer]] and [[Barry Humphries]].<ref name=amazing/> 
Mrs Shufflewick appeared weekly for Sunday lunch during the 1970s. A Hammond organ played by Frankie Rae and drum kit played by David Thallon took pride of place on a tiny stage upon which Mrs Shufflewick performed two shows, usually with fellow-artiste Mark Fleming. Sunday crowds were large and included [[Charles Hawtrey (film actor)|Charles Hawtrey]], Barry Humphries and Barry Cryer.<ref name=amazing>''The Amazing Mrs Shufflewick: The Life Of Rex Jameson'', Patrick Newly</ref>

Jameson died in 1983 and in memorial, the upstairs bar was called The Shufflewick Bar. Jojo Martin said of Rex Jameson, \"Rex Jameson was a genius at his craft, I think the book written about him, ('The Amazing Mrs Shufflewick'), is a very apt title, he was amazing, looking at the photograph on the dust jacket, it is no wonder many thought Rex really was Mrs Shufflewick, rather than a female impersonation act, he should never be forgotten and should always be remembered with the other greats, such as Arthur Lucan ([[Old Mother Riley]]) and George Logan and Patrick Fyffe [[Hinge and Bracket]]\".

The Black Cap was a favourite haunt of the serial killer, Dennis Nilsen, who used it to pick up his vitims, and Anthony Hardy \"The Camden Ripper\" who frequented here, and who dumped the dismembered bodies of his victims behind the The College Arms pub (Crowndale Road - now demolished).

During the 1980s, artists such as [[Reg Bundy]] who began his Cabaret 'life' as part of the triple Act \"The Disappointer Sisters\", performed his alter ego Regina Fong on Tuesday nights, attracting a following of \"Fongettes\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1131884.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Reg Bundy | date=2003-05-14 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> Top drag acts such as Adrela and [[Lily Savage]] also appeared at The Cap during the eighties.

The pub in the 1986 film ''[[Withnail & I]]'' is the \"Mother Black Cap\" (which stood in Tavistock Crescent). Its name was possibly a combination of The Black Cap, and another Camden pub, The [[Mother Red Cap]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYS1iWXH5qcC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=%22mother+red+cap%22+withnail&source=bl&ots=ymC2R6J6Bd&sig=4SR-V-HEHXa6N7U1qA4p1cpxJGc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y41cUZ6LF6ab0wXrv4DADQ&sqi=2&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22mother%20red%20cap%22%20withnail&f=false |title=Withnail & I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know But Were Too Drunk to Ask |author=Thomas Hewitt-McManus |publisher=Lulu Press |page=34|date=2006-07-30 |accessdate=2013-04-03}}</ref>

'''''Marcy Playground''''' is the self-titled debut studio album by American [[alternative rock]] band [[Marcy Playground]], released on February 25, 1997, on [[EMI]]. It was reissued later that year on October 7 on [[Capitol Records]] with a large amount of promotion for the single \"[[Sex and Candy]],\" which became the band's breakthrough single, spending a then-record 15 weeks at No. 1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.

The album also includes the singles \"[[St. Joe on the Schoolbus]]\" and \"[[Sherry Fraser]]\" both of which received moderate radio and MTV2 airplay.

Since 2017, Wallace-Wells has written extensively about [[climate change]] in ''New York'' magazine. He has said that he is optimistic about the earth's environmental future, but he remains cautious.

He later turned the work into a full-length [[The Uninhabitable Earth (book)|book of the same name]], published in 2019.  Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the book ''[[The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History]]'' [[Elizabeth Kolbert]] said in a book blurb that David Wallace-Wells argues that the impacts of climate change will be much graver than most people realize and that he is right.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Uninhabitable-Earth-Life-After-Warming/dp/0525576703/ref=sr_1_3?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9fntBRCGARIsAGjFq5G-fYKjWH5HyTOLqew56RH04WG6ft0t3UJGHg90WPbR3iNP2Y8JNZwaAhdPEALw_wcB&hvadid=321818766437&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9026250&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=b&hvrand=5090281397823299868&hvtargid=kwd-720220913437&hydadcr=3237_10393162&keywords=wallace+wells+the+uninhabitable+earth&qid=1572818834&sr=8-3 |title=The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming: David Wallace-Wells: 9780525576709: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2020-01-17}}</ref>

David Wallace-Wells' work has appeared in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, where he is a deputy editor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/author/david-wallace-wells/|title=Most recent articles by David Wallace-Wells|website=New York Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/press/2019/05/on-the-cover-of-new-york-magazine-living-with-fire.html|title=On the Cover: What Climate Change Has in Store for Los Angeles|website=New York Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref> He also writes for ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/17/david-wallace-wells-uninhabitable-earth-review|title=The Uninhabitable Earth: A Story of the Future by David Wallace-Wells – review|last=Haskell|first=David George|date=2019-02-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> He is a National Fellow at New America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/david-wallace-wells/|title=David Wallace-Wells|website=New America|language=en|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref> In March 2019, he appeared on ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]'' podcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Rogan Experience #1259 - David Wallace-Wells |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoWXvMQ3xqg |accessdate=7 March 2019}}</ref> On July 17, 2019, Wallace-Wells appeared on an episode of ''The Doctor's Farmacy'', a video produced by the functional physician, [[Mark Hyman (doctor)|Mark Hyman M.D.]], who provides an indexed guide to topics covered, as well as, a review of the discussion.<ref>Hyman, Mark, [https://drhyman.com/blog/2019/07/17/ep-63/?mc_cid=e2b02f9c40&mc_eid=83bffe0724 Why Climate Change is Worse Than You Think], The Doctor's Farmacy, Episode 63, July 17, 2019</ref>

Since 2017, Wallace-Wells has written extensively about [[climate change]] in ''New York'' magazine. He has said that he is optimistic about the earth's environmental future, but he remains cautious. He has said that no matter the degree of environmental damage, \"it will always be the case that the next decade could contain more warming, and more suffering, or less warming and less suffering.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/book-excerpt-the-uninhabitable-earth-david-wallace-wells.html|title=The Cautious Case for Climate Optimism (From a Climate Alarmist)|last=Wallace-Wells|first=David|date=2019-02-04|website=Intelligencer|language=en|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref>

His best known work is \"[[The Uninhabitable Earth]]\", an article published July 9, 2017 in ''New York'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html|title=The Uninhabitable Earth|last=Wallace-Wells|first=David|date=July 10, 2017|website=New York Magazine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The essay received mixed to negative criticism from scientists,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-explain-what-new-york-magazine-article-on-the-uninhabitable-earth-gets-wrong-david-wallace-wells/|title=Scientists explain what New York Magazine article on \"The Uninhabitable Earth\" gets wrong|date=2017-07-12|website=Climate Feedback|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-07}}</ref> but was considered an important and impactful work by many reviewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/2/22/18188562/climate-change-david-wallace-wells-the-uninhabitable-earth|title=It is absolutely time to panic about climate change|last=Illing|first=Sean|date=Feb 24, 2019|website=Vox|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> 

He later turned the work into a full-length [[The Uninhabitable Earth (book)|book of the same name]], published in 2019.  Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the book ''[[The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History]]'' [[Elizabeth Kolbert]] said in a book blurb that David Wallace-Wells argues that the impacts of climate change will be much graver than most people realize and that he is right.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Uninhabitable-Earth-Life-After-Warming/dp/0525576703/ref=sr_1_3?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9fntBRCGARIsAGjFq5G-fYKjWH5HyTOLqew56RH04WG6ft0t3UJGHg90WPbR3iNP2Y8JNZwaAhdPEALw_wcB&hvadid=321818766437&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9026250&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=b&hvrand=5090281397823299868&hvtargid=kwd-720220913437&hydadcr=3237_10393162&keywords=wallace+wells+the+uninhabitable+earth&qid=1572818834&sr=8-3 |title=The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming: David Wallace-Wells: 9780525576709: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2020-01-17}}</ref>

He studied medicine from 1967 onwards in [[Tübingen]], [[Freiburg]], [[Berlin]], [[Paris]] and [[Munich]].  After completing his medical exams at Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, he became a medical assistant in 1968 at [[Munich University]], while also working as a scientific assistant (Wissenschaftlicher Assistant) at Munich's [[Max-Planck-Institut für Psychiatrie]], in the [[Neurophysiology]] Department under [[Otto Detlev Creutzfeldt]].  In 1971 he moved to [[University College London]], where he worked in the Department of [[Biophysics]] under [[Bernard Katz]].  In 1974, he completed his medical dissertation, under the title ''Elektrophysiologie der neuralen Helladaptation in der Katzenretina'' (''[[Electrophysiology]] of Neural Light Adaption in the Cat Retina'') in the Medical Faculty of Göttingen University.<ref name=\"nobio\"/>

Afterwards (still in 1974), Sakmann returned to the lab of Otto Creutzfeldt, who had meanwhile moved to the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]] in Göttingen.  Sakmann joined the membrane biology group in 1979.

On 2 June 2009, [[Peter Gruss]], the president of the Max Planck Society, announced that Sakmann would serve as the scientific director of the Max Planck Florida Institute, the organization's biomedical research facility at [[Florida Atlantic University]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]].

Sakmann is the founder of the Bert-Sakmann-Stiftung.

"→‎top:Robert Peel, thePrime Minister",safe,Jnestorius,"The '''Ordnance Memoir of Ireland''' was a projected 1830s [[topography]] of [[Ireland]] to be published by [[Civil parish (Ireland)|civil parish]] alongside the maps of the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] using materials gathered by surveyors as they traversed the country. The project was cancelled in 1840 as too expensive and beyond the survey's original scope. Material gathered before the cancellation mostly covers [[Ulster]]. Much was eventually published in the later twentieth century. The memoirs are a useful [[primary source]] for [[local history]] and [[genealogy]] of the period shortly before the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].

Materials gathered for the projected memoir included:
* 1824–1830 journals of the officers of the [[Royal Engineers]] in conformance to the \"blue book\" of instructions from [[Thomas Frederick Colby|Thomas Colby]] as head of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. None of these survive.
* 1830–1837 \"statistical remarks\" of parishes sent by the same officers to [[Thomas Larcom]] from his arrival in Dublin. These vary greatly in substance and reliability depending on the interests and abilities of the officer in charge of the particular parish. They are very extensive for counties [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Antrim|Antrim]], the first and slowest  to be surveyed.

The project was cancelled in 1840 as too expensive and beyond the survey's original scope. Material gathered before the cancellation mostly covers [[Ulster]]. Much was eventually published in the later twentieth century. The memoirs are a useful [[primary source]] for [[local history]] and [[genealogy]] of the period shortly before the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].

Materials gathered for the projected memoir included:
* 1824–1830 journals of the officers of the [[Royal Engineers]] in conformance to the \"blue book\" of instructions from [[Thomas Frederick Colby|Thomas Colby]] as head of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. None of these survive.
* 1830–1837 \"statistical remarks\" of parishes sent by the same officers to [[Thomas Larcom]] from his arrival in Dublin.

'''''Class of '55''''' is a 1986 [[album]] by [[rock and roll]] pioneers [[Johnny Cash]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Carl Perkins]].

While the album was in part a tribute to [[Elvis Presley]], it was mainly a commemoration of those young performing hopefuls, the four album participants, who — as had Presley — all began their careers with [[Sun Records]] in the 1950s. Recorded at [[Sam Phillips|Sam Phillips']] [[Sun Studio]]s and completed at American Sound Studios, the album was documented by Dick Clark Productions, which filmed it from start to finish; by The Commercial Appeal, the Mid-South's largest circulation newspaper; and by [[Nine-O-One Network Magazine]], the first edition of which was sold with the album in a telemarketing package.<ref>Dickerson, James L.(1996) “Goin’ Back to Memphis: A Century of Blues, Rock ‘n’ Roll, and Glorious Soul,” Schirmer/Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-02-864506-5}}</ref>

The final song of the session, \"Big Train (from Memphis)\", written by John Fogerty, includes the blended voices of [[John Fogerty]], [[The Judds]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[Sam Phillips]], and [[June Carter Cash]]. Fogerty told a reporter that he was thinking about the old Sun Records sound when he wrote the song.<ref>Dickerson, Jim (1986) \"The Sun Session: Together Again in Memphis,\" Nine-O-One Network Magazine</ref> The extended finale of the song features the singers singing lines from various Sun Records songs, including \"[[That's All Right Mama]]\", \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]],\" \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\", \"[[Folsom Prison Blues]]\" and others.

Producer [[Chips Moman]] encountered a major issue following the recording sessions, as Cash was still under contract to [[Columbia Records]] at the time and proper permissions had not been obtained. Faced with the possibility of having to remove Cash's voice from the recordings, Moman paid Columbia $100,000 for the rights to keep Cash on the record.<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2013, p.506</ref> At this time, the America/Smash label was affiliated with [[PolyGram]], which in turn also owned [[Mercury Records]] to which Cash would sign shortly after recording ''Class of '55''.

The recorded \"''Interviews from the Class of '55 Recording Sessions,''\" written and produced by Rose Clayton, earned the 1986 [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album]] for the four performers, plus for producer Chips Moman, [[Sam Phillips]] and [[Ricky Nelson]]. For Nelson, it was his last recording session and only [[Grammy Award]] of his career.

A music video from Perkins' \"Birth of Rock and Roll,\" starring Perkins, Lewis, and [[Ron Wood]] of [[The Rolling Stones]], promoted the \"Class Of '55.\"

Cash, Lewis and Perkins had previously collaborated in 1956 with the [[Million Dollar Quartet]] and in 1982 with [[The Survivors Live]].

[[Dick Clark]] hosted a TV special with footage of the studio sessions aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVkQyjTJAw8|title=Coming Home: A Rockin' Reunion (1989)|first=|last=RocknRollArchive1|date=20 May 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae''. ''C. ornatissimus'' is also known as Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head; one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout <ref name=\":0\" />.



The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />. 

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>. Juvenile ornate butterflyfish are solitary and can be found singly, living in the arms of branching corals, but form pairs during breeding <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\" />. 

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2). Awesome Fish Spotlight: The Ornate Butterflyfish: Reef Builders: The Reef and Saltwater Aquarium Blog. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other coral-eating (obligate corallivores) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells, therefore, butterflyfishes need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding, before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae''. ''C. ornatissimus'' is also known as Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head; one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout <ref name=\":0\" />.



The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />. 

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>. Juvenile ornate butterflyfish are solitary and can be found singly, living in the arms of branching corals, but form pairs during breeding <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\" />. 

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2). Awesome Fish Spotlight: The Ornate Butterflyfish: Reef Builders: The Reef and Saltwater Aquarium Blog. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other coral-eating (obligate corallivores) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of coral polyp <ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells, therefore, butterflyfishes need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding, before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.

'''Marijohn Wilkin''' (July 14, 1920 &ndash; October 28, 2006), née Melson, was an American songwriter, famous in [[country music]] for writing a number of hits. Wilkin won numerous awards over the years and was referred to as \"The Den Mother of Music Row,\" as chronicled in her 1978 biography ''Lord, Let Me Leave a Song'' (authored with Darryl E. Hicks). It was honored as “One of the 100 Most Important Books about Nashville’s Music Industry.”<ref name=Honor>{{cite web|last1=Wilkin|first1=Marijohn|title=Lord, Let Me Leave a Song|url=http://www.mybestyears.com/ShoppingCenterNEW/BooksInfo/INFOMarijohn.html|website=MyBestyears.com|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>

==Biography==
Wilkin was born in Kemp, Texas and raised in Sanger, Texas, north of Dallas. She became a teacher, and was widowed when her husband Bedford Russell was killed in World War II. She remarried in 1946, with one son; her 1950 marriage to Art Wilkin, Jr. was her third.

Her father, a baker, had been a fiddle player. From 1955 she toured with [[Red Foley]], and in 1956 her songs were recorded by [[Mitchell Torok]] and [[Wanda Jackson]]. In 1958, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and had major hits, written with [[John D. Loudermilk]], for [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]] (the number one country hit \"[[Waterloo (Stonewall Jackson song)|Waterloo]]\", which made the pop top ten) and [[Jimmy C. Newman]].

Wilkin also wrote \"[[The Long Black Veil]]\" for [[Lefty Frizzell]] (with [[Danny Dill]]), \"[[Cut Across Shorty]]\" for [[Eddie Cochran]] (with Wayne P. Walker), and \"[[I Just Don't Understand]]\" which became a pop hit for  [[Ann-Margret]] and was covered by [[The Beatles]]. Although she was primarily a country songwriter, her songs have been recorded by several pop and rock acts, including [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Mick Jagger]]. Wilkin also recorded occasionally for [[Columbia Records]] and [[Dot Records]] in the 1960s and at times worked as a background vocalist.  he is billed simply as Marijohn on a few of her recordings. On DOT records, she recorded under the name Romi Spain.

Marijohn Wilkin may be most famous for \"[[One Day at a Time (song)|One Day at a Time]]\", often considered the biggest gospel song of the 1970s. Wilkin wrote the song in 1973 with some assistance by her former protégé [[Kris Kristofferson]]. The song won a [[Dove Award]] from the [[Gospel Music Association]] in 1975 (see also: [[Dove Award for Song of the Year]]). The song was a top 20 country single for [[Marilyn Sellars]] in 1974 and hit No. 37 on [[Billboard's Hot 100]] pop chart. It also launched a career as a gospel recording artist for Wilkin, who released several albums on [[Word Records]].  A remake became a No. 1 country hit for [[Cristy Lane]] in 1980 and has since been recorded more than 200 times.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=95996&messages=3 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522071224/http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=95996&messages=3 |archive-date=2011-05-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Even though written as a personal worship song, it has also been recognized as \"One of the Top 50 Southern Gospel Songs.\" <ref name=CBN>{{cite book|last1=Terry|first1=Lindsay|title=Stories Behind 50 Southern Gospel Favorites|date=2005|publisher=Kregel Publications|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=9780825438851|pages=63–67|edition=First|url=http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/devotions/terry_one_day.aspx|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>

[[Johnny Duncan (country singer)|Johnny Duncan]] and [[Ed Bruce]] were among the many songwriters she helped get a foothold in the music business. Kris Kristofferson was in the army with one of her distant cousins, so he sent some of his work to her at Buckhorn, her publishing company. She became the first to publish his songs, notably \"[[For the Good Times (song)|For the good times]]\". In 1970, it became a massive pop and country hit for [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]. Wilkin is credited for the discovery of Kristofferson and being the first person to give him work as a legitimate songwriter.{{fact}}

Wilkin's son John \"Bucky\" Wilkin became the frontman of the 1960s [[surf rock]] group [[Ronny & the Daytonas]], whose 1964 debut single \"G.T.O.\" reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Pop Singles]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1964-09-12/hot-100|title=Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref>

In 1975, Marijohn was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|last1=NSAI Foundation|title=Marijohn Wilkin|url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/t-z/marijohn-wilkin.aspx|website=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame|publisher=NSAI Foundation|accessdate=26 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204202224/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/t-z/marijohn-wilkin.aspx|archivedate=4 December 2013}}</ref>

Wilkin formed 17th Avenue Music, a publishing company. It became profitable when its songs were recorded by [[LeAnn Rimes]]. In 2005, Wilkin was honored by the SOURCE organization as a pioneering Music Row businesswoman. This was her last notable public appearance. She died of [[heart disease]] in October 2006. Her last marriage was to the record producer Clarence Selman in 1967.

link toIreland,safe,Saintrain,"The '''Ordnance Memoir of Ireland''' was a projected 1830s [[topography]] of [[Ireland]] to be published by [[Civil parish (Ireland)|civil parish]] alongside the maps of the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] using materials gathered by surveyors as they traversed the country. The project was cancelled in 1840 as too expensive and beyond the survey's original scope. Material gathered before the cancellation mostly covers [[Ulster]]. Much was eventually published in the later twentieth century. The memoirs are a useful [[primary source]] for [[local history]] and [[genealogy]] of the period shortly before the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].

Materials gathered for the projected memoir included:
* 1824–1830 journals of the officers of the [[Royal Engineers]] in conformance to the \"blue book\" of instructions from [[Thomas Frederick Colby|Thomas Colby]] as head of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. None of these survive.
* 1830–1837 \"statistical remarks\" of parishes sent by the same officers to [[Thomas Larcom]] from his arrival in Dublin. These vary greatly in substance and reliability depending on the interests and abilities of the officer in charge of the particular parish. They are very extensive for counties [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Antrim|Antrim]], the first and slowest  to be surveyed. As the survey matured and progressed east and south through other [[Counties of Ireland|counties]], it picked up speed in completing its primary mapping work, leaving officers less spare time in which to gather material for the memoir .
* 1834–1840 memoir material gathered by the civilian \"hill sketchers\" sent to revise the original survey in the wake of the Royal Engineers. By 1837 the Engineers ceased collecting material, on the assumption that it would be collected when the area would be revisited by the hill sketchers.  
* Geological information gathered by [[Joseph Ellison Portlock]]; that relating to County Londonderry (and small adjacent areas) was published in 1843,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Portlock |first1=Joseph Ellison |title=Report on the Geology of the County of Londonderry, and of Parts of Tyrone and Fermanagh |date=1843 |publisher=A. Milliken |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qw68AAAAIAAJ |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> after which the [[Geological Survey of Ireland]] was separated from the Ordnance Survey
* Related to, but separate from, the memoir material are the \"Ordnance Survey Letters\" and  Name Books compiled by [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] and [[Eugene O'Curry]], of current and historical [[Irish place names|place names]] in English and especially [[Irish language|Irish]], and associated {{lang|ga|[[dindsenchas]]}} folklore and [[Irish annals|annalistic]] references.

Only one parish was published by the Ordnance Survey, namely Templemore, County Londonderry (comprising [[Derry]] city and the adjacent [[North West Liberties of Londonderry]]) in 1837.<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoir of the City and North Western Liberties of Londonderry — Parish of Templemore |date=1837 |publisher=Hodges |location=Dublin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcxcAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP9  |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>  This 350-page volume was a poorly edited agglomeration of material whose production cost of £1,700 was three times the original estimate for publishing the whole county.

[[Category:1840s disestablishments in Ireland]]","The '''Ordnance Memoir of Ireland''' was a projected 1830s [[topography]] of Ireland to be published by [[Civil parish (Ireland)|civil parish]] alongside the maps of the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] using materials gathered by surveyors as they traversed the country. The project was cancelled in 1840 as too expensive and beyond the survey's original scope. Material gathered before the cancellation mostly covers [[Ulster]]. Much was eventually published in the later twentieth century. The memoirs are a useful [[primary source]] for [[local history]] and [[genealogy]] of the period shortly before the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].

Materials gathered for the projected memoir included:
* 1824–1830 journals of the officers of the [[Royal Engineers]] in conformance to the \"blue book\" of instructions from [[Thomas Frederick Colby|Thomas Colby]] as head of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. None of these survive.
* 1830–1837 \"statistical remarks\" of parishes sent by the same officers to [[Thomas Larcom]] from his arrival in Dublin. These vary greatly in substance and reliability depending on the interests and abilities of the officer in charge of the particular parish. They are very extensive for counties [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Antrim|Antrim]], the first and slowest  to be surveyed. As the survey matured and progressed east and south through other [[Counties of Ireland|counties]], it picked up speed in completing its primary mapping work, leaving officers less spare time in which to gather material for the memoir .
* 1834–1840 memoir material gathered by the civilian \"hill sketchers\" sent to revise the original survey in the wake of the Royal Engineers. By 1837 the Engineers ceased collecting material, on the assumption that it would be collected when the area would be revisited by the hill sketchers.  
* Geological information gathered by [[Joseph Ellison Portlock]]; that relating to County Londonderry (and small adjacent areas) was published in 1843,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Portlock |first1=Joseph Ellison |title=Report on the Geology of the County of Londonderry, and of Parts of Tyrone and Fermanagh |date=1843 |publisher=A. Milliken |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qw68AAAAIAAJ |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> after which the [[Geological Survey of Ireland]] was separated from the Ordnance Survey
* Related to, but separate from, the memoir material are the \"Ordnance Survey Letters\" and  Name Books compiled by [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] and [[Eugene O'Curry]], of current and historical [[Irish place names|place names]] in English and especially [[Irish language|Irish]], and associated {{lang|ga|[[dindsenchas]]}} folklore and [[Irish annals|annalistic]] references.

Only one parish was published by the Ordnance Survey, namely Templemore, County Londonderry (comprising [[Derry]] city and the adjacent [[North West Liberties of Londonderry]]) in 1837.<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoir of the City and North Western Liberties of Londonderry — Parish of Templemore |date=1837 |publisher=Hodges |location=Dublin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcxcAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP9  |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>  This 350-page volume was a poorly edited agglomeration of material whose production cost of £1,700 was three times the original estimate for publishing the whole county.  ''[[A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland]]'', comprising two volumes plus atlas published in 1837 by [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]], was a similar work on a smaller scale, which undermined the case for a publicly funded memoir.

It is owned and operated by the Railway Restoration Project 113 Organization out of [[Minersville, Pennsylvania|Minersville, PA]].

== Original career ==
CNJ #113 was one of five B-7 type switchers built for the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]], numbers 111-115. These locomotives were designed to operate on the Anthracite Roads of Pennsylvania, so instead of having regular fireboxes, they had [[wootten firebox]]es which allowed them to burn [[anthracite coal]]. Since these locomotives were designed with a 0-6-0 wheel arrangement, their only effective use was to be operated as switchers since they did not ride smoothly and rarely got past 15 miles per hour. 113 along with her sisters operated in the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey|CNJ]]'s freight yards for almost three decades. In 1945, the railroad had changed their class to ''6S46'' (6-wheeled Switcher, 46,000 pounds tractive effort). By 1951, she along with her sister counterparts were placed out of service in favor of the new diesel locomotives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rrproject113.org/cnj-113|title=rrproject-113 {{!}} CNJ 113|website=rrproject-113|language=en|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>

== Change in Ownership ==
Around 1953, the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company (now the [[Reading Anthracite Company|Reading Anthracite Co.]]) had bought No. 113 and used her at a [[colliery]] in Locust Summit, outside of [[Ashland, Pennsylvania|Ashland, PA]] until she was last used in 1960. She became the last CNJ steam engine to be steamed up. No. 113 had also run a few fan trips with CNJ #774 in 1954, but 774 was soon scrapped. 113 was then stored outside at Locust Summit for many years and as a result, suffered a massive amount deterioration and even had some trees growing around her. The Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company eventually decided to donate her to the Historic Red Clay Valley Inc. located in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in 1980. In 1986, the locomotive was purchased by Robert E. Kimmel Sr. and she was later moved to Minersville where she operates out of today.

== Restoration ==
Work to restore the locomotive to operating condition began in 1999 and it took more than twenty years for it to fully be operational again. The total cost to restore the engine was more than $600,000 and had countless hours of volunteer labor. 113 was also restored with minimal protection from the elements and no heavy machinery. 
Many of the parts on the locomotive had long been missing before the restoration had even started. As a result, many of the parts had to be made from scratch since there had not been any commercial builders that produced parts for steam locomotives in decades. One example of this is how the volunteers had to make a wooden cast of the original three-chime whistle by measuring an original CNJ whistle which was available to them. The engine was finally fired up after more than five decades of inactivity in late fall of 2012. The Railway Restoration Project 113 Organization conducted a test-run on the same day with the engine also doing some more test-runs in 2013 and 2014.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rrproject113.org/restoration-photos|title=rrproject-113 {{!}} RESTORATION|website=rrproject-113|language=en|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>

== Present ==
After the test-runs for the engine in late 2012 and two/thirds of 2013, the locomotive began operating on some passenger excursions in late 2013 with [[Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad 425|Reading Blue Mountain & Northern Railroad 425]]. CNJ 113 continued to run more excursions by itself and with RBM&N 425 during the 2014 season. Every year since then the 113 has been hauling excursions across the RBM&NR's lines in cooperation with the railroad. For the excursions, the [[Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad|Reading Blue Mountain & Northern Railroad]] provides passenger cars and occasionally some helper locomotives to Railway Restoration Project 113 in order for the excursions to occur. She happens to be the only surviving CNJ steam locomotive that is still operational. There is only one other CNJ locomotive and that is CNJ No. 592, however she is not operational and currently resides at the [[B&O Railroad Museum|Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Museum]]. Currently, No. 113 operates out of Minersville, PA at the Minersville Train Depot hauling multiple excursions each year.

==Plot==
In the opening scene, Jack is trying to muster up the courage to kiss Dina, his sister Hayley's American roommate, before he leaves to return home to London. He had come to Rome to visit his sister Hayley for the weekend, and Dina had also come to visit Hayley. Before he can kiss Dina, Greg, Jack's dorm roommate from university, bumps into them. Realising that Jack is also headed towards the airport, Greg offers him a ride and Jack is unable to kiss Dina or even say a proper goodbye. Saying an awkward goodbye, both men leave with Jack upset.

Three years later, Jack is at his sister Hayley's wedding. Bryan, an aspiring actor and the maid of honor, is more concerned about being called the maid of honor, getting introduced to Italian film director Vitelli and not being seated next to Rebecca, rather than helping out the bride. He is late for the wedding ceremony because he decides to get a haircut to better prepare himself for his meeting with Vitelli. Hayley has chosen to not seat Bryan with Vitelli as she has seated all the English people on the English table, which also includes Amanda, Jack's \"nightmare of an ex-girlfriend\".

Amanda has come to the wedding with her boyfriend Chaz, with whom she has clear commitment issues (he proposed six months earlier and she has not responded yet). Other friends of Hayley's include clingy Rebecca and socially awkward Sidney. Rebecca, upon meeting Chaz, accidentally mistakes him for a cabaret act and mentions that Amanda called Chaz a \"dickhead\". Sidney has worn a kilt to the wedding, despite not being Scottish, and becomes easily uncomfortable in it.

As Jack and Hayley's parents are dead, Hayley has asked Jack to walk her down the aisle. Just as they are about to, Hayley tells Jack that Dina has come to the wedding and is single. After the wedding, Sidney and approaches Dina, which leads to an uncomfortable conversation between the two and ends with Sidney leaving to get some champgane for the both of them, despite Dina not wanting any. Meanwhile, Jack and Bryan are talking about how Bryan will create a good first impression on Vitelli, when Bryan learns that he has to make a maid-of-honor speech. Rebecca joins the conversation, and while she continues to compliment him, Jack sees Dina for the first time in three years. Both of them talk and they confess to one another that they used to ask Hayley about the other.

Marc, Hayley's school classmate, arrives at the wedding venue high on cocaine and plans to ruin the wedding. Hayley confronts Marc and asks him to leave. Their talk is interrupted by Roberto, Hayley's husband, and he ends up having Marc stay for the celebrations.

Hayley asks Jack to drug Marc with her sleeping drops, but some children mess around and rearrange the seating order.

==Plot==
In the opening scene, Jack is trying to muster up the courage to kiss Dina, his sister Hayley's American roommate, before he leaves to return home to London. He had come to Rome to visit his sister Hayley for the weekend, and Dina had also come to visit Hayley. Before he can kiss Dina, Greg, Jack's dorm roommate from university, bumps into them. Realising that Jack is also headed towards the airport, Greg offers him a ride and Jack is unable to kiss Dina or even say a proper goodbye. Saying an awkward goodbye, both men leave with Jack upset.

Three years later, Jack is at his sister Hayley's wedding. Bryan, an aspiring actor and the maid of honor, is more concerned about being called the maid of honor, getting introduced to Italian film director Vitelli and not being seated next to Rebecca, rather than helping out the bride. He is late for the wedding ceremony because he decides to get a haircut to better prepare himself for his meeting with Vitelli. Hayley has chosen to not seat Bryan with Vitelli as she has seated all the English people on the English table, which also includes Amanda, Jack's \"nightmare of an ex-girlfriend\".

Amanda has come to the wedding with her boyfriend Chaz, with whom she has clear commitment issues (he proposed six months earlier and she has not responded yet). Other friends of Hayley's include clingy Rebecca and socially awkward Sidney. Rebecca, upon meeting Chaz, accidentally mistakes him for a cabaret act and mentions that Amanda called Chaz a \"dickhead\". Sidney has worn a kilt to the wedding, despite not being Scottish, and becomes easily uncomfortable in it.

As Jack and Hayley's parents are dead, Hayley has asked Jack to walk her down the aisle. Just as they are about to, Hayley tells Jack that Dina has come to the wedding and is single. After the wedding, Sidney and approaches Dina, which leads to an uncomfortable conversation between the two and ends with Sidney leaving to get some champgane for the both of them, despite Dina not wanting any. Meanwhile, Jack and Bryan are talking about how Bryan will create a good first impression on Vitelli, when Bryan learns that he has to make a maid-of-honor speech. Rebecca joins the conversation, and while she continues to compliment him, Jack sees Dina for the first time in three years. Both of them talk and they confess to one another that they used to ask Hayley about the other.

Marc, Hayley's school classmate, arrives at the wedding venue high on cocaine and plans to ruin the wedding. Hayley confronts Marc and asks him to leave. Their talk is interrupted by Roberto, Hayley's husband, and he ends up having Marc stay for the celebrations.

Hayley asks Jack to drug Marc with her sleeping drops, but some children mess around and rearrange the seating order.

''Lo-Fantasy'' received generally favorable reviews but [[Music journalism|music critic]]s were mixed on the uses from the electronic genre throughout the album. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 71, based on 4 reviews.<ref name=\"Meta\"/>

[[AllMusic]] writer Matt Collar called it \"a melodic, psych-inflected album that showcases Roberts' knack for mixing gigantic, propulsive rock melodies and dance-oriented hooks\", saying that its \"at once organically rootsy and studio sophisticated, with songs that straddle the line between stadium shouters (\"We're All in This Together\") and midtempo club anthems (\"The Hands of Love\").\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Matthew Riddle from ''[[Exclaim!]]'' commended the mixture of Roberts' \"trademark arena-rock choruses and anthemic growls\" through various dance genre filters. He said of Roberts' detractors: \"those willing to get past their preconceived notions may be surprised to find that ''Lo-Fantasy'' is perhaps the most dynamic recording of Roberts' career.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim\"/> Joshua Kloke of ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' noted how the record utilizes a combination of the \"wandering vibe\" from ''[[Chemical City]]'' and the \"jazzy feel\" of ''[[Collider (Sam Roberts album)|Collider]]'', saying that it can be \"airy and middling\" at times. He concluded that \"Thankfully, though, Roberts is less concerned with sticking to a chunky, riff-driven formula than with experimenting with the many layers that he and his band are capable of producing.\"<ref name=\"NOW\"/> In a negative review for [[Slant Magazine]], Kyle Fowle found the electronic elements \"overbearing\", with each track containing \"stale production flourishes and gratuitous layers of reverb.\" He concluded that the record \"attempts to skate by on pure surface appeal in order to distract from the obtuse social commentary at its core.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/>

''Lo-Fantasy'' received generally favorable reviews but [[Music journalism|music critic]]s were mixed on the uses from the electronic genre throughout the album. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 71, based on 4 reviews.<ref name=\"Meta\"/>

[[AllMusic]] writer Matt Collar called it \"a melodic, psych-inflected album that showcases Roberts' knack for mixing gigantic, propulsive rock melodies and dance-oriented hooks\", saying that its \"at once organically rootsy and studio sophisticated, with songs that straddle the line between stadium shouters (\"We're All in This Together\") and midtempo club anthems (\"The Hands of Love\").\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Matthew Riddle from ''[[Exclaim!]]'' commended the mixture of Roberts' \"trademark arena-rock choruses and anthemic growls\" through various dance genre filters. He said of Roberts' detractors: \"those willing to get past their preconceived notions may be surprised to find that ''Lo-Fantasy'' is perhaps the most dynamic recording of Roberts' career.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim\"/> Joshua Kloke of ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' noted how the record utilizes a combination of the \"wandering vibe\" from ''[[Chemical City]]'' and the \"jazzy feel\" of ''[[Collider (Sam Roberts album)|Collider]]'', saying that it can be \"airy and middling\" at times. He concluded that \"Thankfully, though, Roberts is less concerned with sticking to a chunky, riff-driven formula than with experimenting with the many layers that he and his band are capable of producing.\"<ref name=\"NOW\"/> In a negative review for [[Slant Magazine]], Kyle Fowle found the electronic elements \"overbearing\", with each track containing \"stale production flourishes and gratuitous layers of reverb.\" He concluded that the record \"attempts to skate by on pure surface appeal in order to distract from the obtuse social commentary at its core.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/>

'''Chilu Lemba''' (born August 27, 1975) is a Zambian born and South African based radio and television presenter, voice over artist, author and musician. He is widely acknowledged in the communications industry as one of Africa's top Voiceover Artists having narrated numerous productions for radio, television and stadium events such as the African Cup of Nations opening ceremony, broadcast to millions of viewers around the world. His voice is heard across the continent daily on ads ranging from branding commercials for washing detergents and cellphone networks, to promos for satellite television channels. In June 2019, he released his memoir titled Finding My Voice.<ref>http://www.daily-mail.co.zm/chilu-lemba-releases-tota-manja/ Chilu Lemba releases Tota Manja – Zambia Daily Mail</ref><ref>https://www.lusakatimes.com/2015/06/30/chilu-lemba-releases-tota-manja/ Zambia : Chilu Lemba releases Tota Manja</ref>

== Music ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CD Front Cover.jpg|right|frame|Sound Legacy CD Cover|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 28 July 2009}}]] -->
During his teenage years, Lemba developed a passion for writing music. A recipient of the Chengelo Secondary School<ref>http://www.chengelo.sch.zm</ref> Music Award in 1992, he has been involved in numerous musical projects since. Lemba is famed for writing and recording Afro [[Hip hop]] hits \"Zambia Moto\" and \"Shibuka\", featuring Alan Mvula and [[Kora Award]] nominee - Joe Chibangu respectively as well as the song Njota featuring Hip hop artist Zubz and Zambian producer TK Siyandi. Lemba's debut solo CD, ''Sound Legacy'', which spurned a number of radio hits in his home country was released under Ten Twenty Seven Communications, a company he co-owns with his wife. Although ''Sound Legacy'' is Chilu's debut album, he previously  - as a member of The Man X Crew - released a cassette single titled \"Keep Moving\". It was recorded at the Lemba family farm in Lusaka in 1994. Copies were printed and sold mostly to friends and relatives. In many interviews since, he credits his musical sound to encouragement he received from [[Beats International]] and particularly, [[Norman Cook]] (a.k.a. [[Fatboy Slim]]) during a [[Rap music|Rap]] workshop that the group held on their African tour in the early nineties. They encouraged delegates to express [[African culture|African]] originality and be less American sounding.
In 2011, Chilu began recording his second album. In a 3-page article feature on him that appeared in the August 2011 issue of the South African Airways inflight magazine [[Sawubona]], Chilu stated that his second album was to be titled Flowers, Needles & Drumbeats. The album was released in June 2012.
Promotional material included the video for the Njota Remix which was nominated for Best Foreign Video at the Born n Bred Music Awards 2014, losing out to Zone Fam's Translate.

== Television, Voice Overs and Radio ==
Chilu was until early in 2006 a freelance presenter on [[94.7 Highveld Stereo]]. Recently, his voice has been heard on many television and radio spots across Africa on the ''Coca Cola Popstars'' television series, where he was the voice narrator for three seasons. His voice also featured on inserts in FIFA's live broadcast of the 2010 Fifa World Cup round robbin draw seen across the world in 2008 as well as the narration for the animated introductory \"Zakumi\" video, chronicling the rise of Zakumi - the 2010 Fifa World Cup South Africa mascot. He has also been the voiceover artist whose voice is heard at a number of widely broadcast events including The Kora All Africa Music Awards and the Confederation of African Footballs' 2013 Orange Africa Cup of Nations opening ceremony held in South Africa.

He was the co-anchor of the lifestyle magazine television show ''Africa Within'', which he hosted alongside Claire Mawisa during seasons 5 and 6 and with Sandy Ngema in Season 4. It was broadcast on [[SABC Africa]] on the [[DSTV]] Satellite Bouquet. Currently, re-runs of the show are aired on [[SABC 2]]. In 2007 he presented a weekly television show called [[Sports Stake]] featuring various South African sporting personalities as guests.

== The Annual Lusaka Radio Summit ==
In 2009, Chilu founded an annual radio conference at which media practitioners share their experiences. The inaugural Lusaka Radio Summit took place in October at The Martin Luther King Center also known as the American Center in Lusaka, Zambia. Speakers included popular South African media personality Phat Joe, [[Kaya FM]] South Africa's Production Manager Maekanya \"Mak\" Morotoba, Rhythm 100 Internet Radio owner Kaunda Chama, Zambian radio personality Emanuel Nyoni Jr. aka Fresh, Chanda Mfula of the [[Media Institute of Southern Africa]] Zambia Chapter and Chilu. About thirty delegates attended. The 2010 event had double the number of delegates with just under 60. It was held at [[Alliance Francaise]] in Lusaka's Longacres neighborhood. Speakers included South African media personality Claire Mawisa, renowned speaker and strategist Musa Kalenga, music programming specialist Xylon van Eyck, Digital Media consultant Simunza Muyangana of Digital Ice as well as Maekanya and Chilu from the previous years line up. The third Lusaka Radio Summit was held at the Protea Hotel Arcades Lusaka on 28 October 2011. Mobile network company [[MTN Group|MTN]] Zambia took on the sponsorship and the event adopted the company's brand name, becoming The MTN Lusaka Radio Summit.

The Lusaka Radio Summit is organised by Ten 27 Communications.

== Private life ==
He is married to Carol. They have two daughters; [[Talitha (given name)|Talitha]] Lutanda Lemba born in March 2006 and Liseli Lemba born in June 2008. He is a cousin of Zambian born author, [[Joseph Kalimbwe]] with whom he shares a grandfather.

'''Bettringen''' is a ''[[Stadtteil]]'' of [[Schwäbisch Gmünd]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. With around 10,000 inhabitants, it is the biggest borough of Schwäbisch Gmünd.

== Geography ==

The ''Strümpfelbach'' divides Bettringen into an upper part (''Oberbettringen'') and a lower part (''Unterbettringen''). Oberbettringen lies mainly on the North side of the river, while Unterbettringen is placed on the South side. The ''Strümpfelbach'' flows into the [[Rems (river)|Rems]]. Adjacent boroughs of Schwäbisch Gmünd are Weiler in den Bergen, Hussenhofen, Schwäbisch Gmünd proper and Bargau. Bettringen also borders on the municipality [[Waldstetten]].

Bettringen lies 50&nbsp;km east of Stuttgart and on the foot of the [[Swabian Alps]].

== History ==

Bettringen was first mentioned in 1218 in the ''red book of the cloister Lorch''. In the 15th century there was the first mention of Oberbettringen and Unterbettringen.

The ''Bettringen Lords'' (''Herren von Bettringen'') are mentioned in a few certifications in the 13th and 14th century.

Since 1870 ''Unterbettringen'' was part of Oberbettringen. In 1934 the municipality was renamed to Bettringen.

In 1934 the city council of Oberbettringen decided to change its name into '''Bettringen'''.

Since April 1, 1959 Bettringen is part of Schwäbisch Gmünd.

== Politics ==

The ''[[Mayor|Ortsvorsteherin]]'' (representative) of Bettringen is Brigitte Weiß ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]). The local council has 16 seats: 8 CDU, 4 [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], 3 [[Alliance '90/The Greens]], 1 [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Four members of the local council are also member of the city council of [[Schwäbisch Gmünd]].

Also some of the members of the city youth council are from Bettringen or the schools of Bettringen (including the School of Education).

== Religion ==
[[File:St Cyriakus Kirche.jpg|thumb|St. Cyriakus]]
For a long time Bettringen was mainly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Since the migrations after World War II also Protestant people came to Bettringen. Today over 5000 catholic people live in Bettringen in the St. Cyriakus parish. There are three Catholic churches and a chapel:

'''Bettringen''' is a ''[[Stadtteil]]'' of [[Schwäbisch Gmünd]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. With around 10,000 inhabitants, it is the biggest borough of Schwäbisch Gmünd.

== Geography ==

The ''Strümpfelbach'' divides Bettringen into an upper part (''Oberbettringen'') and a lower part (''Unterbettringen''). Oberbettringen lies mainly on the North side of the river, while Unterbettringen is placed on the South side. The ''Strümpfelbach'' flows into the [[Rems (river)|Rems]]. Adjacent boroughs of Schwäbisch Gmünd are Weiler in den Bergen, Hussenhofen, Schwäbisch Gmünd proper and Bargau. Bettringen also borders on the municipality [[Waldstetten]].

Bettringen lies 50&nbsp;km east of Stuttgart and on the foot of the [[Swabian Alps]].

== History ==

Bettringen was first mentioned in 1218 in the ''red book of the cloister Lorch''. In the 15th century there was the first mention of Oberbettringen and Unterbettringen.

The ''Bettringen Lords'' (''Herren von Bettringen'') are mentioned in a few certifications in the 13th and 14th century.

Since 1870 ''Unterbettringen'' was part of Oberbettringen. In 1934 the municipality was renamed to Bettringen.

In 1934 the city council of Oberbettringen decided to change its name into '''Bettringen'''.

Since April 1, 1959 Bettringen is part of Schwäbisch Gmünd.

== Politics ==

The ''[[Mayor|Ortsvorsteherin]]'' (representative) of Bettringen is Brigitte Weiß ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]). The local council has 16 seats: 8 CDU, 4 [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], 3 [[Alliance '90/The Greens]], 1 [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Four members of the local council are also member of the city council of [[Schwäbisch Gmünd]].

Also some of the members of the city youth council are from Bettringen or the schools of Bettringen (including the School of Education).

== Religion ==
[[File:St Cyriakus Kirche.jpg|thumb|St. Cyriakus]]
For a long time Bettringen was mainly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Since the migrations after World War II also Protestant people came to Bettringen. Today over 5000 catholic people live in Bettringen in the St. Cyriakus parish. There are three Catholic churches and a chapel:

* ''[[Cyriacus|St. Cyriakus church]]'', main church
* ''St. Ottilia church'', oldest church
* ''Auferstehung-Christi-Church'' (Resurrection of Christ church)
* ''Felix chapel''

Catholic services are held at least once a day from Tuesday to Sunday. All catholic churches have their own pipe organ. A highlight of the ecumene is the annual ecumene service, which is every Pentecost in one of the both parishes.

'''Magic Mountain''' was a theme park in [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], a beachside suburb of [[Adelaide]], South Australia. It opened in December 1982 and closed on 18 July 2004.

Magic Mountain was popular among the young and \"young at heart\", but had also been criticised for its design, which was likened to a \"giant dog dropping\".<ref name=\"farewell\">[http://www.news.com.au/mercury/story/0,22884,20390694-421,00.html Farewell Magic Mountain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714020406/http://www.news.com.au/mercury/story/0%2C22884%2C20390694-421%2C00.html |date=14 July 2009 }}, ''891 ABC Adelaide'', 18 July 2004</ref> It was [[demolished]] amid controversy late in 2004 as part of the final stage of the Holdfast Shores development and replaced by [[The Beachouse]] in 2006.

==Operation==
Magic Mountain was popular more with locals than [[tourists]], and especially with younger people.

The main attraction of Magic Mountain was its four [[water slide]]s, particularly during the hot Adelaide summers.
(These were accessible on Level 2 of the facility. They were also the largest water slide setup in the southern hemisphere at the time.)

==Currency==

To reduce the risk of stolen money from customers (many children), Magic Mountain took a page from Disney's book and made their own tokens for all of the attractions in the buildings. No matter which machine, One Token equalled One Game.

([[Dazzeland]] and [[Downtown (disambiguation)#Places|Downtown]] also made their own tokens.)

Each token was similar to Australian $1 coins, one side showing the Magic Mountain logo, surrounded by both ''\"NO CASH VALUE\"'' above and the year of use below. The other side either had a sponsor's logo (e.g.: [[Coca-Cola]]) or ''\"NO CASH VALUE\"'' in big font around a logo shaped like [[South Australia]] labelled ''\"SA\"''.

==Closure and demolition==
Demolition of Magic Mountain was part of the second stage of the Holdfast Shores development, and was required in order to maintain the stipulated amount of open space. The plan, signed in 1997, included a profit-sharing agreement between the [[Government of South Australia|state government]] and the Holdfast Shores consortium, and a separate agreement concerning public infrastructure with the local government (the [[City of Holdfast Bay]]).

Stage 1 saw the construction of the marina, the Marina Pier and two apartment blocks. The second stage was construction of the Pier Hotel. Agreements changed before Stage 2 began. The state government withdrew from the now-considered risky hotel development and sold the land to the consortium. The plan also changed, with the separation of the hotel from the Platinum Apartments – the new plan became known as Stage 2B.

Meanwhile, a public-opinion survey in the lead-up to the May 2003 local government elections caused the council to rethink its support of the new plan. Their new-found opposition to the proposed beachfront high-rise apartments focused on Magic Mountain as the one parcel of land within the project that was under their control.<ref name=\"cracks\">[http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/archives/2004_02/issuesandopinion_story1.shtml Cracks in the plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823010151/http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/archives/2004_02/issuesandopinion_story1.shtml |date=23 August 2006 }}, ''The Adelaide Review'', February 2004</ref>

The Beachouse also features a function room located on level 3, The Function at the Beachouse, which is hired for various events including weddings, birthdays, social events, corporate events and conferences.

in order to find employment with the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]]. In February 1676 he came to Moscow, but military officials turned him down. The [[Posolsky Prikaz]] listed him as a visiting foreigner. Le Fort settled in the so-called [[Nemetskaya sloboda]] in Moscow, where he would gain respect among other distinguished foreigners. In July 1678 he once again applied for service in the [[tsarist]] army. Accepted with the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|captain]], Le Fort then went to one of the fronts during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1676–1681)|Russo-Turkish War of 1676-1681]]. In early 1679 he was ordered to join the [[Kiev]] garrison under the command of [[Prince]] [[House of Golitsyn|Vasily Golitsyn]] and [[General]] [[Patrick Gordon]]. Upon his return to Moscow from a short trip to Geneva in 1683, Le Fort carried out various [[diplomat]]ic assignments until the fall of 1685.

Le Fort's house gradually turned into a main attraction of the Nemetskaya sloboda, attended not only by locals, but by Russian noblemen, such as the [[Golitsyn family | Golitsyns]]. It appears that Le Fort utilized his connections with the latter and received rapid promotion.{{cn|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Franz Lefort.jpg|thumb|left|250px|François Le Fort]]
In 1687 and 1689 he took part in two unsuccessful [[Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689|Crimean campaigns]]. Peter the Great became a frequent guest in Le Fort's house from 1690. Le Fort was one of the principal organizers and participators in [[Toy army of Peter I|Peter's military games]], which would pave the way for his career advancement. In 1690 Le Fort was promoted to the rank of [[major general]]. He then became [[lieutenant general]] (1691) and [[general]] (1693). In 1692 [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] funded the construction of a large reception hall for 1,500 people, which formed an extension to Le Fort's house. This hall hosted administrative meetings and Peter's parties.

In 1691 Le Fort was put in charge of a [[regiment]] and assigned a training ground on the left bank of the [[Yauza River]]. Peter ordered the construction of a [[sloboda]] for this purpose, which would later be called Lefortovskaya sloboda (the Lefort quarter, present-day [[Lefortovo District|Lefortovo]] in Moscow's [[South-Eastern Administrative Okrug]]). In 1693-1694 Lefort accompanied Peter on his trip to [[Arkhangelsk]]. In 1694 he participated in Peter's \"play\" {{ill|Kozhukhov campaign|ru|Кожуховский поход}} (a military game in the village of Kozhukhovo, between Moscow and [[Kolomenskoye]]).

During the [[Azov campaigns (1695–96) | Azov campaigns]] of 1695-1696 Le Fort was in charge of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. His return from the war was marked with a solemn parade through Moscow to his \"native\" Nemetskaya sloboda and subsequent festivities. Lefort was awarded a title of [[governor]] (''наместник'', or [[namestnik]]) of [[Novgorod]] and [[estate (land)|estates]] in two [[uyezd]]s.

In 1696 Le Fort together with [[Fyodor Alexeyevich Golovin|Fedor Golovin]] and {{ill|Prokopy Voznitsyn|ru|Возницын, Прокофий Богданович}} took official charge of Peter's [[Grand Embassy]], a Russian [[diplomatic mission]] to [[Western Europe]]. Upon his return to Moscow in 1698 he took part in the trial of the [[Streltsy Uprising | Streltsy rebels]]. That same year he moved to a custom-built palace, later known as the {{ill|Lefortovsky Palace|ru|Лефортовский дворец}}, on the Yauza River. The palace would soon become a center of Russian political and royal life in 1698-1699. Peter the Great used to hold all his important meetings and numerous celebrations in Le Fort's palace. 

François Le Fort died in [[Moscow]] in early March 1699. Upon hearing the news of his death, Tsar Peter lamented \"Now I am alone without one trusty man. He alone was faithful to me. Whom can I confide in now?\" On March 21 Peter held Lefort's state funeral, a ceremony second only to the funerals of Tsars or Patriarchs.<ref>

in order to find employment with the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]]. In February 1676 he came to Moscow, but military officials turned him down. The [[Posolsky Prikaz]] listed him as a visiting foreigner. Le Fort settled in the so-called [[Nemetskaya sloboda]] in Moscow, where he would gain respect among other distinguished foreigners. In July 1678 he once again applied for service in the [[tsarist]] army. Accepted with the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|captain]], Le Fort then went to one of the fronts during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1676–1681)|Russo-Turkish War of 1676-1681]]. In early 1679 he was ordered to join the [[Kiev]] garrison under the command of [[Prince]] [[House of Golitsyn|Vasily Golitsyn]] and [[General]] [[Patrick Gordon]]. Upon his return to Moscow from a short trip to Geneva in 1683, Le Fort carried out various [[diplomat]]ic assignments until the fall of 1685.

Le Fort's house gradually turned into a main attraction of the Nemetskaya sloboda, attended not only by locals, but by Russian noblemen, such as the [[Golitsyn family | Golitsyns]]. It appears that Le Fort utilized his connections with the latter and received rapid promotion.{{cn|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Franz Lefort.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Franz Lefort]]
In 1687 and 1689 he took part in two unsuccessful [[Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689|Crimean campaigns]]. Peter the Great became a frequent guest in Le Fort's house from 1690. Le Fort was one of the principal organizers and participators in [[Toy army of Peter I|Peter's military games]], which would pave the way for his career advancement. In 1690 Le Fort was promoted to the rank of [[major general]]. He then became [[lieutenant general]] (1691) and [[general]] (1693). In 1692 [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] funded the construction of a large reception hall for 1,500 people, which formed an extension to Le Fort's house. This hall hosted administrative meetings and Peter's parties.

In 1691 Le Fort was put in charge of a [[regiment]] and assigned a training ground on the left bank of the [[Yauza River]]. Peter ordered the construction of a [[sloboda]] for this purpose, which would later be called Lefortovskaya sloboda (the Lefort quarter, present-day [[Lefortovo District|Lefortovo]] in Moscow's [[South-Eastern Administrative Okrug]]). In 1693-1694 Lefort accompanied Peter on his trip to [[Arkhangelsk]]. In 1694 he participated in Peter's \"play\" {{ill|Kozhukhov campaign|ru|Кожуховский поход}} (a military game in the village of Kozhukhovo, between Moscow and [[Kolomenskoye]]).

During the [[Azov campaigns (1695–96) | Azov campaigns]] of 1695-1696 Le Fort was in charge of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. His return from the war was marked with a solemn parade through Moscow to his \"native\" Nemetskaya sloboda and subsequent festivities. Lefort was awarded a title of [[governor]] (''наместник'', or [[namestnik]]) of [[Novgorod]] and [[estate (land)|estates]] in two [[uyezd]]s.

In 1696 Le Fort together with [[Fyodor Alexeyevich Golovin|Fedor Golovin]] and {{ill|Prokopy Voznitsyn|ru|Возницын, Прокофий Богданович}} took official charge of Peter's [[Grand Embassy]], a Russian [[diplomatic mission]] to [[Western Europe]].

'''Computer Science & Engineering''' ('''CSE''') is an academic program at some [[University|universities]] that integrates the fields of [[computer engineering]] and [[computer science]], providing knowledge of computing systems in both [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]] design. The study program is modeled on German [[technical universities]], where [[Computer science|CS]], [[Computer engineering|CE]] and [[Information technology|IT]] are treated as respectively the theoretical, technical and practical part of one field called \"''Informatik''\".

Courses include [[computer architecture]], [[processor design]], [[operating systems]], [[computer networks]], [[parallel computing|parallel processing]], [[embedded systems]], [[Network_analysis_(electrical_circuits)|circuit analysis]], [[analog electronics|analog]] and [[digital electronics]], [[computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]], [[cloud computing|cloud]], [[web_development|web]] and [[mobile computing]], [[software engineering]], [[database|database systems]], [[digital signal processing]], [[virtualization]], [[computer simulation|computer simulations]] and [[game programming|games]] programming.

typo,safe,Grimes2,"[[Image:Stravinsky Mass.jpg|thumb|Original cover to the vocal score of the mass, published by [[Boosey & Hawkes]]]]
[[Igor Stravinsky]] composed his '''Mass''' between 1944 and 1948. This 19-minute setting of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (music)|Mass]] exhibits the austere, [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassic]], anti-[[Romantic (music)|Romantic]] aesthetic that characterizes his work from about 1923 to 1951. The Mass also represents one of only a handful of extant pieces by Stravinsky that was not commissioned. As such, part of the motivation behind its composition has been cited by [[Robert Craft]] and others as the product of a spiritual necessity.

==History==

{{quotation|My Mass was partly provoked by some Masses of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] that I found at a secondhand store in Los Angeles in 1942 or 1943. As I played through these rococo-operatic sweets-of-sin, I knew I had to write a Mass of my own, but a real one.|Igor Stravinsky to Robert Craft<ref name=\"white\">Eric Walter White, ''Stravinsky: The Composer and his Works''. London and Boston: Faber and Faber, 1979: p. 407.</ref> }}

Stravinsky completed the Gloria on December 20, 1944 and finished the Kyrie at about the same time. His work on the Mass was then interrupted for several years in which his wrote his [[Symphony in Three Movements]], ''[[Ebony Concerto (Stravinsky)|Ebony Concerto]]'', [[Concerto in D (Stravinsky)|Concerto in D]], and the ballet ''[[Orpheus (ballet)|Orpheus]]''. He resumed work on it in the fall of 1947 and completed it March 15, 1948.

On February 26, 1947, [[Irving Fine]] conducted the Kyrie and Gloria, accompanied by two pianos. The first complete performance occurred on October 27, 1948 in Milan. [[Ernest Ansermet]] conducted members of the chorus and orchestra of La Scala.

==Orchestration==

The work is scored for mixed [[choir|chorus]] and an ensemble of wind instruments comprising two [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], two [[bassoon]]s, two [[trumpet]]s, and three [[trombone]]s. There is also some minor solo material (often sung by members of the choir) in the second and fourth (Gloria and Sanctus) [[movement (music)|movements]]. Stravinsky specifies in the score that \"children's voices should be employed\" for both the [[soprano]] and [[alto]] parts, but, as with Stravinsky's ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'', concert performances of the Mass usually employ adult singers.

==Structure==
[[File:Polyvalency in Stravinsky's Mass.png|thumb|right|350px|Polyvalency in Stravinsky's ''Mass'' {{audio|Polyvalency in Stravinsky.mid|Play}}.<ref name=\"Leeuw\"/>]]

Like his 1955 work ''[[Canticum Sacrum]]'', the Mass forms a symmetrical plan on a large scale. The outer movements (the Kyrie and the Agnus Dei) contain homophonic choral statements with instrumental interludes, and share a tonal vocabulary including [[octatonic]], [[diatonic]], and [[Musical mode|modal]] [[scale (music)|scales]]. By contrast, movements 2 and 4 (the Gloria and the Sanctus) feature florid solo lines which alternate with the choral statements, and the harmony is more recognizably and consistently diatonic.<ref name=\"lundergan\">Edward Lundergan. \"Modal Symmetry and Textural Symbolism in the Credo of the Stravinsky Mass. ''Choral Journal'' 45, no. 8 (March 2006): 9.</ref>
The central movement, the Credo, is the longest. It features static, syllabic, and declamatory text-setting with a limited harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary. Long stretches of text often repeat a single chord, evoking the [[reciting tone]] of [[Gregorian chant]] or the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] liturgical [[chant]] that Stravinsky would have known from his childhood in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Clear setting of the text is favored over an expressive interpretation of its meaning.<ref name=\"lundergan\"/> The music features examples of [[polyvalence (music)|polyvalency]].<ref name=\"Leeuw\">Leeuw, Ton de (2005). ''Music of the Twentieth Century'', p.88. {{ISBN|90-5356-765-8}}.</ref>

==Faith==

Stravinsky chose to compose this Roman Catholic Mass despite his own Orthodox faith. He stated that this was because:
:“I wanted my Mass to be used liturgically, an outright impossibility as far as the Russian Church was concerned, as Orthodox tradition proscribes musical instruments in its services- and as I can endure unaccompanied singing in only the most harmonically primitive music.”<ref name=\"steinberg\">[[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]]. \"Igor Stravinsky: Mass.\" ''Choral Masterworks: A Listener's Guide.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005, 272.</ref>

Stravinsky also said of the Credo:
:“One composes a march to facilitate marching men, so with my Credo I hope to provide an aid to the text. The Credo is the longest movement. There is much to believe.”<ref name=\"steinberg\"/>

[[Category:Compositions by Igor Stravinsky]]

[[Category:1948 compositions]]","[[Image:Stravinsky Mass.jpg|thumb|Original cover to the vocal score of the mass, published by [[Boosey & Hawkes]]]]
[[Igor Stravinsky]] composed his '''Mass''' between 1944 and 1948. This 19-minute setting of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (music)|Mass]] exhibits the austere, [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassic]], anti-[[Romantic (music)|Romantic]] aesthetic that characterizes his work from about 1923 to 1951. The Mass also represents one of only a handful of extant pieces by Stravinsky that was not commissioned. As such, part of the motivation behind its composition has been cited by [[Robert Craft]] and others as the product of a spiritual necessity.

==History==

{{quotation|My Mass was partly provoked by some Masses of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] that I found at a secondhand store in Los Angeles in 1942 or 1943. As I played through these rococo-operatic sweets-of-sin, I knew I had to write a Mass of my own, but a real one.|Igor Stravinsky to Robert Craft<ref name=\"white\">Eric Walter White, ''Stravinsky: The Composer and his Works''. London and Boston: Faber and Faber, 1979: p. 407.</ref> }}

Stravinsky completed the Gloria on December 20, 1944 and finished the Kyrie at about the same time. His work on the Mass was then interrupted for several years in which his wrote his [[Symphony in Three Movements]], ''[[Ebony Concerto (Stravinsky)|Ebony Concerto]]'', [[Concerto in D (Stravinsky)|Concerto in D]], and the ballet ''[[Orpheus (ballet)|Orpheus]]''. He resumed work on it in the fall of 1947 and completed it March 15, 1948.

On February 26, 1947, [[Irving Fine]] conducted the Kyrie and Gloria, accompanied by two pianos. The first complete performance occurred on October 27, 1948 in Milan. [[Ernest Ansermet]] conducted members of the chorus and orchestra of La Scala.

==Orchestration==

The work is scored for mixed [[choir|chorus]] and an ensemble of wind instruments comprising two [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], two [[bassoon]]s, two [[trumpet]]s, and three [[trombone]]s. There is also some minor solo material (often sung by members of the choir) in the second and fourth (Gloria and Sanctus) [[movement (music)|movements]]. Stravinsky specifies in the score that \"children's voices should be employed\" for both the [[soprano]] and [[alto]] parts, but, as with Stravinsky's ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'', concert performances of the Mass usually employ adult singers.

==Structure==
[[File:Polyvalency in Stravinsky's Mass.png|thumb|right|350px|Polyvalency in Stravinsky's ''Mass'' {{audio|Polyvalency in Stravinsky.mid|Play}}.<ref name=\"Leeuw\"/>]]

Like his 1955 work ''[[Canticum Sacrum]]'', the Mass forms a symmetrical plan on a large scale. The outer movements (the Kyrie and the Agnus Dei) contain homophonic choral statements with instrumental interludes, and share a tonal vocabulary including [[octatonic]], [[diatonic]], and [[Musical mode|modal]] [[scale (music)|scales]]. By contrast, movements 2 and 4 (the Gloria and the Sanctus) feature florid solo lines which alternate with the choral statements, and the harmony is more recognizably and consistently diatonic.<ref name=\"lundergan\">Edward Lundergan. \"Modal Symmetry and Textural Symbolism in the Credo of the Stravinsky Mass. ''Choral Journal'' 45, no. 8 (March 2006): 9.</ref>
The central movement, the Credo, is the longest. It features static, syllabic, and declamatory text-setting with a limited harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary. Long stretches of text often repeat a single chord, evoking the [[reciting tone]] of [[Gregorian chant]] or the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] liturgical [[chant]] that Stravinsky would have known from his childhood in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Clear setting of the text is favored over an expressive interpretation of its meaning.<ref name=\"lundergan\"/> The music features examples of [[polyvalence (music)|polyvalency]].<ref name=\"Leeuw\">Leeuw, Ton de (2005). ''Music of the Twentieth Century'', p.88. {{ISBN|90-5356-765-8}}.</ref>

==Faith==

Stravinsky chose to compose this Roman Catholic Mass despite his own Orthodox faith. He stated that this was because:
:“I wanted my Mass to be used liturgically, an outright impossibility as far as the Russian Church was concerned, as Orthodox tradition proscribes musical instruments in its services- and as I can endure unaccompanied singing in only the most harmonically primitive music.”<ref name=\"steinberg\">[[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]]. \"Igor Stavinsky: Mass.\" ''Choral Masterworks: A Listener's Guide.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005, 272.</ref>

Stravinsky also said of the Credo:
:“One composes a march to facilitate marching men, so with my Credo I hope to provide an aid to the text. The Credo is the longest movement. There is much to believe.”<ref name=\"steinberg\"/>
