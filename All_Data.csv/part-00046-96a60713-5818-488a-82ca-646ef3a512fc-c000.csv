The cartoon follows [[Mickey Mouse]] and his dog [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] traveling by train, despite a rule forbidding dogs from entering the train; [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] plays a menacing [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] intent on enforcing this rule.

==Plot==
Leaving for vacation, Mickey Mouse and Pluto arrive at a train station in [[Burbank, California]] (home of [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Productions headquarters]]). They board a west-bound train to [[Pomona (Amtrak station)|Pomona]], but are both immediately kicked off by the conductor, played by Pete, stating that dogs aren't allowed (side gag reveals Pluto's luggage to contain bones).  Pete then rambles off the train's destinations and forces his watch to tell him when the train is ready to leave.  When the watch does show its time for the train to go, Pete calls \"All aboard!\"

Mickey, at this point, decides to smuggle Pluto onboard by squeezing the dog inside his suitcase. At first, the handle breaks, making Mickey almost leave Pluto behind, but he recovers the suitcase and manages to make it aboard the caboose just as the train is leaving the platform. Later, Pluto barks, wanting to be let out.  Mickey reminds him that he will be thrown off if Pete finds out that Pluto's on the train, so he takes Pluto out and unsquashes him.  The freedom is only short lived, however, as Pete is coming through the train to collect tickets, forcing Mickey to squash Pluto back into position in the suitcase. After biting \"OK\" in Mickey's tickets, Pete sees Mickey's suitcase containing Pluto in the seat and forcefully throws it into an overhead baggage net. This causes Pluto to bark, making Pete suspicious.

He then recognizes Mickey, who tries to hide behind a large newspaper and make it look like the barking was coming from him. Realizing that Pluto has been stowed in the suitcase, Pete menacingly asks Mickey if he is alone, which Mickey states that he is alone, Pete then makes up a story about owning a little cat who'd cry when he was all alone and screams a loud \"MEOW!\" (even making his face closely resemble a real cat) at the suitcase causing Pluto to leap out barking at the \"cat\". Realizing his cover's been blown, Pluto ducks back into the suitcase, but Pete has already figured it out.  Before he can catch the pair, Mickey and Pluto run away and a chase ensues on board the train.

Mickey and Pluto first hide in a sleeping car where Pete mistakenly intrudes on a female passenger and gets assaulted. Pete then stumbles into another bed where Mickey and Pluto (disguised as babies) are hiding. Pete apologizes for the intrusion, but quickly finds out after covering up Pluto's tail.  Just as Mickey and Pluto think that they fooled Pete, Pete bursts in and threatens to beat them to a pulp, but sudden darkness from the train running through a tunnel allows the pair to escape, leaving Pete to beat the mattress to a pulp and experience a brief entanglement with the springs.

Mickey and Pluto masquerade as the conductor by hiding in Pete's own coat and hat which they'd had taken off in the tunnel. After getting false directions from Mickey with a deep voice, Pete catches on and threatens to catch them, but ends up disturbing the female passenger again.  Pete receives another beating and, unintentionally taking the passenger's hat, gets pricked by one of her needles.  Mickey disguises himself as an [[Stereotypes of Native Americans|Indian chief]] with Pluto in his [[papoose]], but Pete sees through their disguise after Pluto bites his hand.

While Mickey and Pluto are next to an open window, Pluto is caught on a passing [[mail hook]] which whisks him outside the train. Mickey runs after him through the train, and is just able to grab Pluto as he exits the caboose. Pete throws their luggage out after them and they fall to the ground from the mail hook. Mickey then looks up at the station sign and is pleasantly surprised that they have arrived at Pomona.

==Voice-over footage==
[[File:Walt Disney and Billy Bletcher.png|thumb|left|[[Walt Disney]] (left) and [[Billy Bletcher]] recording voice-overs for ''Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip'']]
''Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip'' is unique among Disney shorts in that film footage exists of the [[voice-over]] session, which included Walt Disney and Billy Bletcher. According to film historian [[Leonard Maltin]], the footage was not known to exist and only discovered (as of 2004) \"not too many years ago.\"<ref>Quoted from \"Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two,\" disc 1</ref>

The black-and-white film, which is about ten minutes in length, is the only known footage of Disney performing as Mickey Mouse. It was included as an extra on the 1997 VHS and 2000 DVD of ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'', and on the 2004 DVD release \"[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Three#Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two|Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two]]\" as an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]].<ref>The easter egg is accessed from the main menu by clicking on Mickey's cane.</ref>

==Adaptations==
In September 1940, a one-page adaptation of ''Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip'' appeared in ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' magazine. In this version Pete discovers Pluto by seeing his tail sticking out of the suitcase. Instead of being kicked off the train, Mickey and Pluto are confined to the baggage car. The story was told in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] and was illustrated by Tom Wood.<ref>{{cite book

This five-page version is a closer retelling of the film, with the added detail that Mickey is heading to an \"important meeting\" in Pomona which he can't be late for. Pluto comes along only because he would get lonely if he stayed home alone.

In 2010, the film inspired the Italian comic story \"Topolino, Pluto e la gita in montagna,\" or \"Mickey, Pluto, and the Trip to the Mountain.\" The story, published in the May edition of ''Extralarge XL Disney'', is 25 pages and written and illustrated by Enrico Faccini<ref>[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=I+PD+++47-1 Topolino, Pluto e la gita in montagna] at INDUCKS</ref>

In Finland the name ''Pääsiäisleipä'' (\"Easter bread\") is used, because ''paska'' is an obscenity in Finnish meaning \"shit\".

== Traditional ingredients ==
Paska is made with [[milk]], [[butter]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[flour]], and [[sugar]], except in Romania, where the recipe most commonly includes sweet cream, [[cottage cheese]], and/or [[sour cream]] along with [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[sugar]], [[raisins]], and [[rum]]. An egg and water mixture is used as a glaze.

== Ukraine ==

In Ukraine it is tradition to fill your easter basket (koshyk) with easter eggs (pysanky), easter bread (paska), sausage (kovbasa), butter, salt and other ceremonial foods on Easter Saturday. On Easter morning, after the liturgy and the blessing of the paska and other staples, everyone returns home to feast on the eggs, cold meats, and other goods that were blessed at church. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CT%5CR%5CTraditionalfoods.htm|title=Encyclopedia of Ukraine|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> After the matins all the people in the congregation exchange Easter greetings, give each other ''krashanky'', and then hurry home with their baskets of blessed food (''sviachene''). In eastern Ukraine they go home, place the ''sviachene'' on the table, and the oldest member of the family opens the cloths in which the food is wrapped, slices pieces from each item, and distributes them to members of the family along with a piece of unleavened bread that has also been blessed. In Western Ukraine, especially in the Hutsul region, the people first walk around the house three times, go to the stable, extend Easter greetings to the cattle, touch them with the ''sviachene'', scatter pieces of Easter bread and salt in the manger, and send holiday greetings to the bees. Only then do they enter the house, ceremoniously open the bundle (''dorinnyk'') over the heads of the children, and sit down to the table to break their fast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CE%5CA%5CEaster.htm|title=Encyclopedia of Ukraine (Easter)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Modern pasky usually have a white glaze made from sugar and egg and are decorated on top with coloured wheat grains or poppy seeds. However, an old custom, which is still practised in some Ukrainian regions and diasporas, is to create dough ornaments for the paska. The symbolism of these ornaments is connected with spring themes: the awakening of nature, resurrection and rebirth. Birds, especially larks, as heralds of spring, took a much-deserved place on pasky.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sovabooks.com.au/tradition-of-paska-ukrainian-easter-bread/|title=Tradition of Paska – Ukrainian Easter Bread|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>
== Christian symbolism ==
[[File:Lob NARkult 02.JPG|thumb|Paska bread kulich in [[Belgorod Oblast]]|alt=]]
The Christian faithful in many [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] countries eat this bread during Easter. Christian symbolism is associated with features of paska type breads. The inside of paska can be a swirl of yellow and white that is said to represent the [[resurrection of Jesus]] while the white represents the [[Holy Spirit]]. Other versions include chocolate, rice, or even savoury mixtures based on cheese. A version is made with maraschino cherries added to symbolize royal jewels in honor of the resurrection of Jesus.<ref>Joan Halmo [https://books.google.com/books?id=wOJ4sLwVllEC&pg=PA43&dq=Paska+bread&lr=#PPA43,M1 ''Celebrating the church year with young children''] Liturgical Press, 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-1580-5}}. 159 pages. page 43</ref>

== Eaten with other foods ==
[[File:PASKA2.JPG|thumb|left|Paska bread|alt=]]
Paska is eaten with \"hrudka\", also called ''syrek'', a bland sweet custard similar to cheese made from separated eggs and milk and beets mixed with [[horseradish]] (''chren''/''hrin'') and [[kielbasa]] (in Polish) or ''kovbasa'' (in Ukrainian).

==Assyrian Paska==
In Iran and the diaspora, Assyrians will eat a Paska cake on Easter, ''Ida Gura''. The tall cake is decorated with a cross on top to represent [[Calvary]], the place of Jesus' crucifixion, and surrounded with colored eggs to symbolize the people who visited Jesus during his death and were at his cross.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

Thums Up is a brand of [[cola]] in [[Indian beverages|India]]. The logo is a red [[Thumbs signal|thumbs up]]. It was introduced in 1977 to offset the withdrawal of [[The Coca-Cola Company]] from India. The brand was later bought by [[Coca-Cola]] who re-launched it in order to compete against [[Pepsi]].

{{As of|February 2012}}, Thums Up was the leader in the cola segment in India, commanding approximately 42% [[market share]] and an overall 15% market share in the Indian aerated waters market.<ref name=etf12>{{cite news|title=Will Coke's 200ml pack price cut cannibalise Thums Up?|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-02-29/news/31110875_1_thums-cola-category-coca-cola|accessdate=1 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=29 February 2012}}</ref>

==History==
Thums Up was created in 1977, after the American company Coca-Cola withdrew from India, due to regulations requiring it to disclose its formula<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9e7d36da-e8e5-11e4-87fe-00144feab7de|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref> and sell 60% of its equity to an Indian company under a government plan for foreign-owned companies to share stakes with domestic partners.<ref>{{cite book|title=International Marketing & Export Management|authors=Albaum. G and Duerr. E.|edition=6th|year=2008|publisher=Pearson|page=265}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/20-years-later-a-look-back-at-cokes-dramatic-1993-return-to-india|title=A Look Back at Coke’s Dramatic Return to India, 20 Years Later|work=The Coca-Cola Company|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}</ref> The Chauhan brothers owned part of the [[Parle Agro|Parle]] company and already had two other brands of soda, [[Limca]] and [[Gold Spot]], which were popular in India at the time. Thums Up quickly became the most popular and achieved a near [[monopoly]] among cola products in India during the 1980s, such as [[Campa Cola]], [[Double Seven (soft drink)|Double Seven]], Dukes and [[United Breweries Group]]'s McDowell's Crush.

Ramesh Chauhan had developed the formula from scratch, experimenting with ingredients such as cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg. The company also wanted the drink to be fizzy, even when it was not ice-cold, so it could be sold by vendors. After much testing and experimentation, the Chauhan brothers and their research team created a cola that was fizzier and spicier than Coca-Cola. They originally planned to name the drink “Thumbs Up,” but removed the “b” to make the name unique.<ref>[https://daily.social/story-of-thums-up/]{{dead link|date=May 2019}}</ref>

In 1991, when the [[Government of India|Indian government]] [[Economic liberalisation in India|opened the market]] to multinationals, [[Pepsi]] was the first to come in. Thums Up and Pepsi subsequently engaged in heavy competition for endorsements. [[Pepsi]] spokespersons included major Indian movie stars like [[Juhi Chawla]], while Thums Up increased its spending on cricket sponsorship. Thums Up also introduced a larger {{Convert|300|ml|USfloz|abbr=on}} bottle, branded \"MahaCola\" (meaning 'great [in size] cola'; the original size was {{Convert|250|ml|USfloz|abbr=on}}). This nickname gained popularity in smaller towns where people would ask for \"Maha Cola\" instead of Thums Up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.india.com/food-2/a-big-thums-up-to-indias-beloved-cola-a-brief-history-and-recipe-1058524/|title=A Big 'Thums Up' to India's Beloved Cola: A Brief History and Recipe|first=Soni|last=Satpathy-Singh|date=1 April 2016|website=India.com}}</ref>

In 1993, Coca-Cola re-entered the market and the three companies competed intensely. Later in the year, Coca-Cola bought the Parle owned drinks Gold Spot,Limca and Thums Up for $60 million. When this were sold to Coca-Cola, Thums Up had a [[market share]] of 85 percent in India.<ref name=etf12/>

===Relaunch===
Despite its strong overall equity, the brand was losing its popularity among the core cola-drinking age group of 12- to 25-year-olds, partly due to a lack of advertising. At first, Coca-Cola cut advertising and production for Thums Up to drive customers to their flagship brand,<ref name=\"outlookbiz\">{{cite news |title=Thumbs Up, Forever |first=Meenakshi |last=Radhakrishnan-Swami |date=July 6, 2013 |work=Outlook Business |url=http://www.outlookbusiness.com/article_v3.aspx?artid=286425}}</ref> but soon realised that Thums Up customers would turn to Pepsi instead of Coke, were Thums Up withdrawn from the market. Instead, Coke decided to use Thums Up as a rival brand to Pepsi. The Coca-Cola Company by this time had about 60.5% share of the Indian soft-drink market but found out that if it took out Thums Up, it would remain with only 28.7% of the market (according to a report by NGO Finance & Trade in India), hence Thums Up was re-launched, targeting 30- to 40-year-olds.

The brand was re-positioned as a \"manly\" drink, drawing on its strong taste qualities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/the-brand-that-refused-to-die.html/1/4179.html |title=The brand that refused to die|author=Shamni Pande|work=Business Today|publisher=Businesstoday.intoday.in |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2010-09-18}}</ref>
Thums Up started an advertising campaign directly attacking Pepsi’s [[television advertisement|television commercials]], focusing on the strength of the drink hoping that the depiction of an \"adult\" drink would appeal to young consumers. \"Grow up to Thums Up\" was a successful campaign. The brand's market share and equity increased.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bob Page |url=http://www.mercurybrief.com/2009/10/thums-up-cola-of-india/ |title=How Thums Up became the ruling cola of India. |publisher=The Mercury Brief |date= |accessdate=2010-09-18}}</ref>

Today, the beverage is the leading cola in India, with 42 percent of the cola market share and 15 percent of the market share for all carbonated drinks. It is especially popular among teenagers, young adults, and people in their 30s and 40s.

==Ingredients==

The original Thums Up logo was a red [[thumbs up]] hand gesture with a slanted, white, sans-serif typeface. This would later be modified by Coca-Cola with blue strokes and a more modern-looking typeface.

The famous slogan until the early 1980s was \"Happy days are here again\", coined by [[copywriter]], [[Vasant Kumar]].  The slogan later became \"I want My Thunder\", and subsequently \"Taste the thunder!\"

Product placement in films was used in the 1980s with Thums Up appearing in the background of many Hindi films.<ref name=\"outlookbiz\"/>

Thums Up is a brand of [[cola]] in [[Indian beverages|India]]. The logo is a red [[Thumbs signal|thumbs up]]. It was introduced in 1977 to offset the withdrawal of [[The Coca-Cola Company]] from India. The brand was later bought by [[Coca-Cola]] who re-launched it in order to compete against [[Pepsi]].

{{As of|February 2012}}, Thums Up was the leader in the cola segment in India, commanding approximately 42% [[market share]] and an overall 15% market share in the Indian aerated waters market.<ref name=etf12>{{cite news|title=Will Coke's 200ml pack price cut cannibalise Thums Up?|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-02-29/news/31110875_1_thums-cola-category-coca-cola|accessdate=1 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=29 February 2012}}</ref>

==History==
Thums Up was created in 1977, after the American company Coca-Cola withdrew from India, due to regulations requiring it to disclose its formula<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9e7d36da-e8e5-11e4-87fe-00144feab7de|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref> and sell 60% of its equity to an Indian company under a government plan for foreign-owned companies to share stakes with domestic partners.<ref>{{cite book|title=International Marketing & Export Management|authors=Albaum. G and Duerr. E.|edition=6th|year=2008|publisher=Pearson|page=265}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/20-years-later-a-look-back-at-cokes-dramatic-1993-return-to-india|title=A Look Back at Coke’s Dramatic Return to India, 20 Years Later|work=The Coca-Cola Company|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}</ref> The Chauhan brothers owned part of the [[Parle Agro|Parle]] company and already had two other brands of soda, [[Limca]] and [[Gold Spot]], which were popular in India at the time. Thums Up quickly became the most popular and achieved a near [[monopoly]] among cola products in India during the 1980s, such as [[Campa Cola]], [[Double Seven (soft drink)|Double Seven]], Dukes and [[United Breweries Group]]'s McDowell's Crush.

Ramesh had developed the formula from scratch, experimenting with ingredients such as cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg. The company also wanted the drink to be fizzy, even when it was not ice-cold, so it could be sold by vendors. After much testing and experimentation, the Chauhan brothers and their research team created a cola that was fizzier and spicier than Coca-Cola. They originally planned to name the drink “Thumbs Up,” but removed the “b” to make the name unique.<ref>[https://daily.social/story-of-thums-up/]{{dead link|date=May 2019}}</ref>

In 1991, when the [[Government of India|Indian government]] [[Economic liberalisation in India|opened the market]] to multinationals, [[Pepsi]] was the first to come in. Thums Up and Pepsi subsequently engaged in heavy competition for endorsements. [[Pepsi]] spokespersons included major Indian movie stars like [[Juhi Chawla]], while Thums Up increased its spending on cricket sponsorship. Thums Up also introduced a larger {{Convert|300|ml|USfloz|abbr=on}} bottle, branded \"MahaCola\" (meaning 'great [in size] cola'; the original size was {{Convert|250|ml|USfloz|abbr=on}}). This nickname gained popularity in smaller towns where people would ask for \"Maha Cola\" instead of Thums Up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.india.com/food-2/a-big-thums-up-to-indias-beloved-cola-a-brief-history-and-recipe-1058524/|title=A Big 'Thums Up' to India's Beloved Cola: A Brief History and Recipe|first=Soni|last=Satpathy-Singh|date=1 April 2016|website=India.com}}</ref>

In 1993, Coca-Cola re-entered the market and the three companies competed intensely. Later in the year, Coca-Cola bought the Parle owned drinks Gold Spot,Limca and Thums Up for $60 million. When this were sold to Coca-Cola, Thums Up had a [[market share]] of 85 percent in India.<ref name=etf12/>

===Relaunch===
Despite its strong overall equity, the brand was losing its popularity among the core cola-drinking age group of 12- to 25-year-olds, partly due to a lack of advertising. At first, Coca-Cola cut advertising and production for Thums Up to drive customers to their flagship brand,<ref name=\"outlookbiz\">{{cite news |title=Thumbs Up, Forever |first=Meenakshi |last=Radhakrishnan-Swami |date=July 6, 2013 |work=Outlook Business |url=http://www.outlookbusiness.com/article_v3.aspx?artid=286425}}</ref> but soon realised that Thums Up customers would turn to Pepsi instead of Coke, were Thums Up withdrawn from the market. Instead, Coke decided to use Thums Up as a rival brand to Pepsi. The Coca-Cola Company by this time had about 60.5% share of the Indian soft-drink market but found out that if it took out Thums Up, it would remain with only 28.7% of the market (according to a report by NGO Finance & Trade in India), hence Thums Up was re-launched, targeting 30- to 40-year-olds.

The brand was re-positioned as a \"manly\" drink, drawing on its strong taste qualities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/the-brand-that-refused-to-die.html/1/4179.html |title=The brand that refused to die|author=Shamni Pande|work=Business Today|publisher=Businesstoday.intoday.in |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2010-09-18}}</ref>
Thums Up started an advertising campaign directly attacking Pepsi’s [[television advertisement|television commercials]], focusing on the strength of the drink hoping that the depiction of an \"adult\" drink would appeal to young consumers. \"Grow up to Thums Up\" was a successful campaign. The brand's market share and equity increased.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bob Page |url=http://www.mercurybrief.com/2009/10/thums-up-cola-of-india/ |title=How Thums Up became the ruling cola of India. |publisher=The Mercury Brief |date= |accessdate=2010-09-18}}</ref>

Today, the beverage is the leading cola in India, with 42 percent of the cola market share and 15 percent of the market share for all carbonated drinks. It is especially popular among teenagers, young adults, and people in their 30s and 40s.

==Ingredients==
According to Coca-Cola's Indian website, Thums Up contains: [[carbonated water]], [[sugar]], acidity regulator ([[E338]]), [[caffeine]], natural colour (150d) and added flavours (\"natural, nature identical and artificial flavouring substances\").<ref name=\"Coke India site\">{{cite web|title=Thumb Up|url=https://www.coca-colaindia.com/our-products/product-list-descriptions/thums-up/|publisher=Coca-Cola India|accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref>

'''''Can-I-Bus''''' is the debut album by [[rapper]] [[Canibus]], released on September 8, 1998 through [[Universal Records]]. The album was released after the rapper's success with his [[LL Cool J]] [[diss (music)|diss track]], \"[[Second Round K.O.]]\", which was included on ''Can-I-Bus'', with additional support from heavyweight boxer [[Mike Tyson]].

However, the album received mixed reviews. The beats, created mostly by [[Wyclef Jean]], were criticized for their blandness and unoriginality (with a fair amount of the criticism coming from Canibus), but lyrically, the album was praised. Tower Records referred to Canibus as \"one of the most innovative new MCs in hip-hop. With ''Can-I-Bus'', the debut album, Canibus delivers more of the battle-rhyme lyrics that are his stock in trade. Still, he manages to cover new ground with conceptually strong cuts like 'I Honor U,' which is dedicated to his mother. With his lyrical skills, Canibus represents the elements that helped build rap music.\" The album was [[gold certification|certified gold]] by the [[RIAA]]. The song \"How We Roll\" also appeared on the bonus 3rd disc of Eightball's album ''[[Lost (Eightball album)|Lost]]''.

''Can-I-Bus'' garnered mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s who admired Canibus' battle rap skills but felt exhaustive at times, along with subpar production and half-hearted attempts at different topics.

Hugo Lunny of MVRemix praised Canibus' battle rhymes but felt that the production didn't give them the necessary energy needed, highlighting \"I Honor U\" and \"Channel Zero\" for finding the right balance, concluding that \"Overall, this is a good album, although anyone who's heard Canibus on 'Desperados' or 'Making A Name 4 Ourselves' is likely to find the album a bit too over hyped. However, listen to the album with fair expectations, and you'll enjoy it.\"<ref name=\"MVR\"/> [[David Browne (journalist)|David Browne]], writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', praised Canibus for being able to go beyond the battle rapper image and show versatility in his topics but found the production a hindrance to his goal, concluding that \"His devotion to the lyrical slam and to self-respect earmark Canibus as a contender, but it wouldn’t hurt him to learn a few things about record making–from, say, [[LL Cool J|LL]]?\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] found Canibus' aggro delivery tiring at times no matter the beat or subject but still gave credit for remaining impactful, concluding that \"Unfortunately, those moments only occur sporadically over the course of this overlong debut, but when they do happen, it's easy to see what all the hype is about.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>

Wall of Sound's Oliver Wang felt that [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Jerry Wonda]]'s pop-sounding production didn't suit Canibus' tight flow and dark lyricism and preferred [[Clark Kent (producer)|Clark Kent]], [[Salaam Remi]] and LG as being a perfect match for his content, saying that \"Like his West Coast counterpart, [[Ras Kass]], Canibus proves that his rhyme rep isn't totally fabricated, but both artists blow their bets in trying to appeal to both underground and pop audiences.\"<ref name=\"WofS\"/> Kevin Powell of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' felt the album lacked more personal tracks and intellectual insight to clear up the lyrical venom found throughout, concluding that \"In these smoke-filled last days of the 1990s, Canibus and ''Can-I-Bus'' are exactly what much of hip-hop has become: a lot of hype. Don't believe it.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> DJ Fatboy of ''RapReviews'' found the album a big disappointment, criticizing Canibus for trying to change his hardcore lyricist image in order to appeal to a mainstream audience, saying that \"It's as if he's embarrassed to be known as a battle rapper. What's wrong with that? Sure, it's a one note performance, but if he can play that one note better than all the other herbs out there, then he shouldn't waste his time and ours by switching up to a style he can't rock.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/>

'''''Can-I-Bus''''' is the debut album by [[rapper]] [[Canibus]], released on September 8, 1998 through [[Universal Records]]. The album was released after the rapper's success with his [[LL Cool J]] [[diss (music)|diss track]], \"[[Second Round K.O.]]\", which was included on ''Can-I-Bus'', with additional support from heavyweight boxer [[Mike Tyson]].

However, the album received mixed reviews. The beats, created mostly by [[Wyclef Jean]], were criticized for their blandness and unoriginality (with a fair amount of the criticism coming from Canibus), but lyrically, the album was praised. Tower Records referred to Canibus as \"one of the most innovative new MCs in hip-hop. With ''Can-I-Bus'', the debut album, Canibus delivers more of the battle-rhyme lyrics that are his stock in trade. Still, he manages to cover new ground with conceptually strong cuts like 'I Honor U,' which is dedicated to his mother. With his lyrical skills, Canibus represents the elements that helped build rap music.\" The album was [[gold certification|certified gold]] by the [[RIAA]]. The song \"How We Roll\" also appeared on the bonus 3rd disc of Eightball's album ''[[Lost (Eightball album)|Lost]]''.

''Can-I-Bus'' garnered mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s who admired Canibus' battle rap skills but felt exhaustive at times, along with subpar production and half-hearted attempts at different topics.

Hugo Lunny of MVRemix praised Canibus' battle rhymes but felt that the production didn't give them the necessary energy needed, highlighting \"I Honor U\" and \"Channel Zero\" for finding the right balance, concluding that \"Overall, this is a good album, although anyone who's heard Canibus on 'Desperados' or 'Making A Name 4 Ourselves' is likely to find the album a bit too over hyped. However, listen to the album with fair expectations, and you'll enjoy it.\"<ref name=\"MVR\"/> [[David Browne (journalist)|David Browne]], writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', praised Canibus for being able to go beyond the battle rapper image and show versatility in his topics but found the production a hindrance to his goal, concluding that \"His devotion to the lyrical slam and to self-respect earmark Canibus as a contender, but it wouldn’t hurt him to learn a few things about record making–from, say, [[LL Cool J|LL]]?\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] found Canibus' aggro delivery tiring at times no matter the beat or subject but still gave credit for remaining impactful, concluding that \"Unfortunately, those moments only occur sporadically over the course of this overlong debut, but when they do happen, it's easy to see what all the hype is about.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>

Wall of Sound's Oliver Wang felt that [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Jerry Wonda]]'s pop-sounding production didn't suit Canibus' tight flow and dark lyricism and preferred [[Clark Kent (producer)|Clark Kent]], [[Salaam Remi]] and LG as being a perfect match for his content, saying that \"Like his West Coast counterpart, [[Ras Kass]], Canibus proves that his rhyme rep isn't totally fabricated, but both artists blow their bets in trying to appeal to both underground and pop audiences.\"<ref name=\"WofS\"/> Kevin Powell of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' felt the album lacked more personal tracks and intellectual insight to clear up the lyrical venom found throughout, concluding that \"In these smoke-filled last days of the 1990s, Canibus and ''Can-I-Bus'' are exactly what much of hip-hop has become: a lot of hype. Don't believe it.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> DJ Fatboy of ''RapReviews'' found the album a big disappointment, criticizing Canibus for trying to change his hardcore lyricist image in order to appeal to a mainstream audience, saying that \"It's as if he's embarrassed to be known as a battle rapper. What's wrong with that? Sure, it's a one note performance, but if he can play that one note better than all the other herbs out there, then he shouldn't waste his time and ours by switching up to a style he can't rock.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/>

He played collegiately at [[West Virginia University]].

McLee played for the [[St. Louis Rams]] of the NFL and the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the CFL.

==College career==
During high school in Uniontown, PA (suburban Pittsburgh), McLee rushed for 1,637 yards and led the team in [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]]. McLee also [[Varsity letter|lettered]] in [[basketball]] and [[Track and field|track]].

Following his uncle Billy and cousin Reggie McLee's footsteps, McLee attended [[West Virginia University]]. He was interested in [[Michigan State]] and [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]], but neither one gave him offers. McLee redshirted his 2002 freshman year, learning the complex 3-3-5 defensive scheme, but was rookie of the week in practice during the game week against the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]].

===Freshman (2002)===
In [[2002 NCAA Division I-A football season|2002]], McLee red-shirted his true freshman season.

===Freshman (2003)===
In [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003]], McLee got more playing time with the graduation of [[Grant Wiley]], 2002's starting linebacker. Behind linebacker Scott Gyorko, McLee totaled 46 tackles for the year and three sacks. McLee recorded two tackles against [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]], three tackles and a sack in the game against the [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]], and six tackles, a sack, and a fumble recovery against the [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland]]. McLee also forced fumble against Miami and [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]]. In the [[Gator Bowl]], McLee recorded six tackles.

===Sophomore (2004)===
In [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season|2004]], McLee played on the Mountaineer team that was expected to be National Championship contenders with [[Rasheed Marshall]], [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam \"Pacman\" Jones]], [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]], and [[Kay-Jay Harris]]. Although the Mountaineers ended 8-4, McLee had a good season. McLee shared time with fellow junior Jeff Noechel, but recorded 44 tackles on the year. In an overtime win against Maryland, McLee recorded six tackles and forced a fumble. Against Virginia Tech, McLee led the team with 11 tackles and recorded a 10-yard sack against [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]]. McLee had a team-best eight tackles in the [[Gator Bowl]] loss to [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]].

===Junior (2005)===
In [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005]], McLee teamed up with a strong defense of [[Mike Lorello]] and [[Jahmile Addae]] at safeties. McLee earned 2005 first-team All-[[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East]] honors, [[ESPN]] All-Conference honors, and All-[[Eastern College Athletic Conference|ECAC]] honors as the starter. McLee recorded 78 tackles, which was second-best on the team. McLee had a team-high six tackles at [[Syracuse Orange#Football history|Syracuse]] for the season-opener, a team-best 11 tackles in the [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina]] win, team-best nine tackles and a sack of [[Marcus Vick]] against Virginia Tech, 10 tackles and two pass break-ups in overtime win against the [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]], 30-yard interception against [[Connecticut Huskies#Football|UConn]], and was the leading tackler with 11 tackles against Pitt. McLee won Girdiron Gladiator Award from the West Virginia coaches and was the Big East player of the week against Cincinnati. He was also named MVP on defense against Syracuse, Virginia Tech, Cincinnati, and Pitt.

===Senior (2006)===
In [[2006 NCAA Division I-A football season|2006]], McLee finally started the whole season. He finished the season with 79 tackles but no sacks. McLee had his second career interception against Connecticut, which he returned for 10 yards. McLee had 9 tackles against [[Marshall University#Athletics|Marshall]], six tackles against Maryland, six against Syracuse, six against Connecticut, six against Cincinnati, and eight tackles in the overtime win against [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]]. McLee finished the season on the [[Butkus Award]] list and traveled to the [[Senior Bowl]].<ref>[http://www.nfl-draft-site.com/2007/01/official-senior-bowl-roster.html The NFL Draft Site: Official Senior Bowl Roster]</ref> In his final game as a Mountaineer, McLee totaled three tackles against [[2006 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]] in the [[Gator Bowl]].

==Professional career==

===Pre-Draft===
During the Senior Bowl, McLee was reported to be \"looking quick\". ESPN ranked McLee as the #14 inside linebacker in the class, out of the 29-ranked inside linebacker prospects. His toughness was praised, while his discipline and learning of schemes were issues. McLee played all three linebacking positions in college, which NFL scouts praised.

===NFL Draft===
McLee went undrafted in the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. A day later, McLee signed with the [[St. Louis Rams]], who did not take any linebackers in the draft, as an undrafted free agent. \"It's a slap in the face,\" McLee said. \"Not one of us was drafted. It's very disappointing. We're going to show the league that we can play... They're going to notice us.\"

On July 18, 2007, McLee's father, Kevin McLee Sr.,<ref name=Kevin /> who was a running back at [[University of Georgia|Georgia]], and former [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay Buccaneer]]<ref name=\"Kevin \"/> died at the age of 52.<ref name=\"McLee Sr.\">{{cite web | url = http://pittsburghlive.com/x/tribunereview/news/fayette/s_517790.html | accessdate = 2008-04-01 | title = Ex-Georgia RB, Uniontown native McLee dies at 52 - Tribune-Review | publisher = PittsburghLIVE.com }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===CFL===

==Professional career==

===Pre-Draft===
During the Senior Bowl, McLee was reported to be \"looking quick\". ESPN ranked McLee as the #14 inside linebacker in the class, out of the 29-ranked inside linebacker prospects. His toughness was praised, while his discipline and learning of schemes were issues. McLee played all three linebacking positions in college, which NFL scouts praised.

===NFL Draft===
McLee went undrafted in the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. A day later, McLee signed with the [[St. Louis Rams]], who did not take any linebackers in the draft, as an undrafted free agent. \"It's a slap in the face,\" McLee said. \"Not one of us was drafted. It's very disappointing. We're going to show the league that we can play... They're going to notice us.\" McLee will join with fellow former-Mountaineer and quarterback [[Marc Bulger]].

On July 18, 2007, McLee's father, Kevin McLee Sr.,<ref name=Kevin /> who was a running back at [[University of Georgia|Georgia]], and former [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay Buccaneer]]<ref name=\"Kevin \"/> died at the age of 52.<ref name=\"McLee Sr.\">{{cite web | url = http://pittsburghlive.com/x/tribunereview/news/fayette/s_517790.html | accessdate = 2008-04-01 | title = Ex-Georgia RB, Uniontown native McLee dies at 52 - Tribune-Review | publisher = PittsburghLIVE.com }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The '''Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway''' was a [[railroad]] and [[steamboat]] network in [[Florida]], USA at the end of the 19th century. Most of its lines became part of the [[Plant System]] in 1899 and the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] in 1902.  The line remains in service today with a vast majority of it now being [[CSX Transportation]]'s [[Sanford Subdivision]].

==History==
The '''Tampa, Peace Creek and St. Johns River Railroad''' was incorporated in 1879, and received a charter to build a railroad from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway was incorporated in 1871, and acquired the railway charter from the Tampa, Peace Creek and St. Johns River Railroad. Construction of a rail line from Jacksonville to [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]] began in March 1883, and regular service between the cities began in March 1884. The railroad was built to the [[5 ft and 1520 mm gauge railways|5-foot gauge]] to match that of the [[Plant System]] Waycross and Florida Railroad, with which it connected in Jacksonville. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway extended its line from Palatka to [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] in 1885, using the right-of-way of the '''Palatka and Indian River Railway Company'''. The line crossed the [[St. Johns River]] a few miles south of Palatka and ran southward on the east side of the river to the northern end of [[Lake Monroe (Florida)|Lake Monroe]], crossed back over the river and then ran a few miles to Sanford, where it connected to the [[South Florida Railroad]]. The line to Sanford began regular service in February 1886.<ref name=Pettengill>{{Cite book|last=Pettengill|first=George W., Jr.|url=|title=The Story of the Florida Railroads 1834–1903|publisher=The Southeast Chapter of The Railway & Locomotive Historical Society, Inc.|year=1998|isbn=|series=Bulletin of the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society, Inc.|volume=86|location=Jacksonville, Florida|edition=Reprint|pages=80–82|orig-year=1952}}</ref> 

The [[Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad]] completed a line from [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]], on the [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]], to [[Enterprise, Florida|Enterprise]], on the eastern shore of Lake Monroe opposite Sanford, in early 1886. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway build a {{convert|3.9|mile|adj=on}} line to Enterprise from its mainline at [[Benson Junction, Florida|Enterprise Junction]]. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway then leased the Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad, and purchased all of its rolling stock. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway operated the Enterprise to Titusville line as its Indian River Branch.<ref name=Pettengill/>

After leasing the Titusville–Enterprise line of the Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad, the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway began operating steamboats from its dock in Titusville down the Indian River to [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]]. In December 1888, the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway established the [[Indian River Steamboat Company]] to operate the steamboats, with Mason Young, vice-president of the railway company, servicing as president of the steamboat company.<ref name=\"Florida1891\">{{cite book|author=Railroad Commission of the State of Florida|title=Annual Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVoPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA89|year=1891|pages=90–101}}</ref> The [[Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway]] opened in 1889 as a short connection between the Indian River Steamboat Company at Jupiter and the north end of [[Lake Worth, Florida|Lake Worth]], where steamers continued south. The line was abandoned by 1896 after the completion of the parallel [[Florida East Coast Railway]].

The [[Orange Ridge, DeLand and Atlantic Railroad]] Company was a [[3 ft gauge railways|3-foot gauge]] {{convert|6|mile|adj=on}} line built in 1885, connecting [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]] with DeLand Landing on the St. Johns River. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West line intersected it {{convert|2|mile}} from DeLand Landing at [[DeLand Junction]]. The railroad was reincorporated in 1886 as the Deland and St. Johns River Railroad Company and converted to 5-foot gauge to match the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway.<ref name=Pettengill/>

In 1893 the JT&KW went [[bankrupt]]. The [[Southeastern Railway (Florida)|Southeastern Railway]] bought the line from Enterprise to Titusville in 1899, and later that year sold it to the [[Florida East Coast Railway]]. Also that year, the rest of the system was reincorporated as the Jacksonville and St. Johns River Railway and sold to the [[Savannah, Florida and Western Railway]] (the [[Plant System]]). The Plant System became part of the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] in 1902. In 1967 the ACL merged into the [[Seaboard Coast Line Railroad]], eventually becoming part of [[CSX]]. The JT&KW is now part of the \"A\" Line, one of CSX's two main lines into Florida.<ref name=\"CSX\">[http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/CSX/CSX%20ETTs/CSX%20Jacksonville%20Div%20ETT%20%234%201-1-2005.pdf CSX Jacksonville Division Timetable]</ref>

==Branches==
;DeLand
The [[Orange Ridge, DeLand and Atlantic Railroad]] was incorporated by Laws of Florida Chapter 3332, No. 114 on March 7, 1881, running from [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]] west across the JT&KW at [[DeLand Junction]] to the [[St. Johns River]]. It became the [[De Land and St. Johns River Railroad]] in 1886, and the JT&KW bought it in 1890.

;Enterprise
The [[Enterprise Branch]] ran from the main line at [[Benson Junction]] east to [[Enterprise, Florida|Enterprise]]. It continued to [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]] as the [[Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad]], acquired in 1886.

;Lake Eustis
The [[Sanford and Lake Eustis Railroad]] was organized in 1886 and merged into the JT&KW on May 1, 1890. The line ran west from Sanford to [[Tavares (FL)|Tavares]] on [[Lake Eustis]].

==Current operations==
{{see also|Sanford Subdivision}}
The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway remains in service and is today part of CSX's A Line.  CSX has designated it as their Sanford Subdivision and [[Jacksonville Terminal Subdivision]].  Though as of 2011, the [[Florida Department of Transportation]] owns a short segment of the line south of [[Deland, Florida|Deland]] to Sanford and operates the [[SunRail]] commuter rail service over that segment.  CSX still runs local freight on the line but all through freight trains have since been shifted to the [[Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad|S Line]] due to SunRail service.  Prior to the sale of the southern portion of the line to FDOT, CSX's Sanford Subdivision continued south to Sanford and then along on the former [[South Florida Railroad]] as far as [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]].

[[Amtrak]] also uses the line for all of its Florida service including the [[Silver Meteor]], [[Silver Star (Amtrak train)|Silver Star]], and the [[Auto Train]].

The '''Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway''' was a [[railroad]] and [[steamboat]] network in [[Florida]], USA at the end of the 19th century. Most of its lines became part of the [[Plant System]] in 1899 and the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] in 1902.  The line remains in service today with a vast majority of it now being [[CSX Transportation]]'s [[Sanford Subdivision]].

==History==
The '''Tampa, Peace Creek and St. Johns River Railroad''' was incorporated in 1879, and received a charter to build a railroad from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway was incorporated in 1871, and acquired the railway charter from the Tampa, Peace Creek and St. Johns River Railroad. Construction of a rail line from Jacksonville to [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]] began in March 1883, and regular service between the cities began in March 1884. The railroad was built to the [[5 ft and 1520 mm gauge railways|5-foot gauge]] to match that of the [[Plant System]] Waycross and Florida Railroad, with which it connected in Jacksonville. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway extended its line from Palatka to [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] in 1885, using the right-of-way of the '''Palatka and Indian River Railway Company'''. The line crossed the [[St. Johns River]] a few miles south of Palatka and ran southward on the east side of the river to the northern end of [[Lake Monroe (Florida)|Lake Monroe]], crossed back over the river and then ran a few miles to Sanford, where it connected to the [[South Florida Railroad]]. The line to Sanford began regular service in February 1886.<ref name=Pettengill>{{Cite book|last=Pettengill|first=George W., Jr.|url=|title=The Story of the Florida Railroads 1834–1903|publisher=The Southeast Chapter of The Railway & Locomotive Historical Society, Inc.|year=1998|isbn=|series=Bulletin of the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society, Inc.|volume=86|location=Jacksonville, Florida|edition=Reprint|pages=80–82|orig-year=1952}}</ref> 

The [[Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad]] completed a line from [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]], on the [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]], to [[Enterprise, Florida|Enterprise]], on the eastern shore of Lake Monroe opposite Sanford, in early 1886. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway build a {{convert|3.9|mile|adj=on}} line to Enterprise from its mainline at [[Benson Junction, Florida|Enterprise Junction]]. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway then leased the Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad, and purchased all of its rolling stock. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway operated the Enterpise to Titusville line as its Indian River Branch.<ref name=Pettengill/>

After leasing the Titusville–Enterprise line of the Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad, the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway began operating steamboats from its dock in Titusville down the Indian River to [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]]. In December 1888, the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway established the [[Indian River Steamboat Company]] to operate the steamboats, with Mason Young, vice-president of the railway company, servicing as president of the steamboat company.<ref name=\"Florida1891\">{{cite book|author=Railroad Commission of the State of Florida|title=Annual Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVoPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA89|year=1891|pages=90–101}}</ref> The [[Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway]] opened in 1889 as a short connection between the Indian River Steamboat Company at Jupiter and the north end of [[Lake Worth, Florida|Lake Worth]], where steamers continued south. The line was abandoned by 1896 after the completion of the parallel [[Florida East Coast Railway]].

The [[Orange Ridge, DeLand and Atlantic Railroad]] Company was a [[3 ft gauge railways|3-foot gauge]] {{convert|6|mile|adj=on}} line built in 1885, connecting [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]] with DeLand Landing on the St. Johns River. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West line intersected it {{convert|2|mile}} from DeLand Landing at [[DeLand Junction]]. The railroad was reincorporated in 1886 as the Deland and St. Johns River Railroad Company and converted to 5-foot gauge to match the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway.<ref name=Pettengill/>

In 1893 the JT&KW went [[bankrupt]]. The [[Southeastern Railway (Florida)|Southeastern Railway]] bought the line from Enterprise to Titusville in 1899, and later that year sold it to the [[Florida East Coast Railway]]. Also that year, the rest of the system was reincorporated as the Jacksonville and St. Johns River Railway and sold to the [[Savannah, Florida and Western Railway]] (the [[Plant System]]). The Plant System became part of the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] in 1902. In 1967 the ACL merged into the [[Seaboard Coast Line Railroad]], eventually becoming part of [[CSX]]. The JT&KW is now part of the \"A\" Line, one of CSX's two main lines into Florida.<ref name=\"CSX\">[http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/CSX/CSX%20ETTs/CSX%20Jacksonville%20Div%20ETT%20%234%201-1-2005.pdf CSX Jacksonville Division Timetable]</ref>

==Branches==
;DeLand
The [[Orange Ridge, DeLand and Atlantic Railroad]] was incorporated by Laws of Florida Chapter 3332, No. 114 on March 7, 1881, running from [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]] west across the JT&KW at [[DeLand Junction]] to the [[St. Johns River]]. It became the [[De Land and St. Johns River Railroad]] in 1886, and the JT&KW bought it in 1890.

;Enterprise
The [[Enterprise Branch]] ran from the main line at [[Benson Junction]] east to [[Enterprise, Florida|Enterprise]]. It continued to [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]] as the [[Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad]], acquired in 1886.

;Lake Eustis
The [[Sanford and Lake Eustis Railroad]] was organized in 1886 and merged into the JT&KW on May 1, 1890. The line ran west from Sanford to [[Tavares (FL)|Tavares]] on [[Lake Eustis]].

==Current operations==
{{see also|Sanford Subdivision}}
The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway remains in service and is today part of CSX's A Line.  CSX has designated it as their Sanford Subdivision and [[Jacksonville Terminal Subdivision]].  Though as of 2011, the [[Florida Department of Transportation]] owns a short segment of the line south of [[Deland, Florida|Deland]] to Sanford and operates the [[SunRail]] commuter rail service over that segment.  CSX still runs local freight on the line but all through freight trains have since been shifted to the [[Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad|S Line]] due to SunRail service.  Prior to the sale of the southern portion of the line to FDOT, CSX's Sanford Subdivision continued south to Sanford and then along on the former [[South Florida Railroad]] as far as [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]].

[[Amtrak]] also uses the line for all of its Florida service including the [[Silver Meteor]], [[Silver Star (Amtrak train)|Silver Star]], and the [[Auto Train]].

'''Bruce Cannon Gibney''' (born February 16, 1976)<ref>[https://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/qa-a-gen-x-venture-capitalist-on-how-boomers-wrecked-america/ Q&A: A venture capitalist on how boomers wrecked America]</ref><ref>United States Public Records, 1970-2009 (California, 2002-2008)</ref> is an American writer and [[venture capital]]ist. He was one of the first investors at PayPal, and went on to work for PayPal founder [[Peter Thiel]]'s hedge fund Clarium and his venture capital company [[Founders Fund]]. His first book, ''A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America'', was published by [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] in 2017.

== Career ==
Gibney started investing when his [[Stanford University]] roommate [[Ken Howery]] co-founded [[PayPal]], the electronic payments company, and offered Gibney the chance to buy \"friends and family\" shares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avcj.com/avcj/profile/53100/profile-founders-funds-bruce-gibney|title=Profile: Founders Fund's Bruce Gibney|website=avcj.com|publisher=Asian Venture Capital Journal|last1=Birkwood|first1=Susannah|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}</ref> After investing in PayPal, Gibney worked as a litigator but was soon hired by [[Peter Thiel]] after Thiel sold PayPal to [[eBay]] in 2002. Gibney worked at Thiel's [[hedge fund]], Clarium, until 2008, making occasional private investments including in [[Palantir Technologies]] in 2005 and later in [[DeepMind]], which was acquired by [[Google]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind|title=Google buys UK artificial intelligence startup Deepmind for £400m|last=Gibbs|first=Samuel|date=January 27, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref> for around $450 million in 2014. He then moved to [[Founders Fund]], a venture capital fund started by Thiel. Thiel and Founders Fund were the earliest outside investors in Facebook, [[SpaceX]], and Palantir, and made other investments including in [[Airbnb|AirBnB]], [[Lyft]], [[Spotify]], and Stemcentrx, which [[AbbVie Inc.|AbbVie]] acquired for $10 billion a few years after Founders Fund's investment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stemcentrx-acquired-by-abbvie-2016-4|title=A startup that just launched out of stealth a few months ago thinks it's found a way to treat cancer, and it just got bought for up to $10 billion|last=Ramsey|first=Lydia|date=April 28, 2016|website=businessinsider.com|publisher=Business Insider|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref>

Gibney wrote Founders Fund's controversial statement of ideology, ''What Happened to the Future?'', in 2011, which called for more aggressive investments in breakthrough technologies and became a widely cited article in the technology community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/11/28/no-death-no-taxes|title=No Death, No Taxes|last=Packer|first=George|date=November 28, 2011|website=newyorker.com|publisher=The New Yorker|access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/founders-fund-the-future-2011-7|title=Facebook Investor Wants Flying Cars, Not 140 Characters|last=Gobry|first=Pascal-Emmanuel|date=July 30, 2011|website=businessinsider.com|publisher=Business Insider|access-date=December 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/429690/why-we-cant-solve-big-problems/|title=Why We Can't Solve Big Problems|last=Pontin|first=Jason|date=October 24, 2012|website=redhnologyreview.com|publisher=MIT|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/01/our-favorite-tech-long-reads-of-2011/|title=Our favorite tech long reads of 2011|last=Kelly|first=Heather|date=January 1, 2012|website=venturebeat.com|publisher=Venture Beat|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref> He also wrote other articles about start-ups and technology and lectured on these subjects, as well as Silicon Valley’s \"libertarian problem\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/bruce-gibney/silicon-valleys-libertarian-problem.html|title=Silicon Valley's Libertarian Problem|first=Bruce|last=Gibney|date=August 13, 2012|website=Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blakemasters.com/post/22271192791/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-8-notes-essay|title=CS 183: Class 8 Notes|last=Masters|first=Blake|date=May 2, 2012|website=blakemasters.com|publisher=Blake Masters|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/entrepreneurship-is-really-risky-right.html|title=Entrepreneurship Is Really Risky, Right?|last=Stillman|first=Jessica|date=February 1, 2012|website=inc.com|publisher=Inc|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2012/05/four-things-to-get-right-when|title=Four Things to Get Right When Starting a Company|last=Gibney, Howery|first=Bruce, Ken|date=May 9, 2012|website=hbr.org|publisher=Harcard Business Review|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2012/01/the-hbr-list-of-audacious-ideas|title=The HBR List of Audacious Ideas|last=|first=|date=January–February 2012|website=hbr.org|publisher=Harvard Business Review|access-date=October 20, 2016}}</ref> Gibney left Founders Fund in December 2012.<ref>{{cite news |work= Tech Crunch |date= December 11, 2012 |author= Josh Constine |title= Founders Fund Partner Bruce Gibney Has Left The Firm |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/founders-fund-bruce-gibney/ |accessdate= January 17, 2017 }}</ref> He continued to make personal investments, though he made few since 2015, stating in a January 2016 speech in [[Zurich]] that he believes start-ups are richly valued and expressing concern that too many start-ups are remaining private for too long, creating misalignment of incentives between executives and employees and investors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldwebforum.ch/display/B2/Speakers+2016|title=World Web Forum (2016) |date=|website=worldwebforum.com|publisher=World Web Forum|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref>

== ''A Generation of Sociopaths'' ==
Gibney's first book, ''A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America'', linked American stagnation to the [[baby boomers]], characterizing the generation as being unusually prone to anti-social personality disorder, which Gibney believes unraveled the pro-social, pro-growth policies of mid-20th-century America.

In her review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]]–winning novelist [[Jane Smiley]] praised Gibney's \"wry, amusing style\", noting that \"he is at his best analysing the financial details of the various forms of national and environmental debt that our children and grandchildren will eventually have to pay.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/17/generation-sociopaths-review-trump-baby-boomers-ruined-world|title=A Generation of Sociopaths review – how Trump and other Baby Boomers ruined the world|last=Smiley|first=Jane|date=2017-05-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> She concluded that \"Gibney does convince me that those of us born between 1940 and 1965 (his definition) are a drag on the future.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/17/generation-sociopaths-review-trump-baby-boomers-ruined-world|title=A Generation of Sociopaths review – how Trump and other Baby Boomers ruined the world|last=Smiley|first=Jane|date=2017-05-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In her summer book list review for the ''[[Financial Times]]'', [[Merryn Somerset Webb]] called ''A Generation of Sociopaths'' \"convincing stuff. Look around you in the UK and you will see hints of the same thing: our own boomers aren't rushing to give up any of their goodies for the young. Anyone in any doubt need only ask a dinner party of them how they feel about capital gains tax on primary residences or worse, asking pensioners to help finance their own medical care by paying national insurance.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8dcceb14-67b4-11e7-9a66-93fb352ba1fe|title=We're going to hell in a handcart- but whose fault is it?|last=|first=|date=July 14, 2017|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-08-19}}</ref>

In his review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Dana Milbank]] wrote that although Gibney overstated his case concerning the Boomers, \"The core of Gibney's argument, that the boomers are guilty of 'generational plunder,' is spot-on.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/if-americas-messed-up-blame-it-on-the-boomers/2017/03/09/a6ccce16-eef8-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html|title=If America’s messed up, blame it on the boomers|last=Milbank|first=Dana|date=2017-03-09|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-10|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> ''[[Booklist]]'' described the book as \"informative, provocative, and entertaining\" in its review.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/A-Generation-of-Sociopaths-How-the-Baby-Boomers-Betrayed-America-Bruce-Cannon-Gibney/pid=8512314|title=Booklist Review: A Generation of Sociopaths|first=Raymond|last=Pun |work=Booklist Online|date=January 9, 2017|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called the book an \"endless, broadest-possible-brush harangue\" that has \"some points, all of which would have been better made without assigning damning agency to them: of course health care has to be restructured, and of course taxes have to be raised if the nation is to escape insolvency. His prescriptions on those fronts are sound, though some are surely controversial.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/bruce-cannon-gibney/a-generation-of-sociopaths/|title=Kirkus Review: A Generation of Sociopaths|work=Kirkus Reviews|date=January 3, 2017}}</ref>

'''Bruce Cannon Gibney''' (born February 16, 1976)<ref>[https://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/qa-a-gen-x-venture-capitalist-on-how-boomers-wrecked-america/ Q&A: A venture capitalist on how boomers wrecked America]</ref><ref>United States Public Records, 1970-2009 (California, 2002-2008)</ref> is an American writer and [[venture capital]]ist. He was one of the first investors at PayPal, and went on to work for PayPal founder [[Peter Thiel]]'s hedge fund Clarium and his venture capital company [[Founders Fund]]. His first book, ''A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America'', was published by [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] in 2017.

== Career ==
Gibney started investing when his [[Stanford University]] roommate [[Ken Howery]] co-founded [[PayPal]], the electronic payments company, and offered Gibney the chance to buy \"friends and family\" shares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avcj.com/avcj/profile/53100/profile-founders-funds-bruce-gibney|title=Profile: Founders Fund's Bruce Gibney|website=avcj.com|publisher=Asian Venture Capital Journal|last1=Birkwood|first1=Susannah|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}</ref> After investing in PayPal, Gibney worked as a litigator but was soon hired by [[Peter Thiel]] after Thiel sold PayPal to [[eBay]] in 2002. Gibney worked at Thiel's [[hedge fund]], Clarium, until 2008, making occasional private investments including in [[Palantir Technologies]] in 2005 and later in [[DeepMind]], which was acquired by [[Google]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind|title=Google buys UK artificial intelligence startup Deepmind for £400m|last=Gibbs|first=Samuel|date=January 27, 2014||newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref> for around $450 million in 2014. He then moved to [[Founders Fund]], a venture capital fund started by Thiel. Thiel and Founders Fund were the earliest outside investors in Facebook, [[SpaceX]], and Palantir, and made other investments including in [[Airbnb|AirBnB]], [[Lyft]], [[Spotify]], and Stemcentrx, which [[AbbVie Inc.|AbbVie]] acquired for $10 billion a few years after Founders Fund's investment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stemcentrx-acquired-by-abbvie-2016-4|title=A startup that just launched out of stealth a few months ago thinks it's found a way to treat cancer, and it just got bought for up to $10 billion|last=Ramsey|first=Lydia|date=April 28, 2016|website=businessinsider.com|publisher=Business Insider|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref>

Gibney wrote Founders Fund's controversial statement of ideology, ''What Happened to the Future?'', in 2011, which called for more aggressive investments in breakthrough technologies and became a widely cited article in the technology community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/11/28/no-death-no-taxes|title=No Death, No Taxes|last=Packer|first=George|date=November 28, 2011|website=newyorker.com|publisher=The New Yorker|access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/founders-fund-the-future-2011-7|title=Facebook Investor Wants Flying Cars, Not 140 Characters|last=Gobry|first=Pascal-Emmanuel|date=July 30, 2011|website=businessinsider.com|publisher=Business Insider|access-date=December 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/429690/why-we-cant-solve-big-problems/|title=Why We Can't Solve Big Problems|last=Pontin|first=Jason|date=October 24, 2012|website=redhnologyreview.com|publisher=MIT|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/01/our-favorite-tech-long-reads-of-2011/|title=Our favorite tech long reads of 2011|last=Kelly|first=Heather|date=January 1, 2012|website=venturebeat.com|publisher=Venture Beat|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref> He also wrote other articles about start-ups and technology and lectured on these subjects, as well as Silicon Valley’s \"libertarian problem\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/bruce-gibney/silicon-valleys-libertarian-problem.html|title=Silicon Valley's Libertarian Problem|first=Bruce|last=Gibney|date=August 13, 2012|website=Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blakemasters.com/post/22271192791/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-8-notes-essay|title=CS 183: Class 8 Notes|last=Masters|first=Blake|date=May 2, 2012|website=blakemasters.com|publisher=Blake Masters|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/entrepreneurship-is-really-risky-right.html|title=Entrepreneurship Is Really Risky, Right?|last=Stillman|first=Jessica|date=February 1, 2012|website=inc.com|publisher=Inc|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2012/05/four-things-to-get-right-when|title=Four Things to Get Right When Starting a Company|last=Gibney, Howery|first=Bruce, Ken|date=May 9, 2012|website=hbr.org|publisher=Harcard Business Review|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2012/01/the-hbr-list-of-audacious-ideas|title=The HBR List of Audacious Ideas|last=|first=|date=January–February 2012|website=hbr.org|publisher=Harvard Business Review|access-date=October 20, 2016}}</ref> Gibney left Founders Fund in December 2012.<ref>{{cite news |work= Tech Crunch |date= December 11, 2012 |author= Josh Constine |title= Founders Fund Partner Bruce Gibney Has Left The Firm |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/founders-fund-bruce-gibney/ |accessdate= January 17, 2017 }}</ref> He continued to make personal investments, though he made few since 2015, stating in a January 2016 speech in [[Zurich]] that he believes start-ups are richly valued and expressing concern that too many start-ups are remaining private for too long, creating misalignment of incentives between executives and employees and investors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldwebforum.ch/display/B2/Speakers+2016|title=World Web Forum (2016) |date=|website=worldwebforum.com|publisher=World Web Forum|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref>

== ''A Generation of Sociopaths'' ==
Gibney's first book, ''A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America'', linked American stagnation to the [[baby boomers]], characterizing the generation as being unusually prone to anti-social personality disorder, which Gibney believes unraveled the pro-social, pro-growth policies of mid-20th-century America.

In her review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]]–winning novelist [[Jane Smiley]] praised Gibney's \"wry, amusing style\", noting that \"he is at his best analysing the financial details of the various forms of national and environmental debt that our children and grandchildren will eventually have to pay.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/17/generation-sociopaths-review-trump-baby-boomers-ruined-world|title=A Generation of Sociopaths review – how Trump and other Baby Boomers ruined the world|last=Smiley|first=Jane|date=2017-05-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> She concluded that \"Gibney does convince me that those of us born between 1940 and 1965 (his definition) are a drag on the future.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/17/generation-sociopaths-review-trump-baby-boomers-ruined-world|title=A Generation of Sociopaths review – how Trump and other Baby Boomers ruined the world|last=Smiley|first=Jane|date=2017-05-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In her summer book list review for the ''[[Financial Times]]'', [[Merryn Somerset Webb]] called ''A Generation of Sociopaths'' \"convincing stuff. Look around you in the UK and you will see hints of the same thing: our own boomers aren't rushing to give up any of their goodies for the young. Anyone in any doubt need only ask a dinner party of them how they feel about capital gains tax on primary residences or worse, asking pensioners to help finance their own medical care by paying national insurance.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8dcceb14-67b4-11e7-9a66-93fb352ba1fe|title=We're going to hell in a handcart- but whose fault is it?|last=|first=|date=July 14, 2017|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-08-19}}</ref>

In his review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Dana Milbank]] wrote that although Gibney overstated his case concerning the Boomers, \"The core of Gibney's argument, that the boomers are guilty of 'generational plunder,' is spot-on.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/if-americas-messed-up-blame-it-on-the-boomers/2017/03/09/a6ccce16-eef8-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html|title=If America’s messed up, blame it on the boomers|last=Milbank|first=Dana|date=2017-03-09|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-10|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> ''[[Booklist]]'' described the book as \"informative, provocative, and entertaining\" in its review.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/A-Generation-of-Sociopaths-How-the-Baby-Boomers-Betrayed-America-Bruce-Cannon-Gibney/pid=8512314|title=Booklist Review: A Generation of Sociopaths|first=Raymond|last=Pun |work=Booklist Online|date=January 9, 2017|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called the book an \"endless, broadest-possible-brush harangue\" that has \"some points, all of which would have been better made without assigning damning agency to them: of course health care has to be restructured, and of course taxes have to be raised if the nation is to escape insolvency. His prescriptions on those fronts are sound, though some are surely controversial.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/bruce-cannon-gibney/a-generation-of-sociopaths/|title=Kirkus Review: A Generation of Sociopaths|work=Kirkus Reviews|date=January 3, 2017}}</ref>

== History ==
OpIndia was founded in 2014 by Rahul Raj and Kumar Kamal as a current affairs and news website. In October 2016, it was acquired by Kovai Media Private Limited, a [[Coimbatore]]-based company of [[T. V. Mohandas Pai]] that also owns the right-leaning magazine ''[[Swarajya (magazine)|Swarajya]].''<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/right-vs-wrong-arundhati-roy-mohandas-pai-funding-fake-news-busters-118040600594_1.html|title=Right vs Wrong: Arundhati Roy, Mohandas Pai funding fake news busters|last=Manish|first=Sai|date=2018-04-07|work=[[Business Standard]]|access-date=10 November 2019}}</ref> 

Raj left OpIndia over a disagreement with the site's editorial stance. OpIndia disassociated from Kovai Media and became a separate entity.<ref name=\"Tables Turn\">{{cite web|accessdate=2020-03-19|title=Tables Turn on Twitter's Hindutva Warriors, and It's the BJP Doing the Strong-Arming|first=Aleesha|last=Matharu|url=https://thewire.in/media/twitter-handles-bjp-free-speech-right-wing-media|website=[[The Wire (India)|The Wire]]}}</ref> [[Rahul Roushan]] was appointed the CEO of OpIndia,<ref>{{cite web |title=OpIndia CEO Rahul Roushan calls for mob violence, deletes tweet|url=https://www.altnews.in/opindia-ceo-rahul-roushan-calls-for-largescale-mindless-violence-deletes-tweet/|date=17 February 2019|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=[[Alt News]]}}</ref> and Nupur J Sharma became the editor.<ref name=\":2\" />

== Content ==
In a 2018 interview with the ''[[Business Standard]]'', Sharma stated that OpIndia is openly right-leaning and does not claim to be ideologically neutral.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/special/busting-fake-news-who-funds-whom/20180408.htm|title=Busting fake news: Who funds whom?|first=Sai|last=Manish|date=8 April 2018|website=[[Business Standard]]|language=en|access-date=2020-03-03|via=[[Rediff.com]]}}</ref> OpIndia has accused prominent media outlets – ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[India Today]]'', [[Scroll.in]], ''[[The Wire (India)|The Wire]]'', and others – of spreading [[fake news]] and leftist propaganda.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/01/03/fake-news-lies-muslim-bashing-and-ravish-kumar-inside-opindias-harrowing-world|title=Fake news, lies, Muslim bashing, and Ravish Kumar: Inside OpIndia's harrowing world|last=Kumar|first=Basant|date=3 January 2020|work=[[Newslaundry]]|accessdate=3 January 2020|language=en-UK}}</ref>

[[Fact checkers]] certified by the [[Poynter Institute]]'s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), including [[Alt News]] and Boom, have identified multiple instances in which OpIndia has propagated fake news.<ref name=\"Fake news\" />

== Reception ==
In May 2019, the IFCN rejected OpIndia's application to be accredited as a fact-checker.<ref name=\"ET IFCN\">{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/can-fact-checking-emerge-as-big-and-viable-business/articleshow/69210719.cms|title=Can fact-checking emerge as big and viable business?|last=Ananth|first=Venkat|date=2019-05-07|work=[[The Economic Times]]|access-date=10 November 2019}}</ref> While noting partial compliance on a number of categories, the IFCN rejected the application on grounds of political partisanship and lack of transparency, and raised concerns over questionable fact-checking methodologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/application/public/opindiacom/EED18C9F-C8B2-258A-BB43-7E90FA57C26C|title=Conclusions and recommendations on the application by OpIndia.com|last=Kaur|first=Kanchan|date=11 February 2019|website=[[International Fact-Checking Network]]|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190310013235/https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/application/public/opindiacom/EED18C9F-C8B2-258A-BB43-7E90FA57C26C|archive-date=10 March 2019|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> The rejection disqualified OpIndia from fact-checking contracts with web properties owned by [[Facebook]] and [[Google]].<ref name=\"ET IFCN\" /> In response, Sharma criticized the IFCN assessment and urged for acceptance of outlets with \"declared ideological leanings\".<ref name=\"ET IFCN\" />

After co-founder Raj departed OpIndia, he described the website as a \"blind mouthpiece\" of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] on [[Twitter]] in August 2019. Raj criticized Sharma, alleging that she and others \"started as [[Trolling|trolls]]\" and \"abuse and [[Victim playing|play victim card]] when questioned\".<ref name=\"Tables Turn\" />

== History ==
OpIndia was founded in 2014 by Rahul Raj and Kumar Kamal as a current affairs and news website. In October 2016, it was acquired by Kovai Media Private Limited, a [[Coimbatore]]-based company of [[T. V. Mohandas Pai]] that also owns the right-leaning magazine ''[[Swarajya (magazine)|Swarajya]].''<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/right-vs-wrong-arundhati-roy-mohandas-pai-funding-fake-news-busters-118040600594_1.html|title=Right vs Wrong: Arundhati Roy, Mohandas Pai funding fake news busters|last=Manish|first=Sai|date=2018-04-07|work=[[Business Standard]]|access-date=10 November 2019}}</ref> 

Raj left OpIndia over a disagreement with the site's editorial stance.

In a 2018 interview with the ''[[Business Standard]]'', Sharma stated that OpIndia is openly right-leaning and does not claim to be ideologically neutral.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/special/busting-fake-news-who-funds-whom/20180408.htm|title=Busting fake news: Who funds whom?|first=Sai|last=Manish|date=8 April 2018|website=[[Business Standard]]|language=en|access-date=2020-03-03|via=[[Rediff.com]]}}</ref> OpIndia has accused prominent media outlets – ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[India Today]]'', [[Scroll.in]], ''[[The Wire (India)|The Wire]]'', and others – of spreading [[fake news]] and leftist propaganda.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/01/03/fake-news-lies-muslim-bashing-and-ravish-kumar-inside-opindias-harrowing-world|title=Fake news, lies, Muslim bashing, and Ravish Kumar: Inside OpIndia's harrowing world|last=Kumar|first=Basant|date=3 January 2020|work=[[Newslaundry]]|accessdate=3 January 2020|language=en-UK}}</ref>

[[Fact checkers]] certified by the [[Poynter Institute]]'s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), including [[Alt News]] and Boom, have identified multiple instances in which OpIndia has propagated fake news.<ref name=\"Fake news\" />

After co-founder Raj departed OpIndia, he described the website as a \"blind mouthpiece\" of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] on [[Twitter]] in August 2019. Raj criticized Sharma, alleging that she and others \"started as [[Trolling|trolls]]\" and \"abuse and [[Victim playing|play victim card]] when questioned\".<ref name=\"Tables Turn\" />

ie=UTF8&redirect=true&condition=all</ref> which he sold on the streets of Southern
California. In 1976, the City of [[Laguna Beach, California]], denied Steffens a permit to sell his works within the
city limits, touching off brouhaha in the local press.<ref>Janice Brownfield, ''Reporter vs. Publisher''. Santa Ana, California: Alpenstock Publishing, 1986, pp. 46-47.</ref> Steffens went to court, seeking relief under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], but the court ruled in favor of the city. Steffens turned to writing a series of one-act plays-in-verse,
which were professionally produced as “Herod the Great: A Sequence of Pageants” by the Olympia Arts Ensemble
in Minneapolis in 1981 with [[Michael Yonkers]] in the title role. Noel Bredahl of the ''St. Paul Post-Dispatch'' hailed
the play as \"an awesome creation on the part of the playwright.<ref>Noel BreDahl (April 9, 1981). “What’s playing on area stages.” ''St. Paul Dispatch'', p. 3B.</ref> David Hawley, also of the ''St. Paul Post Dispatch'', wrote, “Steffens is a powerful, talented artist.\"<ref>David Hawley (April 6, 1981). “’Herod’ suffers from uncontrolled excess.” ''St. Paul Post-Dispatch'', p. 14A.</ref>

==Writing career==

Steffens has published more than fifty poems over the last forty years, receiving many awards along the way,
including the Emerging Voices Award presented by [[The Loft Literary Center]] in Minneapolis and the Lake Superior
Writing Competition Award sponsored by the [[Duluth Public Library]]. While working as a freelance proofreader
for [[Lucent Books]] in 1989, Steffens wrote his first nonfiction book for children, ''Animal Rights''. Over the next twenty-seven years, he wrote twenty-five more books for children and young adults, coauthored seven, and edited the 2004 anthology ''The Free Speech Movement''. His works have been praised by ''Booklist'', ''School Library Journal'', ''Kirkus Reviews'', and ''Children’s Literature''.

Steffens is a two-time recipient of the San Diego Book Award for Best Young Adult & Children's Nonfiction.

'''Dalton Ichiro Tanonaka''' (born June 13, 1954) is an American television executive. He has spent most of his career in Asia, receiving several international and U.S. awards for his journalism work. Tanonaka is also known for his community service, providing scholarships to deserving students and speaking  at schools and universities.<ref>{{harvnb|Tanonaka|1993}}, {{harvnb|Tanonaka|1994}}, {{harvnb|Tanonaka|1996}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Tanonaka was born in Kapaau, [[Kohala, Hawaii]], not far from the original statue of [[King Kamehameha I]]. He was raised in Honolulu on the island of Oahu, attending public schools through his graduation from [[Kalani High School]], where he played football and soccer. After working as a tour escort to \"grow up\" and save money, Tanonaka graduated from Mesa College (now [[Colorado Mesa University]]) in [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], in 1976 with an Associate in Arts degree, and [[Northern Illinois University]] in [[DeKalb, Illinois]], in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism.

==Career==
After TV and newspaper jobs at the ABC and NBC affiliates in Honolulu and the ''[[Honolulu Advertiser]]'', Tanonaka was recruited by Japan's public broadcaster [[NHK]] in 1990. He helped launch and was the anchor of \"Japan Business Today\", an internationally distributed daily program from Tokyo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2001/06/23/people/dalton-tanonaka/|title=Dalton Tanonaka|first=Vivienne|last=Kenrick|date=Jun 23, 2001|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019|via=Japan Times Online}}</ref>
After the NHK project ended in 1994, Tanonaka joined the launch team of the U.S. business channel [[CNBC Asia|CNBC in Asia]]. From regional headquarters in Chai Wan, Hong Kong, Tanonaka anchored daily news and feature programs including \"The NBC Asia Evening News\" and \"Money, Money, Money\".

When the operations of CNBC Asia was moved to Singapore in 1998, Tanonaka returned to Hawaii for a brief period. He was appointed Honolulu's director of economic development, where he served until resuming his journalism career in 1999. [[CNN International]] recruited him to its Asia headquarters in Hong Kong, where he anchored programs including \"BizAsia\", \"Asia Tonight\", and \"TalkAsia\".

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the U.S., Tanonaka asked to be released from his CNN contract and returned to Hawaii to make an attempt at public service. In [[Hawaii gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]], he ran unsuccessfully for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for [[Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii]], finishing second behind former [[Hawaii State Circuit Courts|Circuit Court]] judge [[Duke Aiona]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thegardenisland.com/news/dalton-tanonaka-running-for-republican-lt-governor-seat/article_fc8c41bf-c449-56d0-ad8e-3c18f185a32b.html|archiveurl=http://archive.today/20130821071826/http://thegardenisland.com/news/dalton-tanonaka-running-for-republican-lt-governor-seat/article_fc8c41bf-c449-56d0-ad8e-3c18f185a32b.html|url-status=dead|title=Dalton Tanonaka running for Republican lt. governor seat - Thegardenisland.com: News|accessdate=Apr 13, 2020}}</ref> Following a brief period as president of the [[Pacific Basin Economic Council]] (PBEC) based in Honolulu, Tanonaka ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2004.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/candidates/295076/</ref> During this campaign, allegations of illegalities were made by political opponents. Tanonaka cooperated with authorities, but after agreeing to plead guilty to technical violations, U.S. District Judge [[Helen Gillmor]] ordered him to spend 90 days in the [[Honolulu Federal Detention Center]] to \"send a message\" to the public.

In 2006, Tanonaka joined Indonesia's first 24-hour news channel [[Metro TV (Indonesia)|MetroTV]] in Jakarta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asiadreams.com/edisi/january-february/asia-inspiration/dalton-tanonaka.html|archiveurl=http://archive.today/20130821071818/http://asiadreams.com/edisi/january-february/asia-inspiration/dalton-tanonaka.html|url-status=dead|title=eams Magazine&#124; July - August 2013 &#124; Asia Dr|accessdate=Apr 13, 2020}}</ref>  He was tasked with creating a new international-standard English program for global distribution. \"Indonesia Now\" debuted in September 2006, and is seen on international networks such as Japan's NHK as well as live-streamed on the Internet at www.metrotvnews.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotvnews.com/indonesianow-beta/ |title=Indonesia Now Beta  |accessdate=August 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222145044/http://www.metrotvnews.com/indonesianow-beta/ |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }}</ref>

In 2010, Tanonaka teamed up with actress Rahayu \"Sara\" Saraswati for the weekly dialogue program \"TalkIndonesia\".  In 2011, he created \"ASEAN Today\", a monthly program done in partnership with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) Secretariat.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asean.org/news/asean-secretariat-news/item/asean-today-tv-program-debuts-globally |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730084014/http://www.asean.org/news/asean-secretariat-news/item/asean-today-tv-program-debuts-globally |archive-date=2013-07-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tanonaka was a regular columnist in the ''[[Jakarta Post]]'' \"Weekender\" magazine from its debut in 2007, moving to the ''[[Jakarta Globe]]'' in 2010.<ref>http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/dalton-tanonaka-despite-the-frustrations-35-things-to-love-about-life-in-indonesia/</ref> In January 2014, Tanonaka became CEO of \"[[The Indonesia Channel]],\" the country's first 24-hour all-English channel for global distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theindonesiachannel.com/|title=The Indonesia Channel|website=www.theindonesiachannel.com|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019}}</ref>

==Humanitarian work and activism==
Training professional journalists has been a regular part of Tanonaka's career. Under a program coordinated by the Asia-Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD), he has travelled to Iran, Pakistan and Mauritius to hold workshops in broadcasting standards and skills. The Tanonaka International Journalism Scholarship was named for Tanonaka's father Thomas, and given to deserving university students in Indonesia. Winners were handed cash grants and received living stipends in cities such as [[Yogyakarta]], [[Lampung]], and Jakarta, the most recent in June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cce-indonesia.org/Tanonaka_Scholarship.html|title=cce-indonesia.org|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019}}</ref> As a member of the [[Asian American Journalists Association]] (AAJA),{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Tanonaka created and initially endowed the AAJA Minoru Yasui Memorial Scholarship in memory of [[Minoru Yasui|the late civil rights advocate]]. It was first awarded in 1993 to promising male broadcast students to support and motivate interest in the field.

Tanonaka has also been involved in a variety of other charitable activities in Indonesia. In December 2006, he was the co-creator of the \"Beat The Bird Flu Concert\" in Jakarta, Indonesia, to spotlight prevention measures of the deadly virus. He secured MetroTV's commitment in airing public service announcements and a concert special. An ongoing environmental disaster in [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo, East Java]] prompted Tanonaka and friend Ron Mullers to hold a fund-raising event in 2007 for victims of [[Sidoarjo mud flow|an unstoppable mudflow]] that wiped out homes and businesses. After raising nearly $10,000 with the participation of Tanonaka's rock'n'roll band, the men went personally to the mudflow site to personally hand out packets of money directly to affected residents. Finally, to develop and promote Indonesian artists, Tanonaka created \"The Mister Moonlight Show\" in 2009, a live music event with Indonesian musicians and singers for five-star hotel venues. It is now in its fourth year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hotjakartaevent/|title=THE MISTER MOONLIGHT SHOW|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019}}</ref>

Tanonaka and Mullers led a community drive to erect a statue of a young Barack Obama in a park near the U.S. president's childhood home in Jakarta, Indonesia. It was unveiled in December 2009, and moved to its permanent location at Obama's elementary school in February 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8405314.stm|title=Indonesia unveils statue of Obama|date=Dec 10, 2009|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

'''Variations for piano''', Op. 27, is a [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] [[musical composition|piece]] for [[piano]] composed by [[Anton Webern]] in 1936. It consists of three movements:

{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman
|Sehr mäßig (Very moderate)
|Sehr schnell (Very fast)
|Ruhig fließend (Calmly flowing)
}}

Webern's only published work for solo piano, the Variations are one of his major instrumental works and a signal example of his late style.<ref name=\"Bailey 1998, 151\">Bailey 1998, 151.</ref> Webern dedicated the work to pianist [[Eduard Steuermann]].<ref>Webern 1937: \"Eduard Steuemann / gewidmet\" (on frontispiece).</ref> However, it was premiered (after months of coaching from Webern) by [[Peter Stadlen]] on 26 October 1937 in Vienna.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0eYMDtLL4X4C&pg=PA152&dq=Webern+26+October&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjh2Jange_nAhVXTxUIHUjKCJgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Webern%2026%20October&f=false] Bailey 1998 p 152</ref> Much later Stadlen produced the definitive interpretive edition of Op.27, published by [[Universal Edition]] in 1979.<ref>''Notes''(2nd Series), Vol 27 No 2, December 190, p 405-406</ref>

==History of composition==
By the early 1930s Webern was one of the composers and artists criticised by the [[Nazi Party]], which was rapidly gaining power. By 1934 Webern's [[Conductor (music)|conducting]] career, a major source of income for the composer, was practically over, and he earned his living by teaching composition to a few private pupils. Despite the considerable disadvantages this financial situation had, the lack of a stable job provided Webern with more time to compose.<ref name=\"Bailey 1998, 151\"/>

Opus 27 took Webern about a year to complete. The three movements were not composed in the order they appear in the work:<ref>Dates from: Bailey 1991, 452.</ref>
* Third movement: begun 14 October 1935, completed 8 July 1936
* First movement: begun 22 July 1936, completed 19 August 1936
* Second movement: begun 25 August 1936, completed 5 November 1936
The piece is the only work for piano solo that was published by the composer and assigned an opus number. It was also the last work by Webern to be published by [[Universal Edition]] during his lifetime.<ref>Bailey 1998, 152.</ref>

==Analysis==
===Structure===
All three movements of the work are 12-tone pieces based on the following row (as found at the beginning of the second movement<ref name=\"Nolan\"/>):

[[File:Webern - Piano Variations op. 27 tone row.png|thumb|center|550px|Principal forms of Webern's tone row from Variations for piano, op. 27, movement 2.<ref name=\"Nolan\">Nolan 1995, 49–50, though her 0 is G{{Music|sharp}}, and so she labels these two row forms P8 and I10.</ref> The first simultaneous pairing of row forms is P1 and R8, and as with the principal forms, each hexachord fills in a chromatic fourth, with B as the pivot (end of P1 and beginning of IR8), and thus linked by the prominent tritone in the center of the row {{audio|Webern - Piano Variations op. 27 tone row.mid|Play}}.<ref>Leeuw 2005, 158, for whom 0 = E{{Music|flat}}.</ref>]]

The work's title, ''Variations'', is ambiguous. In a letter dated 18 July, Webern wrote: \"The completed part is a variations movement; the whole will be a kind of 'Suite'\".<ref>Bailey 1991, 189.</ref> Only the third movement was completed at the time, and it is clearly [[Variation (music)|a set of variations]]. The form of the other two movements conforms to the \"[[Suite (music)|Suite]]\" plan: the first movement is a [[ternary form]], ABA, and the second is a [[binary form]]. However, to refer to an entire work by the form of its last movement is very unusual, and numerous attempts have been made to explain the title.<ref>Bailey 1991, 189&ndash;190.</ref>

Webern scholar Kathryn Bailey outlined three possible views on the structure of the piece. Webern's Variations may be considered any of these:<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 190\">Bailey 1991, 190.</ref>
# A three-movement sonata: [[sonata form]] &ndash; binary [[scherzo]] &ndash; variations
# A three-movement suite: ternary movement &ndash; binary movement &ndash; variations
# A set of variations, in which the first two movements have little connection to the third

One of the earliest explanations was offered by [[René Leibowitz]], who in 1948 described the first movement as a theme and two variations, the second movement as a theme with a single variation, and the third movement as five variations of yet another theme.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 190\"/> Willi Reich, a member of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s circle, described the work as a sonatina which begins with a set of variations (first movement) and ends with a sonata form (third movement). Reich claimed his explanation was identical to Webern's and stemmed from the two men's conversations, however, the authenticity of this claim has been questioned.<ref>Bailey 1991, 191.</ref> 

Yet another explanation was provided by Friedhelm Dōhl (who published Reich's analysis, but did not find it satisfactory), who viewed each of the fourteen phrases in the first movement as a variation of the prime/retrograde idea, and found the same structure in the second movement. Robert U. Nelson published a similar analysis in 1969.<ref>Nelson 1969.</ref> Finally, Kathryn Bailey's analysis suggests that the first movement is a sonata form, her ideas supported by Webern's own remarks in the original manuscript, published in 1979 by Peter Stadlen.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 192\">Bailey 1991, 192.</ref>

===Symmetry===
A particularly notable feature of Variations is [[symmetry]], which is featured throughout the work. Horizontal symmetry can be observed, for example, in successive phrases of the first movement: bars 1&ndash;18 comprise four phrases, each built from the normal row and its retrograde stated simultaneously, and the second half of the phrase is always a reverse of the first. Each phrase is therefore a [[palindrome]], though only the first pair of rows in the beginning of the movement is perfectly palindromic.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 192\"/> Vertical symmetry pervades the second movement, which is a [[Canon (music)|canon]]. The pitches are arranged around the pitch axis of A4. Each downward reaching interval is replicated exactly in the opposite direction.<ref>Bailey 1991, 262&ndash;264.</ref>

'''Variations for piano''', Op. 27, is a [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] [[musical composition|piece]] for [[piano]] composed by [[Anton Webern]] in 1936. It consists of three movements:

{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman
|Sehr mäßig (Very moderate)
|Sehr schnell (Very fast)
|Ruhig fließend (Calmly flowing)
}}

Webern's only published work for solo piano, the Variations are one of his major instrumental works and a signal example of his late style.<ref name=\"Bailey 1998, 151\">Bailey 1998, 151.</ref> Webern dedicated the work to pianist [[Eduard Steuermann]].<ref>Webern 1937: \"Eduard Steuemann / gewidmet\" (on frontispiece).</ref> However, it was premiered (after months of coaching from Webern) by [[Peter Stadlen]] on 26 October 1937 in Vienna.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0eYMDtLL4X4C&pg=PA152&dq=Webern+26+October&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjh2Jange_nAhVXTxUIHUjKCJgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Webern%2026%20October&f=false] Bailey 1998 p 152</ref> Much later Stadlen produced the definitive interpretive edition of Op.27, published by [[Universal Edition]] in 1979.<ref>''Notes''(2nd Series), Vol 27 No 2, December 190, p 405-406</ref>

==History of composition==
By the early 1930s Webern was one of the composers and artists criticised by the [[Nazi Party]], which was rapidly gaining power. By 1934 Webern's [[Conductor (music)|conducting]] career, a major source of income for the composer, was practically over, and he earned his living by teaching composition to a few private pupils. Despite the considerable disadvantages this financial situation had, the lack of a stable job provided Webern with more time to compose.<ref name=\"Bailey 1998, 151\"/>

Opus 27 took Webern about a year to complete. The three movements were not composed in the order they appear in the work:<ref>Dates from: Bailey 1991, 452.</ref>
* Third movement: begun 14 October 1935, completed 8 July 1936
* First movement: begun 22 July 1936, completed 19 August 1936
* Second movement: begun 25 August 1936, completed 5 November 1936
The piece is the only work for piano solo that was published by the composer and assigned an opus number. It was also the last work by Webern to be published by [[Universal Edition]] during his lifetime.<ref>Bailey 1998, 152.</ref>

==Analysis==
===Structure===
All three movements of the work are 12-tone pieces based on the following row (as found at the beginning of the second movement<ref name=\"Nolan\"/>):

[[File:Webern - Piano Variations op. 27 tone row.png|thumb|center|550px|Principal forms of Webern's tone row from Variations for piano, op. 27, movement 2.<ref name=\"Nolan\">Nolan 1995, 49–50, though her 0 is G{{Music|sharp}}, and so she labels these two row forms P8 and I10.</ref> The first simultaneous pairing of row forms is P1 and R8, and as with the principal forms, each hexachord fills in a chromatic fourth, with B as the pivot (end of P1 and beginning of IR8), and thus linked by the prominent tritone in the center of the row {{audio|Webern - Piano Variations op. 27 tone row.mid|Play}}.<ref>Leeuw 2005, 158, for whom 0 = E{{Music|flat}}.</ref>]]

The work's title, ''Variations'', is ambiguous. In a letter dated 18 July, Webern wrote: \"The completed part is a variations movement; the whole will be a kind of 'Suite'\".<ref>Bailey 1991, 189.</ref> Only the third movement was completed at the time, and it is clearly [[Variation (music)|a set of variations]]. The form of the other two movements conforms to the \"[[Suite (music)|Suite]]\" plan: the first movement is a [[ternary form]], ABA, and the second is a [[binary form]]. However, to refer to an entire work by the form of its last movement is very unusual, and numerous attempts have been made to explain the title.<ref>Bailey 1991, 189&ndash;190.</ref>

Webern scholar Kathryn Bailey outlined three possible views on the structure of the piece. Webern's Variations may be considered any of these:<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 190\">Bailey 1991, 190.</ref>
# A three-movement sonata: [[sonata form]] &ndash; binary [[scherzo]] &ndash; variations
# A three-movement suite: ternary movement &ndash; binary movement &ndash; variations
# A set of variations, in which the first two movements have little connection to the third

One of the earliest explanations was offered by [[René Leibowitz]], who in 1948 described the first movement as a theme and two variations, the second movement as a theme with a single variation, and the third movement as five variations of yet another theme.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 190\"/> Willi Reich, a member of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s circle, described the work as a sonatina which begins with a set of variations (first movement) and ends with a sonata form (third movement). Reich claimed his explanation was identical to Webern's and stemmed from the two men's conversations, however, the authenticity of this claim has been questioned.<ref>Bailey 1991, 191.</ref> 

Yet another explanation was provided by Friedhelm Dōhl (who published Reich's analysis, but did not find it satisfactory), who viewed each of the fourteen phrases in the first movement as a variation of the prime/retrograde idea, and found the same structure in the second movement. Robert U. Nelson published a similar analysis in 1969.<ref>Nelson 1969.</ref> Finally, Kathryn Bailey's analysis suggests that the first movement is a sonata form, her ideas supported by Webern's own remarks in the original manuscript, published in 1979 by Peter Stadlen.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 192\">Bailey 1991, 192.</ref>

===Symmetry===
A particularly notable feature of Variations is [[symmetry]], which is featured throughout the work. Horizontal symmetry can be observed, for example, in successive phrases of the first movement: bars 1&ndash;18 comprise four phrases, each built from the normal row and its retrograde stated simultaneously, and the second half of the phrase is always a reverse of the first. Each phrase is therefore a [[palindrome]], though only the first pair of rows in the beginning of the movement is perfectly palindromic.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 192\"/> Vertical symmetry pervades the second movement, which is a [[Canon (music)|canon]]. The pitches are arranged around the pitch axis of A4. Each downward reaching interval is replicated exactly in the opposite direction.<ref>Bailey 1991, 262&ndash;264.</ref>

==Biography==

Composer Andrew Staniland was born in [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], [[Alberta]], in 1977. His first instrument was the [[guitar]], and he began playing in [[Heavy metal music|heavy-metal]] bands as a young teen. Staniland began formal studies in jazz and arranging at Grant MacEwan Community College in Edmonton (now [[MacEwan University]]), where he also studied composition with Gordon Nicholson. He then studied [[classical guitar]] at the [[University of Lethbridge]], Alberta, before obtaining both a [[Master's degree|Master's]] and [[Doctorate]] degree in Composition from the [[University of Toronto]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicworks.ca/featured-article/profile/andrew-staniland-accelerates-toward-next-idea|title=Andrew Staniland accelerates toward the next idea|last=Bunce|first=Jonathan|date=|website=Musicworks magazine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

'''cmd.exe''' is the default [[command-line interpreter]] for [[OS/2]], [[eComStation]], [[Windows]], [[Windows CE]], and the [[ReactOS]] operating systems.  The name refers to its executable filename.  It is also commonly referred to as '''cmd''' or the '''Command Prompt''', referring to the default window title on Windows.  The implementations differ on the various systems but the behavior and basic set of commands is generally consistent.  {{mono|cmd.exe}} is the counterpart of {{mono|[[COMMAND.COM]]}} in [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] systems, and analogous to the [[Unix shell]]s used on [[Unix-like]] systems. The initial version of {{mono|cmd.exe}} for Windows NT was developed by Therese Stowell.<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\"/> On [[Windows CE .NET 4.2]],<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms879823(v%3dmsdn.10) Command Processor Shell (Windows CE .NET 4.2) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> [[Windows CE 5.0]]<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/aa453925%28v%3dmsdn.10%29 Command Processor Shell (Windows CE 5.0) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> and [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]]<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ee499728%28v%3dwinembedded.60%29 Command Processor Shell (Windows Embedded CE 6.0) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> it is also referred to as '''Command Processor Shell'''.

==Operation==
{{mono|cmd.exe}} interacts with the user through a [[command-line interface]]. On Windows, this interface is implemented through the [[Win32 console]]. {{mono|cmd.exe}} may take advantage of features available to native programs of its own platform. For example, on OS/2 and Windows, it can use real [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]] in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the [[standard error stream]]. ({{mono|COMMAND.COM}} uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.)

==Internal commands==

===Windows NT family===
The following list of [[Shell builtin|internal]] [[command (computing)|commands]] is supported by {{mono|cmd.exe}} on [[Windows NT]] and later:<ref>{{Cite book|author-last=Hill|author-first=Tim|title=Windows NT Shell Scripting|date=1998|publisher=[[Macmillan Inc.|Macmillan Technical Publishing]]|isbn=978-1578700479|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/windowsntshellsc0000hill}}</ref>

==Comparison with COMMAND.COM==
On Windows, {{mono|cmd.exe}} is mostly compatible with {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} but provides the following extensions over it:

* More detailed error messages than the blanket \"[[Bad command or file name]]\" (in the case of malformed commands) of {{mono|COMMAND.COM}}. In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The {{mono|[[help (command)|HELP]]}} command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.
* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history. (Under DOS this function was only available under [[DR DOS]] (through [[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]]) and later via a external component called {{mono|[[DOSKEY]]}}.)
* Adds [[command-line completion]] for file and folder paths.
* Treats the [[caret]] character ({{mono|^}}) as the [[escape character]]; the character following it is to be taken literally. There are special characters in {{mono|cmd.exe}} and {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} (e.g. \"{{mono|<}}\", \"{{mono|>}}\" and \"|\") that are meant to alter the behavior of the command line processor. The caret character forces the command line processor to interpret them literally.
* Supports delayed variable expansion with [[SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion]], allowing values of variables to be calculated at runtime instead of during parsing of script before execution (Windows 2000 and later), fixing DOS idioms that made using [[control structures]] hard and complex.<ref name=\"Delay\"/> The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode.

Internal commands have also been improved:

* The {{mono|[[DELTREE]]}} command was merged into the {{mono|[[RMDIR|RD]]}} command, as part of its {{mono|/S}} [[Switch (command line)|switch]].
* {{mono|SetLocal}} and {{mono|EndLocal}} commands limit the scope of changes to the environment. Changes made to the command line environment after {{mono|SetLocal}} commands are local to the [[batch file]]. {{mono|EndLocal}} command restores the previous settings.<ref name=\"SetLocal\"/>
* The {{mono|Call}} command allows subroutines within batch file. The {{mono|Call}} command in {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} only supports calling external batch files.
* File name parser extensions to the {{mono|Set}} command are comparable with [[C shell]].{{Elucidate|reason=|date=October 2015}}
* The {{mono|Set}} command can perform [[Expression Evaluation|expression evaluation]].
* An expansion of the {{mono|[[For loop|For]]}} command supports parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to file names.
* The new {{mono|[[PUSHD|PushD]]}} and {{mono|[[POPD|PopD]]}} commands provide access past navigated paths similar to \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons in a web browser or [[File Explorer]].
* The conditional {{mono|IF}} command can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons. (This was available in DR-DOS, but not in [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] or [[MS-DOS]].)

The initial version of {{mono|cmd.exe}} for Windows NT was developed by Therese Stowell.<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\"/> On [[Windows CE .NET 4.2]],<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms879823(v%3dmsdn.10) Command Processor Shell (Windows CE .NET 4.2) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> [[Windows CE 5.0]]<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/aa453925%28v%3dmsdn.10%29 Command Processor Shell (Windows CE 5.0) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> and [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]]<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ee499728%28v%3dwinembedded.60%29 Command Processor Shell (Windows Embedded CE 6.0) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> it is also referred to as '''Command Processor Shell'''.

==Operation==
{{mono|cmd.exe}} interacts with the user through a [[command-line interface]]. On Windows, this interface is implemented through the [[Win32 console]]. {{mono|cmd.exe}} may take advantage of features available to native programs of its own platform. For example, on OS/2 and Windows, it can use real [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]] in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the [[standard error stream]]. ({{mono|COMMAND.COM}} uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.)

==Internal commands==

==Comparison with COMMAND.COM==
On Windows, {{mono|cmd.exe}} is mostly compatible with {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} but provides the following extensions over it:

* More detailed error messages than the blanket \"[[Bad command or file name]]\" (in the case of malformed commands) of {{mono|COMMAND.COM}}. In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The {{mono|[[help (command)|HELP]]}} command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.
* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history. (Under DOS this function was only available under [[DR DOS]] (through [[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]]) and later via a external component called {{mono|[[DOSKEY]]}}.)
* Adds [[command-line completion]] for file and folder paths.
* Treats the [[caret]] character ({{mono|^}}) as the [[escape character]]; the character following it is to be taken literally. There are special characters in {{mono|cmd.exe}} and {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} (e.g. \"{{mono|<}}\", \"{{mono|>}}\" and \"|\") that are meant to alter the behavior of the command line processor. The caret character forces the command line processor to interpret them literally.
* Supports delayed variable expansion with [[SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion]], allowing values of variables to be calculated at runtime instead of during parsing of script before execution (Windows 2000 and later), fixing DOS idioms that made using [[control structures]] hard and complex.<ref name=\"Delay\"/> The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode.

Internal commands have also been improved:

* The {{mono|[[DELTREE]]}} command was merged into the {{mono|[[RMDIR|RD]]}} command, as part of its {{mono|/S}} [[Switch (command line)|switch]].
* {{mono|SetLocal}} and {{mono|EndLocal}} commands limit the scope of changes to the environment. Changes made to the command line environment after {{mono|SetLocal}} commands are local to the [[batch file]]. {{mono|EndLocal}} command restores the previous settings.<ref name=\"SetLocal\"/>
* The {{mono|Call}} command allows subroutines within batch file. The {{mono|Call}} command in {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} only supports calling external batch files.
* File name parser extensions to the {{mono|Set}} command are comparable with [[C shell]].{{Elucidate|reason=|date=October 2015}}
* The {{mono|Set}} command can perform [[Expression Evaluation|expression evaluation]].
* An expansion of the {{mono|[[For loop|For]]}} command supports parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to file names.
* The new {{mono|[[PUSHD|PushD]]}} and {{mono|[[POPD|PopD]]}} commands provide access past navigated paths similar to \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons in a web browser or [[File Explorer]].
* The conditional {{mono|IF}} command can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons. (This was available in DR-DOS, but not in [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] or [[MS-DOS]].)

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    

== Behavior ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. 
<br />
== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quraters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.  


Another adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities’ limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2). Awesome Fish Spotlight: The Ornate Butterflyfish: Reef Builders: The Reef and Saltwater Aquarium Blog. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other obligate corallivores (coral-eating) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.

Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.  


Another adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities’ limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2). Awesome Fish Spotlight: The Ornate Butterflyfish: Reef Builders: The Reef and Saltwater Aquarium Blog. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other obligate corallivores (coral-eating) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.

'''Camarero''' (1951–1956) was a [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse that was raised and raced in [[Puerto Rico]]. He was the winner of 73 races, including the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]] in Puerto Rico. Camarero is notable for setting the current world record of the most [[Winning streak (sports)|consecutive wins]] for a [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse at 56 in a series of races between April 1953 and August 1955. 

==Background==
Cameraro was sired by Thirteen who was a son of 1938 Travers Stakes winner Thanksgiving. His name translates to \"waiter\" in Spanish. Camarero was a small bay colt that weighed 750 pounds and stood only 14 hands high. His male line traced to [[The Finn]] and he was bred and owned by prominent [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] newspaper man Jose Coll-Vidal.<ref name= \"ny55\">New York Times. Aug 9, 1955</ref>

As per Puerto Rican racetrack regulation, [[Parimutuel betting|prohibitive]] favorites are not allowed to be wagered on, which meant that for most of Camarero's winning streak no on-track bets were taken.<ref name=\"ny55\"/> Camarero was the first winner of Puerto Rico's [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]], winning the Governor's Cup, Jose de Diego Stakes and Primavera Stakes in 1954, undefeated.<ref>[http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/weekly-feature-articles/2005/August/05/Camareros-record-of-56-consecutive-wins-turns-50.aspx Thoroughbred Times. Aug. 5, 2005]</ref><ref>Jorge Colón Delgado. ''Camarero en punta.'' 1998.</ref> As well according to Hall of Fame Jockey Angel Cordero Jr \"he[Cameraro] means horse racing.\"

== History ==
On July 19, 1951, Camarera foaled a black colt with four white pasterns who was named Sabrosito. Through Coll-Vidal's foal-sharing agreement with breeder Luis Rechani-Agrait, the colt was bred in Rechani-Agrait's name and foaled on his farm.

A year later, Coll-Vidal and trainer Pablo Suarez first saw Sabrosito, whom Coll-Vidal said looked like a small donkey. However, Suarez insisted that Coll-Vidal take the well-bred yearling. He did and renamed the colt Camarero in honor of his dam. 

At the beginning of the 1950s, Puerto Rico's economy had declined and many lived in poverty. By 1953, when Camarero began his career, only two tracks were operating.

Camarero made his first start on April 14, 1953, at two furlongs at Quintana racetrack and won by three lengths. On May 17, he won his second race; seven days later, he won his first stakes race in front-running fashion by four lengths. On July 17, he won his fifth race when he took the six-furlong Luis Mu-oz Rivera Stakes by seven lengths. From August 23 to October 23, Camarero won eight more races, including another stakes. His jockey in his first 13 victories was Juan Diaz-Andino.

Coll-Vidal had come close to Kincsem's record with two other horses, Cofresi and Condado, who won 49 and 44 consecutive races, respectively. He believed that for Camarero to break the record, he would have to replace the colt's jockey with leading rider Mateo Matos.

In 1952, Matos exercised horses at Aqueduct for Horatio Luro but returned to Puerto Rico. When he was first asked to ride the undefeated Camarero, Matos declined. \"He wanted to sleep in peace,\" wrote Jorge Col-n-Delgado in his book about Camarero. Assured that Coll-Vidal would not replace him if he lost aboard Camarero, Matos agreed to ride the colt.



Camarero recorded five more victories to finish his two-year-old campaign in 1953 with 18 wins. On New Year's Day in 1954, he won the 61/2-furlong Governor's Cup while carrying 120 pounds, eight more than the second-highest-weighted horse in the race. The Governor's Cup was the first leg of Puerto Rico's Triple Crown, which was established in 1951 and had not yet been won.

The next two legs were the 11/16-mile Jose de Diego Stakes and the 11/8-mile Primavera Stakes. Camarero could carry high weight, but it was unknown if he could race successfully at longer distances. On January 11, 1954, he won his 20th race by ten lengths while going 11/16 miles, eliminating any doubts of his ability.

On April 17, Camarero won the Jose de Diego Stakes for his 28th win. On May 9, carrying 15 pounds more than any other rival, he won the Primavera Stakes to become Puerto Rico's first Triple Crown winner. On his actual third birthday, Camarero won his 32nd race and set a 61/2-furlong track record. After winning another race ten days later, he earned a well-deserved rest.

Fans grew eager for Camarero's return, and on October 24, he easily won his next start. He finished his three-year-old campaign with his 37th victory on December 19 and was selected Horse of the Year.

Racing's popularity in Puerto Rico increased with each of Camarero's victories. By the end of 1954, track attendance had jumped 25%. People who had never been interested in the sport paid attention to Camarero while he chased Kincsem's record.

\"Some people would say that he was allowed to win, but that wasn't true,\" Cordero recalled. \"He used to win because he was the best. The only thing was he never raced against horses [that were not bred] in Puerto Rico. But in my opinion, he could have competed against any horse at the time. ... But since he was chasing the world record, they kept racing him against Puerto Rican-bred horses.\"

At four in 1955, Camarero won nine more races from January 6 to April 22 and was just nine wins away from the record. During the first 32 racing days of the year, total handle increased a whopping 64% compared with the previous year. Everyone in Puerto Rico was talking about Camarero and chanting \"Camarero en punta,\" or \"Camarero up front,\" a phrase used by track announcer Pito Rivera-Monge when the colt headed to victory.

Camarero kept winning. On July 18, 1955, he won his 54th race to tie Kincsem's record. The entire country waited to see when he would race again, and the interest was covered in the New York Times. Finally, it was announced that Camarero would go for the world record on August 7 in the fourth race at Quintana.

At the start of the 6 1/2-furlong race, the eight horses broke alertly. Matos held Camarero back and looked for a good spot to place him. By the half-mile pole, Matos let Camarero go, and the colt responded to win by six lengths.

\"With 600 meters to go, Camarero was already ahead and I could hear the people screaming,\" Matos recalled in Col-n-Delgado's book. \"Coming down the stretch, I knew I had the race. Camarero started to pull away easily. The closer that we would get to the finish line, the louder the people would get in the stands. It was incredible. When I passed the finish line, I remember telling myself, 'We did it. We finally did it.' \"

Fans shouted and hugged each other, while others cried. Elsewhere, the thousands of people who listened to the race on the radio began to rejoice, and many went out into the streets where drivers honked their horns. All of Puerto Rico celebrated.

\"When Camarero established the world record, I was at the track that day,\" Cordero said. \"I was too young to fully understand what was going on. All I knew was that Camarero was our champion and that every time he raced, he would win.\"Camarero was scheduled to rest following his world-record victory, but for some reason returned ten days later and scored his 56th consecutive victory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thoroughbredtimes.com/weekly-feature-articles/2005/August/05/Camareros-record-of-56-consecutive-wins-turns-50.aspx/|title=Camarero's record of 56 consecutive wins turns 50|last=Pe-a-Rivera Owens|first=Carlos and Amy|date=|website=|url-status=archived|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531060030/http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/weekly-feature-articles/2005/August/05/Camareros-record-of-56-consecutive-wins-turns-50.aspx|archive-date=31 May 2010|access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref>

However the win was short lived as 9 days later he would taste defeat for the first time in his career. he would go on to race 20 more times after his first defeat loosing another 3 times but managing to win another 17 more times. By the end of his career he had won 73 times out of 77 starts with two seconds and zero thirds.

==Death==
Camarero would run his final race on August 26,1956 only a day later he died on August 27, 1956 of an intestinal obstruction.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/113727854 New York Times. \"Camarero, Star racer, dies.\" Aug. 28, 1956]</ref> His gravesite at Hipodromo Quintana was visited by 10,000 fans during the funeral ceremony.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.santaisabelpr.com/camarero-campeon-del-hipismo-boricua/| title=Camarero, campeón del hipismo boricua| author=Melvin Rivera Velázquez| language=Spanish| date=2008-06-01| accessdate=2009-12-04}}</ref>

'''George Luther Stearns''' (January 8, 1809 – April 9, 1867) was an American industrialist and [[merchant]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts]], as well as an [[abolitionist]] and a noted recruiter of black soldiers for the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
George L. Stearns was born in [[Medford, Massachusetts]] on January 8, 1809, the eldest son and second child of Luther and Mary (Hall) Stearns. His paternal immigrant ancestor, Isaac Sterne, arrived in Salem on June 12, 1630, from [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. He had sailed to the new colony with [[John Winthrop]], a future governor, and Sir [[Richard Saltonstall]], among others. Isaac Sterne moved to Watertown, located along the [[Charles River]], where he died in 1671. What became known as the American Stearns family (note spelling variation) grew, with branches moving northward and westward. For decades men typically worked as farmers, teachers, and clergymen.

Stearns' father, Luther Stearns, was born on February 17, 1770, the eldest of five children born to Captain Josiah Stearns, a soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He commanded a company of 50 men from [[Lunenburg, Massachusetts]]. Luther Stearns had entered Dartmouth College at age seventeen but transferred, graduating from Harvard in 1791. He worked as a tutor at Harvard and eventually studied medicine. He later became an obstetrician. He was honored in 1811 by an honorary degree from Harvard. <!-- Nice trick! Honorary degrees do not constitute certification for medical specialties -->

After getting his practice started, Luther married Mary Hall of [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], on December 29, 1799; she was 16 years old, not an uncommon marrying age for women. They settled in  Medford, Massachusetts to be closer to her relatives. They had three children together: Elizabeth Hall, George Luther, and Henry Laurens Stearns (named after the American Ambassador of that name, a distant relative). The senior Stearns later opened a private preparatory school for boys in Medford; many students came from the American South and the West Indies.

Stearns died of pneumonia on April 27, 1820, when son George was eleven years old. To earn money, young George sometimes tended the locks on the Middlesex Canal in town.  At the age of 15, he entered the workforce to support his mother and sisters.

===Career===
In early life, Stearns was engaged in the business of ship-chandlery. After a prosperous career, he began the manufacture of sheet and pipe-lead, doing business in [[Boston]] and residing in Medford.

He married Mary Elizabeth Preston on October 12, 1843. They met through acquaintances, including her father Warren Preston, a probate judge in Norridgewock, Maine; and [[Lydia Maria Child]], an American abolitionist and women's rights activist. 

Before voting in the Missouri and Kansas territories about the future of slavery in each jurisdiction, Stearns was one of the chief financiers of the [[Emigrant Aid Company]]. It supported the settlement of [[Kansas]] by antislavery homesteaders. He identified with the [[Abolitionism in the United States|antislavery cause]], and became a [[Free Soil Party|Free-soiler]] in 1848. 

He also established the Medford station of the [[Underground Railroad]] to help escaped refugee slaves to gain freedom (some continued to Canada, which had abolished slavery). Stearns was one of the \"[[Secret Six]]\" who aided [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in [[Kansas]], and financially supported him for the raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]]; Brown was executed for this attack. Stearns had owned the pikes and 200 [[Sharps rifle]]s taken to  Harpers Ferry by Brown and his followers. Following Brown's arrest, Stearns briefly fled to Canada but returned to Medford to face inquiry following Brown's execution.

Soon after the opening of the Civil War, Stearns advocated the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. Massachusetts Governor [[John Albion Andrew|John Andrew]] asked Stearns to recruit the first two Northern state-sponsored black [[infantry]] [[regiment]]s. He contributed strongly to recruiting the enlistees of the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry|54th]] and [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|55th Massachusetts]] regiments and the 5th cavalry. 

Stearns was commissioned as [[Major (United States)|major]] through the recommendation of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. Later he also enlisted  black soldiers for the [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]]US Colored Troops from [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], and [[Tennessee]]. He is credited with recruiting more than 13,000 African Americans.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} He also established schools for their children and found work for their families while the men served in the army.

Stearns founded the ''Nation'', ''Commonwealth'', and ''Right Way'' newspapers for the dissemination of his ideas.<ref>James M. McPherson, ''The Struggle for Equality: Abolitionists and the Negro in the Civil War and Reconstruction'', Princeton University Press, 1964/new edition 2015</ref> 

After President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January 1863, Stearns worked tirelessly for the [[civil rights]] of African Americans. Among his many admirers and friends were [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Charles Sumner]], [[Frederick Douglass]], and President [[Andrew Johnson]]. He also helped to found the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], a federal organization designed to support emancipated African Americans ([[freedmen]]) in the South after the end of the war.


==Death and legacy==
Stearns died of pneumonia in New York City, New York on April 9, 1867. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] gave the [http://www.authorama.com/cambridge-sketches-16.html eulogy] at his funeral at the [[Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford and the Osgood House|First Parish Church in Medford]] ([[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]). 

Writer [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] published a poem in honor of Stearns in the May 1867 edition of the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'', entitled \"G.L.S.\" It read, in part:<ref name=\"stearns\">{{cite book|last1=Stearns|first1=Frank Preston|title=The Life and Public Services of George Luther Stearns|year=1907|page=385-390|url=https://archive.org/stream/publicservices00stearich/publicservices00stearich_djvu.txt|access-date=23 July 2016}}</ref> 

\"No duty could overtask him;<br />
No need his will outrun;<br />

\"A man who asked not to be great;<br />

In 1897, a monument was erected on Boston Common to commemorate Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]] and the 54th Massachusetts regiment he commanded. Together with 20 of his men, he was killed in July 1863 in the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]]. At the dedication of the monument, [[Booker T. Washington]], President of [[Tuskegee Institute]], made an address. He attributed the organization and recruiting of the US Colored Troops to be the work \"of John A. Andrew ... and that of George L. Stearns, who, with hidden generosity and a great sweet heart, helped to turn the darkest hour into day, and in doing so freely gave service, fortune and life itself to the cause which this day commemorates.\" <ref>\"Exercises at the Dedication of the Monument to Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the Fifty-fourth Regiment of Massachusetts Infantry,\" May 31, 1897, Boston: Boston City Council, 1897.</ref>

Following this commemoration, Joseph H. Smith, a veteran of the 54th, started a movement to have a commemorative tablet placed in the Statehouse at Boston, to honor Major Stearns' services. The resolution was passed in 1897 to place a tablet in Memorial Hall or other establishments in Boston and signed by Governor Wolcott. It was not enacted at the time, but a second resolution was passed in 1901 by the Massachusetts legislature to authorize it. 

The tablet is entitled: \"In Memoriam George Luther Stearns\" and says, in part:<ref name=\"Stearns\"/>

A merchant of Boston
Who illustrated in his life and character
The nobility and generosity of 
''Citizenship''
Giving his life and fortune for 
The overthrow of slavery and the 
Preservation of ''free'' institutions
To his unresting devotion and unfailing hope
Massachusetts owes
The fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth regiments 
of colored infantry, 
And the federal government ten thousand
colored troops, 
At a critical moment in the great war. 
In the darkest hour of the republic
His faith in the ''people'' never wavered.
