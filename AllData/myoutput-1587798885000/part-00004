Traders who trade in this capacity with the motive of profit are therefore [[speculator]]s. The methods of quick trading contrast with the long-term trades underlying [[buy and hold]] and [[value investing]] strategies. Day traders exit positions before the market closes to avoid unmanageable risks and negative price gaps between one day's close and the next day's price at the open. \n\nDay traders generally use [[Margin (finance)|margin]] leverage; in the United States, [[Regulation T]] permits an initial maximum leverage of 2:1, but many brokers will permit 4:1 leverage as long as the leverage is reduced to 2:1 or less by the end of the trading day. In the United States, people who make more than 3 day trades per week are termed [[pattern day trader]]s and are required to maintain $25,000 in equity in their accounts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.finra.org/investors/day-trading-margin-requirements-know-rules | title=Day-Trading Margin Requirements: Know the Rules | publisher=[[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]]}}</ref> Since margin interest is typically only charged on overnight balances, the trader may pay no interest fees for the margin benefit, though still running the risk of a [[Margin calls|margin call]]. Margin interest rates are usually based on the [[broker's call]].\n\nSome of the more commonly day-traded [[financial instrument]]s are [[stock]]s, [[Option (finance)|options]], [[currency|currencies]], [[contracts for difference]], and a host of [[futures contract]]s such as [[Stock|equity]] index futures, [[interest rate]] futures, currency futures and commodity futures.\n\nDay trading was once an activity that was exclusive to financial firms and professional speculators. Many day traders are [[bank]] or investment firm employees working as specialists in [[Equity (finance)|equity]] investment and [[Investment management|fund management]]. Day trading gained popularity after the deregulation of commissions in the United States in 1975, the advent of [[electronic trading platform]]s in the 1990s, and with the stock price volatility during the [[dot-com bubble]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/1999/08/23/editorial3.html | title=Daytrading: Wall Street's latest, riskiest get-rich scheme | first=Gunther | last=Karger | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=August 22, 1999}}</ref>\n\nSome day traders use an intra-day technique known as [[Scalping (trading)|scalping]] that usually has the trader holding a position for a few minutes or only seconds.\n\n==Profit and risks==\nBecause of the nature of [[Leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] and the rapid returns that are possible, day trading results can range from extremely profitable to extremely unprofitable, and high-risk profile [[Trader (finance)|traders]] can generate either huge percentage returns or huge percentage losses.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/011705.asp | title=Day Trading: An Introduction | publisher=[[Investopedia]]}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the high profits (and losses) that day trading makes possible, these traders are sometimes portrayed as \"[[bandit]]s\" or \"[[Gambling|gamblers]]\" by other investors.\n\nDay trading is risky, especially if any of the following is present while trading:\n\n* trading a loser's game/system rather than a game that's at least winnable,\n* inadequate risk capital with the accompanying excess stress of having to \"survive\",\n* incompetent money management (i.e. executing trades poorly).<ref name=SECrisks>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/daytrading.htm |title=U.S. government warning about the dangers of day trading }}</ref><ref name=StockTwitsEdge>{{cite book |author=[[Today Trader|Gomez, Steve; Lindloff, Andy]] |title=Change is the only Constant.

In addition, brokers usually allow bigger [[Margin (finance)|margin]] for day traders. In the United States for example, while the initial margin required to hold a stock position overnight are 50% of the stock's value due to [[Regulation T]], many brokers allow pattern day trader accounts to use levels as low as 25% for intraday purchases. This means a day trader with the legal minimum $25,000 in their account can buy $100,000 (4x leverage) worth of stock during the day, as long as half of those positions are exited before the market close. Because of the high risk of margin use, and of other day trading practices, a day trader will often have to exit a losing position very quickly, in order to prevent a greater, unacceptable loss, or even a disastrous loss, much larger than their original investment, or even larger than their total assets.\n\n==History==\nOriginally, the most important U.S. stocks were traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. A trader would contact a [[stockbroker]], who would relay the order to a specialist on the floor of the NYSE. These specialists would each make markets in only a handful of stocks. The specialist would match the purchaser with another broker's seller; write up physical tickets that, once processed, would effectively transfer the stock; and relay the information back to both brokers. Before 1975, brokerage commissions were fixed at 1% of the amount of the trade, i.e. to purchase $10,000 worth of stock cost the buyer $100 in commissions and same 1% to sell. Meaning that to profit trades had to make ''over'' 2\n% to make any real gain.\n\nOne of the first steps to make day trading of shares potentially profitable was the change in the commission scheme. In 1975, the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) made fixed commission rates illegal, giving rise to discount brokers offering much reduced commission rates.\n\n===Financial settlement===\n[[Settlement (financial)|Financial settlement]] periods used to be much longer: Before the early 1990s at the [[London Stock Exchange]], for example, stock could be paid for up to 10 working days after it was bought, allowing traders to buy (or sell) shares at the beginning of a settlement period only to sell (or buy) them before the end of the period hoping for a rise in price. This activity was identical to modern day trading, but for the longer duration of the settlement period. But today, to reduce market risk, the settlement period is typically [[T+2|two working days]]. Reducing the settlement period reduces the likelihood of [[Default (finance)|default]], but was impossible before the advent of electronic ownership transfer.\n\n===Electronic communication networks===\nThe systems by which stocks are traded have also evolved, the second half of the twentieth century having seen the advent of [[electronic communication network]]s (ECNs). These are essentially large proprietary computer networks on which brokers can list a certain amount of securities to sell at a certain price (the asking price or \"ask\") or offer to buy a certain amount of securities at a certain price (the \"bid\").\n\nECNs and exchanges are usually known to traders by a three- or four-letter designators, which identify the ECN or exchange on Level II stock screens. The first of these was [[Instinet]] (or \"inet\"), which was founded in 1969 as a way for major institutions to bypass the increasingly cumbersome and expensive NYSE, and to allow them to trade during hours when the exchanges were closed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instinet.com/about-instinet/history.html|title=Instinet - A Nomura Company {{!}} History|website=www.instinet.com|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> Early ECNs such as Instinet were very unfriendly to small investors, because they tended to give large institutions better prices than were available to the public. This resulted in a fragmented and sometimes illiquid market.\n\nThe next important step in facilitating day trading was the founding in 1971 of [[NASDAQ]]&mdash;a virtual stock exchange on which orders were transmitted electronically. Moving from paper share certificates and written share registers to \"dematerialized\" shares, traders used computerized trading and registration that required not only extensive changes to legislation but also the development of the necessary technology: online and real time systems rather than batch; electronic communications rather than the postal service, telex or the physical shipment of computer tapes, and the development of secure cryptographic algorithms.\n\nThese developments heralded the appearance of \"[[market maker]]s\": the NASDAQ equivalent of a NYSE specialist. A market maker has an inventory of stocks to buy and sell, and simultaneously offers to buy and sell the same stock. Obviously, it will offer to sell stock at a higher price than the price at which it offers to buy. This difference is known as the \"spread\". The market maker is indifferent as to whether the stock goes up or down, it simply tries to constantly buy for less than it sells. A persistent trend in one direction will result in a loss for the market maker, but the strategy is overall positive (otherwise they would exit the business). Today there are about 500 firms who participate as market makers on ECNs, each generally making a market in four to forty different stocks. Without any legal obligations, market makers were free to offer smaller spreads on [[electronic communication network]]s than on the [[NASDAQ]]. A small investor might have to pay a $0.25 spread (e.g. he might have to pay $10.50 to buy a share of stock but could only get $10.25 for selling it), while an institution would only pay a $0.05 spread (buying at $10.40 and selling at $10.35).\n\n===SOES===\nFollowing the 1987 stock market crash, the SEC adopted \"Order Handling Rules\" which required market makers to publish their best bid and ask on the NASDAQ.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/39038914|title=Man Vs. Machine: How the Crash of '87 Gave Birth To High-Frequency Trading|last=CNBC|first=Scott Patterson, {{!}}Special to|date=2010-09-13|website=www.cnbc.com|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> Another reform made was the \"[[Small-order execution system]]\", or \"SOES\", which required market makers to buy or sell, immediately, small orders (up to 1000 shares) at the market maker's listed bid or ask. The design of the system gave rise to arbitrage by a small group of traders known as the \"SOES bandits\", who made sizable profits buying and selling small orders to market makers by anticipating price moves before they were reflected in the published inside bid/ask prices. The SOES system ultimately led to trading facilitated by software instead of market makers via ECNs.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/1998/06/01/story2.html | title=Got $50,000 extra? Put it in day trading | first=Robert | last=Goldfield | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=May 31, 1998}}</ref>\n\n===Before the bubble===\nIn the late 1990s, existing ECNs began to offer their services to small investors. New ECNs arose, most importantly Archipelago ([[NYSE Arca]]) [[Instinet]], [[SuperDot]], and [[Island ECN]]. Archipelago eventually became a stock exchange and in 2005 was purchased by the NYSE. \n\n[[Electronic trading platform]]s were created and commissions plummeted. An online trader in 2005 might have bought $300,000 worth of stock at a commission of less than $10, compared to the $3,000 commission the trader would have paid in 1974. Moreover, the trader was able in 2005 to buy the stock almost instantly and got it at a cheaper price.\n\nThis combination of factors has made day trading in stocks and stock derivatives (such as [[Exchange-traded fund|ETF]]s) possible. The low commission rates allow an individual or small firm to make a large number of trades during a single day. The liquidity and small spreads provided by ECNs allow an individual to make near-instantaneous trades and to get favorable pricing.\n\n===Technology bubble (1997\u20132000)===\nThe ability for individuals to day trade coincided with the extreme [[bull market]] in technological issues from 1997 to early 2000, known as the [[dot-com bubble]]. From 1997 to 2000, the NASDAQ rose from 1200 to 5000. Many naive investors with little market experience made huge profits buying these stocks in the morning and selling them in the afternoon, at 400% [[Margin (finance)|margin]] rates.\n\nIn March 2000, this bubble burst, and a large number of less-experienced day traders began to lose money as fast, or faster, than they had made during the buying frenzy. The NASDAQ crashed from 5000 back to 1200; many of the less-experienced traders went broke, although obviously it was possible to have made a fortune during that time by [[short selling]] or playing on volatility.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2002/02/11/focus3.html | title=It's back to day jobs for most Internet 'day traders' | first=David | last=Nakashima | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=February 11, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp|title=Dotcom Bubble Definition|last=Hayes|first=Adam|website=Investopedia|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nIn parallel to stock trading, starting at the end of the 1990s, several new [[market maker]] firms provided foreign exchange and derivative day trading through [[electronic trading platform]]s. These allowed day traders to have instant access to decentralised markets such as forex and global markets through derivatives such as [[contracts for difference]]. Most of these firms were based in the UK and later in less restrictive jurisdictions, this was in part due to the regulations in the US prohibiting this type of [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] trading. These firms typically provide trading on margin allowing day traders to take large position with relatively small capital, but with the associated increase in risk. The [[retail foreign exchange trading]] became popular to day trade due to its liquidity and the 24-hour nature of the market.\n\n==Techniques==\nThe following are several basic [[trading strategies]] by which day traders attempt to make profits. In addition, some day traders also use [[contrarian investing]] strategies (more commonly seen in [[algorithmic trading]]) to trade specifically against irrational behavior from day traders using the approaches below. It is important for a trader to remain flexible and adjust  techniques to match changing market conditions.<ref name=Gomez2009>{{cite journal |author=[[Today Trader|Gomez, Steve]] |title=Adapting To Change |date=October 2009 |journal=[[SFO Magazine]] |url=http://www.traderplanet.com/articles/view/164866-adapting-to-change/ |accessdate=2013-10-17 }} (republished on Trader Planet, 2013)</ref>\n\nSome of these approaches require [[short selling]] stocks; the trader borrows stock from his broker and sells the borrowed stock, hoping that the price will fall and he will be able to purchase the shares at a lower price, thus keeping the difference as their profit. There are several technical problems with short sales - the broker may not have shares to lend in a specific issue, the broker can call for the return of its shares at any time, and some restrictions are imposed in America by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] on short-selling (see [[uptick rule]] for details). Some of these restrictions (in particular the uptick rule) don't apply to trades of stocks that are actually shares of an [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF).\n\n=== Trend following ===\n{{main|Trend following}}\n\n[[Trend following]], a strategy used in all trading time-frames, assumes that [[financial instrument]]s which have been rising steadily will continue to rise, and vice versa with falling. The trend follower buys an instrument which has been rising, or [[short selling|short sells]] a falling one, in the expectation that the trend will continue. \n\n===Contrarian investing===\n{{main|Contrarian investing}}\n\n[[Contrarian investing]] is a [[market timing]] strategy used in all trading time-frames. It assumes that [[financial instrument]]s that have been rising steadily will reverse and start to fall, and vice versa. The contrarian trader buys an instrument which has been falling, or short-sells a rising one, in the expectation that the trend will change.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contrarian.asp | title=Contrarian | first=JAMES | last=CHEN | publisher=[[Investopedia]] | date=March 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Range trading ===\n{{main|Swing trading}}\n\nRange trading, or range-bound trading, is a trading style in which stocks are watched that have either been rising off a support price or falling off a [[resistance price]]. That is, every time the stock hits a high, it falls back to the low, and vice versa. Such a stock is said to be \"trading in a range\", which is the opposite of trending.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingrange.asp | title=Trading Range | first=JAMES | last=CHEN | publisher=[[Investopedia]] | date=May 4, 2018}}</ref> The range trader therefore buys the stock at or near the low price, and sells (and possibly [[short selling|short sells]]) at the high. A related approach to range trading is looking for moves outside of an established range, called a [[Breakout (technical analysis)|breakout]] (price moves up) or a breakdown (price moves down), and assume that once the range has been broken prices will continue in that direction for some time.\n\n=== Scalping ===\n{{main|scalping (trading)}}\n\n[[Scalping (trading)|Scalping]] was originally referred to as spread trading. Scalping is a trading style where small price gaps created by the bid\u2013ask spread are exploited by the speculator. It normally involves establishing and liquidating a position quickly, usually within minutes or even seconds.\n\nScalping highly liquid instruments for off-the-floor day traders involves taking quick profits while minimizing risk (loss exposure).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/scalping.asp|title=Scalping: Small Quick Profits Can Add Up|last=Norris|first=Emily|website=Investopedia|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> It applies technical analysis concepts such as over/under-bought, support and resistance zones as well as trendline, trading channel to enter the market at key points and take quick profits from small moves. The basic idea of scalping is to exploit the inefficiency of the market when volatility increases and the trading range expands. Scalpers also use the \"fade\" technique. When stock values suddenly rise, they short sell securities that seem overvalued.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.daytradetheworld.com/trading-blog/what-type-of-trader-are-you/ | title=Type of Day Trader | publisher=DayTradeTheWorld}}</ref>\n\n===Rebate trading===\nRebate trading is an equity trading style that uses ECN rebates as a primary source of profit and revenue. Most ECNs charge commissions to customers who want to have their orders filled immediately at the best prices available, but the ECNs ''pay'' commissions to buyers or sellers who \"add liquidity\" by placing limit orders that create \"market-making\" in a security. Rebate traders seek to make money from these rebates and will usually maximize their returns by trading low priced, high volume stocks. This enables them to trade more shares and contribute more liquidity with a set amount of capital, while limiting the risk that they will not be able to exit a position in the stock.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-wall-streets-latest-trading-scam-that-costs-you-billions-2009-7 | title=The Latest Wall Street Trading Scam That Costs You Billions | first=Henry | last=Blodget | authorlink=Henry Blodget | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===News playing===\n{{main|trading the news}}\nThe basic strategy of news playing is to buy a stock which has just announced good news, or [[short (finance)|short sell]] on bad news. Such events provide enormous volatility in a stock and therefore the greatest chance for quick profits (or losses). Determining whether news is \"good\" or \"bad\" must be determined by the price action of the stock, because the market reaction may not match the tone of the news itself. This is because rumors or estimates of the event (like those issued by market and industry analysts) will already have been circulated before the official release, causing prices to move in anticipation. The price movement caused by the official news will therefore be determined by how good the news is relative to the market's expectations, not how good it is in absolute terms.\n\n===Price action===\n[[Price action trading]] relies on technical analysis but does not rely on conventional indicators. These traders rely on a combination of price movement, chart patterns, volume, and other raw market data to gauge whether or not they should take a trade. This is seen as a \"simplistic\" and \"minimalist\" approach to trading but is not by any means easier than any other trading methodology. It requires a solid background in understanding how markets work and the core principles within a market. However, the benefit for this methodology is that it is effective in virtually any market (stocks, foreign exchange, futures, gold, oil, etc.).\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\nIt is estimated that more than 75% of stock trades in United States are generated by [[algorithmic trading]] or [[high-frequency trading]]. The increased use of algorithms and quantitative techniques has led to more competition and smaller profits.<ref>{{cite news | first=Charles | last=Duhigg | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/23/business/worldbusiness/23iht-trading.3647885.html | title=Artificial intelligence applied heavily to picking stocks - Business - International Herald Tribune | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 23, 2006 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Algorithmic trading is used by banks and hedge funds as well as retail traders.  Retail traders can choose to buy a commercially available [[Automated trading system|Automated trading systems]] or to develop their own automatic trading software.\n\n==Cost==\n===Commission===\n[[Commission (remuneration)|Commissions]] for [[Direct access trading|direct-access brokers]] are calculated based on volume. The more shares traded, the cheaper the commission. The average commission per trade is roughly $5 per round trip (getting in and out of a position). While a retail broker might charge $7 or more per trade regardless of the trade size, a typical direct-access broker may charge anywhere from $0.01 to $0.0002 per share traded (from $10 down to $.20 per 1000 shares), or $0.25 per futures contract. A scalper can cover such costs with even a minimal gain.\n\n===Spread===\n{{Main|Bid\u2013ask spread}}\nThe numerical difference between the bid and ask prices is referred to as the bid\u2013ask spread. Most worldwide markets operate on a [[bid-ask]]-based system.\n\nThe '''ask''' prices are immediate execution (market) prices for '''quick buyers''' (ask takers) while '''bid''' prices are for '''quick sellers''' (bid takers). If a trade is executed at quoted prices, closing the trade immediately without queuing would always cause a loss because the bid price is always less than the ask price at any point in time.  \n\nThe bid\u2013ask spread is two sides of the same coin. The spread can be viewed as trading bonuses or costs according to different parties and different strategies. On one hand, traders who do NOT wish to queue their order, instead paying the market price, pay the spreads (costs). On the other hand, traders who wish to queue and wait for execution receive the spreads (bonuses). Some day trading strategies attempt to capture the spread as additional, or even the only, profits for successful trades.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/spread-bid-and-ask-spread-1031392|title=Large Bid and Ask Spreads in Day Trading Explained|last=Milton|first=Adam|website=The Balance|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===Market data===\n[[Market data]] is necessary for day traders to be competitive. A real-time data feed requires paying fees to the respective stock exchanges, usually combined with the broker's charges; these fees are usually very low compared to the other costs of trading. The fees may be waived for promotional purposes or for customers meeting a minimum monthly volume of trades. Even a moderately active day trader can expect to meet these requirements, making the basic data feed essentially \"free\". In addition to the raw market data, some traders purchase more advanced data feeds that include historical data and features such as scanning large numbers of stocks in the live market for unusual activity. Complicated analysis and charting software are other popular additions. These types of systems can cost from tens to hundreds of dollars per month to access.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/100714/vital-importance-choosing-right-day-trading-software.asp | title=Choosing the Right Day-Trading Software | first=SHOBHIT | last=SETH | publisher=[[Investopedia]] | date=February 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Regulations and restrictions==\n\n===Pattern day trader===\n{{main|Pattern day trader}}\nIn addition, in the United States, the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] and SEC further restrict the entry by means of \"pattern day trader\" amendments. [[Pattern day trader]] is a term defined by the SEC to describe any [[trader (finance)|trader]] who buys and sells a particular security in the same trading day (day trades), and does this four or more times in any five consecutive business day period. A pattern day trader is subject to special rules, the main rule being that in order to engage in pattern day trading in a margin account, the trader must maintain an equity balance of at least $25,000. It is important to note that this requirement is only for day traders using a margin account.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.finra.org/investors/highlights/day-traders-mind-your-margin | title=Day Traders: Mind Your Margin | publisher=[[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]]}}</ref>\n\n==Profitability==\n\nA 2019 research paper looked at the performance of individual day traders in the Brazilian equity futures market.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3423101 | title=Day Trading for a Living?| publisher=SSRN|ssrn=3423101| last1=Chague| first1=Fernando| last2=De-Losso| first2=Rodrigo| last3=Giovannetti| first3=Bruno}}</ref> Based on trading records from 2012 to 2017, they conclude that day trading is almost uniformly unprofitable.

Day trading gained popularity after the deregulation of commissions in the United States in 1975, the advent of [[electronic trading platform]]s in the 1990s, and with the stock price volatility during the [[dot-com bubble]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/1999/08/23/editorial3.html | title=Daytrading: Wall Street's latest, riskiest get-rich scheme | first=Gunther | last=Karger | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=August 22, 1999}}</ref>\n\nSome day traders use an intra-day technique known as [[Scalping (trading)|scalping]] that usually has the trader holding a position for a few minutes or only seconds.\n\n==Profit and risks==\nBecause of the nature of [[Leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] and the rapid returns that are possible, day trading results can range from extremely profitable to extremely unprofitable, and high-risk profile [[Trader (finance)|traders]] can generate either huge percentage returns or huge percentage losses.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/011705.asp | title=Day Trading: An Introduction | publisher=[[Investopedia]]}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the high profits (and losses) that day trading makes possible, these traders are sometimes portrayed as \"[[bandit]]s\" or \"[[Gambling|gamblers]]\" by other investors.\n\nDay trading is risky, especially if any of the following is present while trading:\n\n* trading a loser's game/system rather than a game that's at least winnable,\n* inadequate risk capital with the accompanying excess stress of having to \"survive\",\n* incompetent money management (i.e. executing trades poorly).<ref name=SECrisks>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/daytrading.htm |title=U.S. government warning about the dangers of day trading }}</ref><ref name=StockTwitsEdge>{{cite book |author=[[Today Trader|Gomez, Steve; Lindloff, Andy]] |title=Change is the only Constant.

In addition, brokers usually allow bigger [[Margin (finance)|margin]] for day traders. In the United States for example, while the initial margin required to hold a stock position overnight are 50% of the stock's value due to [[Regulation T]], many brokers allow pattern day trader accounts to use levels as low as 25% for intraday purchases. This means a day trader with the legal minimum $25,000 in their account can buy $100,000 (4x leverage) worth of stock during the day, as long as half of those positions are exited before the market close. Because of the high risk of margin use, and of other day trading practices, a day trader will often have to exit a losing position very quickly, in order to prevent a greater, unacceptable loss, or even a disastrous loss, much larger than their original investment, or even larger than their total assets.\n\n==History==\nOriginally, the most important U.S. stocks were traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. A trader would contact a [[stockbroker]], who would relay the order to a specialist on the floor of the NYSE. These specialists would each make markets in only a handful of stocks. The specialist would match the purchaser with another broker's seller; write up physical tickets that, once processed, would effectively transfer the stock; and relay the information back to both brokers. Before 1975, brokerage commissions were fixed at 1% of the amount of the trade, i.e. to purchase $10,000 worth of stock cost the buyer $100 in commissions and same 1% to sell. Meaning that to profit trades had to make ''over'' 2\n% to make any real gain.\n\nOne of the first steps to make day trading of shares potentially profitable was the change in the commission scheme. In 1975, the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) made fixed commission rates illegal, giving rise to discount brokers offering much reduced commission rates.\n\n===Financial settlement===\n[[Settlement (financial)|Financial settlement]] periods used to be much longer: Before the early 1990s at the [[London Stock Exchange]], for example, stock could be paid for up to 10 working days after it was bought, allowing traders to buy (or sell) shares at the beginning of a settlement period only to sell (or buy) them before the end of the period hoping for a rise in price. This activity was identical to modern day trading, but for the longer duration of the settlement period. But today, to reduce market risk, the settlement period is typically [[T+2|two working days]]. Reducing the settlement period reduces the likelihood of [[Default (finance)|default]], but was impossible before the advent of electronic ownership transfer.\n\n===Electronic communication networks===\nThe systems by which stocks are traded have also evolved, the second half of the twentieth century having seen the advent of [[electronic communication network]]s (ECNs). These are essentially large proprietary computer networks on which brokers can list a certain amount of securities to sell at a certain price (the asking price or \"ask\") or offer to buy a certain amount of securities at a certain price (the \"bid\").\n\nECNs and exchanges are usually known to traders by a three- or four-letter designators, which identify the ECN or exchange on Level II stock screens. The first of these was [[Instinet]] (or \"inet\"), which was founded in 1969 as a way for major institutions to bypass the increasingly cumbersome and expensive NYSE, and to allow them to trade during hours when the exchanges were closed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instinet.com/about-instinet/history.html|title=Instinet - A Nomura Company {{!}} History|website=www.instinet.com|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> Early ECNs such as Instinet were very unfriendly to small investors, because they tended to give large institutions better prices than were available to the public. This resulted in a fragmented and sometimes illiquid market.\n\nThe next important step in facilitating day trading was the founding in 1971 of [[NASDAQ]]&mdash;a virtual stock exchange on which orders were transmitted electronically. Moving from paper share certificates and written share registers to \"dematerialized\" shares, traders used computerized trading and registration that required not only extensive changes to legislation but also the development of the necessary technology: online and real time systems rather than batch; electronic communications rather than the postal service, telex or the physical shipment of computer tapes, and the development of secure cryptographic algorithms.\n\nThese developments heralded the appearance of \"[[market maker]]s\": the NASDAQ equivalent of a NYSE specialist. A market maker has an inventory of stocks to buy and sell, and simultaneously offers to buy and sell the same stock. Obviously, it will offer to sell stock at a higher price than the price at which it offers to buy. This difference is known as the \"spread\". The market maker is indifferent as to whether the stock goes up or down, it simply tries to constantly buy for less than it sells. A persistent trend in one direction will result in a loss for the market maker, but the strategy is overall positive (otherwise they would exit the business). Today there are about 500 firms who participate as market makers on ECNs, each generally making a market in four to forty different stocks. Without any legal obligations, market makers were free to offer smaller spreads on [[electronic communication network]]s than on the [[NASDAQ]]. A small investor might have to pay a $0.25 spread (e.g. he might have to pay $10.50 to buy a share of stock but could only get $10.25 for selling it), while an institution would only pay a $0.05 spread (buying at $10.40 and selling at $10.35).\n\n===SOES===\nFollowing the 1987 stock market crash, the SEC adopted \"Order Handling Rules\" which required market makers to publish their best bid and ask on the NASDAQ.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/39038914|title=Man Vs. Machine: How the Crash of '87 Gave Birth To High-Frequency Trading|last=CNBC|first=Scott Patterson, {{!}}Special to|date=2010-09-13|website=www.cnbc.com|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> Another reform made was the \"[[Small-order execution system]]\", or \"SOES\", which required market makers to buy or sell, immediately, small orders (up to 1000 shares) at the market maker's listed bid or ask. The design of the system gave rise to arbitrage by a small group of traders known as the \"SOES bandits\", who made sizable profits buying and selling small orders to market makers by anticipating price moves before they were reflected in the published inside bid/ask prices. The SOES system ultimately led to trading facilitated by software instead of market makers via ECNs.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/1998/06/01/story2.html | title=Got $50,000 extra? Put it in day trading | first=Robert | last=Goldfield | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=May 31, 1998}}</ref>\n\n===Before the bubble===\nIn the late 1990s, existing ECNs began to offer their services to small investors. New ECNs arose, most importantly Archipelago ([[NYSE Arca]]) [[Instinet]], [[SuperDot]], and [[Island ECN]]. Archipelago eventually became a stock exchange and in 2005 was purchased by the NYSE. \n\n[[Electronic trading platform]]s were created and commissions plummeted. An online trader in 2005 might have bought $300,000 worth of stock at a commission of less than $10, compared to the $3,000 commission the trader would have paid in 1974. Moreover, the trader was able in 2005 to buy the stock almost instantly and got it at a cheaper price.\n\nThis combination of factors has made day trading in stocks and stock derivatives (such as [[Exchange-traded fund|ETF]]s) possible. The low commission rates allow an individual or small firm to make a large number of trades during a single day. The liquidity and small spreads provided by ECNs allow an individual to make near-instantaneous trades and to get favorable pricing.\n\n===Technology bubble (1997\u20132000)===\nThe ability for individuals to day trade coincided with the extreme [[bull market]] in technological issues from 1997 to early 2000, known as the [[dot-com bubble]]. From 1997 to 2000, the NASDAQ rose from 1200 to 5000. Many naive investors with little market experience made huge profits buying these stocks in the morning and selling them in the afternoon, at 400% [[Margin (finance)|margin]] rates.\n\nIn March 2000, this bubble burst, and a large number of less-experienced day traders began to lose money as fast, or faster, than they had made during the buying frenzy. The NASDAQ crashed from 5000 back to 1200; many of the less-experienced traders went broke, although obviously it was possible to have made a fortune during that time by [[short selling]] or playing on volatility.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2002/02/11/focus3.html | title=It's back to day jobs for most Internet 'day traders' | first=David | last=Nakashima | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=February 11, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp|title=Dotcom Bubble Definition|last=Hayes|first=Adam|website=Investopedia|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nIn parallel to stock trading, starting at the end of the 1990s, several new [[market maker]] firms provided foreign exchange and derivative day trading through [[electronic trading platform]]s. These allowed day traders to have instant access to decentralised markets such as forex and global markets through derivatives such as [[contracts for difference]]. Most of these firms were based in the UK and later in less restrictive jurisdictions, this was in part due to the regulations in the US prohibiting this type of [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] trading. These firms typically provide trading on margin allowing day traders to take large position with relatively small capital, but with the associated increase in risk. The [[retail foreign exchange trading]] became popular to day trade due to its liquidity and the 24-hour nature of the market.\n\n==Techniques==\nThe following are several basic [[trading strategies]] by which day traders attempt to make profits. In addition, some day traders also use [[contrarian investing]] strategies (more commonly seen in [[algorithmic trading]]) to trade specifically against irrational behavior from day traders using the approaches below. It is important for a trader to remain flexible and adjust  techniques to match changing market conditions.<ref name=Gomez2009>{{cite journal |author=[[Today Trader|Gomez, Steve]] |title=Adapting To Change |date=October 2009 |journal=[[SFO Magazine]] |url=http://www.traderplanet.com/articles/view/164866-adapting-to-change/ |accessdate=2013-10-17 }} (republished on Trader Planet, 2013)</ref>\n\nSome of these approaches require [[short selling]] stocks; the trader borrows stock from his broker and sells the borrowed stock, hoping that the price will fall and he will be able to purchase the shares at a lower price, thus keeping the difference as their profit. There are several technical problems with short sales - the broker may not have shares to lend in a specific issue, the broker can call for the return of its shares at any time, and some restrictions are imposed in America by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] on short-selling (see [[uptick rule]] for details). Some of these restrictions (in particular the uptick rule) don't apply to trades of stocks that are actually shares of an [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF).\n\n=== Trend following ===\n{{main|Trend following}}\n\n[[Trend following]], a strategy used in all trading time-frames, assumes that [[financial instrument]]s which have been rising steadily will continue to rise, and vice versa with falling. The trend follower buys an instrument which has been rising, or [[short selling|short sells]] a falling one, in the expectation that the trend will continue. \n\n===Contrarian investing===\n{{main|Contrarian investing}}\n\n[[Contrarian investing]] is a [[market timing]] strategy used in all trading time-frames. It assumes that [[financial instrument]]s that have been rising steadily will reverse and start to fall, and vice versa. The contrarian trader buys an instrument which has been falling, or short-sells a rising one, in the expectation that the trend will change.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contrarian.asp | title=Contrarian | first=JAMES | last=CHEN | publisher=[[Investopedia]] | date=March 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Range trading ===\n{{main|Swing trading}}\n\nRange trading, or range-bound trading, is a trading style in which stocks are watched that have either been rising off a support price or falling off a [[resistance price]]. That is, every time the stock hits a high, it falls back to the low, and vice versa. Such a stock is said to be \"trading in a range\", which is the opposite of trending.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingrange.asp | title=Trading Range | first=JAMES | last=CHEN | publisher=[[Investopedia]] | date=May 4, 2018}}</ref> The range trader therefore buys the stock at or near the low price, and sells (and possibly [[short selling|short sells]]) at the high. A related approach to range trading is looking for moves outside of an established range, called a [[Breakout (technical analysis)|breakout]] (price moves up) or a breakdown (price moves down), and assume that once the range has been broken prices will continue in that direction for some time.\n\n=== Scalping ===\n{{main|scalping (trading)}}\n\n[[Scalping (trading)|Scalping]] was originally referred to as spread trading. Scalping is a trading style where small price gaps created by the bid\u2013ask spread are exploited by the speculator. It normally involves establishing and liquidating a position quickly, usually within minutes or even seconds.\n\nScalping highly liquid instruments for off-the-floor day traders involves taking quick profits while minimizing risk (loss exposure).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/scalping.asp|title=Scalping: Small Quick Profits Can Add Up|last=Norris|first=Emily|website=Investopedia|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> It applies technical analysis concepts such as over/under-bought, support and resistance zones as well as trendline, trading channel to enter the market at key points and take quick profits from small moves. The basic idea of scalping is to exploit the inefficiency of the market when volatility increases and the trading range expands. Scalpers also use the \"fade\" technique. When stock values suddenly rise, they short sell securities that seem overvalued.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.daytradetheworld.com/trading-blog/what-type-of-trader-are-you/ | title=Type of Day Trader | publisher=DayTradeTheWorld}}</ref>\n\n===Rebate trading===\nRebate trading is an equity trading style that uses ECN rebates as a primary source of profit and revenue. Most ECNs charge commissions to customers who want to have their orders filled immediately at the best prices available, but the ECNs ''pay'' commissions to buyers or sellers who \"add liquidity\" by placing limit orders that create \"market-making\" in a security. Rebate traders seek to make money from these rebates and will usually maximize their returns by trading low priced, high volume stocks. This enables them to trade more shares and contribute more liquidity with a set amount of capital, while limiting the risk that they will not be able to exit a position in the stock.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-wall-streets-latest-trading-scam-that-costs-you-billions-2009-7 | title=The Latest Wall Street Trading Scam That Costs You Billions | first=Henry | last=Blodget | authorlink=Henry Blodget | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===News playing===\n{{main|trading the news}}\nThe basic strategy of news playing is to buy a stock which has just announced good news, or [[short (finance)|short sell]] on bad news. Such events provide enormous volatility in a stock and therefore the greatest chance for quick profits (or losses). Determining whether news is \"good\" or \"bad\" must be determined by the price action of the stock, because the market reaction may not match the tone of the news itself. This is because rumors or estimates of the event (like those issued by market and industry analysts) will already have been circulated before the official release, causing prices to move in anticipation. The price movement caused by the official news will therefore be determined by how good the news is relative to the market's expectations, not how good it is in absolute terms.\n\n===Price action===\n[[Price action trading]] relies on technical analysis but does not rely on conventional indicators. These traders rely on a combination of price movement, chart patterns, volume, and other raw market data to gauge whether or not they should take a trade. This is seen as a \"simplistic\" and \"minimalist\" approach to trading but is not by any means easier than any other trading methodology. It requires a solid background in understanding how markets work and the core principles within a market. However, the benefit for this methodology is that it is effective in virtually any market (stocks, foreign exchange, futures, gold, oil, etc.).\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\nIt is estimated that more than 75% of stock trades in United States are generated by [[algorithmic trading]] or [[high-frequency trading]]. The increased use of algorithms and quantitative techniques has led to more competition and smaller profits.<ref>{{cite news | first=Charles | last=Duhigg | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/23/business/worldbusiness/23iht-trading.3647885.html | title=Artificial intelligence applied heavily to picking stocks - Business - International Herald Tribune | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 23, 2006 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Algorithmic trading is used by banks and hedge funds as well as retail traders.  Retail traders can choose to buy a commercially available [[Automated trading system|Automated trading systems]] or to develop their own automatic trading software.\n\n==Cost==\n===Commission===\n[[Commission (remuneration)|Commissions]] for [[Direct access trading|direct-access brokers]] are calculated based on volume. The more shares traded, the cheaper the commission. The average commission per trade is roughly $5 per round trip (getting in and out of a position). While a retail broker might charge $7 or more per trade regardless of the trade size, a typical direct-access broker may charge anywhere from $0.01 to $0.0002 per share traded (from $10 down to $.20 per 1000 shares), or $0.25 per futures contract. A scalper can cover such costs with even a minimal gain.\n\n===Spread===\n{{Main|Bid\u2013ask spread}}\nThe numerical difference between the bid and ask prices is referred to as the bid\u2013ask spread. Most worldwide markets operate on a [[bid-ask]]-based system.\n\nThe '''ask''' prices are immediate execution (market) prices for '''quick buyers''' (ask takers) while '''bid''' prices are for '''quick sellers''' (bid takers). If a trade is executed at quoted prices, closing the trade immediately without queuing would always cause a loss because the bid price is always less than the ask price at any point in time.  \n\nThe bid\u2013ask spread is two sides of the same coin. The spread can be viewed as trading bonuses or costs according to different parties and different strategies. On one hand, traders who do NOT wish to queue their order, instead paying the market price, pay the spreads (costs). On the other hand, traders who wish to queue and wait for execution receive the spreads (bonuses). Some day trading strategies attempt to capture the spread as additional, or even the only, profits for successful trades.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/spread-bid-and-ask-spread-1031392|title=Large Bid and Ask Spreads in Day Trading Explained|last=Milton|first=Adam|website=The Balance|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===Market data===\n[[Market data]] is necessary for day traders to be competitive. A real-time data feed requires paying fees to the respective stock exchanges, usually combined with the broker's charges; these fees are usually very low compared to the other costs of trading. The fees may be waived for promotional purposes or for customers meeting a minimum monthly volume of trades. Even a moderately active day trader can expect to meet these requirements, making the basic data feed essentially \"free\". In addition to the raw market data, some traders purchase more advanced data feeds that include historical data and features such as scanning large numbers of stocks in the live market for unusual activity. Complicated analysis and charting software are other popular additions. These types of systems can cost from tens to hundreds of dollars per month to access.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/100714/vital-importance-choosing-right-day-trading-software.asp | title=Choosing the Right Day-Trading Software | first=SHOBHIT | last=SETH | publisher=[[Investopedia]] | date=February 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Regulations and restrictions==\n\n===Pattern day trader===\n{{main|Pattern day trader}}\nIn addition, in the United States, the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] and SEC further restrict the entry by means of \"pattern day trader\" amendments. [[Pattern day trader]] is a term defined by the SEC to describe any [[trader (finance)|trader]] who buys and sells a particular security in the same trading day (day trades), and does this four or more times in any five consecutive business day period. A pattern day trader is subject to special rules, the main rule being that in order to engage in pattern day trading in a margin account, the trader must maintain an equity balance of at least $25,000. It is important to note that this requirement is only for day traders using a margin account.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.finra.org/investors/highlights/day-traders-mind-your-margin | title=Day Traders: Mind Your Margin | publisher=[[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]]}}</ref>\n\n==Profitability==\n\nA 2019 research paper looked at the performance of individual day traders in the Brazilian equity futures market.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3423101 | title=Day Trading for a Living?| publisher=SSRN|ssrn=3423101| last1=Chague| first1=Fernando| last2=De-Losso| first2=Rodrigo| last3=Giovannetti| first3=Bruno}}</ref> Based on trading records from 2012 to 2017, they conclude that day trading is almost uniformly unprofitable.
