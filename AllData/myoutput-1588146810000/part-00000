[[Thomas Erskine Perry|Sir Thomas Erskine Perry]], the then Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Judicature at Bombay]], would deliver lectures on law after court hours. These classes were held on a very informal basis and were attended only by a select group.\n\nHowever, it was not till Sir Perry left for [[England]] in 1852, that a conscious effort was made to collect funds in order to institute a chair in Jurisprudence at the [[Elphinstone Institution]], the Perry Professorship of Jurisprudence. In 1855, Dr. R. T. Reid (first Judge of the Small Causes Court, Bombay) was appointed as the first Perry Professor of Jurisprudence and the Government Law School, as it was then called, was established at the Elphinstone Institution. The Government Law School has been affiliated with the [[University of Bombay]] since 1860. Government Law College, Mumbai is one of the premier law institutes of India.\n\n===Full time institution===\nThe name Government Law School was changed to Government Law College in 1925. It was only in 1938 that the college was converted into a full-time institution. After this change of status, the Government of Bombay decided to allocate a plot, west of [[Churchgate railway station]] for the Government Law College building. The college today stands at this location.\n\n==Academic Profile==\nAffiliated to the Mumbai University, the Government Law College follows the semester system, and provides the 5-year integrated BLS-LLB as well as the 3-year LLB course. \n\nThe 5-year course consists of a 2-year foundation in the liberal arts/sociology, followed by the 3-year curriculum of core legal subjects, which are common to the 3-year law course. \n\nMost of the 3-year law subjects are taught by practicing lawyers, rather than academics, most of them teaching part-time. The teaching, pedagogy, and curriculum for the three-year programme is thus geared more towards practical professional law, rather than theoretical, academic law. \n\nCurrent faculty include respected academics such as Prof [[Homer Pithawalla|Homer Pithawala]] and Prof Daswani, partners from India's top law firms (often with international legal experience), as well as advocates practicing in the higher judiciary.<ref>http://www.glcmumbai.com/faculty.html</ref> \n\nMany of the more prominent faculty are alumni of the college.\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmission to the college is through the Maharashtra Common Entrance Test - the MH LAW CET, which was introduced in 2016. \n\nThe entrance exam is compulsory for admissions for law colleges in Maharashtra, and tests legal aptitude, general knowledge, language, and reasoning skills. \n\n85% of the seats are reserved for candidates from Maharashtra, and an overall reservation for various college seats is as high as 50%. \n\nIn 2018, over 23000 students appeared from Maharashtra, and 16000 students appeared for the entrance test from the rest of the country for the 3-year course.<ref>http://llb3.mhpravesh.in/CMS/Content_Static.aspx?did=1904</ref> \n\nThe total number of seats are 240, and typical cut off ranks for students from the \"Maharashtra General Category\" is an all-India Rank of 200, while those of students from outside Maharashtra is about 120.<ref>https://www.imsindia.com/LAW/law-entrances/mah-law-cet-3-years/mah-law-cet-cutoffs-2017.html</ref>\n\nThe 5-year course is less competitive, for many students consider alternate law schools, such as the [[National Law University|National Law Universities]], which do not offer 3-year degrees, and admit students on the basis of another test - [[Common Law Admission Test|CLAT]]. \n\nIn 2018, over 15000 students appeared for the 5-year MH LAW CET admissions test.<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/15k-students-clear-cet-for-5-yr-law-course/articleshow/64101085.cms</ref> Typical cut offs for 240 BLS-LLB seats are at All India Rank 250 for Maharashtra students belonging to the \"General Category\".<ref>https://www.imsindia.com/LAW/law-entrances/mah-law-cet-5-years/mah-law-cet-cutoffs-2017.html</ref>\n\n===Courses===\n====Five Year Law Course====\nThe '''B.L.S. LL.B.''' program is a 10-semester full-time course open to students right out of [[High School]] (Class XII in the Indian system). The first 2 years (4 semesters) constitute a 'pre-law' course where the student is taught social-science subjects like [[Economics]], [[Political science|Political Science]], [[History]], [[English language|English]] and [[Legal language|Legal Language]] etc. \n\nIn the next three years core law subjects, like [[Contract Law|Contracts]], Family law, [[Labour laws in India|Labour Laws]], etc. are dealt with. \n\nIn their 8th and 10th semester, the students have the option of choosing some particular subjects along with some compulsory subjects. A total of 4 practical training papers are compulsory for all the students. \n\nThe BLS or the Bachelor of Legal Sciences degree is awarded to the students by the [[University of Mumbai]] after successful completion of the 3rd year and the LLB degree is awarded after completion of 5 years. \n\nStudents are eligible to exit with a Bachelor's degree in Legal Studies ('''BLS''') at the end of 6 semesters, but cannot practice law unless they complete the course in its entirety.\n\n====Three Year Law Course====\nA minimum of a Bachelor's degree is required for enrolling into the [[LL.B.]] degree. The '''LL.B.''' degree is a three-year program with classes devoted solely to the study of law, and graduates are eligible to practice as an advocate, as per the Rules of the Bar Council of India. A student who desires to learn the law but does not wish to practice as an advocate is eligible for the LL.B. (General) Degree at the end of two years.\n\n====Other courses====\nGLC further features specialised diploma courses which include Postgraduate Diploma Course in Securities Law, Post Graduate Diploma In Intellectual Property Rights and Diploma in Cyber-Laws offered in joint-collaboration with the Asian School of Cyber Laws.<ref>http://www.bestindiaedu.com/colleges/government-law-college-mumbai.html</ref> Recently the College has started the Post Graduate Certificate Course in [[Human rights|Human Rights]]. All courses are taught by leading practitioners and experts.\n\n===Prominent current and former faculty===\n[[File:Young Ambedkar.gif|thumb|alt=Government Law College, Mumbai|B. R. Ambedkar served as the Principal of Government Law College, Bombay from 1935 to 1937|upright]]\nThroughout its history, the college has had the honour of guidance from eminent legal luminaries who have adorned benches of the Supreme Court of India and the Bombay High Court. The long list of legends include:\n* [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], Indian freedom fighter, famous as Father of Indian Discontent and one of the First Generation of Indians to have graduated.\n*[[B. R. Ambedkar]], former Principal, first Law Minister of India and Chairman, Drafting Committee of the Constitution of India \n* Sir [[Dinshah Fardunji Mulla]], former Principal, [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Councilor]], founding partner of Mulla & Mulla\n* [[Nanabhoy Palkhivala]], former Professor, noted Constitutional Lawyer\n*[[M.

In addition to its extensive collection of books and law reports drawn from all over the world, the library has maintained and preserved rare books that are out of print, some of which cannot be found in any other library in India. The Library additionally features a dedicated Electronic Research Room (ERR) for student use.\n[[File:The Harilal J. Kania Memorial Library and Reading Room.png|thumb|right|'''The Harilal J. Kania Memorial Library and Reading Room''' houses more than 42,000 books, including the original copy of the Indian Penal Code.|425px]]\nIn 1856-57 a collection of law books was purchased for the use of the students of the college at the suggestion of Mr. E.I. Howard, Bar-at-Law and the then Director of Public Instruction.\n\nBut this could only be housed at the Native General Library at Dhobi Talao for the lack of space. Eventually, in 1891, Government Law School and its Library were accommodated in [[Elphinstone College]] Building at [[Kala Ghoda|Kalaghoda]] and on 13 July 1891, the Government sanctioned a grant of Rs.2,000/- for the purchase of furniture and other equipment for the Law Library. \n\nEvery Principal in their own way tried to enrich the library in order to make it useful to the students as well as to the practitioners. \n\nDuring his tenure [[B. R. Ambedkar|Dr. B. R. Ambedkar]] prevailed upon the Government to make an additional grant of Rs. 1000/- which was sanctioned in 1936. \n\nThe Harilal J. Kania Memorial Library and Reading Room on the third floor of the college has been a part of this college since 1952. \n\nThis Reading Room was created from the Harilal J. Kania Memorial Fund, which was instituted to honour the memory of [[H. J. Kania|Sir Harilal J. Kania]], the first [[Chief Justice of India]] and an ex-student of GLC. This Reading Room can accommodate as many as 200 students at a time. \n\nThe other two floors, i.e. the first and the second floors of the annex building, house various books on case law, many of which are more than a hundred years old.\n\nThe library enjoys the distinction of being the archival repository of the [[Civil procedure|Civil Procedure Code]] of the [[East India Company]]\u2019s Courts in the presidency of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]], and the original copy of the [[Indian Penal Code]] as drafted by [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] in the year 1886.\n\n===Scholarships and awards===\nThe college provides scholarships to meritorious students. Special awards such as the Ranganathrao Trophy,\nthe Yashwant Dalal Cup for Overall Excellence, the Diwan Jotimal Chuganee Trophy and the B.M. Vardhan\u2019s Trophy for best Debater/Elocutionist are instituted for the overall development of students.<ref>http://glcmumbai.com/glc-scholarships-awards/government-law-college-scholarships-awards.aspx</ref>\n\n===Publications===\nThe college has been publishing the college magazine since 1930 and the Law Review for the last few years.<ref name=\"dnaindia.com\">http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/1054660/report-legal-eagle-flying-high-at-150</ref>\n\n==Student life==\nThe college is known for an active student life and college teams have a consistently exemplary record in many sports.<ref>http://www.barcouncilofindia.org/about/legal-education/government-law-college-mumbai</ref> The GLC campus is located at [[Churchgate]], to the west of the railway station, with close proximity to the [[Bombay High Court]]. The college has 17 classrooms, a Mooting Room, an Auditorium, an audio-visual room and a canteen for the benefit of students. The campus has a basketball court and a mini gymkhana at the back of the auditorium (for table tennis, carom, etc.). The students also use the nearby [[Oval Maidan]] or Mumbai University ground for sports such as cricket and football. The college has no hostel of its own. However, 62 seats for male students of the College in the Government Colleges Hostel, \"C\" Road, Churchgate and 20 Seats for male students at the [[Ismail Yusuf College]] at [[Jogeshwari|Jogeshwari, Mumbai]] has been provided.<ref>http://www.legallyindia.com/wiki/Government_Law_College_%28GLC%29_Mumbai</ref>\n\nGLC has been encouraging activities like Moot Courts, debates, essay competitions and other activities which help improving the legal knowledge and the oratory and literary skills of the aspiring candidates.

In addition to its extensive collection of books and law reports drawn from all over the world, the library has maintained and preserved rare books that are out of print, some of which cannot be found in any other library in India. The Library additionally features a dedicated Electronic Research Room (ERR) for student use.\n[[File:The Harilal J. Kania Memorial Library and Reading Room.png|thumb|right|'''The Harilal J. Kania Memorial Library and Reading Room''' houses more than 42,000 books, including the original copy of the Indian Penal Code.|425px]]\nIn 1856-57 a collection of law books was purchased for the use of the students of the college at the suggestion of Mr. E.I. Howard, Bar-at-Law and the then Director of Public Instruction.\n\nBut this could only be housed at the Native General Library at Dhobi Talao for the lack of space. Eventually, in 1891, Government Law School and its Library were accommodated in [[Elphinstone College]] Building at [[Kala Ghoda|Kalaghoda]] and on 13 July 1891, the Government sanctioned a grant of Rs.2,000/- for the purchase of furniture and other equipment for the Law Library. \n\nEvery Principal in their own way tried to enrich the library in order to make it useful to the students as well as to the practitioners. \n\nDuring his tenure [[B. R. Ambedkar|Dr. B. R. Ambedkar]] prevailed upon the Government to make an additional grant of Rs. 1000/- which was sanctioned in 1936. \n\nThe Harilal J. Kania Memorial Library and Reading Room on the third floor of the college has been a part of this college since 1952. \n\nThis Reading Room was created from the Harilal J. Kania Memorial Fund, which was instituted to honour the memory of [[H. J. Kania|Sir Harilal J. Kania]], the first [[Chief Justice of India]] and an ex-student of GLC. This Reading Room can accommodate as many as 200 students at a time. \n\nThe other two floors, i.e. the first and the second floors of the annex building, house various books on case law, many of which are more than a hundred years old.\n\nThe library enjoys the distinction of being the archival repository of the [[Civil procedure|Civil Procedure Code]] of the [[East India Company]]\u2019s Courts in the presidency of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]], and the original copy of the [[Indian Penal Code]] as drafted by [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] in the year 1886.\n\n===Scholarships and awards===\nThe college provides scholarships to meritorious students. Special awards such as the Ranganathrao Trophy,\nthe Yashwant Dalal Cup for Overall Excellence, the Diwan Jotimal Chuganee Trophy and the B.M.
