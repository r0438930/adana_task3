The battle occurred between 15 and 23 October 1944. It occurred in and around the region of [[Vukov Klanac]] as Wehrmacht forces retreated from the nearby cities of [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Ston]]. It resulted in the  [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th Devil's Division]] losing most of its equipment and a large fraction of its manpower to Partisan forces.\n\n==Prelude==\nThe grounds of the battle took place south of the [[Neretva#Lower Neretva and wetlands|Lower Neretva Valley]] between the majority of the [[Wehrmacht]] [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th \"Devil's Division\"]] and elements of the  [[8th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|8th Dalmatian Shock Corps]], mainly the 1st and 11th Brigades of the [[26th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|26th Division]]. Prior to the battle the 369th was withdrawing from [[Dubrovnik]] following significant land gains from Dalmatian partisans. The Supreme Staff ordered the 26th Division to liberate [[Pelje\u0161ac]] and to prevent the 369th division from retreating to [[Metkovi\u0107]] on the Neretva River. On 13 October, at the 26th Division's headquarters post in [[Janjina]], Colonel [[Bo\u017eo Bo\u017eovi\u0107]], with his commissar [[Du\u0161an Kora\u010d]] and chief of staff [[Ante Bio\u010di\u0107]] met with the commanders of the 1st and 11th Brigades to form a plan to liberate [[Ston]] and cut off the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=126}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nThe 1st Brigade had to cross the [[Bay of Mali Ston]] and land near [[Neum]], where it would infiltrate the Vukov Gorge area, cut off the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road, and prevent enemy counterattacks from Metkovi\u0107. The 11th Brigade was ordered to liberate Ston and then to assist the 1st Brigade in cutting off and defeating the Wehrmacht and Usta\u0161e forces in withdrawing from Dubrovnik.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=126}}\n\n===Neum===\nBefore Ston could be taken, there were multiple tactically prominent locations that the Partisans needed to take. The 1st Brigade was divided into four battalions, with three crossing the Bay of Mali Ston and the fourth being held in reserve. The first and third landed near the village of [[Klek, Croatia|Klek]], while the second landed across the channel on the [[Klek (peninsula)|Klek Peninsula]]. The two battalions that landed near the village of Klek engaged the overstretched third battalion of the German 370th Regiment and quickly took control over surrounding villages along the coast. The battalion on the Klek peninsula advanced east towards the Neum-Ston road and took a crossroads about a kilometer south of Neum.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=126}}\n\nThe following morning of 16 October, the German garrison in Neum was ordered to withdraw westward to the towns of Du\u017ei, Topola, and O\u0161lje. With the liquidation of the defense at Neum, elements of the 1st Brigade quickly occupied the important harbor of the town. From there, the third battalion was ordered to take the German stronghold of Kuti and deny the road to Metkovi\u0107. By the end of the day, a large swath of coast stretching from Neum to Klek and Slivno Ravno was under Partisan control, and the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road link was severed.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=126}}\n\n===Entry into Vukov Gorge===\nThe 1st Brigade was then tasked with breaking into the area of Vukov Gorge and taking the peak of [[O\u0161trikovac]]. Taking the mountain was important because the peak overlooked the crossroads of the road from Dubrovnik and the road from Ston. Over the day of 17 October, the 1st Brigade went on the attack and made significant gains across the Vukov Gorge area. The first battalion took Du\u017ei and was cycled into reserve, but not before it could sever the connection between Hutovo and Du\u017ei, trapping yet more German garrisons. Just North of Hutovo, the 13th Brigade, part of the [[29th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|29th Herzegovinian Division]], held position in Popovo Polje and was yet to make contact with the command of the 26th Division. By the end of the day of 17 October, the 2nd and 4th battalions had occupied [[Topola, Croatia|Topola]] and [[O\u0161lje]], within striking distance of O\u0161trikovac. During this time the 3rd battalion broke the German garrison at Kuti and took over prepared German demolition points. The German reaction out of Metkovi\u0107 was harsh. The Germans attacked the Partisans around the village of Kuti three times following the Partisans capturing the village. The 1st Brigade now held the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road from the outskirts of Metkovi\u0107 all the way to O\u0161trikovac.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=127}}\n\n===Ston===\nThe 11th Brigade's attack on the town of Ston was supported by a British long-range artillery unit on [[Mljet]].{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=125}} On 18 October, following the gains made by the 1st Brigade, the 11th Brigade commenced its attack on Ston. Prior to the 18 October the brigade had made minor attacks on bunkers and strongpoints around Ston but had failed to produce any major results. The Germans in the meantime had been reinforced by a company of quisling Italian fascists. On the 18th, however, following a concentrated attack from the 11th Brigade the Italians and Germans were forced to retreat from [[Mali Ston]] into Ston proper. Following the capture of Mali Ston, the partisans moved into an attack on the city of Ston, where resistance was stronger, helped by the intact medieval fortifications in Ston. German strongpoints in the forts of Ka\u0161tio and Korona were surrounded and held out for a few hours before Partisans overran the fortifications. By the evening of 18 October, Ston was completely under Partisan control.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=127}} The remaining German forces retreated past Rudine and Doli to reinforce O\u0161trikovac, which was being attacked by Partisans in the surrounding shrubland. 258 Germans and Italians surrendered to the Partisans at Ston.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\n===O\u0161trikovac===\n[[File:Vukov klanac destroyed german tank.jpg|thumb|Yugoslav Partisans standing beside a destroyed German tank at Vukov Gorge, October 1944]]\nAs the 11th Brigade pressed the Germans at Ston, the Partisans in the area around O\u0161trikovac attacked the German stronghold on the mountain to prevent a successful German withdrawal from Ston. The 2nd and 4th battalions of the 1st Brigade attacked the stronghold around the same time the 11th Brigade attacked Ston. The German defenders had been reinforced by troops withdrawing from Dubrovnik. The attack continued inconclusively throughout the day of 18 October, with no significant gains made by the Partisans, even when the Partisans deployed the 1st Battalion to reinforce the attackers. The command of the 1st Brigade cancelled the attack that night to reorganize.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\nThe next morning the attack resumed. At this same time, the German presence in the Vukov Gorge area was reorganized into Army Group \"Becker\", around 4,000 strong. A reinforced garrison at Metkovi\u0107 began to move towards Partisan-occupied demolition points North of Vukov Gorge. Learning of an armored German advance from Metkovi\u0107, the Partisans used the demolition points to turn back the German advance. The command of the 26th Division, expecting a counterattack from the Germans at O\u0161trikovac as well, ordered the 1st Brigade to withdraw to the flanks of the O\u0161trikovac-Vukov Gorge road and prepared to ambush any advancing German forces. At the same time the 11th Brigade positioned along the Metkovi\u0107-Dubrovnik road to ambush the retreating column from Metkovi\u0107 that had been stopped earlier that day.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\nThe command of the 26th Division, worried about the uncertainty of the situation in Vukov Gorge and eager to secure its gains (Neum and Ston) earlier that week, had actually ordered the 1st Brigade to withdraw back to Pelje\u0161ac and the 11th to Neum. However, conditions of heavy combat prevented either Brigade from being able to withdraw. The command of the entire [[8th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|8th Dalmatian Corps]] shared the same concerns as the command of the 26th Division and ordered the 1st and 11th to withdraw from its situation by 22 October to be redeployed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and [[Bra\u010d]].{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\n===Vukov Klanac===\nThe order to withdraw came in a difficult situation for the brigades as they were tied down in brutal engagements with Army Group Becker, which was attempting to break through to Metkovi\u0107. This meant that neither brigade was able to withdraw at the time. On 20 October following the instructions of the 8th Corps, the command of the 26th Division sent a request to the 29th Division in Dubrovnik asking that Herzegovinian brigades replace the exhausted 1st and 11th brigades. This exchange was unable to occur as the headquarters of the 29th Division was too far to redeploy in time. Ante Bio\u010di\u0107, Chief of Staff for the 26th division, disobeyed orders and refused to compel the division to retreat from its positions. The 11th Brigade went ahead with the direct orders of the 8th Corps and retreated to Mali Ston anyways, without Bio\u010di\u0107's knowledge or permission.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\nWith the absence of the 11th Brigade, the Northern flank of the Partisan salient around Vukov Gorge was left overstretched, only manned by the Brigade's 4th battalion. In the early morning of 21 October both Army Group Becker and the German garrison in Metkovi\u0107 attacked the 1st Brigade. After an intense encounter with the garrison from Metkovi\u0107, the 4th battalion was able to temporarily halt its advance. However, the commander of the 1st Brigade, [[Bogdan Stupar]]{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=165}}, wanted to minimize the risk of the 4th battalion being badly damaged and ordered it out of the Metkovi\u0107 area, instead having it test the German defenses at [[Opuzen]]. Throughout the rest of the day the other three battalions in the 1st Brigade battered the advancing column of Army Group Becker along the road to Vukov Gorge. By the end of the day the Metkovi\u0107 force and Becker had met at Vukov Gorge, where the road had been demolished by Partisans. With the vehicles of Army Group Becker unable to cross the road, the force made the fatal decision to hold at Vukov Gorge.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\nThe commander of Army Group Becker could have in theory continued towards Metkovi\u0107 without his heavy equipment, but he was convinced that it was not worth losing so much armor and motorized war materiel. So it was that over the night of 21/22 October the entire force of Becker was left completely exposed to the war-seasoned Partisans' guerrilla tactics and suffered heavy casualties. Wounded had to be carried by stretcher across the long, exposed stretch of destroyed road to be evacuated to Metkovi\u0107. Engineers arrived the next day, 22 October, and the commander of the German force was told it would take a minimum of two weeks to repair the road. The force of Army Group Becker, now surrounded, held out for another night, under constant attack from Partisans of the 1st Brigade. At dawn on 23 October, Army Group Becker capitulated. Only a quarter of the German force managed to escape back to Metkovi\u0107. At the scene of the battle remained all German machinery and equipment, destroyed or damaged.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn October 23, Chief of Staff of the 26th Division, Ante Bio\u010dic reported to the Division Headquarters: \"Bitter battles were fought with the enemy who sought to break through from O\u0161trikovac to Metkovi\u0107. Even the smallest remnants would probably have been destroyed had the 11th Brigade not been pulled out for a new task during the battle.\" The total losses of the enemy in the area of Ston-Vukov Gorge, according to the report of the 26th Division Headquarters of November 17, 1944, delivered to the 8th Corps Headquarters, amounted to 2,000 dead and 1,070 captured German soldiers and officers. 12 tanks and 20 trucks were destroyed. 211 motor vehicles were seized, one intact tank, 60 various cannons, 289 horses and various other equipment was taken. The 1st and 11th Dalmatian Brigade units had 56 dead and about 260 wounded.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n===Books===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ani\u0107 |first= Nikola |title= Povijest Osmog korpusa narodnooslobodila\u010dke vojske Hrvatske 1943-1945 |language= Croatian |trans-title= History of the Eighth Corps of the People's Liberation Army of Croatia 1943-1945 |date=2004 |access-date=30 March 2020 |url=http://www.znaci.net/00003/498.htm}}\n* {{cite book |last= Mitcham |first= Samuel W. |date=2007 |title=German Order of Battle: Volume Two |isbn=978-0-8117-3416-5}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n[[Category:Yugoslavia in World War II]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Yugoslav Partisans]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict = Battle of Vukov Klanac\n| image = Vukov klanac partisan mortar.png\n| caption = [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] operating a mortar in Vukov Gorge\n| place = Between [[Ston]] and [[Metkovi\u0107]]{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=125}}, [[Independent State of Croatia]]\n| date = 15-23 October 1944\n| result =  [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] victory\n| combatant1 = {{flagicon | Yugoslavia}} [[Yugoslav Partisans]]\n| combatant2 = {{flag | NDH}}<br>{{flagicon | NDH}} [[Usta\u0161e]]\n| units2 = {{flagicon | Nazi Germany | variant=army}}  [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th Division]]\n* 369th Regiment\n* 370th Regiment\n{{flagicon | NDH}}  [[9th Brigade (Usta\u0161e Militia)|9th Brigade]]\n| units1 = {{flagicon | Yugoslavia}}  [[8th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|8th Shock Corps]]\n* {{flagicon | SR Croatia}}  [[26th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|26th Division]]\n** 1st Brigade\n** 11th Brigade\n{{flagicon | SR Bosnia and Herzegovina}}  [[29th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|29th Division]] {{resize|(briefly)}}\n| commander1 = [[Bo\u017eo Bo\u017eovi\u0107]]{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=165}}<br>[[Vlado \u0160egrt]]{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=225}}\n| commander2 = {{flagicon | Nazi Germany}} [[Georg Reinicke]]{{sfn|Mitcham|2007|page=74}}\n| casualties1 = 56 dead<br>260 wounded\n| casualties2 = 2,000 dead{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=125}}{{efn|Yugoslav sources from the 26th Division}}<br>1,070 captured\n| strength1 = 3,000\n| strength2 = {{flagicon|Nazi Germany|variant=army}} 8,000<br>{{flagicon|NDH|variant=army}} 720 militia\n| campaignbox = {{Campaignbox Yugoslavia}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Vukov Klanac''', known in English as the '''Battle of Vukov Gorge''', was a 7-day fight between [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan]] forces in central [[Dalmatia]]. The battle occurred between 15 and 23 October 1944. It occurred in and around the region of [[Vukov Klanac]] as Wehrmacht forces retreated from the nearby cities of [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Ston]]. It resulted in the  [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th Devil's Division]] losing most of its equipment and a large fraction of its manpower to Partisan forces.\n\n==Prelude==\nThe grounds of the battle took place south of the [[Neretva#Lower Neretva and wetlands|Lower Neretva Valley]] between the majority of the [[Wehrmacht]] [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th \"Devil's Division\"]] and elements of the  [[8th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|8th Dalmatian Shock Corps]], mainly the 1st and 11th Brigades of the [[26th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|26th Division]]. Prior to the battle the 369th was withdrawing from [[Dubrovnik]] following significant land gains from Dalmatian partisans. The Supreme Staff ordered the 26th Division to liberate [[Pelje\u0161ac]] and to prevent the 369th division from retreating to [[Metkovi\u0107]] on the Neretva River. On 13 October, at the 26th Division's headquarters post in [[Janjina]], Colonel [[Bo\u017eo Bo\u017eovi\u0107]], with his commissar [[Du\u0161an Kora\u010d]] and chief of staff [[Ante Bio\u010di\u0107]] met with the commanders of the 1st and 11th Brigades to form a plan to liberate [[Ston]] and cut off the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=126}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nThe 1st Brigade had to cross the [[Bay of Mali Ston]] and land near [[Neum]], where it would infiltrate the Vukov Gorge area, cut off the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road, and prevent enemy counterattacks from Metkovi\u0107.

However, the commander of the 1st Brigade, [[Bogdan Stupar]]{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=165}}, wanted to minimize the risk of the 4th battalion being badly damaged and ordered it out of the Metkovi\u0107 area, instead having it test the German defenses at [[Opuzen]]. Throughout the rest of the day the other three battalions in the 1st Brigade battered the the advancing column of Army Group Becker along the road to Vukov Gorge. By the end of the day the Metkovi\u0107 force and Becker had met at Vukov Gorge, where the road had been demolished by Partisans. With the vehicles of Army Group Becker unable to cross the road, the force made the fatal decision to hold at Vukov Gorge.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\nThe commander of Army Group Becker could have in theory continued towards Metkovi\u0107 without his heavy equipment, but he was convinced that it was not worth losing so much armor and motorized war materiel. So it was that over the night of 21/22 October the entire force of Becker was left completely exposed to the war-seasoned Partisans' guerrilla tactics and suffered heavy casualties. Wounded had to be carried by stretcher across the long, exposed stretch of destroyed road to be evacuated to Metkovi\u0107. Engineers arrived the next day, 22 October, and the commander of the German force was told it would take a minimum of two weeks to repair the road. The force of Army Group Becker, now surrounded, held out for another night, under constant attack from Partisans of the 1st Brigade. At dawn on 23 October, Army Group Becker capitulated. Only a quarter of the German force managed to escape back to Metkovi\u0107. At the scene of the battle remained all German machinery and equipment, destroyed or damaged.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn October 23, Chief of Staff of the 26th Division, Ante Bio\u010dic reported to the Division Headquarters: \"Bitter battles were fought with the enemy who sought to break through from O\u0161trikovac to Metkovi\u0107. Even the smallest remnants would probably have been destroyed had the 11th Brigade not been pulled out for a new task during the battle.\" The total losses of the enemy in the area of Ston-Vukov Gorge, according to the report of the 26th Division Headquarters of November 17, 1944, delivered to the 8th Corps Headquarters, amounted to 2,000 dead and 1,070 captured German soldiers and officers. 12 tanks and 20 trucks were destroyed. 211 motor vehicles were seized, one intact tank, 60 various cannons, 289 horses and various other equipment was taken.
