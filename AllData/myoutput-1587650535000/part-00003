The name \"''Mao suit''\" comes from Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong's fondness for the style, so that the garment became closely associated with him and with Chinese Communism.

It was sometimes worn over a [[turtleneck]].\n\n== Origins ==\nWhen the Republic was founded in 1912, the style of dress worn in China was based on [[Manchu]] dress (''[[qipao]]'' and ''[[changshan]]''), which had been imposed by the [[Qing Dynasty]] as a form of social control. The majority-[[Han Chinese]] revolutionaries who overthrew the Qing were fueled by failure of the Qing to defend China and a lack of scientific advancement compared to the West. Even before the founding of the Republic, older forms of Chinese dress were becoming unpopular among the elite and led to the development of Chinese dress which combined the changshan and the Western hat to form a new dress.
