Club]]'' agreed with other reviewers that the EP is too brief to satisfy fans but instead argued that the release is a sampler of many of Elliott's styles and wrote that the music \"serve[s] as further reassertion of her lasting impact on the industry as a whole... [and] works to further cement her indelible imprint on popular entertainment\".<ref name=\"avcrev\" /> For ''[[The Line of Best Fit]]'', Udit Mahalingam agrees that the EP fits into Elliott's broader body of work, favorably comparing it with earlier songs and noting how the lyrics contain her trademark [[futurism]], summing up that it is a sign of greatness to come and \"feels like a kaleidoscopic portrayal of the rapper\u2019s multifacetedness as an artist\".<ref name=\"tlobf\" /> Aaron Williams of [[Uproxx]] also compared this work to the 2002 album ''[[Under Construction (Missy Elliott album)|Under Construction]]'' and Elliott's other musical influences while emphasizing her originality on this release.<ref name=\"ur\" />\n\nIn the ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', Zaza Hlalethwa takes the opportunity to review Elliott's career through ''Iconology'' and the VMA award, noting how Elliott's signature vocal delivery has influenced further artists and her music video aesthetic remains unique, even among other musicians who have followed since her debut; the reviewer asserts that the work \"pushes no boundaries\" while still showcasing the artist's strengths.<ref name=\"mg\" /> Paul Thompson of ''[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]'' gave a brief, mixed review that praises her vocal work but calls the first two opening tracks \"replacement-level trap numbers\".<ref name=\"vul\" /> Dan Weiss of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' gave the EP 3.5 out of five stars, calling it \"an exceedingly slapdash and minimal release... rush-released to cash in on Missy Elliott's Video Vanguard honor\" but praising the actual content, including Elliott's vocal performance on the a capella track.<ref name=\"pi\" /> [[Rob Sheffield]] also emphasized the greatness of Elliott as an artist and ends his ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review, \"It\u2019s a vital reminder of why we\u2019ve been missing her so much. And of why she'll always be welcome back.\"<ref name=\"rs\" /> Fred Thomas of [[AllMusic]] called the album, \"a brief and somewhat awkward sampling of various genre exercises, all fun and lively but nowhere near the excellence of Elliott's best\" and the editorial staff of the site gave it three out of five stars.<ref name=\"amg\" />\n\nAfter the site declared the release one of the most anticipated of the year in January,<ref name=\"pmjan\" /> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s Stephen Kearse gave the EP a score of 4.6 out of 10, calling it rushed and stating, \"There's nothing insightful or fun about Missy looking back rather than ahead, especially when she's already released two compilation records during her hiatus.\"<ref name=\"pm\" /> ''[[PopMatters]]''{{'}} Elisabeth Woronzoff gave the album eight out of 10, echoing the desire for more work from Elliot, calling this a \"welcomed returned and a hopeful teaser for upcoming projects\".<ref name=\"pop\" />\n\n==Track listing==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes.<ref name=\"ln\" />\n#\"[[Throw It Back (Missy Elliott song)|Throw It Back]]\" (Michael Aristotle, William Jared Buggs, Missy Elliott, and Quintin Ernest Talbert)&nbsp;\u2013 3:13\n#\"Cool Off\" (Aristotle, Buggs, Elliott, Talbert)&nbsp;\u2013 2:15\n#\"DripDemeanor\" ([[Corte Ellis]], Elliott, and [[Timothy Mosley]])&nbsp;\u2013 3:52\n#\"Why I Still Love You\" (Elliott and [[Timbaland]])&nbsp;\u2013 2:49\n#\"Why I Still Love You\" (Acapella) (Elliott and Timbaland)&nbsp;\u2013 2:40\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Missy Elliott]] \u2013 lead artist, songwriter, [[record producer|production]] on \"DripDemeanor\"\n*Brandon Black \u2013 [[synth bass]], [[vocoder]] on \"DripDemeanor\"\n*Chris Godbey \u2013 [[Audio engineering|engineering]]\n*Wili Hendrix \u2013 production on \"Throw It Back\" and \"Cool Off\"\n*Angel Lopez \u2013 co-production on \"Why I Still Love You\" and \"Why I Still Love You\" (Acapella)\n*Glenn Schick \u2013 [[Audio mastering|mastering]]\n*Sum1 \u2013 vocals on \"DripDemeanor\"\n*[[Timbaland]] \u2013 production on \"DripDemeanor\", \"Why I Still Love You\", and \"Why I Still Love You\" (Acapella)\n*Federico Vindver \u2013 co-production on \"Why I Still Love You\" and \"Why I Still Love You\" (Acapella)\n*Finis \"KY\" White \u2013 [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]]\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance of ''Iconology''\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{album chart|BillboardCanada|52|artist=Missy Elliott|rowheader=true|accessdate=September 4, 2019}}\n|-\n{{album chart|Switzerland|68|artist=Missy Elliott|album=Iconology %5BEP%5D|rowheader=true|accessdate=September 4, 2019}}\n|-\n{{album chart|Billboard200|24|artist=Missy Elliott|rowheader=true|accessdate=September 4, 2019}}\n|-\n{{album chart|BillboardRandBHipHop|15|artist=Missy Elliot|rowheader=true|accessdate=October 26, 2019}}\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of 2019 albums]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"amg\">{{Cite web |last=Thomas |first=Fred |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/iconology-mw0003311684 |title=''Iconology''&nbsp;\u2013 Missy Elliott |accessdate=November 7, 2019 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"aoty\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/172149-missy-elliott-iconology.php |title=Missy Elliott&nbsp;\u2013''Iconology'' |accessdate=February 5, 2020 |publisher=[[Album of the Year (website)|Album of the Year]]}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"april\">{{Cite web |url=http://thesource.com/2019/04/18/missy-elliott-album/ |title=Missy Elliott Says She's 'Finished' Recording Her Upcoming Album |author=Miss2Bees |date=June 1, 2019 |work=[[The Source]] |access-date=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"atl\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/missy-elliott-iconography-ep-review-solid-vma-teaser/596821/ |title=Missy Elliott Is Reclaiming Her Legacy |date=August 26, 2019 |accessdate=August 26, 2019 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"avc\">{{Cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/missy-elliott-is-releasing-a-new-album-at-midnight-so-1837483482 |title=Missy Elliott Is Releasing a New Album at Midnight, So Sleep Can Go to Hell |last=Miller |first=Shannon |date=August 22, 2019 |accessdate=August 22, 2019 |website=[[The A.V.

Club]]'' agreed with other reviewers that the EP is too brief to satisfy fans but instead argued that the release is a sampler of many of Elliott's styles and wrote that the music \"serve[s] as further reassertion of her lasting impact on the industry as a whole... [and] works to further cement her indelible imprint on popular entertainment\".<ref name=\"avcrev\" /> For ''[[The Line of Best Fit]]'', Udit Mahalingam agrees that the EP fits into Elliott's broader body of work, favorably comparing it with earlier songs and noting how the lyrics contain her trademark [[futurism]], summing up that it is a sign of greatness to come and \"feels like a kaleidoscopic portrayal of the rapper\u2019s multifacetedness as an artist\".<ref name=\"tlobf\" /> Aaron Williams of [[Uproxx]] also compared this work to the 2002 album ''[[Under Construction (Missy Elliott album)|Under Construction]]'' and Elliott's other musical influences while emphasizing her originality on this release.<ref name=\"ur\" />\n\nIn the ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', Zaza Hlalethwa takes the opportunity to review Elliott's career through ''Iconology'' and the VMA award, noting how Elliott's signature vocal delivery has influenced further artists and her music video aesthetic remains unique, even among other musicians who have followed since her debut; the reviewer asserts that the work \"pushes no boundaries\" while still showcasing the artist's strengths.<ref name=\"mg\" /> Paul Thompson of ''[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]'' gave a brief, mixed review that praises her vocal work but calls the first two opening tracks \"replacement-level trap numbers\".<ref name=\"vul\" /> Dan Weiss of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' gave the EP 3.5 out of five stars, calling it \"an exceedingly slapdash and minimal release... rush-released to cash in on Missy Elliott's Video Vanguard honor\" but praising the actual content, including Elliott's vocal performance on the a capella track.<ref name=\"pi\" /> [[Rob Sheffield]] also emphasized the greatness of Elliott as an artist and ends his ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review, \"It\u2019s a vital reminder of why we\u2019ve been missing her so much. And of why she'll always be welcome back.\"<ref name=\"rs\" /> Fred Thomas of [[AllMusic]] called the album, \"a brief and somewhat awkward sampling of various genre exercises, all fun and lively but nowhere near the excellence of Elliott's best\" and the editorial staff of the site gave it three out of five stars.<ref name=\"amg\" />\n\nAfter the site declared the release one of the most anticipated of the year in January,<ref name=\"pmjan\" /> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s Stephen Kearse gave the EP a score of 4.6 out of 10, calling it rushed and stating, \"There's nothing insightful or fun about Missy looking back rather than ahead, especially when she's already released two compilation records during her hiatus.\"<ref name=\"pm\" /> ''[[PopMatters]]''{{'}} Elisabeth Woronzoff gave the album eight out of 10, echoing the desire for more work from Elliot, calling this a \"welcomed returned and a hopeful teaser for upcoming projects\".<ref name=\"pop\" />\n\n==Track listing==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes.<ref name=\"ln\" />\n#\"[[Throw It Back (Missy Elliott song)|Throw It Back]]\" (Michael Aristotle, William Jared Buggs, Missy Elliott, and Quintin Ernest Talbert)&nbsp;\u2013 3:13\n#\"Cool Off\" (Aristotle, Buggs, Elliott, Talbert)&nbsp;\u2013 2:15\n#\"DripDemeanor\" ([[Corte Ellis]], Elliott, and [[Timothy Mosley]])&nbsp;\u2013 3:52\n#\"Why I Still Love You\" (Elliott and [[Timbaland]])&nbsp;\u2013 2:49\n#\"Why I Still Love You\" (Acapella) (Elliott and Timbaland)&nbsp;\u2013 2:40\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Missy Elliott]] \u2013 lead artist, songwriter, [[record producer|production]] on \"DripDemeanor\"\n*Brandon Black \u2013 [[synth bass]], [[vocoder]] on \"DripDemeanor\"\n*Chris Godbey \u2013 [[Audio engineering|engineering]]\n*Wili Hendrix \u2013 production on \"Throw It Back\" and \"Cool Off\"\n*Angel Lopez \u2013 co-production on \"Why I Still Love You\" and \"Why I Still Love You\" (Acapella)\n*Glenn Schick \u2013 [[Audio mastering|mastering]]\n*Sum1 \u2013 vocals on \"DripDemeanor\"\n*[[Timbaland]] \u2013 production on \"DripDemeanor\", \"Why I Still Love You\", and \"Why I Still Love You\" (Acapella)\n*Federico Vindver \u2013 co-production on \"Why I Still Love You\" and \"Why I Still Love You\" (Acapella)\n*Finis \"KY\" White \u2013 [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]]\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance of ''Iconology''\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{album chart|BillboardCanada|52|artist=Missy Elliott|rowheader=true|accessdate=September 4, 2019}}\n|-\n{{album chart|Switzerland|68|artist=Missy Elliott|album=Iconology %5BEP%5D|rowheader=true|accessdate=September 4, 2019}}\n|-\n{{album chart|Billboard200|24|artist=Missy Elliott|rowheader=true|accessdate=September 4, 2019}}\n|-\n{{album chart|BillboardRandBHipHop|15|artist=Missy Elliot|rowheader=true|accessdate=October 26, 2019}}\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of 2019 albums]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"amg\">{{Cite web |last=Thomas |first=Fred |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/iconology-mw0003311684 |title=''Iconology''&nbsp;\u2013 Missy Elliott |accessdate=November 7, 2019 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"aoty\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/172149-missy-elliott-iconology.php |title=Missy Elliott&nbsp;\u2013''Iconology'' |accessdate=February 5, 2020 |publisher=[[Album of the Year (website)|Album of the Year]]}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"april\">{{Cite web |url=http://thesource.com/2019/04/18/missy-elliott-album/ |title=Missy Elliott Says She's 'Finished' Recording Her Upcoming Album |author=Miss2Bees |date=June 1, 2019 |work=[[The Source]] |access-date=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"atl\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/missy-elliott-iconography-ep-review-solid-vma-teaser/596821/ |title=Missy Elliott Is Reclaiming Her Legacy |date=August 26, 2019 |accessdate=August 26, 2019 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"avc\">{{Cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/missy-elliott-is-releasing-a-new-album-at-midnight-so-1837483482 |title=Missy Elliott Is Releasing a New Album at Midnight, So Sleep Can Go to Hell |last=Miller |first=Shannon |date=August 22, 2019 |accessdate=August 22, 2019 |website=[[The A.V.
