They participate in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. They currently have 25 teams across schoolboy, junior and senior grades. The Roosters premier team began the [[Te Atatu Roosters 2019 Season|2019 season]] in the \"Fox Championship Qualifying Competition\", but after qualifying first they gained entry to the Fox Championship competition where a top 4 finish will see them begin the 2020 season in the top division.\n[[File:Te Atatu v New Lynn.jpg|thumb|right|Te Atatu scoring v New Lynn]]\n\n==Home Ground==\nThe Roosters play at the [[Auckland Council|council owned]] [[Jack Colvin Park]] located on the [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula]], next to the [[North Western Motorway]]. Junior teams play at [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]], and at Gloria Park both also on the peninsula.\n\n== History ==\nThe Te Atatu club was founded in 1955 after the opening of the North-Western motorway led to suburban growth in the Te Atat\u016b area. The first team was a 7-aside team formed to represent Te Atatu North and South. They initially had to wear [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] jerseys and their first ever game was against Wesley at [[Fowlds Park]]. The first training area was in a cow paddock on Edmonton Rd, before they were later able to move to [[Ramlea Park]].\n\nIn 1961 Te Atatu won their first schoolboy championship in their Te Atatu colours. In 1960\u201361 [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]] was developed on Neil Avenue and in 1965 they fielded their first senior side in the Senior B grade. The ground is still commonly referred to as 'Neil Ave'.\n\nIn the late 1960s work began on the current club rooms on Toru Avenue. They were built on Crown (council) land arranged with Waitemata Mayor [[Jack Colvin]] after 3 club members were elected to the WCC Parks Committee. However, before the club rooms could be built the land needed to be prepared. The land was in such poor condition that no other clubs had bothered applying for it, and life member Ken Pitman described the task of preparing it thus: \"What a mess, over six acres of swamp, gorse and pine trees, five feet thick. Well we were all enthusiastic and silly enough to attempt the impossible. We chopped, scrounged, swore, drank and burned our way through the lot\". The council also helped by putting a culvert under the motorway and realigned the creek which ran through the park. Eventually the playing fields were established and work could begin on the club rooms.<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/western-leader/67998177/</ref>\n\nThe club rooms took over 6 years to complete with the foundation stone being laid on 17 December 1962, with the official opening on 19 April 1969 by MP Martin Finlay. Just as the land was prepared solely by club members, so to was the clubroom built completely by members including Ken Pitman, Tom Hetherington, Ted Quedely, Eric Draper, Ernie Rainbow, Morrie Ramsey, Peter and Bis Pitman, Buddy Jones, Harry McWilliams, Jim Denyer, Gordon McCarten, Pat Fairweather, Don McMeekin, Murray Hill and Ian Pattulo.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | title = The History of Te Atatu Rugby League Club\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | publisher = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | date = 18 February 2012\n  | url = http://www.foxsportspulse.com/club_info.cgi?client=0-4975-69502-0-0&sID=128875&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=8812328\n  | accessdate = 7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s Te Atatu were becoming more competitive on the field at senior level and completed wins over all of the top clubs over a period of time, including [[Ellerslie Eagles]], [[Mt Albert Lions]], [[Glenora Bears]], [[Richmond Bulldogs]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies]].  At this time the club also began producing NZ international quality players such as [[Dennis A. Williams|Dennis Williams]] who aged only 18 famously scored a brilliant individual try with his first touch of the ball in his debut test versus Great Britain, along with John Smith and John Wilson. In 1973 they won the Senior Competition and the Phelan Shield. In the same year they played the first ever [[Australian Aboriginal rugby league team]] in a pre season game, losing 13\u201317.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]\n  | title = Aboriginal team wins\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | date = 18 February 1973\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-LIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W-UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3423,6519452\n  | accessdate = 10 August 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | title = Aboriginal Rugby League Stars Recognised After 4 Decades\n  | work = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | place =Australia\n  \n  | date = 8 February 2013\n  | url = https://www.armidaleexpress.com.au/story/1286216/aboriginal-rugby-league-stars-recognised-after-four-decades/\n  | accessdate = 30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAround this time other branches of the club were formed at Ranui (which later led to the formation of the [[Waitemata Seagulls]]), and [[Massey, New Zealand|Massey]]. Teams playing at [[Moire Park]] in Massey were known as Te Atatu Massey. The nickname 'Roosters' was adopted along with the Eastern Suburbs (now [[Sydney Roosters]]) style jersey. In 1976 they turned 21 yrs old and celebrated with a ball at the Mandalay in the city. In 1979 club members looking for a summer activity to continue bonding and to develop player skills formed the Te Atatu Roosters Softball Club. The softball club has since relocated to the Massey Rugby Club and plays at Rosedale Park on Auckland's North Shore, but has retained the name [[Roosters Softball Club]].<ref>http://www.onlysport.co.nz/browse/profile-607-Roosters_Softball_Club_Inc.html</ref><ref>http://www.roosterssoftball.co.nz/</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the club finally began experiencing the success on the field they had sought after for many years. In 1986 they were runners up in the Fox Memorial to Mt Albert but weeks later were crowned National Club Champions after defeating the same opposition. Then in 1988 they won the Fox Memorial Shield beating local rivals [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 23\u201316 in the final at [[Carlaw Park]] and a month later won the National Club title for the second time by again defeating Glenora at Eden Park as curtain-raiser to the Kiwis \u2013 Kangaroo World Cup final.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Te Atatu Roosters Facebook page]]\n  | first = Graeme Murdoch\n  | title = 60th Jubilee Speech Notes\n  |publisher=Facebook\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | pages = 1\u20132\n  | date = 20 June 2015\n  | url = https://www.facebook.com/1423833681197274/photos/pb.1423833681197274.-2207520000.1436166628./1638454956401811/?type=3&theater\n  | accessdate = 6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Te Atatu formed their first women's premier team. They have now played four seasons and won the 2nd division title twice (2016 and 2019).<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/sport/80016339/women-flock-to-the-te-atatu-roosters-rugby-league-team</ref>\n\n== Titles ==\n{{see also|Auckland Rugby League club trophies}}\nTe Atatu's first ever senior trophy was the Gillette Cup in 1968. They won it again in 1974.\n\nTheir other trophies early in their existence were in the Sharman Cup where they won it in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1976 and 1978.\n\nTe Atatu had a historic year in 1986 when they won the Rukutai Shield for winning the minor premiership and making the Fox Memorial grand final (both for the first time) where they lost to the [[Mt Albert Lions]] 31\u20134. A month later they had revenge when they beat the Lions by 36\u201310 to claim their first National Club title at [[Carlaw Park]], defeating Randwick and Upper Hutt along the way.\n\nTe Atatu finally won the coveted [[Fox Memorial Shield]], awarded to the Auckland club champions in 1988 with a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6JGSd5irZ4|22-16 win] over local rivals the [[Glenora Bears]].  They also went on to win the Lion Red National Club Final against Glenora at [[Eden Park]] 18\u20138 in the same year.  The match was televised live as it was the curtain-raiser to the New Zealand \u2013 Australia Rugby League World Cup final which Australia went on to win 25\u201312 in front of 45,363 spectators.\n\nIn 1990 they again made the Fox Memorial final but lost to a [[Tawera Nikau]] inspired [[Otahuhu Leopards]]. In 1993 they made the Fox Memorial final for the 4th time but were again defeated by the [[Northcote Tigers]] 29\u201310.\n\nIn 2005 the Roosters celebrated their 50th Jubilee. In 2007 Te Atatu won the Roope Rooster (which by this time had become a trophy the winning team defended on their home ground). They defeated Mt Albert to win it and defended it for 3 matches before losing it to the [[Richmond Bulldogs]].\n\nIn 2010 they finished 4th at the end of the regular season in the Fox Memorial and defeated 3rd placed Howick in the minor final, before losing to Otahuhu in preliminary final.\n\nThe 2011 to 2014 seasons were largely uneventful, spent in the lower divisions. The 2014 season was arguably one of the worst in the club's history with just 2 wins from 18 games, both over the last placed [[Manukau Magpies]].\n\nThe club then rebuilt in 2015 by appointing Revell Neil and bringing in many new players to the premier team. This saw a massive reversal in results and over the 2015 and 2016 seasons they won a remarkable 35 games, with 2 draws and just 3 losses. In 2015 they had their 60th Jubilee which featured a celebratory match with local rivals Glenora and was won by Te Atatu 38\u201328. They also won the Phelan Shield in this time. In 2016 they won the Phelan Shield again along with promotion back to the Fox Memorial when they beat the [[Bay Roskill Vikings]] 31\u201322 in the Sharman Cup final. In 2017 they were competitive in many matches but failed to convert this into wins. They were relegated back to the Sharman Cup and in 2018 were forced to rebuild after losing many of their players to other teams. Former Te Atatu player [[Lawrence Tagaloa]] was appointed head coach. They finished the season with a 7\u20137 record and lost to New Lynn in the Sharman Cup championship final. 2019 saw another change with new coaches (Keith Hanley and Phil Gordon) appointed and many new additions to the team.\n\n[[File:TeAtatuRoostersvPtChev.png|thumb|right|Te Atatu players in a match against Point Chevalier]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Williams|Dennis Williams]] in 1971. He went on to play 31 tests for New Zealand. The majority of the NZ representatives were to come from the late 1980s and early 1990s when the club experienced considerable success on the field With the likes of [[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]], [[Mark Elia]], [[Mark Horo]], [[Ron O'Regan]], [[Dean Orr]], and [[Sam Panapa]] in the side. In the early 1990s brothers Henry and [[Robbie Paul]] represented the Kiwi's though Robbie moved to play professionally in England at a young age and due to the difficulty for players from England being able to return to New Zealand or Australia for tests he did not represent New Zealand as many times as he would undoubtedly have. His brother [[Henry Paul]] also moved to play professionally in England and he later switched codes representing England in rugby union, and in [[Rugby Sevens]]. He was not the only Te Atatu Rooster to represent another country in Rugby Union. [[Shontayne Hape]] switched codes and was selected for the full English international side who he represented 13 times, and more recently [[James O'Connor (rugby union)|James O'Connor]] who was a Te Atatu Schoolboy was selected for the Wallabies, the [[Australia national rugby union team]].\n\n===NZ Representatives===\n'''Kiwis'''\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]] (16 tests)\n*[[Mark Elia]] (37 tests)\n*[[Shontayne Hape]] (14 tests)\n*[[Mark Horo]] (16 tests)\n*[[Suaia Matagi]] (1 test)\n*[[Ron O'Regan]] (8 tests)\n*[[Dean Orr]] (1 test)\n*[[Sam Panapa]] (8 tests)\n*[[Henry Paul]] (24 tests)\n*[[Robbie Paul]] (29 tests)\n*[[John Smith (rugby league)|John Smith]] (12 tests)\n*[[Dennis A.

They participate in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. They currently have 25 teams across schoolboy, junior and senior grades. The Roosters premier team began the [[Te Atatu Roosters 2019 Season|2019 season]] in the \"Fox Championship Qualifying Competition\", but after qualifying first they gained entry to the Fox Championship competition where a top 4 finish will see them begin the 2020 season in the top division.\n[[File:Te Atatu v New Lynn.jpg|thumb|right|Te Atatu scoring v New Lynn]]\n\n==Home Ground==\nThe Roosters play at the [[Auckland Council|council owned]] [[Jack Colvin Park]] located on the [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula]], next to the [[North Western Motorway]]. Junior teams play at [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]], and at Gloria Park both also on the peninsula.\n\n== History ==\nThe Te Atatu club was founded in 1955 after the opening of the North-Western motorway led to suburban growth in the Te Atat\u016b area. The first team was a 7-aside team formed to represent Te Atatu North and South. They initially had to wear [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] jerseys and their first ever game was against Wesley at [[Fowlds Park]]. The first training area was in a cow paddock on Edmonton Rd, before they were later able to move to [[Ramlea Park]].\n\nIn 1961 Te Atatu won their first schoolboy championship in their Te Atatu colours. In 1960\u201361 [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]] was developed on Neil Avenue and in 1965 they fielded their first senior side in the Senior B grade. The ground is still commonly referred to as 'Neil Ave'.\n\nIn the late 1960s work began on the current club rooms on Toru Avenue. They were built on Crown (council) land arranged with Waitemata Mayor [[Jack Colvin]] after 3 club members were elected to the WCC Parks Committee. However, before the club rooms could be built the land needed to be prepared. The land was in such poor condition that no other clubs had bothered applying for it, and life member Ken Pitman described the task of preparing it thus: \"What a mess, over six acres of swamp, gorse and pine trees, five feet thick. Well we were all enthusiastic and silly enough to attempt the impossible. We chopped, scrounged, swore, drank and burned our way through the lot\". The council also helped by putting a culvert under the motorway and realigned the creek which ran through the park. Eventually the playing fields were established and work could begin on the club rooms.<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/western-leader/67998177/</ref>\n\nThe club rooms took over 6 years to complete with the foundation stone being laid on 17 December 1962, with the official opening on 19 April 1969 by MP Martin Finlay. Just as the land was prepared solely by club members, so to was the clubroom built completely by members including Ken Pitman, Tom Hetherington, Ted Quedely, Eric Draper, Ernie Rainbow, Morrie Ramsey, Peter and Bis Pitman, Buddy Jones, Harry McWilliams, Jim Denyer, Gordon McCarten, Pat Fairweather, Don McMeekin, Murray Hill and Ian Pattulo.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | title = The History of Te Atatu Rugby League Club\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | publisher = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | date = 18 February 2012\n  | url = http://www.foxsportspulse.com/club_info.cgi?client=0-4975-69502-0-0&sID=128875&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=8812328\n  | accessdate = 7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s Te Atatu were becoming more competitive on the field at senior level and completed wins over all of the top clubs over a period of time, including [[Ellerslie Eagles]], [[Mt Albert Lions]], [[Glenora Bears]], [[Richmond Bulldogs]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies]].  At this time the club also began producing NZ international quality players such as [[Dennis A. Williams|Dennis Williams]] who aged only 18 famously scored a brilliant individual try with his first touch of the ball in his debut test versus Great Britain, along with John Smith and John Wilson. In 1973 they won the Senior Competition and the Phelan Shield. In the same year they played the first ever [[Australian Aboriginal rugby league team]] in a pre season game, losing 13\u201317.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]\n  | title = Aboriginal team wins\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | date = 18 February 1973\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-LIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W-UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3423,6519452\n  | accessdate = 10 August 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | title = Aboriginal Rugby League Stars Recognised After 4 Decades\n  | work = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | place =Australia\n  \n  | date = 8 February 2013\n  | url = https://www.armidaleexpress.com.au/story/1286216/aboriginal-rugby-league-stars-recognised-after-four-decades/\n  | accessdate = 30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAround this time other branches of the club were formed at Ranui (which later led to the formation of the [[Waitemata Seagulls]]), and [[Massey, New Zealand|Massey]]. Teams playing at [[Moire Park]] in Massey were known as Te Atatu Massey. The nickname 'Roosters' was adopted along with the Eastern Suburbs (now [[Sydney Roosters]]) style jersey. In 1976 they turned 21 yrs old and celebrated with a ball at the Mandalay in the city. In 1979 club members looking for a summer activity to continue bonding and to develop player skills formed the Te Atatu Roosters Softball Club. The softball club has since relocated to the Massey Rugby Club and plays at Rosedale Park on Auckland's North Shore, but has retained the name [[Roosters Softball Club]].<ref>http://www.onlysport.co.nz/browse/profile-607-Roosters_Softball_Club_Inc.html</ref><ref>http://www.roosterssoftball.co.nz/</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the club finally began experiencing the success on the field they had sought after for many years. In 1986 they were runners up in the Fox Memorial to Mt Albert but weeks later were crowned National Club Champions after defeating the same opposition. Then in 1988 they won the Fox Memorial Shield beating local rivals [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 23\u201316 in the final at [[Carlaw Park]] and a month later won the National Club title for the second time by again defeating Glenora at Eden Park as curtain-raiser to the Kiwis \u2013 Kangaroo World Cup final.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Te Atatu Roosters Facebook page]]\n  | first = Graeme Murdoch\n  | title = 60th Jubilee Speech Notes\n  |publisher=Facebook\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | pages = 1\u20132\n  | date = 20 June 2015\n  | url = https://www.facebook.com/1423833681197274/photos/pb.1423833681197274.-2207520000.1436166628./1638454956401811/?type=3&theater\n  | accessdate = 6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Te Atatu formed their first women's premier team. They have now played four seasons and won the 2nd division title twice (2016 and 2019).<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/sport/80016339/women-flock-to-the-te-atatu-roosters-rugby-league-team</ref>\n\n== Titles ==\n{{see also|Auckland Rugby League club trophies}}\nTe Atatu's first ever senior trophy was the Gillette Cup in 1968. They won it again in 1974.\n\nTheir other trophies early in their existence were in the Sharman Cup where they won it in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1976 and 1978.\n\nTe Atatu had a historic year in 1986 when they won the Rukutai Shield for winning the minor premiership and making the Fox Memorial grand final (both for the first time) where they lost to the [[Mt Albert Lions]] 31\u20134. A month later they had revenge when they beat the Lions by 36\u201310 to claim their first National Club title at [[Carlaw Park]], defeating Randwick and Upper Hutt along the way.\n\nTe Atatu finally won the coveted [[Fox Memorial Shield]], awarded to the Auckland club champions in 1988 with a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6JGSd5irZ4|22-16 win] over local rivals the [[Glenora Bears]].  They also went on to win the Lion Red National Club Final against Glenora at [[Eden Park]] 18\u20138 in the same year.  The match was televised live as it was the curtain-raiser to the New Zealand \u2013 Australia Rugby League World Cup final which Australia went on to win 25\u201312 in front of 45,363 spectators.\n\nIn 1990 they again made the Fox Memorial final but lost to a [[Tawera Nikau]] inspired [[Otahuhu Leopards]]. In 1993 they made the Fox Memorial final for the 4th time but were again defeated by the [[Northcote Tigers]] 29\u201310.\n\nIn 2005 the Roosters celebrated their 50th Jubilee. In 2007 Te Atatu won the Roope Rooster (which by this time had become a trophy the winning team defended on their home ground). They defeated Mt Albert to win it and defended it for 3 matches before losing it to the [[Richmond Bulldogs]].\n\nIn 2010 they finished 4th at the end of the regular season in the Fox Memorial and defeated 3rd placed Howick in the minor final, before losing to Otahuhu in preliminary final.\n\nThe 2011 to 2014 seasons were largely uneventful, spent in the lower divisions. The 2014 season was arguably one of the worst in the club's history with just 2 wins from 18 games, both over the last placed [[Manukau Magpies]].\n\nThe club then rebuilt in 2015 by appointing Revell Neil and bringing in many new players to the premier team. This saw a massive reversal in results and over the 2015 and 2016 seasons they won a remarkable 35 games, with 2 draws and just 3 losses. In 2015 they had their 60th Jubilee which featured a celebratory match with local rivals Glenora and was won by Te Atatu 38\u201328. They also won the Phelan Shield in this time. In 2016 they won the Phelan Shield again along with promotion back to the Fox Memorial when they beat the [[Bay Roskill Vikings]] 31\u201322 in the Sharman Cup final. In 2017 they were competitive in many matches but failed to convert this into wins. They were relegated back to the Sharman Cup and in 2018 were forced to rebuild after losing many of their players to other teams. Former Te Atatu player [[Lawrence Tagaloa]] was appointed head coach.

Williams|Dennis Williams]] in 1971. He went on to play 31 tests for New Zealand. The majority of the NZ representatives were to come from the late 1980s and early 1990s when the club experienced considerable success on the field With the likes of [[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]], [[Mark Elia]], [[Mark Horo]], [[Ron O'Regan]], [[Dean Orr]], and [[Sam Panapa]] in the side. In the early 1990s brothers Henry and [[Robbie Paul]] represented the Kiwi's though Robbie moved to play professionally in England at a young age and due to the difficulty for players from England being able to return to New Zealand or Australia for tests he did not represent New Zealand as many times as he would undoubtedly have. His brother [[Henry Paul]] also moved to play professionally in England and he later switched codes representing England in rugby union, and in [[Rugby Sevens]]. He was not the only Te Atatu Rooster to represent another country in Rugby Union. [[Shontayne Hape]] switched codes and was selected for the full English international side who he represented 13 times, and more recently [[James O'Connor (rugby union)|James O'Connor]] who was a Te Atatu Schoolboy was selected for the Wallabies, the [[Australia national rugby union team]].\n\n===NZ Representatives===\n'''Kiwis'''\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]] (16 tests)\n*[[Mark Elia]] (37 tests)\n*[[Shontayne Hape]] (14 tests)\n*[[Mark Horo]] (16 tests)\n*[[Suaia Matagi]] (1 test)\n*[[Ron O'Regan]] (8 tests)\n*[[Dean Orr]] (1 test)\n*[[Sam Panapa]] (8 tests)\n*[[Henry Paul]] (24 tests)\n*[[Robbie Paul]] (29 tests)\n*[[John Smith (rugby league)|John Smith]] (12 tests)\n*[[Dennis A.
