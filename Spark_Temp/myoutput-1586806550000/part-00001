In the age of [[digital image]]s, visual [[search engine]]s and image-organizing programs normally use thumbnails, as do most modern operating systems or desktop environments, such as [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[KDE]] ([[Linux]]) and [[GNOME]] ([[Linux]]). On web pages, they also avoid the need to download larger files unnecessarily.\n\n==Implementation==\n\nThumbnails are ideally implemented on web pages as separate, smaller copies of the original image, in part because one purpose of a thumbnail image on a web page is to reduce [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and download time. Some web designers produce thumbnails with [[HTML element|HTML]] or client-side scripting that makes the user's browser shrink the picture, rather than use a smaller copy of the image. This results in no saved bandwidth, and the visual quality of browser resizing is usually less than ideal.\nDisplaying a significant part of the picture instead of the full frame can allow the use of a smaller thumbnail while maintaining recognizability. For example, when thumbnailing a full-body [[portrait]] of a person, it may be better to show the face slightly reduced than an indistinct figure. However, this may mislead the viewer about what the image contains, so is more suited to artistic presentations than searching or catalogue browsing.\n\nIn 2002, the court in the US case ''[[Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation]]'' ruled that it was [[fair use]] for [[Internet]] search engines to use thumbnail images to help web users find what they seek.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"thumbnail\" is a reference to the human thumbnail and alludes to the small size of the image or picture, comparable to the size of the human thumbnail.<ref name=\"Online Etymology Dictionary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=thumbnail|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2010-03-05|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref><ref name=\"AllWords.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-thumbnail.html|title=AllWords.com|accessdate=2010-03-05}}</ref> While the earliest use of the word in this sense dates back to the 17th century,<ref name=\"Random House Word of the Day\">{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19971211|title=Random House Word of the Day|accessdate=2010-03-05}}</ref> the American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms is reported to have documented that the expression first appears in the mid-19th century to refer to 'a drawing the size of the thumbnail'.<ref name=\"Podictionary\">{{cite web|url=http://podictionary.com/?p=202 |title=OPodictionary|accessdate= 2010-03-05}}</ref> The word was then used figuratively, in both [[noun]] and [[adjective]] form, to refer to anything small or concise, such as a biographical essay.
