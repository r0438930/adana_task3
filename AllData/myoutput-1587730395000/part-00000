The bridge was designed by [[John Whitton]] and built from 1883 to 1884 by J. S. Bennett, with iron work supplied by [[Westwood, Baillie]], [[England]]. It is also known as the '''Rail Bridge over Murray River, Albury-Wodonga''' and the '''Albury Lattice Railway Bridge''' and '''Murray River Underbridge'''. The bridge is owned by [[RailCorp]], and maintained by the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] as part of its lease of the line. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1020>{{cite NSW SHR|5045524|Albury rail bridge over Murray River|hr=01020|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is located {{convert|648.465|km}} from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central railway station]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 20-year period between 1873 and 1893 there was a massive programme of public works in New South Wales, particularly in expanding the road and rail networks. During this period and despite strong economic conditions, the respective chief engineers, for roads (William C Bennett) and for railways ([[John Whitton]]), adopted economic construction methods and materials, for example by using local materials where possible. Consequently, an enormous amount of hardwood timber was used for bridge works; mostly timber beam and timber truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nHowever, long span bridges were required for major river crossings, making timber bridge construction unsuitable at many locations. Metal bridge construction was adopted for larger bridges at major river crossings with metal supplied from England. John Whitton adopted the use of wrought iron lattice truss bridges, with twelve such bridges built for the NSW Railways in the late 19th century and 24 wrought iron bridges built for roads.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nMany of these bridges (for road and rail) remain extant in NSW, including railway lattice bridges at: [[Bathurst Rail Bridge over Macquarie River|Bathurst]] ([[Macquarie River]], 1876), [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]] (Macquarie River, 1881), [[Woolbrook, New South Wales|Woolbrook]] (MacDonald River, 1882), [[Dubbo rail bridge over Macquarie River|Dubbo]] (Macquarie River, 1884), [[Cowra]] ([[Lachlan River]], 1887), [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] ([[Peel River (New South Wales)|Peel River]], 1882), Albury (Murray River, 1884), and [[Narrandera]] ([[Murrumbidgee River]], 1885).<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nThe Albury Murray River Bridge consists of two {{convert|48.463|m|ft|0|adj=on}} wrought iron lattice girder trusses, a steel opening transom top, and cast iron piers. The cylinders, made by [[Stockton, New South Wales|Stockton]] Forge Co. in the UK and weighed {{convert|290|t}}; and the superstructure, made by Westwood Baillie & Co. and weighed {{convert|594|t}} were delivered between 3 April 1883 and 11 June 1883.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nThe total cost of the bridge was estimated at \u00a332,519.19.0, including:<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n*Cylinders, superstructure: \u00a312,313.0.3\n*Railway carriage of above: \u00a35,318.19.9\n*Sinking & fixing of cylinders: \u00a310,005.3.9\n*Erecting superstructure: \u00a33,775.3.3\n*Cost of trial borings: \u00a32,11.5.0\n*Permanent Way materials on bridge: \u00a3103.3.7\n*Engineer's expenses for supervisor: \u00a3793.3.5\n\nFew major modifications have been made to the Albury Bridge with the most significant change probably being the opening of a Standard Gauge track linking Albury to [[Melbourne]] on 12 April 1962, with normal passenger services commencing on 16 April 1962.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nTwo former railway lattice bridges (1885 [[Georges River]] bridge at [[Como, New South Wales|Como]] and 1886 [[Parramatta River]] bridge at [[Meadowbank, New South Wales|Meadowbank]]) were decommissioned for railway use but remain in use as pedestrian walkways /cycle ways. The 1871 wrought iron rail bridge over the [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]] at [[Aberdeen, New South Wales|Aberdeen]] was replaced by another bridge and demolished and the 1881 rail bridge over the Murrumbidgee River at [[Wagga Wagga]] was demolished in 2006 and replaced by a concrete structure.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Albury Murray River Bridge is a double track, 3 [[Span (architecture)|span]] [[wrought iron]] [[Latticework|lattice]] underbridge. It is a two span continuous lattice bridge with overhead transverse frames for stabilising the top flanges. The spans are {{convert|159|ft|m|order=flip}} to centres of [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and the lattice work has six triangulations. The piers are pairs of cast iron cylinders supplied by Stockton Forge Co. from England. It is the only double track lattice bridge in service, the other was at Meadowbank, and is one of the second set of six wrought iron lattice bridges with 4-triangular lattice. It was also the first of the two-track lattice bridges constructed on the NSW railway system.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nThe line remains in use. It was reported as being in satisfactory condition in 2008. Apart from relatively minor technical works, repairs and strengthening, the Albury bridge is highly intact.<ref name=nswshr-1020/> One of the tracks is currently closed that the line is being used as a single line. \n\n== Heritage listing ==\n\nThe wrought iron lattice Albury Murray River underbridge is a major early structure associated with the \"father\" of the NSW railways, John Whitton, and geographically linked to Albury Railway Precinct, one of the most significant railway sites in the NSW. It is an excellent example of a wrought iron lattice bridge, a design that was used extensively for bridge construction during the first major phase of railway construction in NSW in the late 19th century. It is a historically and aesthetically significant structure and a prominent landmark on the NSW/[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] border.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nIt is one of only two double track bridges of this design, the other being the wrought iron lattice Parramatta River bridge at Meadowbank (no longer in use for rail traffic) and is still in use, carrying both standard gauge (NSW) and broad gauge (Victorian) railway lines. It is the 7th oldest lattice bridge in the NSW rail system, being constructed in the second phase of wrought iron lattice bridge construction (one of the 2nd set of six such bridges).<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nAlbury rail bridge over Murray River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nTwelve wrought iron lattice railway bridges were built in NSW during the boom period for railway construction 1871-1887, starting at Aberdeen and ending at Cowra.
