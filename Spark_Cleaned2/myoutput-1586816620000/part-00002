They belong to the tradition of [[panel painting]], one of the most highly regarded forms of art in the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]]. The Fayum portraits are the only large body of art from that tradition to have survived. They were formerly, and incorrectly, called Coptic portraits.\n\nMummy portraits have been found across [[Egypt]], but are most common in the [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum Basin]], particularly from [[Hawara]] in the Fayum Basin and the [[Hadrian]]ic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city [[Antinoopolis]]. \"Faiyum Portraits\" is generally used as a stylistic, rather than a geographic, description. While painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases date back to pharaonic times, the Faiyum mummy portraits were an innovation dating to the time of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule in Egypt]].<ref>Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. <cite>Arts of Ancient Egypt</cite>. p.193. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}</ref>\n\nThe portraits date to the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman era]], from the late 1st century BC or the early 1st century AD onwards. It is not clear when their production ended, but recent research suggests the middle of the 3rd century. They are among the largest groups among the very few survivors of the [[panel painting]] tradition of the classical world, which was continued into [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and Western traditions in the post-classical world, including the local tradition of [[Coptic art|Coptic iconography]] in Egypt.\n\nThe portraits covered the faces of bodies that were mummified for burial. Extant examples indicate that they were mounted into the bands of cloth that were used to wrap the bodies. Almost all have now been detached from the mummies.<ref>Examples still attached are in the [[Egyptian Museum]], [[Cairo]] and the British Museum</ref> They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] [[Ancient Roman art|artistic traditions]] than [[Ancient Egyptian art|Egyptian ones]].<ref>Oakes, Lorna.

Due to the hot dry Egyptian climate, the paintings are frequently very well preserved, often retaining their brilliant colours seemingly unfaded by time.\n\n== History of research ==\n\n===Pre-19th century===\n[[Image:Engraving of finding mummies in Sakkara by Pietro Della Valle.gif|thumb|upright| Mummies' discovery by Pietro Della Valle]]\nThe Italian explorer [[Pietro della Valle]], on a visit to [[Saqqara]]-[[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in 1615, was the first European to discover and describe mummy portraits. He transported some mummies with portraits to Europe, which are now in the [[Albertinum]] ([[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden]]).<ref name=\"Borg 10\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 10f.</ref>\n\n===19th-century collectors===\nAlthough interest in Ancient Egypt steadily increased after that period, further finds of mummy portraits did not become known before the early 19th century. The provenance of these first new finds is unclear; they may come from [[Saqqara]] as well, or perhaps from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. In 1820, the Baron of Minotuli acquired several mummy portraits for a German collector, but they became part of a whole shipload of Egyptian artifacts lost in the [[North Sea]]. In 1827, L\u00e9on de Laborde brought two portraits, supposedly found in Memphis, to Europe, one of which can today be seen at the [[Louvre]], the other in the [[British Museum]]. [[Ippolito Rosellini]], a member of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]]'s 1828/29 expedition to Egypt, brought a further portrait back to [[Florence]]. It is so similar to de Laborde's specimens that it is thought to be from the same source.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/> During the 1820s, the British [[Consul General]] to Egypt, [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], sent several further portraits to [[Paris]] and [[London]]. Some of them were long considered portraits of the family of the Theban [[Archon]] Pollios Soter, a historical character known from written sources, but this has turned out to be incorrect.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/>\n\nOnce again, a long period elapsed before more mummy portraits came to light. In 1887, Daniel Marie Fouquet heard of the discovery of numerous portrait mummies in a cave. He set off to inspect them some days later, but arrived too late, as the finders had used the painted plaques for firewood during the three previous cold desert nights. Fouquet acquired the remaining two of what had originally been fifty portraits. While the exact location of this find is unclear, the likely source is from er-Rubayat.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/> At that location, not long after Fouquet's visit, the Viennese art trader Theodor Graf found several further images, which he tried to sell as profitably as possible. He engaged the famous [[Leipzig]]-based [[Egyptologist]] [[Georg Ebers]] to publish his finds. He produced presentation folders to advertise his individual finds throughout Europe. Although little was known about their archaeological find contexts, Graf went as far as to ascribe the portraits to known [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] pharaohs by analogy with other works of art, mainly coin portraits. None of these associations were particularly well argued or convincing, but they gained him much attention, not least because he gained the support of well-known scholars like [[Rudolf Virchow]]. As a result, mummy portraits became the centre of much attention.<ref name=\"Barbara Borg 1998\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 13f., 34ff.</ref> By the late 19th century, their very specific aesthetic made them sought-after collection pieces, distributed by the global arts trade.\n\n===Archaeological study: Flinders Petrie===\n[[Image:Fayum-07.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Detail of a portrait within its mummy wrappings, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1911.]]\nIn parallel, more scientific engagement with the portraits was beginning. In 1887, the British archaeologist [[Flinders Petrie]] started [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] at [[Hawara]]. He discovered a Roman [[necropolis]] which yielded 81 portrait mummies in the first year of excavation. At an exhibition in London, these portraits drew large crowds. In the following year, Petrie continued excavations at the same location but now suffered from the competition of a German and an Egyptian art dealer. Petrie returned in the winter of 1910/11 and excavated a further 70 portrait mummies, some of them quite badly preserved.{{sfnp|Petrie|1911|p=1}} With very few exceptions, Petrie's studies still provide the only examples of mummy portraits so far found as the result of systematic excavation and published properly. Although the published studies are not entirely up to modern standards, they remain the most important source for the find contexts of portrait mummies.\n\n===Late-19th- and early-20th-century collectors===\nIn 1892, the German archaeologist von Kaufmann discovered the so-called \"[[Tomb of Aline]]\", which held three mummy portraits; among the most famous today. Other important sources of such finds are at [[Antinopolis|Antino\u00f6polis]] and [[Akhmim]]. The French archaeologist Albert Gayet worked at Antino\u00f6polis and found much relevant material, but his work, like that of many of his contemporaries, does not satisfy modern standards. His documentation is incomplete, many of his finds remain without context.\n\n===Museums===\nToday, mummy portraits are represented in all important archaeological museums of the world. Many have fine examples on display, notably the [[British Museum]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Louvre]] in Paris.<ref name=\"Hoesch\">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienportr\u00e4ts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=464}}</ref> Because they were mostly recovered through inappropriate and unprofessional means, virtually all are without archaeological context, a fact which consistently lowers the quality of archaeological and culture-historical information they provide. As a result, their overall significance as well as their specific interpretations remain controversial.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/>\n\n== Materials and techniques ==\nA majority of images show a formal portrait of a single figure, facing and looking toward the viewer, from an angle that is usually slightly turned from full face. The figures are presented as busts against a monochrome background which in some instances are decorated. The individuals are both male and female and range in age from childhood to old age.\n\n===Painted surface===\n<gallery widths=200px heights=140px>\nMummy portrait of a man from Fayum, Hawara, modern-day Egypt.

British Museum\n</gallery>\nThe majority of preserved mummy portraits were painted on boards or panels, made from different imported hardwoods, including [[oak]], [[Lime tree|lime]], [[sycamore]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[cypress]], [[ficus|fig]], and [[citrus]].<ref>Wrede, L\u00c4 IV, 218</ref> The wood was cut into thin rectangular panels and made smooth. The finished panels were set into layers of wrapping that enclosed the body and were surrounded by bands of cloth, giving the effect of a window-like opening through which the face of the deceased could be seen. Portraits were sometimes painted directly onto the canvas or rags of the mummy wrapping ([[cartonnage]] painting).\n\n===Painting techniques===\n\nThe wooden surface was sometimes primed for painting with a layer of plaster. In some cases the primed layer reveals a preparatory drawing.\nTwo painting techniques were employed: [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) painting and animal glue [[tempera]].  The encaustic images are striking because of the  contrast between vivid and rich colours, and comparatively large brush-strokes, producing an \"[[Impressionistic]]\" effect. The tempera paintings have a finer gradation of tones and chalkier colours, giving a more restrained appearance.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> In some cases, [[gold leaf]] was used to depict jewellery and wreaths. There also are examples of hybrid techniques or of variations from the main techniques.\n\nThe Fayum portraits reveal a wide range of painterly expertise and skill in presenting a lifelike appearance. The naturalism of the portraits is often revealed in knowledge of anatomic structure and in skilled modelling of the form by the use of light and shade, which gives an appearance of three-dimensionality to most of the figures. The graded flesh tones are enhanced with shadows and highlights indicative of directional lighting.\n\n==Subjects and social context of the paintings==\n<gallery heights=200px widths=140px>\nPortrait of the Boy Eutyches - Metmuseum 18.9.2.jpg||Portrait of a boy, identified by inscription as Eutyches, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nEgyptian - Mummy Portrait of a Man - Walters 323.jpg|A portrait from the late 1st century AD.

According to Walker, [[Computed tomography|C.A.T.]] scans  reveal a correspondence of age and sex between mummy and image. He concludes that the age distribution reflects the low life expectancy at the time. It was often believed that the wax portraits were completed during the life of the individual and displayed in their home, a custom that belonged to the traditions of [[Greek art]],<ref>''Encyclopedia Of Ancient Greece'', Nigel Guy, Routledge Taylor and Francis group, p. 601</ref> but this view is no longer widely held given the evidence suggested by the C.A.T. scans of the Faiyum mummies, as well as Roman census returns. In addition, some portraits were painted directly onto the coffin; for example, on a shroud or another part.\n\n===Social status===\nThe patrons of the portraits apparently belonged to the affluent upper class of military personnel, civil servants and religious dignitaries. Not everyone could afford a mummy portrait; many mummies were found without one. Flinders Petrie states that only one or two per cent of the mummies he excavated were embellished with portraits.<ref name=\"Borg 58\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 58</ref> The rates for mummy portraits do not survive, but it can be assumed that the material caused higher costs than the labour, since in antiquity, painters were appreciated as craftsmen rather than as artists.<ref name=\"Borg 58\"/> The situation from the \"[[Tomb of Aline]]\" is interesting in this regard. It contained four mummies: those of Aline, of two children and of her husband. Unlike his wife and children, the latter was not equipped with a portrait but with a gilt three-dimensional mask. Perhaps plaster masks were preferred if they could be afforded.\n\n[[Image:FuneraryMasksRomanEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Three-dimensional funerary masks of painted plaster from Faiyum (1st century), [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]].]]\n\nBased on literary, archaeological and genetic studies, it appears that those depicted were native Egyptians, who had adopted the dominant Greco-Roman culture.<ref name=Verena>{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999}}</ref> The name of some of those portrayed are known from inscriptions; they are predominantly Greek. Hairstyles and clothing are always influenced by Roman fashion. Women and children are often depicted wearing valuable ornaments and fine garments, men often wearing specific and elaborate outfits. Greek inscriptions of names are relatively common, sometimes they include professions. It is not known whether such inscriptions always reflect reality, or whether they may state ideal conditions or aspirations rather than true conditions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienportr\u00e4ts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=465}}</ref> One single inscription is known to definitely indicate the deceased's profession (a shipowner) correctly. The mummy of a woman named Hermione also included the term ''grammatike'' (\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae). For a long time, it was assumed that this indicated that she was a teacher by profession (for this reason, Flinders Petrie donated the portrait to [[Girton College]], [[Cambridge]], the first residential college for women in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]), but today, it is assumed that the term indicates her level of education. Some portraits of men show sword-belts or even pommels, suggesting that they were members of the Roman military.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 53\u201355</ref>\n\n== Culture-historical context ==\n\n===Changes in burial habits===\n[[File:Gold-glass portrait of a woman (Turin).jpg|thumb|[[Gold glass]] [[miniature portrait]] of a woman, probably 3rd century. One of a small group of such portraits, some probably made in [[Alexandria]]]]\nThe burial habits of [[Ptolemaic Dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Egyptians mostly followed ancient traditions. The bodies of members of the upper classes were [[mummy|mummified]], equipped with a decorated coffin and a mummy mask to cover the head. The [[Greeks]] who entered Egypt at that time mostly followed their own habits. There is evidence from [[Alexandria]] and other sites indicating that they practised the Greek tradition of [[cremation]]. This broadly reflects the general situation in [[Hellenistic]] Egypt, its rulers proclaiming themselves to be [[pharaoh]]s but otherwise living in an entirely Hellenistic world, incorporating only very few local elements. Conversely, the Egyptians only slowly developed an interest in the Greek-Hellenic culture that dominated the [[East Mediterranean]] since the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. This situation changed substantially with the arrival of the Romans. Within a few generations, all Egyptian elements disappeared from everyday life. Cities like [[Karanis]] or [[Oxyrhynchus]] are largely Graeco-Roman places. There is clear evidence that this resulted from a mixing of different ethnicities in the ruling classes of Roman Egypt.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 40\u201356</ref>{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=17\u201320}}\n\n===Religious continuity===\nOnly in the sphere of religion is there evidence for a continuation of Egyptian traditions. Egyptian temples were erected as late as the 2nd century. In terms of burial habits, Egyptian and Hellenistic elements now mixed. Coffins became increasingly unpopular and went entirely out of use by the 2nd century. In contrast, mummification appears to have been practised by large parts of the population. The mummy mask, originally an Egyptian concept, grew more and more Graeco-Roman in style, Egyptian motifs became ever rarer. The adoption of Roman portrait painting into Egyptian burial cult belongs into this general context.<ref>summarised in: Judith A. Corbelli: ''The Art of Death in Graeco-Roman Egypt'', Princes Risborough 2006 {{ISBN|0-7478-0647-0}}</ref>\n\n===Link with Roman funeral masks?===\nSome authors suggest that the idea of such portraits may be related to the custom among the [[nobiles|Roman nobility]] of displaying ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|imagines]]'', images of their ancestors, in the [[domus|atrium of their house]]. In funeral processions, these wax masks were worn by professional mourners to emphasize the continuity of an illustrious family line, but originally perhaps to represent a deeper evocation of the presence of the dead. [[Roman festivals]] such as the [[Parentalia]] as well as [[Religion in ancient Rome#Domestic and private cult|everyday domestic rituals]] cultivated ancestral spirits (see also [[veneration of the dead]]). The development of mummy portraiture may represent a combination of Egyptian and [[Roman funerals and burial|Roman funerary tradition]], since it appears only after Egypt was established as a [[Roman province]].<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 78</ref>\n\n===\"Salon paintings\"?===\nThe images depict the heads or busts of men, women and children. They probably date from c. 30 BC to the 3rd century.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienportr\u00e4ts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=464}} Other scholars, e.g. Barbara Borg, suggest that they start under [[Tiberius]].</ref> To the modern eye, the portraits appear highly individualistic. Therefore, it has been assumed for a long time that they were produced during the lifetime of their subjects and displayed as \"salon paintings\" within their houses, to be added to their mummy wrapping after their death. Newer research rather suggests that they were only painted after death,<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> an idea perhaps contradicted by the multiple paintings on some specimens and the (suggested) change of specific details on others. The individualism of those depicted was actually created by variations in some specific details, within a largely unvaried general scheme.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> The habit of depicting the deceased was not a new one, but the painted images gradually replaced the earlier Egyptian masks, although the latter continued in use for some time, often occurring directly adjacent to portrait mummies, sometimes even in the same graves.\n\n===Realism and convention===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n<gallery heights=200px widths=140px>\nEgitto romano, ritratto di giovane uomo, su copritesta di mummia, I secolo dc.jpg|Fayum mummy portrait of a man, 1st century AD, Oriental Institute, Chicago\nHomme avec barbe, portrait fun\u00e9raire, Fayoum, \u00c9gypte.jpg|Fayum portrait of a man, mid-2nd century, Myers Collection, [[Eton College]].\nEpoca romana, ritratto femminile del fayum, IV sec dc.JPG|Fayum portrait of a woman, 4th century, Museo archeologico nazionale, Florence\nFayum-18.jpg|Fayum portrait of a woman, 2nd century, Manchester Museum, University of Manchester\n</gallery>\n\nTogether with the painted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan tombs]], the [[Lucanians|Lucanian]] tombs and the [[Tomb of the Diver]] in [[Paestum]], the frescoes from [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and the [[Greek vase]]s, they are the best preserved paintings from ancient times and are renowned for their remarkable [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]]. It is, however, debatable whether the portraits depict the subjects as they really were. Analyses have shown that the painters depicted faces according to conventions in a repetitive and formulaic way, albeit with a variety of hairstyles and beards. They appear to have worked from a number of standard types without making detailed observations of the unique facial proportions of specific individuals which give each face its own personality.\n\n===Style===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe combination of naturalistic Greek portrait of the deceased with Egyptian-form deities, symbols, and frame was primarily phenomenon of funerary art from the chora, or countryside, in Roman Egypt. Combining Egyptian and Greek pictorial forms or motifs was not restricted to funerary art, however: the public and highly visible portraits of Ptolemaic dynasts and Roman emperors grafted iconography developed for a ruler\u2019s Greek or Roman images onto Egyptian statues in the dress and posture of Egyptian kings and queens. The possible combinations of Greek and Egyptian elements can be elucidated by imposing a (somewhat artificial) distinction between form and content, where \u2018form\u2019 is taken as the system of representation, and \u2018content\u2019 as the symbol, concept, or figure being portrayed.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Christina Riggs |title=The Beautiful Burial in Roman Egypt: Art, Identity, and Funerary Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2005 |p=11 |ISBN=9780191534874}}</ref>\n\n==Coexistence with other burial habits==\nThe religious meaning of mummy portraits has not, so far, been fully explained, nor have associated grave rites. There is some indication that it developed from genuine Egyptian funerary rites, adapted by a multi-cultural ruling class.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> The tradition of mummy portraits occurred from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] to [[Nubia]], but it is striking that other funerary habits prevailed over portrait mummies at all sites except those in the Faiyum (and there especially Hawara and Achmim) and Antinoopolis. In most sites, different forms of burial coexisted. The choice of grave type may have been determined to a large extent by the financial means and status of the deceased, modified by local customs. Portrait mummies have been found both in rock-cut tombs and in freestanding built grave complexes, but also in shallow pits. It is striking that they are virtually never accompanied by any grave offerings, with the exception of occasional pots or sprays of flowers.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 31</ref>\n\n==End of the mummy portrait tradition==\n<gallery heights=200px widths=140px>\nArte romano-egizia, mummia di herakleides, 50-100, 02.JPG|Fayum mummy portrait of a man named Herakleides, 50\u2013100 AD, [[Getty Villa]]\nGetty Villa - Collection (5304932007).jpg|Portrait of a woman named Isidora from [[Ankyronpolis]], 100-110 AD, Getty Villa\nGetty Villa - Collection (5305528696).jpg|Fayum portrait of a woman from [[Hawara]], 75\u2013100 AD, Getty Villa\nMummy Portrait of a Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|Mummy portrait of a woman, tempera on wood, 170\u2013200 AD, [[Getty Center]]\n</gallery>\nFor a long time, it was assumed that the latest portraits belong to the end of the 4th century, but recent research has modified this view considerably, suggesting that the last wooden portraits belong to the middle, the last directly painted mummy wrappings to the second half of the 3rd century. It is commonly accepted that production reduced considerably since the beginning of the 3rd century. Several reasons for the decline of the mummy portrait have been suggested; no single reason should probably be isolated, rather, they should be seen as operating together.\n\n*In the 3rd century the Roman Empire underwent a severe economic crisis, severely limiting the financial abilities of the upper classes. Although they continued to lavishly spend money on representation, they favoured public appearances, like games and festivals, over the production of portraits. However, other elements of sepulchral representation, like [[sarcophagi]], did continue.\n*There is evidence of a religious crisis at the same time. This may not be as closely connected with the rise of Christianity as previously assumed. (The earlier suggestion of a 4th-century end to the portraits would coincide with the widespread distribution of Christianity in Egypt. Christianity also never banned mummification.) An increasing neglect of Egyptian temples is noticeable during the Roman imperial period, leading to a general drop in interest in all ancient religions.\n*The [[Constitutio Antoniniana]], i.e. the granting of Roman citizenship to all free subjects changed the social structures of Egypt. For the first time, the individual cities gained a degree of self-administration. At the same time, the provincial upper classes changed in terms of both composition and inter-relations.\nThus, a combination of several factors appears to have led to changes of fashion and ritual. No clear causality can be asserted.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 88\u2013101</ref>\n\nConsidering the limited nature of the current understanding of portrait mummies, it remains distinctly possible that future research will considerably modify the image presented here. For example, some scholars suspect that the centre of production of such finds, and thus the centre of the distinctive funerary tradition they represent, may have been located at Alexandria. New finds from [[Marina el-Alamein]] strongly support such a  view.<ref name=\"Barbara Borg 1998\"/> In view of the near-total loss of Greek and Roman paintings, mummy portraits are today considered to be among the very rare examples of ancient art that can be seen to reflect \"Great paintings\" and especially Roman portrait painting.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/>\n{{clear}}\n==Mummy portraits as sources on provincial Roman fashion==\n\n===Provincial fashions===\nMummy portraits depict a variety of different hairstyles. They are one of the main aids in dating the paintings. The majority of the deceased were depicted with hairstyles then in fashion. They are frequently similar to those depicted in [[sculpture]]. As part of Roman propaganda, such sculptures, especially those depicting the imperial family, were often displayed throughout the empire. Thus, they had a direct influence on the development of fashion. Nevertheless, the mummy portraits, as well as other finds, suggest that fashions lasted longer in the provinces than in the imperial court, or at least that diverse styles might coexist.\n\n===Hairstyles===\n<gallery heights=200px widths=140px>\nFayum-13.jpg|Depiction of a woman with curly hair, wearing a violet chiton and cloak and pendant earrings. [[British Museum]]\nEgyptian - Female Portrait Mask - Walters 325.jpg|The plaited hairstyle of this elite woman makes it possible to date this painting to the reign of [[Trajan]] (AD 98 \u2013 117). [[Walters Art Museum]]\nFayum-11.jpg|Depiction of a woman with a ringlet hairstyle, an orange chiton with black bands and rod-shaped earrings. [[Museum of Scotland]]\n</gallery>\nSince Roman men tended to wear short-cropped hair, female hairstyles are a better source of evidence for changes in fashion. The female portraits suggest a coarse chronological scheme: Simple hairstyles with a central parting in the [[Tiberius|Tiberian]] period are followed by more complex ringlet hairstyles, nested plaits and [[toupee|curly toup\u00e9es]] over the forehead in the late 1st century. Small oval nested plaits dominate the time of the [[Antonines]], simple central-parting hairstyles with a hairknot in the neck occur in the second half of the 2nd century. The time of [[Septimius Severus]] was characterised by [[toup\u00e9e]]-like fluffy as well as strict, straight styles, followed by looped plaits on the crown of the head. The latter belong to the very final phase of mummy portraits, and have only been noted on a few mummy wrappings. It seems to be the case that curly hairstyles were especially popular in Egypt.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 45\u201349</ref>\n\n===Clothing===\nLike the hairstyles, the clothing depicted also follows the general fashions of the Roman Empire, as known from statues and busts. Both men and women tend to wear a thin [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] as an undergarment. Above it, both sexes tend to wear a cloak, laid across the shoulders or wound around the torso. The males wear virtually exclusively white, while female clothing is often red or pink, but can also be yellow, white, blue or purple. The chiton often bears a decorative line (''[[laticlave|clavus]]''), occasionally light red or light green, also sometimes gold, but normally in dark colours. Some painted mummy wrappings from Antinoopolis depict garments with long sleeves and very wide ''clavi''. So far, not a single portrait has been definitely shown to depict the [[toga]], a key symbol of Roman citizenship. It should, however, be kept in mind that Greek cloaks and togas are draped very similarly on depictions of the 1st and early 2nd centuries. In the late 2nd and 3rd centuries, togas should be distinguishable, but fail to occur.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 49\u201351</ref>\n\n===Jewelry===\nApart from the gold [[wreath]]s worn by many men, with very few exceptions, only women are depicted with jewellery. This generally accords with the common jewellery types of the Graeco-Roman East. Especially the Antinoopolis portraits depict simple gold link chains and massive gold rings. There are also depictions of [[precious stone|precious]] or [[semi-precious stones]] like [[emerald]], [[carnelian]], [[garnet]], [[agate]] or [[amethyst]], rarely also of [[pearl]]s. The stones were normally ground into cylindrical or spherical beads. Some portraits depict elaborate [[collier (necklace)|colliers]], with precious stones set in gold.\n\nThe gold wreath was apparently rarely, if ever, worn in life, but a number have been found in graves from much earlier periods. Based on the plant wreaths given as prizes in contests, the idea was apparently to celebrate the achievements of the deceased in life.\n\nThere are three basic shapes of ear ornaments: Especially common in the 1st century are circular or drop-shaped pendants. Archaeological finds indicate that these were fully or semi-spherical. Later tastes favoured S-shaped hooks of gold wire, on which up to five beads of different colours and materials could be strung. The third shape are elaborate pendants with a horizontal bar from which two or three, occasionally four, vertical rods are suspended, usually each decorated with a white bead or pearl at the bottom. Other common ornaments include gold hairpins, often decorated with pearls, fine [[diadem (personal wear)|diadems]], and, especially at Antinoopolis, gold [[hairnet]]s. Many portraits also depict [[amulet]]s and [[pendant]]s, perhaps with magical functions.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\u201eDer zierlichste Anblick der Welt ....\u201c \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 51\u201352</ref>\n\n== Art-historical significance ==\n[[Image:Septimusseverustondo.jpg|thumb|Tondo with images of Septimius Severus and his family. [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].]]\nThe mummy portraits have immense art-historical importance. Ancient sources indicate that [[panel painting]] (rather than [[wall painting]]), i.e. painting on wood or other mobile surfaces was held in high regard. But very few ancient panel paintings\nsurvive. One of the few examples besides the mummy portraits is the [[Severan Tondo]], also from Egypt (around 200), which, like the mummy portraits, is believed to represent a provincial version of contemporary style.{{refn|1=Other examples: a framed portrait from Hawara,{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=121\u2013122, Nr. 117}} the image of a man flanked by two deities from the same site,{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=123\u2013124, Nr. 119}} or the 6th century BC panels from Pitsa in Greece.<ref>[https://www.sikyon.com/sicyon/Painting/spainting_eg.html]</ref>}}\nSome aspects of the mummy portraits, especially their frontal perspective and their concentration on key facial features, strongly resemble later [[icon painting]]. A direct link has been suggested, but it should be kept in mind that the mummy portraits represent only a small part of a much wider Graeco-Roman tradition, the whole of which later bore an influence on [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] and [[Byzantine Art]]. A pair of panel \"icons\" of [[Serapis]] and [[Isis]] of comparable date (3rd century) and style are in the [[Getty Museum]] at [[Malibu, California|Malibu]];<ref>[https://www.aisthesis.de/wbock/bilder/4-9si.gif image]</ref> as with the cult of [[Mithras]], earlier examples of cult images were sculptures or pottery figurines, but from the 3rd century reliefs and then painted images are found.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Kurt Weitzmann]] |title=The Icon |date=1982 |publisher=Evans Brothers Ltd |location=London |p=3 |others=(trans of Le Icone, Montadori 1981) |ISBN=0-237-45645-1}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Panel painting]]\n*[[Ancient Roman art]]\n*[[Faiyum]]\n*[[Coptic art]]\n*[[Coptic Museum]]\n*[[Pitsa panels]]\n*[[Malibu Painter]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n(chronological order)\n\n* {{cite book|author=W.

They belong to the tradition of [[panel painting]], one of the most highly regarded forms of art in the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]]. The Fayum portraits are the only large body of art from that tradition to have survived. They were formerly, and incorrectly, called Coptic portraits.\n\nMummy portraits have been found across [[Egypt]], but are most common in the [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum Basin]], particularly from [[Hawara]] in the Fayum Basin and the [[Hadrian]]ic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city [[Antinoopolis]]. \"Faiyum Portraits\" is generally used as a stylistic, rather than a geographic, description. While painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases date back to pharaonic times, the Faiyum mummy portraits were an innovation dating to the time of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule in Egypt]].<ref>Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. <cite>Arts of Ancient Egypt</cite>. p.193. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}</ref>\n\nThe portraits date to the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman era]], from the late 1st century BC or the early 1st century AD onwards. It is not clear when their production ended, but recent research suggests the middle of the 3rd century. They are among the largest groups among the very few survivors of the [[panel painting]] tradition of the classical world, which was continued into [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and Western traditions in the post-classical world, including the local tradition of [[Coptic art|Coptic iconography]] in Egypt.\n\nThe portraits covered the faces of bodies that were mummified for burial. Extant examples indicate that they were mounted into the bands of cloth that were used to wrap the bodies. Almost all have now been detached from the mummies.<ref>Examples still attached are in the [[Egyptian Museum]], [[Cairo]] and the British Museum</ref> They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally.

He transported some mummies with portraits to Europe, which are now in the [[Albertinum]] ([[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden]]).<ref name=\"Borg 10\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 10f.</ref>\n\n===19th-century collectors===\nAlthough interest in Ancient Egypt steadily increased after that period, further finds of mummy portraits did not become known before the early 19th century. The provenance of these first new finds is unclear; they may come from [[Saqqara]] as well, or perhaps from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. In 1820, the Baron of Minotuli acquired several mummy portraits for a German collector, but they became part of a whole shipload of Egyptian artifacts lost in the [[North Sea]]. In 1827, L\u00e9on de Laborde brought two portraits, supposedly found in Memphis, to Europe, one of which can today be seen at the [[Louvre]], the other in the [[British Museum]]. [[Ippolito Rosellini]], a member of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]]'s 1828/29 expedition to Egypt, brought a further portrait back to [[Florence]]. It is so similar to de Laborde's specimens that it is thought to be from the same source.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/> During the 1820s, the British [[Consul General]] to Egypt, [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], sent several further portraits to [[Paris]] and [[London]]. Some of them were long considered portraits of the family of the Theban [[Archon]] Pollios Soter, a historical character known from written sources, but this has turned out to be incorrect.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/>\n\nOnce again, a long period elapsed before more mummy portraits came to light. In 1887, Daniel Marie Fouquet heard of the discovery of numerous portrait mummies in a cave. He set off to inspect them some days later, but arrived too late, as the finders had used the painted plaques for firewood during the three previous cold desert nights. Fouquet acquired the remaining two of what had originally been fifty portraits. While the exact location of this find is unclear, the likely source is from er-Rubayat.<ref name=\"Borg 10\"/> At that location, not long after Fouquet's visit, the Viennese art trader Theodor Graf found several further images, which he tried to sell as profitably as possible. He engaged the famous [[Leipzig]]-based [[Egyptologist]] [[Georg Ebers]] to publish his finds. He produced presentation folders to advertise his individual finds throughout Europe. Although little was known about their archaeological find contexts, Graf went as far as to ascribe the portraits to known [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] pharaohs by analogy with other works of art, mainly coin portraits. None of these associations were particularly well argued or convincing, but they gained him much attention, not least because he gained the support of well-known scholars like [[Rudolf Virchow]]. As a result, mummy portraits became the centre of much attention.<ref name=\"Barbara Borg 1998\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 13f., 34ff.</ref> By the late 19th century, their very specific aesthetic made them sought-after collection pieces, distributed by the global arts trade.\n\n===Archaeological study: Flinders Petrie===\n[[Image:Fayum-07.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Detail of a portrait within its mummy wrappings, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1911.]]\nIn parallel, more scientific engagement with the portraits was beginning. In 1887, the British archaeologist [[Flinders Petrie]] started [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] at [[Hawara]]. He discovered a Roman [[necropolis]] which yielded 81 portrait mummies in the first year of excavation. At an exhibition in London, these portraits drew large crowds. In the following year, Petrie continued excavations at the same location but now suffered from the competition of a German and an Egyptian art dealer. Petrie returned in the winter of 1910/11 and excavated a further 70 portrait mummies, some of them quite badly preserved.{{sfnp|Petrie|1911|p=1}} With very few exceptions, Petrie's studies still provide the only examples of mummy portraits so far found as the result of systematic excavation and published properly. Although the published studies are not entirely up to modern standards, they remain the most important source for the find contexts of portrait mummies.\n\n===Late-19th- and early-20th-century collectors===\nIn 1892, the German archaeologist von Kaufmann discovered the so-called \"[[Tomb of Aline]]\", which held three mummy portraits; among the most famous today. Other important sources of such finds are at [[Antinopolis|Antino\u00f6polis]] and [[Akhmim]]. The French archaeologist Albert Gayet worked at Antino\u00f6polis and found much relevant material, but his work, like that of many of his contemporaries, does not satisfy modern standards. His documentation is incomplete, many of his finds remain without context.\n\n===Museums===\nToday, mummy portraits are represented in all important archaeological museums of the world. Many have fine examples on display, notably the [[British Museum]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Louvre]] in Paris.<ref name=\"Hoesch\">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienportr\u00e4ts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=464}}</ref> Because they were mostly recovered through inappropriate and unprofessional means, virtually all are without archaeological context, a fact which consistently lowers the quality of archaeological and culture-historical information they provide. As a result, their overall significance as well as their specific interpretations remain controversial.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/>\n\n== Materials and techniques ==\nA majority of images show a formal portrait of a single figure, facing and looking toward the viewer, from an angle that is usually slightly turned from full face. The figures are presented as busts against a monochrome background which in some instances are decorated. The individuals are both male and female and range in age from childhood to old age.\n\n===Painted surface===\n<gallery widths=200px heights=140px>\nMummy portrait of a man from Fayum, Hawara, modern-day Egypt.

British Museum\n</gallery>\nThe majority of preserved mummy portraits were painted on boards or panels, made from different imported hardwoods, including [[oak]], [[Lime tree|lime]], [[sycamore]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[cypress]], [[ficus|fig]], and [[citrus]].<ref>Wrede, L\u00c4 IV, 218</ref> The wood was cut into thin rectangular panels and made smooth. The finished panels were set into layers of wrapping that enclosed the body and were surrounded by bands of cloth, giving the effect of a window-like opening through which the face of the deceased could be seen. Portraits were sometimes painted directly onto the canvas or rags of the mummy wrapping ([[cartonnage]] painting).\n\n===Painting techniques===\n\nThe wooden surface was sometimes primed for painting with a layer of plaster. In some cases the primed layer reveals a preparatory drawing.\nTwo painting techniques were employed: [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) painting and animal glue [[tempera]].  The encaustic images are striking because of the  contrast between vivid and rich colours, and comparatively large brush-strokes, producing an \"[[Impressionistic]]\" effect. The tempera paintings have a finer gradation of tones and chalkier colours, giving a more restrained appearance.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> In some cases, [[gold leaf]] was used to depict jewellery and wreaths. There also are examples of hybrid techniques or of variations from the main techniques.\n\nThe Fayum portraits reveal a wide range of painterly expertise and skill in presenting a lifelike appearance. The naturalism of the portraits is often revealed in knowledge of anatomic structure and in skilled modelling of the form by the use of light and shade, which gives an appearance of three-dimensionality to most of the figures. The graded flesh tones are enhanced with shadows and highlights indicative of directional lighting.\n\n==Subjects and social context of the paintings==\n<gallery heights=200px widths=140px>\nPortrait of the Boy Eutyches - Metmuseum 18.9.2.jpg||Portrait of a boy, identified by inscription as Eutyches, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nEgyptian - Mummy Portrait of a Man - Walters 323.jpg|A portrait from the late 1st century AD.

According to Walker, [[Computed tomography|C.A.T.]] scans  reveal a correspondence of age and sex between mummy and image. He concludes that the age distribution reflects the low life expectancy at the time. It was often believed that the wax portraits were completed during the life of the individual and displayed in their home, a custom that belonged to the traditions of [[Greek art]],<ref>''Encyclopedia Of Ancient Greece'', Nigel Guy, Routledge Taylor and Francis group, p. 601</ref> but this view is no longer widely held given the evidence suggested by the C.A.T. scans of the Faiyum mummies, as well as Roman census returns. In addition, some portraits were painted directly onto the coffin; for example, on a shroud or another part.\n\n===Social status===\nThe patrons of the portraits apparently belonged to the affluent upper class of military personnel, civil servants and religious dignitaries. Not everyone could afford a mummy portrait; many mummies were found without one. Flinders Petrie states that only one or two per cent of the mummies he excavated were embellished with portraits.<ref name=\"Borg 58\">Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 58</ref> The rates for mummy portraits do not survive, but it can be assumed that the material caused higher costs than the labour, since in antiquity, painters were appreciated as craftsmen rather than as artists.<ref name=\"Borg 58\"/> The situation from the \"[[Tomb of Aline]]\" is interesting in this regard. It contained four mummies: those of Aline, of two children and of her husband. Unlike his wife and children, the latter was not equipped with a portrait but with a gilt three-dimensional mask. Perhaps plaster masks were preferred if they could be afforded.\n\n[[Image:FuneraryMasksRomanEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Three-dimensional funerary masks of painted plaster from Faiyum (1st century), [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]].]]\n\nBased on literary, archaeological and genetic studies, it appears that those depicted were native Egyptians, who had adopted the dominant Greco-Roman culture.<ref name=Verena>{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999}}</ref> The name of some of those portrayed are known from inscriptions; they are predominantly Greek. Hairstyles and clothing are always influenced by Roman fashion. Women and children are often depicted wearing valuable ornaments and fine garments, men often wearing specific and elaborate outfits. Greek inscriptions of names are relatively common, sometimes they include professions. It is not known whether such inscriptions always reflect reality, or whether they may state ideal conditions or aspirations rather than true conditions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienportr\u00e4ts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=465}}</ref> One single inscription is known to definitely indicate the deceased's profession (a shipowner) correctly. The mummy of a woman named Hermione also included the term ''grammatike'' (\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae). For a long time, it was assumed that this indicated that she was a teacher by profession (for this reason, Flinders Petrie donated the portrait to [[Girton College]], [[Cambridge]], the first residential college for women in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]), but today, it is assumed that the term indicates her level of education. Some portraits of men show sword-belts or even pommels, suggesting that they were members of the Roman military.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 53\u201355</ref>\n\n== Culture-historical context ==\n\n===Changes in burial habits===\n[[File:Gold-glass portrait of a woman (Turin).jpg|thumb|[[Gold glass]] [[miniature portrait]] of a woman, probably 3rd century. One of a small group of such portraits, some probably made in [[Alexandria]]]]\nThe burial habits of [[Ptolemaic Dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Egyptians mostly followed ancient traditions. The bodies of members of the upper classes were [[mummy|mummified]], equipped with a decorated coffin and a mummy mask to cover the head. The [[Greeks]] who entered Egypt at that time mostly followed their own habits. There is evidence from [[Alexandria]] and other sites indicating that they practised the Greek tradition of [[cremation]]. This broadly reflects the general situation in [[Hellenistic]] Egypt, its rulers proclaiming themselves to be [[pharaoh]]s but otherwise living in an entirely Hellenistic world, incorporating only very few local elements. Conversely, the Egyptians only slowly developed an interest in the Greek-Hellenic culture that dominated the [[East Mediterranean]] since the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. This situation changed substantially with the arrival of the Romans. Within a few generations, all Egyptian elements disappeared from everyday life. Cities like [[Karanis]] or [[Oxyrhynchus]] are largely Graeco-Roman places. There is clear evidence that this resulted from a mixing of different ethnicities in the ruling classes of Roman Egypt.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 40\u201356</ref>{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=17\u201320}}\n\n===Religious continuity===\nOnly in the sphere of religion is there evidence for a continuation of Egyptian traditions. Egyptian temples were erected as late as the 2nd century. In terms of burial habits, Egyptian and Hellenistic elements now mixed. Coffins became increasingly unpopular and went entirely out of use by the 2nd century. In contrast, mummification appears to have been practised by large parts of the population. The mummy mask, originally an Egyptian concept, grew more and more Graeco-Roman in style, Egyptian motifs became ever rarer. The adoption of Roman portrait painting into Egyptian burial cult belongs into this general context.<ref>summarised in: Judith A. Corbelli: ''The Art of Death in Graeco-Roman Egypt'', Princes Risborough 2006 {{ISBN|0-7478-0647-0}}</ref>\n\n===Link with Roman funeral masks?===\nSome authors suggest that the idea of such portraits may be related to the custom among the [[nobiles|Roman nobility]] of displaying ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|imagines]]'', images of their ancestors, in the [[domus|atrium of their house]]. In funeral processions, these wax masks were worn by professional mourners to emphasize the continuity of an illustrious family line, but originally perhaps to represent a deeper evocation of the presence of the dead. [[Roman festivals]] such as the [[Parentalia]] as well as [[Religion in ancient Rome#Domestic and private cult|everyday domestic rituals]] cultivated ancestral spirits (see also [[veneration of the dead]]). The development of mummy portraiture may represent a combination of Egyptian and [[Roman funerals and burial|Roman funerary tradition]], since it appears only after Egypt was established as a [[Roman province]].<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 78</ref>\n\n===\"Salon paintings\"?===\nThe images depict the heads or busts of men, women and children. They probably date from c. 30 BC to the 3rd century.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nicola Hoesch|title=Mumienportr\u00e4ts|encyclopedia=[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]|volume=8|date=2000|p=464}} Other scholars, e.g. Barbara Borg, suggest that they start under [[Tiberius]].</ref> To the modern eye, the portraits appear highly individualistic. Therefore, it has been assumed for a long time that they were produced during the lifetime of their subjects and displayed as \"salon paintings\" within their houses, to be added to their mummy wrapping after their death. Newer research rather suggests that they were only painted after death,<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> an idea perhaps contradicted by the multiple paintings on some specimens and the (suggested) change of specific details on others. The individualism of those depicted was actually created by variations in some specific details, within a largely unvaried general scheme.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> The habit of depicting the deceased was not a new one, but the painted images gradually replaced the earlier Egyptian masks, although the latter continued in use for some time, often occurring directly adjacent to portrait mummies, sometimes even in the same graves.\n\n===Realism and convention===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n<gallery heights=200px widths=140px>\nEgitto romano, ritratto di giovane uomo, su copritesta di mummia, I secolo dc.jpg|Fayum mummy portrait of a man, 1st century AD, Oriental Institute, Chicago\nHomme avec barbe, portrait fun\u00e9raire, Fayoum, \u00c9gypte.jpg|Fayum portrait of a man, mid-2nd century, Myers Collection, [[Eton College]].\nEpoca romana, ritratto femminile del fayum, IV sec dc.JPG|Fayum portrait of a woman, 4th century, Museo archeologico nazionale, Florence\nFayum-18.jpg|Fayum portrait of a woman, 2nd century, Manchester Museum, University of Manchester\n</gallery>\n\nTogether with the painted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan tombs]], the [[Lucanians|Lucanian]] tombs and the [[Tomb of the Diver]] in [[Paestum]], the frescoes from [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and the [[Greek vase]]s, they are the best preserved paintings from ancient times and are renowned for their remarkable [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]]. It is, however, debatable whether the portraits depict the subjects as they really were. Analyses have shown that the painters depicted faces according to conventions in a repetitive and formulaic way, albeit with a variety of hairstyles and beards. They appear to have worked from a number of standard types without making detailed observations of the unique facial proportions of specific individuals which give each face its own personality.\n\n===Style===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe combination of naturalistic Greek portrait of the deceased with Egyptian-form deities, symbols, and frame was primarily phenomenon of funerary art from the chora, or countryside, in Roman Egypt. Combining Egyptian and Greek pictorial forms or motifs was not restricted to funerary art, however: the public and highly visible portraits of Ptolemaic dynasts and Roman emperors grafted iconography developed for a ruler\u2019s Greek or Roman images onto Egyptian statues in the dress and posture of Egyptian kings and queens. The possible combinations of Greek and Egyptian elements can be elucidated by imposing a (somewhat artificial) distinction between form and content, where \u2018form\u2019 is taken as the system of representation, and \u2018content\u2019 as the symbol, concept, or figure being portrayed.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Christina Riggs |title=The Beautiful Burial in Roman Egypt: Art, Identity, and Funerary Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2005 |p=11 |ISBN=9780191534874}}</ref>\n\n==Coexistence with other burial habits==\nThe religious meaning of mummy portraits has not, so far, been fully explained, nor have associated grave rites. There is some indication that it developed from genuine Egyptian funerary rites, adapted by a multi-cultural ruling class.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/> The tradition of mummy portraits occurred from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] to [[Nubia]], but it is striking that other funerary habits prevailed over portrait mummies at all sites except those in the Faiyum (and there especially Hawara and Achmim) and Antinoopolis. In most sites, different forms of burial coexisted. The choice of grave type may have been determined to a large extent by the financial means and status of the deceased, modified by local customs. Portrait mummies have been found both in rock-cut tombs and in freestanding built grave complexes, but also in shallow pits. It is striking that they are virtually never accompanied by any grave offerings, with the exception of occasional pots or sprays of flowers.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 31</ref>\n\n==End of the mummy portrait tradition==\n<gallery heights=200px widths=140px>\nArte romano-egizia, mummia di herakleides, 50-100, 02.JPG|Fayum mummy portrait of a man named Herakleides, 50\u2013100 AD, [[Getty Villa]]\nGetty Villa - Collection (5304932007).jpg|Portrait of a woman named Isidora from [[Ankyronpolis]], 100-110 AD, Getty Villa\nGetty Villa - Collection (5305528696).jpg|Fayum portrait of a woman from [[Hawara]], 75\u2013100 AD, Getty Villa\nMummy Portrait of a Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|Mummy portrait of a woman, tempera on wood, 170\u2013200 AD, [[Getty Center]]\n</gallery>\nFor a long time, it was assumed that the latest portraits belong to the end of the 4th century, but recent research has modified this view considerably, suggesting that the last wooden portraits belong to the middle, the last directly painted mummy wrappings to the second half of the 3rd century. It is commonly accepted that production reduced considerably since the beginning of the 3rd century. Several reasons for the decline of the mummy portrait have been suggested; no single reason should probably be isolated, rather, they should be seen as operating together.\n\n*In the 3rd century the Roman Empire underwent a severe economic crisis, severely limiting the financial abilities of the upper classes. Although they continued to lavishly spend money on representation, they favoured public appearances, like games and festivals, over the production of portraits. However, other elements of sepulchral representation, like [[sarcophagi]], did continue.\n*There is evidence of a religious crisis at the same time. This may not be as closely connected with the rise of Christianity as previously assumed. (The earlier suggestion of a 4th-century end to the portraits would coincide with the widespread distribution of Christianity in Egypt. Christianity also never banned mummification.) An increasing neglect of Egyptian temples is noticeable during the Roman imperial period, leading to a general drop in interest in all ancient religions.\n*The [[Constitutio Antoniniana]], i.e. the granting of Roman citizenship to all free subjects changed the social structures of Egypt. For the first time, the individual cities gained a degree of self-administration. At the same time, the provincial upper classes changed in terms of both composition and inter-relations.\nThus, a combination of several factors appears to have led to changes of fashion and ritual. No clear causality can be asserted.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 88\u2013101</ref>\n\nConsidering the limited nature of the current understanding of portrait mummies, it remains distinctly possible that future research will considerably modify the image presented here. For example, some scholars suspect that the centre of production of such finds, and thus the centre of the distinctive funerary tradition they represent, may have been located at Alexandria. New finds from [[Marina el-Alamein]] strongly support such a  view.<ref name=\"Barbara Borg 1998\"/> In view of the near-total loss of Greek and Roman paintings, mummy portraits are today considered to be among the very rare examples of ancient art that can be seen to reflect \"Great paintings\" and especially Roman portrait painting.<ref name=\"Hoesch\"/>\n{{clear}}\n==Mummy portraits as sources on provincial Roman fashion==\n\n===Provincial fashions===\nMummy portraits depict a variety of different hairstyles. They are one of the main aids in dating the paintings. The majority of the deceased were depicted with hairstyles then in fashion. They are frequently similar to those depicted in [[sculpture]]. As part of Roman propaganda, such sculptures, especially those depicting the imperial family, were often displayed throughout the empire. Thus, they had a direct influence on the development of fashion. Nevertheless, the mummy portraits, as well as other finds, suggest that fashions lasted longer in the provinces than in the imperial court, or at least that diverse styles might coexist.\n\n===Hairstyles===\n<gallery heights=200px widths=140px>\nFayum-13.jpg|Depiction of a woman with curly hair, wearing a violet chiton and cloak and pendant earrings. [[British Museum]]\nEgyptian - Female Portrait Mask - Walters 325.jpg|The plaited hairstyle of this elite woman makes it possible to date this painting to the reign of [[Trajan]] (AD 98 \u2013 117). [[Walters Art Museum]]\nFayum-11.jpg|Depiction of a woman with a ringlet hairstyle, an orange chiton with black bands and rod-shaped earrings. [[Museum of Scotland]]\n</gallery>\nSince Roman men tended to wear short-cropped hair, female hairstyles are a better source of evidence for changes in fashion. The female portraits suggest a coarse chronological scheme: Simple hairstyles with a central parting in the [[Tiberius|Tiberian]] period are followed by more complex ringlet hairstyles, nested plaits and [[toupee|curly toup\u00e9es]] over the forehead in the late 1st century. Small oval nested plaits dominate the time of the [[Antonines]], simple central-parting hairstyles with a hairknot in the neck occur in the second half of the 2nd century. The time of [[Septimius Severus]] was characterised by [[toup\u00e9e]]-like fluffy as well as strict, straight styles, followed by looped plaits on the crown of the head. The latter belong to the very final phase of mummy portraits, and have only been noted on a few mummy wrappings. It seems to be the case that curly hairstyles were especially popular in Egypt.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 45\u201349</ref>\n\n===Clothing===\nLike the hairstyles, the clothing depicted also follows the general fashions of the Roman Empire, as known from statues and busts. Both men and women tend to wear a thin [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] as an undergarment. Above it, both sexes tend to wear a cloak, laid across the shoulders or wound around the torso. The males wear virtually exclusively white, while female clothing is often red or pink, but can also be yellow, white, blue or purple. The chiton often bears a decorative line (''[[laticlave|clavus]]''), occasionally light red or light green, also sometimes gold, but normally in dark colours. Some painted mummy wrappings from Antinoopolis depict garments with long sleeves and very wide ''clavi''. So far, not a single portrait has been definitely shown to depict the [[toga]], a key symbol of Roman citizenship. It should, however, be kept in mind that Greek cloaks and togas are draped very similarly on depictions of the 1st and early 2nd centuries. In the late 2nd and 3rd centuries, togas should be distinguishable, but fail to occur.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...\". \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 49\u201351</ref>\n\n===Jewelry===\nApart from the gold [[wreath]]s worn by many men, with very few exceptions, only women are depicted with jewellery. This generally accords with the common jewellery types of the Graeco-Roman East. Especially the Antinoopolis portraits depict simple gold link chains and massive gold rings. There are also depictions of [[precious stone|precious]] or [[semi-precious stones]] like [[emerald]], [[carnelian]], [[garnet]], [[agate]] or [[amethyst]], rarely also of [[pearl]]s. The stones were normally ground into cylindrical or spherical beads. Some portraits depict elaborate [[collier (necklace)|colliers]], with precious stones set in gold.\n\nThe gold wreath was apparently rarely, if ever, worn in life, but a number have been found in graves from much earlier periods. Based on the plant wreaths given as prizes in contests, the idea was apparently to celebrate the achievements of the deceased in life.\n\nThere are three basic shapes of ear ornaments: Especially common in the 1st century are circular or drop-shaped pendants. Archaeological finds indicate that these were fully or semi-spherical. Later tastes favoured S-shaped hooks of gold wire, on which up to five beads of different colours and materials could be strung. The third shape are elaborate pendants with a horizontal bar from which two or three, occasionally four, vertical rods are suspended, usually each decorated with a white bead or pearl at the bottom. Other common ornaments include gold hairpins, often decorated with pearls, fine [[diadem (personal wear)|diadems]], and, especially at Antinoopolis, gold [[hairnet]]s. Many portraits also depict [[amulet]]s and [[pendant]]s, perhaps with magical functions.<ref>Barbara Borg: ''\u201eDer zierlichste Anblick der Welt ....\u201c \u00c4gyptische Portr\u00e4tmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 51\u201352</ref>\n\n== Art-historical significance ==\n[[Image:Septimusseverustondo.jpg|thumb|Tondo with images of Septimius Severus and his family. [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].]]\nThe mummy portraits have immense art-historical importance. Ancient sources indicate that [[panel painting]] (rather than [[wall painting]]), i.e. painting on wood or other mobile surfaces was held in high regard. But very few ancient panel paintings\nsurvive. One of the few examples besides the mummy portraits is the [[Severan Tondo]], also from Egypt (around 200), which, like the mummy portraits, is believed to represent a provincial version of contemporary style.{{refn|1=Other examples: a framed portrait from Hawara,{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=121\u2013122, Nr. 117}} the image of a man flanked by two deities from the same site,{{sfnp|Walker|Bierbrier|1997|pp=123\u2013124, Nr. 119}} or the 6th century BC panels from Pitsa in Greece.<ref>[https://www.sikyon.com/sicyon/Painting/spainting_eg.html]</ref>}}\nSome aspects of the mummy portraits, especially their frontal perspective and their concentration on key facial features, strongly resemble later [[icon painting]]. A direct link has been suggested, but it should be kept in mind that the mummy portraits represent only a small part of a much wider Graeco-Roman tradition, the whole of which later bore an influence on [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] and [[Byzantine Art]]. A pair of panel \"icons\" of [[Serapis]] and [[Isis]] of comparable date (3rd century) and style are in the [[Getty Museum]] at [[Malibu, California|Malibu]];<ref>[https://www.aisthesis.de/wbock/bilder/4-9si.gif image]</ref> as with the cult of [[Mithras]], earlier examples of cult images were sculptures or pottery figurines, but from the 3rd century reliefs and then painted images are found.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Kurt Weitzmann]] |title=The Icon |date=1982 |publisher=Evans Brothers Ltd |location=London |p=3 |others=(trans of Le Icone, Montadori 1981) |ISBN=0-237-45645-1}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Panel painting]]\n*[[Ancient Roman art]]\n*[[Faiyum]]\n*[[Coptic art]]\n*[[Coptic Museum]]\n*[[Pitsa panels]]\n*[[Malibu Painter]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n(chronological order)\n\n* {{cite book|author=W.
