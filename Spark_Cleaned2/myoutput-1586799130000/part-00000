Roosevelt announced his so-called [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]] in 1936. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sumners discreetly worked in opposition. When the plan's bill was in trouble, Sumners reportedly said, \"Boys, here's where I cash in my chips,\" referring to his waning support for the President.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" />  Ultimately, Chairman Sumners came out formally against the Court-packing plan. He and two other Texans, Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Senator [[Tom Connally|Thomas T. Connally]], led the fight against the court plan because they saw the president\u2019s request as a symbolic desire for unlimited power. Sumners, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, decided that the reorganization bill would not come up in his committee, because he wanted to avoid it being sent to and passing in the full House. He traveled around the country making speeches about constitutional government. The bill never left his committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jzc01|title=COURT-PACKING PLAN OF 1937|last=PATENAUDE|first=LIONEL V.|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>\n\nHe faced two serious opponents in the 1938 election, but was re-elected and was not seriously challenged again.\n\nIn 1945, Sumners responded strongly to the lynching of Jesse James Payne, a prisoner in custody of Sheriff Lonnie T.

Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to lynchings in Mississippi in 1931, \u201cWhat we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>\n\nIn the wake of the lynchings of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels in 1937, Sumners was asked to speak about anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined, writing, \u201cIt has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  The meeting would be construed as being opposed to anti-lynching legislation; whereas, to be effective it should be a meeting opposed to lynching. This suggestion is very important\u2026everything should indicate that you are trying to stop mob violence and that this is the whole purpose of the meeting.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. L. W. Alford, Chairman of the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, May 4, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>\n\nIn reference to the 1937 lynchings, an outraged Sumners sent the Governor of Mississippi a telegram that stated \u201cIf the press reports are even approximately correct, and they seem to be, these lynchings, both with regard to lynchers and the officers involved, were as dastardly a crime as cowardice could devise and brutality execute. It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment.\u201d<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now-infamous lynchings including the sheriffs, writing, \u201cThe turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A. A. Carmichael, May 25, 1937, DHS, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nAfter leaving Congress, Sumners was the Director of Research for the [[Southwestern Legal Foundation]]. Sumners formed the Hatton W. Sumners Foundation in 1949, which still awards loans and scholarships to worthy students.

Roosevelt announced his so-called [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]] in 1936. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sumners discreetly worked in opposition. When the plan's bill was in trouble, Sumners reportedly said, \"Boys, here's where I cash in my chips,\" referring to his waning support for the President.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" />  Ultimately, Chairman Sumners came out formally against the Court-packing plan. He and two other Texans, Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Senator [[Tom Connally|Thomas T. Connally]], led the fight against the court plan because they saw the president\u2019s request as a symbolic desire for unlimited power. Sumners, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, decided that the reorganization bill would not come up in his committee, because he wanted to avoid it being sent to and passing in the full House. He traveled around the country making speeches about constitutional government. The bill never left his committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jzc01|title=COURT-PACKING PLAN OF 1937|last=PATENAUDE|first=LIONEL V.|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>\n\nHe faced two serious opponents in the 1938 election, but was re-elected and was not seriously challenged again.\n\nIn 1945, Sumners responded strongly to the lynching of Jesse James Payne, a prisoner in custody of Sheriff Lonnie T. Davis in [[Madison, Florida|Madison, FL]]. Sheriff Davis was investigated for any wrongdoing associated with the lynching of Payne.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jack.

Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to lynchings in Mississippi in 1931, \u201cWhat we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>\n\nIn the wake of the lynchings of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels in 1937, Sumners was asked to speak about anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined, writing, \u201cIt has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  The meeting would be construed as being opposed to anti-lynching legislation; whereas, to be effective it should be a meeting opposed to lynching. This suggestion is very important\u2026everything should indicate that you are trying to stop mob violence and that this is the whole purpose of the meeting.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. L. W. Alford, Chairman of the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, May 4, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>\n\nIn reference to the 1937 lynchings, an outraged Sumners sent the Governor of Mississippi a telegram that stated \u201cIf the press reports are even approximately correct, and they seem to be, these lynchings, both with regard to lynchers and the officers involved, were as dastardly a crime as cowardice could devise and brutality execute. It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment.\u201d<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now-infamous lynchings including the sheriffs, writing, \u201cThe turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A. A. Carmichael, May 25, 1937, DHS, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nAfter leaving Congress, Sumners was the Director of Research for the [[Southwestern Legal Foundation]]. Sumners formed the Hatton W. Sumners Foundation in 1949, which still awards loans and scholarships to worthy students.
