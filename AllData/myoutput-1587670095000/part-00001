During his career, which lasted from 1998 to 2017, he made 647 appearances in the [[English Football League|Football League]], including 308 for [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. He is currently a first team coach at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].\n\nBorn in Dagenham, Barrett began his career with [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], but failed to make an appearance for them and moved on to sign for [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], spending the 1999\u20132000 season with them. In 2000, he moved to [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] and then spent two years at [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] before joining Southend United in 2004. He helped Southend from League Two to the Championship during a six-year stay at Roots Hall, and played over 250 times for the Club before signing for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 2010. He would go on to play for Leyton Orient (loan), [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[AFC Wimbledon]]. In January 2015, he re-joined Southend United.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Southend United===\nBarrett joined [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], on a free transfer at the beginning of the 2004\u201305 season.

During his career, which lasted from 1998 to 2017, he made 647 appearances in the [[English Football League|Football League]], including 308 for [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]].  He is currently a first team coach at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].\n\nBorn in Dagenham, Barrett began his career with [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], but failed to make an appearance for them and moved on to sign for [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], spending the 1999\u20132000 season with them. In 2000, he moved to [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] and then spent two years at [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] before joining Southend United in 2004. He helped Southend from League Two to the Championship during a six-year stay at Roots Hall, and played over 250 times for the Club before signing for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 2010. He would go on to play for Leyton Orient (loan), [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[AFC Wimbledon]]. In January 2015, he re-joined Southend United.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Southend United===\nBarrett joined [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], on a free transfer at the beginning of the 2004\u201305 season.
