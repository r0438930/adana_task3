The land boundary follows a [[water divide|watershed]] and is crossed by two roads (the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9]] and the [[A836 road|A836]]) and by one railway (the [[Far North Line]]). Across the [[Pentland Firth]], ferries link Caithness with [[Orkney]], and Caithness also has an airport at [[Wick, Highland|Wick]]. The Pentland Firth island of [[Stroma, Scotland|Stroma]] is within Caithness.\n\nThe name was also used for the [[earl of Caithness|earldom of Caithness]] ({{circa}} 1334 onwards) and for the [[Caithness (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness constituency]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (1708 to 1918). Boundaries are not identical in all contexts, but the Caithness area {{as of | 2019 | lc = on}} lies entirely within the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] [[council areas of Scotland|council area]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe ''Caith'' element of ''Caithness'' comes from the name of a [[Picts|Pictish]] tribe known as the ''Cat'' or ''Catt'' people, or ''Catti'' (see [[Kingdom of Cat]]). The {{lang|non|-ness}} element comes from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] and means \"headland\". The Norse called the area {{lang|non|Katanes}} (\"headland of the Catt people\"), and over time this became ''Caithness''.<ref name=snh>[http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/gaelic/gaelicnorseinthelandscape.pdf Gaelic and Norse in the Landscape: Placenames in Caithness and Sutherland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921192834/http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/gaelic/gaelicnorseinthelandscape.pdf |date=21 September 2011 }}. Scottish National Heritage. pp.7\u20138</ref>\n\nThe [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] name for Caithness, {{lang|gd|Gallaibh}}, means \"among the strangers\" (the Norse). The Catti are represented in the Gaelic name for eastern [[Sutherland]], {{lang|gd|Cataibh}},<ref name=snh/> and the old Gaelic name for [[Shetland]], {{lang|gd|Innse Chat}}.\n\n==Geography==\n\nCaithness extends about 30 miles (50 kilometres) north-south and about 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) east-west, with a roughly triangular-shaped area of about {{cvt|712|sqmi|km2}}. The topography is generally flat, in contrast to the majority of the remainder of the North of Scotland. Until the latter part of the 20th century when large areas were planted in conifers, this level profile was rendered still more striking by the almost total absence of forest.\n[[File:caithness.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Caithness landscape, looking towards [[Halkirk]] from Beinn Freiceadain]]\n\nIt is a land of open, rolling farmland, [[moorland]] and scattered settlements. The county is fringed to the north and east by dramatic coastal scenery and is home to large, internationally important colonies of seabirds. The surrounding waters of the [[Pentland Firth]] and the [[North Sea]] hold a great diversity of marine life. Notable features of the north coast are [[Sandside Bay]], [[Thurso Bay]] and [[Dunnet Bay]], [[Dunnet Head]] (the northern-most point of Britain) and [[Duncansby Head]] (the north-east tip of Britain); along the east coast can be found Freswick Bay, [[Sinclairs Bay]] and [[Wick Bay]]. To the north in Pentland Firth lies [[Stroma, Scotland|Stroma]], the only major island of the county. Away from the coast, the landscape is dominated by open moorland and blanket [[bog]] known as the [[Flow Country]] which is the largest expanse of blanket bog in [[Europe]], extending into Sutherland. This is divided up along the ''straths'' ([[river]] [[valley]]s) by more fertile farm and [[croft (land)|croft]] land. In the far south the landscape is slightly hillier, culminating in [[Morven, Caithness|Morvern]], the highest peak in the county at 706 m (2,316&nbsp;ft).\n\nThe county contain a number of lochs, though these are smaller in comparison with the rest of northern Scotland. The most prominent are Loch Heilen, Loch of Wester, Loch Scarmclate, [[Loch Watten]], Loch of Toftingall, Loch Stemster, Loch Hempriggs, Loch of Yarrows, Loch Sand, Loch Rangag, Loch Ruard, Loch an Thulachan, Loch More, Loch Caluim, Loch Tuim Ghlais, Loch Scye, [[Loch Shurrery]], [[Loch Calder]] and Loch Mey.\n\nThe underlying geology of most of Caithness is [[old red sandstone]] to an estimated depth of over 4,000 metres. This consists of the cemented sediments of [[Orcadian Basin|Lake Orcadie]], which is believed to have stretched from [[Shetland]] to [[Grampian]] during the [[Devonian]] period, about 370 million years ago. Fossilised fish and plant remains are found between the layers of sediment. Older metamorphic ([[granite]]) rock is apparent in the [[Scaraben]] and [[Ord, Highland|Ord]] area, in the relatively high southwest area of the county. Caithness' highest point ([[Morven, Caithness|Morven]]) is in this area.\n\nBecause of the ease with which the sandstone splits to form large flat slabs ([[flagstone]]) it is an especially useful building material, and has been used as such since [[Neolithic]] times.\n\n==Natural heritage==\n[[File:St John's Loch near Dunnet Head - geograph.org.uk - 326534.jpg|thumb|left|St John's Loch near [[Dunnet Head]] has the distinction of supporting the most northerly hatch of [[Mayfly]] in the British Isle.]]\nCaithness is one of the [[Watsonian vice-counties]], subdivisions of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] which are used largely for the purposes of biological recording and other scientific data-gathering. The vice-counties were introduced by [[Hewett Cottrell Watson]], who first used them in the third volume of his ''{{lang|la|Cybele Britannica}}'', published in 1852. He refined the system somewhat in later volumes, but the vice-counties remain unaffected by subsequent local government re-organisations, allowing more accurate comparisons of historical and modern data. They provide a stable basis for recording using similarly-sized units, and, although grid-based reporting has grown in popularity, they remain a standard in the vast majority of ecological surveys, allowing data collected over long periods of time to be compared easily.\n\nThe underlying geology, harsh climate, and long history of human occupation have shaped the natural heritage of Caithness. Today a diverse landscape incorporates both common and rare habitats and species, and Caithness provides a stronghold for many once common breeding species that have undergone serious declines elsewhere, such as [[wader]]s, [[European water vole|water vole]]s, and flocks of [[bird migration|over-wintering]] birds.\n\nMany rare mammals, birds, and fish have been sighted or caught in and around Caithness waters. [[Harbour porpoise]]s, dolphins (including [[Risso's dolphin|Risso's]], [[bottle-nosed dolphin|bottle-nosed]], [[common dolphin|common]], [[Atlantic white-sided dolphin|Atlantic white-sided]], and [[white-beaked dolphin]]s), and [[minke whale|minke]] and [[long-finned pilot whale]]s<ref>ALISTAIRMUNRO. 2017.

These include the [[Grey Cairns of Camster]], the [[The Stone Lud|Stone Lud]], the [[Hill O Many Stanes]], a complex of sites around [[Loch Yarrows]] and over 100 [[broch]]s. A [[prehistoric]] [[souterrain]] structure at Caithness has been likened to discoveries at [[Midgarth]] and on [[Shapinsay]].<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17936 C.Michael Hogan, ''Castle bloody'', The Megalithic Portal, ed.

The name Pentland Firth can be read as meaning Pictland Fjord.\n\nNumerous bands of Norse settlers landed in the county, and gradually established themselves around the coast. On the [[Latheron]] (south) side, they extended their settlements as far as Berriedale. Many of the names of places are Norse in origin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Logan|first1=F.

Around 1196, Earl [[Harald Maddadsson]] agreed to pay a monetary tribute for Caithness to [[William I of Scotland|William I]]. [[Norway]] has recognised Caithness as fully Scottish since the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266.\n\nThe study of Caithness prehistory is well represented in the county by groups including Yarrows Heritage Trust,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yarrowsheritagetrust.co.uk/|title=Yarrows Heritage Trust - Home|author=|date=|website=www.yarrowsheritagetrust.co.uk|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> Caithness Horizons<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/caithness-horizons-museum-p256591|title=Caithness Horizons Museum|publisher=}}</ref> and [[Caithness Broch Project]].\n\n==Local government==\n===Early civic history===\nCaithness originally formed part of the shire or [[sheriffdom]] of [[Inverness-shire|Inverness]], but gradually gained independence: in 1455 the [[Earl of Caithness]] gained a grant of the justiciary and sheriffdom of the area from the Sheriff of Inverness. In 1503 an [[act of parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] confirmed the separate jurisdiction, with [[Dornoch]] and [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] named as [[burgh]]s in which the sheriff of Caithness was to hold courts. The area of the sheriffdom was declared to be identical to that of the [[Diocese of Moray, Ross and Caithness|Diocese of Caithness]]. The Sheriff of Inverness still retained power over important legal cases, however, until 1641. In that year, parliament declared Wick the head burgh of the shire of Caithness and the Earl of Caithness became the heritable sheriff.<ref>{{cite book |title=Caithness & Sutherland |url=https://archive.org/details/caithnesssutherl00campuoft |last=Campbell |first=H F |series=Cambridge County Geographies |year=1920 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |pages=[https://archive.org/details/caithnesssutherl00campuoft/page/1 1]\u20132 }}</ref> Following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] of 1707, the term \"[[Counties of Scotland|county]]\" began to be applied to the shire, a process that was completed with the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in 1747.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whetstone |first1=Ann E. |last2= |first2= |year= |title=The Reform of the Scottish Sheriffdoms in the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries |journal=Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies |publisher=The North American Conference on British Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=61\u201371 |doi= |jstor=4048219}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Scottish Society 1707\u20131820 |last=Whatley |first=Christopher A |year=2000 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-7190-4540-0 |page=147 }}</ref> The county began to be known as Caithness-shire.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe population by 1841 had reached 36,343.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.IV'', (1848), London, Charles Knight, p.16</ref>\n\nThe county began to be used as a unit of local administration, and in 1890 was given an elected [[county council]] under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]]. Although officially within the county, the [[burghs]] of Wick and [[Thurso]] retained their status as autonomous local government areas; they were already well established as autonomous burghs with their own burgh councils. Ten [[parish]] councils covering rural areas were established in 1894.\n\nWick, a [[royal burgh]], served as the county's administrative centre.\n\nIn 1930, the parish councils were abolished under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929]].\n\n===1975\u201396===\nIn 1975, the Local Government council and the burgh councils were superseded under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] when Caithness became one of eight districts, each with its own \"district council\", within the new two-tier Highland [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]]. When created, the district included the whole of the county plus [[Tongue, Highland|Tongue]] and [[Strathnaver|Farr]] areas of the neighbouring [[Sutherland|county of Sutherland]]. The boundary was soon changed, however, to correspond with that between the counties. Caithness was one of eight districts in the Highland region.\n\nHighland region was also created in 1975, as one of nine two-tier local government regions of Scotland. Each region consisted of a number of districts and both regions and districts had their own elected [[Local government|councils]]. The creation of the Highland region and of Caithness as a district involved the abolition of the two [[burgh]] councils in Caithness, [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] and [[Thurso]], as well as the Caithness [[county council]].\n\nWick, which had been the administrative centre for the county, became the administrative centre for the district.\n\nIn 1996 local government in Scotland was again reformed, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], to create [[Council areas of Scotland|32 unitary council areas]]. The Highland region became the Highland unitary council area, and the functions of the district councils were absorbed by the [[Highland Council]].\n\n===1996 to 2007===\n[[Image:ScotlandHighlands.png|thumb|[[Highland council area]] 1996 to present]]\nIn 1996, Caithness and the other seven districts of the Highland region were merged into the unitary Highland [[Council areas of Scotland|council area]], under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]]. The new Highland Council then adopted the former districts as management areas and created a system of [[area committee]]s to represent the management areas.\n\nUntil 1999 the Caithness management and committee areas consisted of 8 out of the 72 Highland Council [[ward (politics)|ward]]s. Each ward elected one councillor by the [[first past the post]] system of election.\n\nIn 1999, however, ward boundaries were redrawn but management area boundaries were not. As a result, area committees were named after and made decisions for areas which they did not exactly represent. The new Caithness committee area, consisting of ten out of the 80 new Highland Council wards, did not include the village of [[Reay]], although that village was within the Caithness management area. For area committee representation the village was within the [[Sutherland]] committee area.\n\nNew wards were created for elections this year, 2007, polling on 3 May and, as the wards became effective for representational purposes, the Highland Council's management and committee structures were reorganised. The Caithness management area and the Caithness area committee were therefore abolished.\n\n=== 2007 to date===\nIn 2007 the [[Highland Council]], which is now the local government authority, created the [[Highland Council|Caithness ward management area]], which has boundaries similar to those of the historic county. It was divided between three new wards electing councillors by the [[single transferable vote]] system of election, which is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]]. One ward elects four councillors. Each of the other two elects three councillors. Also, the council's eight management areas were abolished, in favour of three new corporate management areas, with Caithness becoming a ward management area within the council's new [[Highland Council|Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross operational management area]], which covers seven of the council's 22 new wards. The boundaries of the Caithness ward management area are not exactly those of the former Caithness management area, but they do include the village of Reay.\n\nThe ward management area is one of five within the corporate management area and until 2017 consisted of three wards, the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Landward Caithness ward]], the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Thurso ward]] and the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Wick ward]]. Each of the other ward management areas within the corporate management area consists of a single ward. In 2017 the three Caithness wards were reduced to two 'Town and County' wards, each returning four members to the Highland Council,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/info/695/council_information_performance_and_statistics/504/council_wards|title=Council wards|first=Heather|last=Butlin|website=www.highland.gov.uk}}</ref> this was a reduction of two Councillors from the last election in 2012.

The current Chairman of the Caithness Committee is Donnie Mackay (Independent) and the Civic Leader position is held by A.I Willie Mackay (Independent) both being installed on the 16th of June 2017 at the first Caithness Committee of the new council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/news/article/10242/caithness_committee_chair_and_civic_leader_appointed|title=Caithness Committee Chair and Civic Leader appointed|first=Sylvia|last=Tarrant|website=www.highland.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Parishes===\nPrior to implementation of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, civil administration parishes were also parishes of the [[Church of Scotland]], and one Caithness parish, Reay, straddled the boundary between the county of Caithness and the [[county of Sutherland]], and another, Thurso had a separate fragment bounded by Reay and Halkirk. For civil administration purposes, implementation of the act redefined parish boundaries, transferring part of Reay to the Sutherland parish of [[Farr, Sutherland|Farr]] and the fragment of Thurso to the parish of Halkirk.<ref>Boundary changes as described in ''Boundaries of Counties and Parishes in Scotland'', Hay Shennan, 1892</ref>\n\nIn the cases of two of the parishes, Thurso and Wick, each includes a burgh with the same name as the parish. For civil administration purposes each of these parishes was divided between the burgh and the landward (rural) area of the parish.\n\nCivil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them.

They are however the most local tier of statutory representation.\n\nUnder the 1973 Act, district councils were obliged to implement community council schemes. A Caithness district scheme was adopted in 1975, dividing the area of the district between 12 community councils.\n\nStatutory status for community councils was continued under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], and a Caithness scheme is now the responsibility of the [[Highland Council]].\n\nThe area of the former district of Caithness is now covered by 12 community council areas which are numbered and described as below in the Highland Council's ''Scheme for the Establishment of Community Councils in Caithness'', October 1997. Current community council names and contact details are given on a Highland Council website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/17A2E136-4582-484E-999C-514F9D88BA53/0/communitycouncillors.pdf|title=''Community 03 March 2008'', accessed 3 March 2008|publisher=Highland Council website|access-date=3 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024041858/http://www.highland.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/17A2E136-4582-484E-999C-514F9D88BA53/0/communitycouncillors.pdf|archive-date=24 October 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n: 1.

At the same time however, the county town of [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] was represented as a component of [[Tain Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Tain Burghs]] until 1832 and of [[Wick Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Wick Burghs]] until 1918.\n\nBetween 1708 and 1832 the Caithness constituency was paired with [[Buteshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buteshire]] as ''alternating constituencies'': one constituency elected a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to one parliament and then the other elected an MP to the next. Between 1832 and 1918 Caithness elected an MP to every parliament.\n\nIn 1918 the Caithness constituency and Wick were merged into the then new constituency of [[Caithness and Sutherland (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness and Sutherland]]. In 1997 Caithness and Sutherland was merged into [[Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross]].\n\nThe [[Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Scottish Parliament constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross]] was created in 1999 and now has boundaries slightly different from those of the House of Commons constituency. It was replaced by the larger constituency of [[Caithness, Sutherland and Ross (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Caithness, Sutherland and Ross]] in 2011.\n\nThe modern constituencies may be seen as more sub-divisions of the Highland area than as representative of counties (and burghs). For its own purposes, however, the Highland Council uses more conservative sub-divisions, with names which refer back to the era of district councils and, in some cases, county councils.\n\nIn the [[Scottish Parliament]] Caithness is represented also as part of the [[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament region)|Highlands and Islands]] [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|electoral region]].\n\n==Towns and villages==\n[[File:John o' Groats.JPG|thumb|right|John o' Groats]]\n[[File:Thurso from the hill at Mountpleasant - geograph.org.uk - 8869.jpg|thumb|right|Thurso]]\n[[File:Bridge of Wick - geograph.org.uk - 252159.jpg|thumb|right|Wick]]\nIn 2011, Caithness had a resident population of 26,486 (23,866 in 2001).

The land boundary follows a [[water divide|watershed]] and is crossed by two roads (the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9]] and the [[A836 road|A836]]) and by one railway (the [[Far North Line]]). Across the [[Pentland Firth]], ferries link Caithness with [[Orkney]], and Caithness also has an airport at [[Wick, Highland|Wick]]. The Pentland Firth island of [[Stroma, Scotland|Stroma]] is within Caithness.\n\nThe name was also used for the [[earl of Caithness|earldom of Caithness]] ({{circa}} 1334 onwards) and for the [[Caithness (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness constituency]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (1708 to 1918). Boundaries are not identical in all contexts, but the Caithness area {{as of | 2019 | lc = on}} lies entirely within the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] [[council areas of Scotland|council area]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe ''Caith'' element of ''Caithness'' comes from the name of a [[Picts|Pictish]] tribe known as the ''Cat'' or ''Catt'' people, or ''Catti'' (see [[Kingdom of Cat]]). The {{lang|non|-ness}} element comes from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] and means \"headland\". The Norse called the area {{lang|non|Katanes}} (\"headland of the Catt people\"), and over time this became ''Caithness''.<ref name=snh>[http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/gaelic/gaelicnorseinthelandscape.pdf Gaelic and Norse in the Landscape: Placenames in Caithness and Sutherland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921192834/http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/gaelic/gaelicnorseinthelandscape.pdf |date=21 September 2011 }}. Scottish National Heritage. pp.7\u20138</ref>\n\nThe [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] name for Caithness, {{lang|gd|Gallaibh}}, means \"among the strangers\" (the Norse). The Catti are represented in the Gaelic name for eastern [[Sutherland]], {{lang|gd|Cataibh}},<ref name=snh/> and the old Gaelic name for [[Shetland]], {{lang|gd|Innse Chat}}.\n\n==Geography==\n\nCaithness extends about 30 miles (50 kilometres) north-south and about 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) east-west, with a roughly triangular-shaped area of about {{cvt|712|sqmi|km2}}. The topography is generally flat, in contrast to the majority of the remainder of the North of Scotland. Until the latter part of the 20th century when large areas were planted in conifers, this level profile was rendered still more striking by the almost total absence of forest.\n[[File:caithness.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Caithness landscape, looking towards [[Halkirk]] from Beinn Freiceadain]]\n\nIt is a land of open, rolling farmland, [[moorland]] and scattered settlements. The county is fringed to the north and east by dramatic coastal scenery and is home to large, internationally important colonies of seabirds. The surrounding waters of the [[Pentland Firth]] and the [[North Sea]] hold a great diversity of marine life. Notable features of the north coast are [[Sandside Bay]], [[Thurso Bay]] and [[Dunnet Bay]], [[Dunnet Head]] (the northern-most point of Britain) and [[Duncansby Head]] (the north-east tip of Britain); along the east coast can be found Freswick Bay, [[Sinclairs Bay]] and [[Wick Bay]]. To the north in Pentland Firth lies [[Stroma, Scotland|Stroma]], the only major island of the county. Away from the coast, the landscape is dominated by open moorland and blanket [[bog]] known as the [[Flow Country]] which is the largest expanse of blanket bog in [[Europe]], extending into Sutherland. This is divided up along the ''straths'' ([[river]] [[valley]]s) by more fertile farm and [[croft (land)|croft]] land. In the far south the landscape is slightly hillier, culminating in [[Morven, Caithness|Morvern]], the highest peak in the county at 706 m (2,316&nbsp;ft).\n\nThe county contain a number of lochs, though these are smaller in comparison with the rest of northern Scotland. The most prominent are Loch Heilen, Loch of Wester, Loch Scarmclate, [[Loch Watten]], Loch of Toftingall, Loch Stemster, Loch Hempriggs, Loch of Yarrows, Loch Sand, Loch Rangag, Loch Ruard, Loch an Thulachan, Loch More, Loch Caluim, Loch Tuim Ghlais, Loch Scye, [[Loch Shurrery]], [[Loch Calder]] and Loch Mey.\n\nThe underlying geology of most of Caithness is [[old red sandstone]] to an estimated depth of over 4,000 metres. This consists of the cemented sediments of [[Orcadian Basin|Lake Orcadie]], which is believed to have stretched from [[Shetland]] to [[Grampian]] during the [[Devonian]] period, about 370 million years ago. Fossilised fish and plant remains are found between the layers of sediment. Older metamorphic ([[granite]]) rock is apparent in the [[Scaraben]] and [[Ord, Highland|Ord]] area, in the relatively high southwest area of the county. Caithness' highest point ([[Morven, Caithness|Morven]]) is in this area.\n\nBecause of the ease with which the sandstone splits to form large flat slabs ([[flagstone]]) it is an especially useful building material, and has been used as such since [[Neolithic]] times.\n\n==Natural heritage==\n[[File:St John's Loch near Dunnet Head - geograph.org.uk - 326534.jpg|thumb|left|St John's Loch near [[Dunnet Head]] has the distinction of supporting the most northerly hatch of [[Mayfly]] in the British Isle.]]\nCaithness is one of the [[Watsonian vice-counties]], subdivisions of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] which are used largely for the purposes of biological recording and other scientific data-gathering. The vice-counties were introduced by [[Hewett Cottrell Watson]], who first used them in the third volume of his ''{{lang|la|Cybele Britannica}}'', published in 1852. He refined the system somewhat in later volumes, but the vice-counties remain unaffected by subsequent local government re-organisations, allowing more accurate comparisons of historical and modern data. They provide a stable basis for recording using similarly-sized units, and, although grid-based reporting has grown in popularity, they remain a standard in the vast majority of ecological surveys, allowing data collected over long periods of time to be compared easily.\n\nThe underlying geology, harsh climate, and long history of human occupation have shaped the natural heritage of Caithness. Today a diverse landscape incorporates both common and rare habitats and species, and Caithness provides a stronghold for many once common breeding species that have undergone serious declines elsewhere, such as [[wader]]s, [[European water vole|water vole]]s, and flocks of [[bird migration|over-wintering]] birds.\n\nMany rare mammals, birds, and fish have been sighted or caught in and around Caithness waters. [[Harbour porpoise]]s, dolphins (including [[Risso's dolphin|Risso's]], [[bottle-nosed dolphin|bottle-nosed]], [[common dolphin|common]], [[Atlantic white-sided dolphin|Atlantic white-sided]], and [[white-beaked dolphin]]s), and [[minke whale|minke]] and [[long-finned pilot whale]]s<ref>ALISTAIRMUNRO. 2017.

The name Pentland Firth can be read as meaning Pictland Fjord.\n\nNumerous bands of Norse settlers landed in the county, and gradually established themselves around the coast. On the [[Latheron]] (south) side, they extended their settlements as far as Berriedale. Many of the names of places are Norse in origin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Logan|first1=F.

Around 1196, Earl [[Harald Maddadsson]] agreed to pay a monetary tribute for Caithness to [[William I of Scotland|William I]]. [[Norway]] has recognised Caithness as fully Scottish since the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266.\n\nThe study of Caithness prehistory is well represented in the county by groups including Yarrows Heritage Trust,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yarrowsheritagetrust.co.uk/|title=Yarrows Heritage Trust - Home|author=|date=|website=www.yarrowsheritagetrust.co.uk|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> Caithness Horizons<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/caithness-horizons-museum-p256591|title=Caithness Horizons Museum|publisher=}}</ref> and [[Caithness Broch Project]].\n\n==Local government==\n===Early civic history===\nCaithness originally formed part of the shire or [[sheriffdom]] of [[Inverness-shire|Inverness]], but gradually gained independence: in 1455 the [[Earl of Caithness]] gained a grant of the justiciary and sheriffdom of the area from the Sheriff of Inverness. In 1503 an [[act of parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] confirmed the separate jurisdiction, with [[Dornoch]] and [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] named as [[burgh]]s in which the sheriff of Caithness was to hold courts. The area of the sheriffdom was declared to be identical to that of the [[Diocese of Moray, Ross and Caithness|Diocese of Caithness]]. The Sheriff of Inverness still retained power over important legal cases, however, until 1641. In that year, parliament declared Wick the head burgh of the shire of Caithness and the Earl of Caithness became the heritable sheriff.<ref>{{cite book |title=Caithness & Sutherland |url=https://archive.org/details/caithnesssutherl00campuoft |last=Campbell |first=H F |series=Cambridge County Geographies |year=1920 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |pages=[https://archive.org/details/caithnesssutherl00campuoft/page/1 1]\u20132 }}</ref> Following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] of 1707, the term \"[[Counties of Scotland|county]]\" began to be applied to the shire, a process that was completed with the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in 1747.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whetstone |first1=Ann E. |last2= |first2= |year= |title=The Reform of the Scottish Sheriffdoms in the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries |journal=Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies |publisher=The North American Conference on British Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=61\u201371 |doi= |jstor=4048219}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Scottish Society 1707\u20131820 |last=Whatley |first=Christopher A |year=2000 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-7190-4540-0 |page=147 }}</ref> The county began to be known as Caithness-shire.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe population by 1841 had reached 36,343.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.IV'', (1848), London, Charles Knight, p.16</ref>\n\nThe county began to be used as a unit of local administration, and in 1890 was given an elected [[county council]] under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]]. Although officially within the county, the [[burghs]] of Wick and [[Thurso]] retained their status as autonomous local government areas; they were already well established as autonomous burghs with their own burgh councils. Ten [[parish]] councils covering rural areas were established in 1894.\n\nWick, a [[royal burgh]], served as the county's administrative centre.\n\nIn 1930, the parish councils were abolished under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929]].\n\n===1975\u201396===\nIn 1975, the Local Government council and the burgh councils were superseded under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] when Caithness became one of eight districts, each with its own \"district council\", within the new two-tier Highland [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]]. When created, the district included the whole of the county plus [[Tongue, Highland|Tongue]] and [[Strathnaver|Farr]] areas of the neighbouring [[Sutherland|county of Sutherland]]. The boundary was soon changed, however, to correspond with that between the counties. Caithness was one of eight districts in the Highland region.\n\nHighland region was also created in 1975, as one of nine two-tier local government regions of Scotland. Each region consisted of a number of districts and both regions and districts had their own elected [[Local government|councils]]. The creation of the Highland region and of Caithness as a district involved the abolition of the two [[burgh]] councils in Caithness, [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] and [[Thurso]], as well as the Caithness [[county council]].\n\nWick, which had been the administrative centre for the county, became the administrative centre for the district.\n\nIn 1996 local government in Scotland was again reformed, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], to create [[Council areas of Scotland|32 unitary council areas]]. The Highland region became the Highland unitary council area, and the functions of the district councils were absorbed by the [[Highland Council]].\n\n===1996 to 2007===\n[[Image:ScotlandHighlands.png|thumb|[[Highland council area]] 1996 to present]]\nIn 1996, Caithness and the other seven districts of the Highland region were merged into the unitary Highland [[Council areas of Scotland|council area]], under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]]. The new Highland Council then adopted the former districts as management areas and created a system of [[area committee]]s to represent the management areas.\n\nUntil 1999 the Caithness management and committee areas consisted of 8 out of the 72 Highland Council [[ward (politics)|ward]]s. Each ward elected one councillor by the [[first past the post]] system of election.\n\nIn 1999, however, ward boundaries were redrawn but management area boundaries were not. As a result, area committees were named after and made decisions for areas which they did not exactly represent. The new Caithness committee area, consisting of ten out of the 80 new Highland Council wards, did not include the village of [[Reay]], although that village was within the Caithness management area. For area committee representation the village was within the [[Sutherland]] committee area.\n\nNew wards were created for elections this year, 2007, polling on 3 May and, as the wards became effective for representational purposes, the Highland Council's management and committee structures were reorganised. The Caithness management area and the Caithness area committee were therefore abolished.\n\n=== 2007 to date===\nIn 2007 the [[Highland Council]], which is now the local government authority, created the [[Highland Council|Caithness ward management area]], which has boundaries similar to those of the historic county. It was divided between three new wards electing councillors by the [[single transferable vote]] system of election, which is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]]. One ward elects four councillors. Each of the other two elects three councillors. Also, the council's eight management areas were abolished, in favour of three new corporate management areas, with Caithness becoming a ward management area within the council's new [[Highland Council|Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross operational management area]], which covers seven of the council's 22 new wards. The boundaries of the Caithness ward management area are not exactly those of the former Caithness management area, but they do include the village of Reay.\n\nThe ward management area is one of five within the corporate management area and until 2017 consisted of three wards, the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Landward Caithness ward]], the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Thurso ward]] and the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Wick ward]]. Each of the other ward management areas within the corporate management area consists of a single ward. In 2017 the three Caithness wards were reduced to two 'Town and County' wards, each returning four members to the Highland Council,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/info/695/council_information_performance_and_statistics/504/council_wards|title=Council wards|first=Heather|last=Butlin|website=www.highland.gov.uk}}</ref> this was a reduction of two Councillors from the last election in 2012.

The current Chairman of the Caithness Committee is Donnie Mackay (Independent) and the Civic Leader position is held by A.I Willie Mackay (Independent) both being installed on the 16th of June 2017 at the first Caithness Committee of the new council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/news/article/10242/caithness_committee_chair_and_civic_leader_appointed|title=Caithness Committee Chair and Civic Leader appointed|first=Sylvia|last=Tarrant|website=www.highland.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Parishes===\nPrior to implementation of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, civil administration parishes were also parishes of the [[Church of Scotland]], and one Caithness parish, Reay, straddled the boundary between the county of Caithness and the [[county of Sutherland]], and another, Thurso had a separate fragment bounded by Reay and Halkirk. For civil administration purposes, implementation of the act redefined parish boundaries, transferring part of Reay to the Sutherland parish of [[Farr, Sutherland|Farr]] and the fragment of Thurso to the parish of Halkirk.<ref>Boundary changes as described in ''Boundaries of Counties and Parishes in Scotland'', Hay Shennan, 1892</ref>\n\nIn the cases of two of the parishes, Thurso and Wick, each includes a burgh with the same name as the parish. For civil administration purposes each of these parishes was divided between the burgh and the landward (rural) area of the parish.\n\nCivil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them. As their areas have been largely unchanged since the 19th century this allows for comparison of population figures over an extended period of time.\n{| class=\"toptextcells\"\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are however the most local tier of statutory representation.\n\nUnder the 1973 Act, district councils were obliged to implement community council schemes. A Caithness district scheme was adopted in 1975, dividing the area of the district between 12 community councils.\n\nStatutory status for community councils was continued under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], and a Caithness scheme is now the responsibility of the [[Highland Council]].\n\nThe area of the former district of Caithness is now covered by 12 community council areas which are numbered and described as below in the Highland Council's ''Scheme for the Establishment of Community Councils in Caithness'', October 1997.

At the same time however, the county town of [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] was represented as a component of [[Tain Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Tain Burghs]] until 1832 and of [[Wick Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Wick Burghs]] until 1918.\n\nBetween 1708 and 1832 the Caithness constituency was paired with [[Buteshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buteshire]] as ''alternating constituencies'': one constituency elected a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to one parliament and then the other elected an MP to the next. Between 1832 and 1918 Caithness elected an MP to every parliament.\n\nIn 1918 the Caithness constituency and Wick were merged into the then new constituency of [[Caithness and Sutherland (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness and Sutherland]]. In 1997 Caithness and Sutherland was merged into [[Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross]].\n\nThe [[Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Scottish Parliament constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross]] was created in 1999 and now has boundaries slightly different from those of the House of Commons constituency. It was replaced by the larger constituency of [[Caithness, Sutherland and Ross (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Caithness, Sutherland and Ross]] in 2011.\n\nThe modern constituencies may be seen as more sub-divisions of the Highland area than as representative of counties (and burghs). For its own purposes, however, the Highland Council uses more conservative sub-divisions, with names which refer back to the era of district councils and, in some cases, county councils.\n\nIn the [[Scottish Parliament]] Caithness is represented also as part of the [[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament region)|Highlands and Islands]] [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|electoral region]].\n\n==Towns and villages==\n[[File:John o' Groats.JPG|thumb|right|John o' Groats]]\n[[File:Thurso from the hill at Mountpleasant - geograph.org.uk - 8869.jpg|thumb|right|Thurso]]\n[[File:Bridge of Wick - geograph.org.uk - 252159.jpg|thumb|right|Wick]]\nIn 2011, Caithness had a resident population of 26,486 (23,866 in 2001).
