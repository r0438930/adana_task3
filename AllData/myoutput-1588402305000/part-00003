{"title_page": "Wolfgang Windgassen", "text_new": "{{short description|German operatic tenor}}\n'''Wolfgang Windgassen''' (26 June 1914 \u2013 8 September 1974) was a [[Tenor#Heldentenor|heldentenor]] internationally known for his performances in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] operas.\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Annemasse]], [[France]], he was the son (and pupil) of a well known German Heldentenor, [[Fritz Windgassen]] (who was also the teacher of [[Gottlob Frick]]). His mother was the German coloratura soprano [[Vali von der Osten]], sister of the much more famous soprano [[Eva von der Osten]], who created the part of Octavian in [[Richard Strauss]]' ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''. Both Windgassen's parents were longtime mainstays of the [[Staatsoper Stuttgart]].\n\nWolfgang made his d\u00e9but at [[Pforzheim]] as Pinkerton in ''[[Madama Butterfly]].'' After army service he became a member of the Stuttgart opera company, and succeeded his father as principal tenor. Stuttgart opera remained his home base throughout his career, and for the last two years of his life he was its artistic director.\n\nWindgassen sang at all the important opera houses all over the world. He was invited to perform at the reopening of the [[Bayreuth Festival]] in 1951 and continued to appear there till 1970, singing all the great Wagner tenor roles: Erik, Tannh\u00e4user, Lohengrin, Tristan, Walter, Loge, Siegmund, both Siegfrieds and Parsifal, his debut role in 1951.\n\nHe died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] at the age of 60.\n\n==Recordings==\nHe is well represented on record, both in studio recordings and live tapings. Pre-eminent among the former is the famous [[Decca Records|Decca]] ''[[Ring Cycle|Ring]]'', conducted by [[Georg Solti]] and produced by [[John Culshaw]]. He was not Culshaw\u2019s first choice for Siegfried, the more powerful voice of [[Ernst Kozub]] being preferred. But Kozub's musical limitations led to his removal; Windgassen magnanimously stood in for him at the last minute. His live Bayreuth recording of ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' with [[Birgit Nilsson]] as Isolde, conducted by [[Karl B\u00f6hm]], is still highly regarded by many critics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nWindgassen was the Siegfried in several complete, live ''Rings'' from Bayreuth that have been issued commercially on CD, conducted by such now-legendary figures as [[Hans Knappertsbusch]], [[Clemens Krauss]], [[Joseph Keilberth]], and [[Karl B\u00f6hm]]. He was also the Loge and Siegmund in [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]]'s Ring broadcast by the Italian Radio (RAI) in 1953, and subsequently issued as a best-selling CD box, as well as Florestan in the EMI studio recording of ''[[Fidelio]]'' directed by Furtw\u00e4ngler.  Recorded performances are also available as Parsifal, Walther von Stolzing, Tannauser, [[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|Erik]], Lohengrin, Froh, [[Der Freisch\u00fctz|Max]], [[Die Fledermaus|Prince Orlofsky]], [[Rienzi]], and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.\n\n==Video==\n\nHe can be seen on video in a performance as Tristan (with [[Birgit Nilsson]] and [[Hans Hotter]], in [[Wieland Wagner]]'s production, conducted by [[Pierre Boulez]]), as Otello (singing in German), as [[Die Fledermaus|Prince Orlofsky]], and briefly in concerts and rehearsals on various anthologies.\n\n==Anecdotes==\n\nDuring a performance of Siegfried in Covent Garden in 1955 Windgassen realised that only the fragments of the sword he was supposed to forge together had been provided, and that there was no hidden sword nearby that he could pull out and swing to cut the anvil as required in the script.  He was faced with the urgent necessity of forging the real \"Nothung\" so that he could proceed to slice the cardboard anvil.  He kept cool while singing and slowly retreating further and further into the wings, where he managed to get someone to bring him the complete Nothung from backstage, which he then carefully smuggled under his cloak, undetected by the audience.<ref>Hugh Vickers, Great Opera Disaster, St. Martin's, New York 1979, p. 68</ref>\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.testament.co.uk/Notes/Siegfriedenglishnote.pdf Testament]\n*Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', 782 pages,  {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLSIWIND.HTM Capon's Lists of Opera Recordings discography]\n*[http://historyofthetenor.com/page.php?151 History of the Tenor - Sound Clips and Narration]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oJZFPK7gHI Siegfried forges his sword Nothung, audio only, YouTube]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psnJXrITGlg Walther von Stolzing composes the Prize Song in MEISTERSINGER]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJNP3-gSebk On video: crazy Prince Orlofsky explains his philosophy of life in DIE FLEDERMAUS]\n\n{{start box}}\n{{s-npo|union}}\n{{succession box|title=President of the [[Arts Union]]|years=1966&ndash;1973|before=[[Viktor de Kowa]]|after=Otto Sprenger}}\n{{end box}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Windgassen, Wolfgang}}\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:1974 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Annemasse]]\n[[Category:Heldentenors]]\n[[Category:German operatic tenors]]\n[[Category:Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n[[Category:20th-century opera singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century German musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|German operatic tenor}}\n'''Wolfgang Windgassen''' (26 June 1914 \u2013 8 September 1974) was a [[Tenor#Heldentenor|heldentenor]] internationally known for his performances in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] operas.\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Annemasse]], [[France]], he was the son (and pupil) of a well known German Heldentenor, [[Fritz Windgassen]] (who was also the teacher of [[Gottlob Frick]]).
