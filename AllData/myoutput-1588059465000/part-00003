He emigrated to the United States as a [[missionary]], where he ministered in rural [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maryland]]. Beschter was the last Jesuit [[pastor]] of [[St. Mary's Church (Lancaster, Pennsylvania)|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], as well as the pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. He was also a priest at several other [[German language|German]]-speaking churches in Pennsylvania.\n\nBeschter's ministerial work was punctuated by a time as [[master of novices]] at the new Jesuit [[novitiate]] in [[White Marsh, Maryland]], as well as a brief term as [[List of presidents of Georgetown University|president]] of [[Georgetown University]] in 1829. While in Maryland, he aligned himself with the [[Continental Europe]]an Jesuits in the United States, who endorsed a [[Monarchism|monarchist]] view of ecclesiastical leadership. After his presidency, Beschter remained at Georgetown for a year as a professor of German, before returning to [[Paradise Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Paradise, Pennsylvania]], where he lived out the last twelve years of his life as a priest.\n\n== Early life ==\nJohann Wilhelm Beschter was born on May 20, 1763,<ref name=\"devitt242\">{{harvnb|Devitt|1911|p=242}}</ref> in the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]],{{Efn|name=birthplace|Some sources indicate that Beschter may have been born in the [[Duchy of Limbourg]].<ref name=buckley127>{{harvnb|Buckley|2013|p=127}}</ref>}}<ref name=\"woodstockletters350, 352\">{{harvnb|''Woodstock Letters''|1901|p=350, 352}}</ref> located in the [[Austrian Netherlands]], a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"naturalization\" /> While little is known about his early life, Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] reported that before sailing for the [[New World]] from [[Amsterdam]] in 1807, Beschter was a [[pastor]] and [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] in Luxembourg.<ref name=woodstockletters350-1>{{harvnb|''Woodstock Letters''|1901|pp=350\u2013351}}</ref>\n\nAfter arriving in the United States, he was admitted to the [[Society of Jesus]] on October 10, 1807,<ref name=woodstockletters>{{harvnb|''Woodstock Letters''|1901|p=351}}</ref> and [[Anglicisation of names|anglicized]] his name as John William Beschter.<ref name=sener327>{{harvnb|Sener|1894|p=327}}</ref> On August 22, 1809, and again on April 21, 1814, he submitted petitions for [[naturalization]] while in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"naturalization\">{{Cite web|url=https://co.lancaster.pa.us/DocumentCenter/View/258/Naturalization-Index-1800---1906|title=Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Naturalization Index 1800-1906|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228010658/https://co.lancaster.pa.us/DocumentCenter/View/258/Naturalization-Index-1800---1906|archive-date=February 28, 2019|access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Missionary in the United States ==\n\n=== Pennsylvania ===\nIn the year of his arrival in the United States, Beschter was assigned as a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]] to [[St. Mary's Church (Lancaster, Pennsylvania)|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=sener327/> By the following year, he had been made pastor of the church,<ref name=devitt242/> making him the only Jesuit pastor of St. Mary's following the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|restoration of the Society]] in America.<ref name=devitt185>{{harvnb|Devitt|1933|p=185}}</ref> Though assigned to St. Mary's, he drew the praise of Archbishop Carroll for simultaneously ministering to three congregations in the area, which comprised [[Americans|American]], [[Germans|German]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] parishioners.<ref name=\"h\u00e4berlein198\" /> His appointment as pastor quieted an existing quarrel within the parish over the nationality and language of the pastor. Beschter's predecessor, Herman J. Stoecker, was not proficient in English, to the consternation of the Irish congregants. Stoecker had succeeded Francis Fitzsimons, an Irishman who could not speak [[German language|German]], which ruffled the German majority of parishioners. Beschter's proficiency in English as well as his native German made him a satisfactory solution to the dispute.<ref name=h\u00e4berlein197-8>{{harvnb|H\u00e4berlein|2009|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref>\n\nDuring his pastorate, the church established a [[Parochial mission|mission]] to [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania]], in 1810, as it had done in other locations throughout the state in the past. Beschter celebrated the laying of the [[cornerstone]] of the mission church, named St. Mary of the Assumption,<ref name=nolt185>{{harvnb|Nolt|2002|p=185}}</ref> on July 23 of that year.<ref name=sener337>{{harvnb|Sener|1894|p=337}}</ref> Presiding over the ceremony, he preached in both English and German to a congregation of Catholics and [[Protestantism|Protestants]],<ref name=chinnici727>{{harvnb|Chinnici|1979|p=727}}</ref> which included one [[Moravian Church|Moravian]], three [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and three [[Calvinism|Reformed]] pastors.<ref name=\"h\u00e4berlein198\" /> Beschter was described as having garnered the support and attachment of the congregation as pastor.<ref name=burson210>{{harvnb|Burson|Wright|2015|p=210}}</ref> Upon the end of his pastorate in 1812,<ref name=\"devitt242\" /> he was replaced by another Irishman, Michael J.

Though the Jesuits had an established presence in White Marsh dating to around 1741,<ref name=devitt173>{{harvnb|Devitt|1933|p=173}}</ref> it was not until 1814 that serious efforts to establish a new novitiate there were undertaken. Beschter escorted the first group of novices from [[Frederick, Maryland]] to the novitiate at White Marsh, where they arrived on July 12, 1814.<ref name=devitt175>{{harvnb|Devitt|1933|p=175}}</ref> For some time during that year, he acted as [[master of novices]] at White Marsh.<ref name=devitt181>{{harvnb|Devitt|1933|p=181}}</ref>\n\nHe is next noted as having been an [[Curate|assistant curate]] to [[Louis de Barth|Louis De Barth]] in [[Conewago Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania|Conewago]] in [[Adams County, Pennsylvania]], in 1816.<ref name=\"reily63\">{{harvnb|Reily|1885|p=63}}</ref> As the Catholic community surrounding Conewago grew, the initially dependent mission churches were granted greater degrees of autonomy, though still retaining an association with Conewago. Beschter was placed in charge of one of these churches\u2014Brandt Chapel\u2014in the Pigeon Hills area of [[Paradise Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Paradise]] in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]].<ref name=\"reily68\">{{harvnb|Reily|1885|p=68}}</ref> Later that year, he was stationed in Frederick, where he remained for two years.<ref name=reily200>{{harvnb|Reily|1885|p=200}}</ref> By 1818, Beschter had fallen ill and became involved in disagreements with Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan|Michael Egan]] of [[Philadelphia]],<ref name=h\u00e4berlein198>{{harvnb|H\u00e4berlein|2009|p=198}}</ref> and so left for [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"devitt242\" /> To mark the tercentenary of [[Martin Luther]]'s writing of the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'', a pamphlet was published in Philadelphia under Beschter's name titled \"The Blessed Reformation\u2014Martin Luther portrayed by himself.\" In reality, the pamphlet was written by [[Anthony Kohlmann]], who used Beschter's name as a [[pseudonym]].<ref name=devitt243>{{harvnb|Devitt|1911|p=243}}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, Beschter was appointed pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], located on the site of the present [[National Shrine of St. Alphonsus Liguori|St. Alphonsus Church]].<ref name=\"devitt242\" /> Succeeding F.&nbsp;X.

He defended the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit Superior General]] [[Luigi Fortis]]' appointment of Polish-born [[Francis Dzierozynski]] in 1820 as ''socius'', [[consultor]], and [[admonitor]] to [[Charles Neale]] (the [[Provincial superior|mission superior]] for the United States), which vested Dzierozynski with broad authority.<ref name=kuzniewski54>{{harvnb|Kuzniewski|1992|p=54}}</ref> He condemned the \"curious\" American view that \"sovereignty rests essentially in the people,\" as well as their opposition to monarchy.<ref name=kuzniewski55>{{harvnb|Kuzniewski|1992|p=55}}</ref> On February 2, 1821, Beschter was conferred the status of ''gradus'' in the Society of Jesus.{{Efn|name=glossary|''Gradus'' was an academic rank conferred on members of the Society of Jesus.<ref name=gramatowski15>{{harvnb|Gramatowski|2013|p=15}}</ref>}}<ref name=mendizabal>{{harvnb|Mendizabal|1972|p=21}}</ref> When Dzierozynski was later made mission superior in 1823, Beschter again supported him.<ref name=burson214>{{harvnb|Burson|Wright|2015|p=214}}</ref>\n\n== Georgetown University ==\n[[File:Georgetown 1828.jpg|thumb|Georgetown's campus in 1828|alt=Georgetown University in 1828]]\n\nIn 1828, Beschter was transferred to [[Georgetown University]] as minister.<ref name=\"devitt242\" /> When [[William Feiner]] was permitted to resign the presidency in 1829 (he had contracted [[tuberculosis]], to which he would succumb by June), Beschter was appointed [[president of Georgetown University]],<ref name=curran99>{{harvnb|Curran|1993|p=99}}</ref> assuming office on March 31 of that year.<ref name=shea79>{{harvnb|Shea|1891|p=79}}</ref> His selection came as a surprise and was met with opposition by the Anglo-American laymen, who claimed Beschter was not fluent in speaking or writing in English,<ref name=\"curran101\" /> despite the fact that he was competent enough to preach in English.<ref name=lee34>{{harvnb|Lee|2010|p=34}}</ref> They further asserted that he had no knowledge of the operation of a college. Likewise, nativist Jesuits opposed the leadership of Georgetown by such foreigners as Anthony Kohlmann, [[Stephen L.

He emigrated to the United States as a [[missionary]], and ministered in rural [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maryland]]. Beschter was the last Jesuit [[pastor]] of [[St. Mary's Church (Lancaster, Pennsylvania)|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], as well as the pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. He was also a priest at several other [[German language|German]]-speaking churches in Pennsylvania.\n\nBeschter's ministerial work was punctuated by a time as [[master of novices]] at the new Jesuit [[novitiate]] in [[White Marsh, Maryland]], as well as a brief term as [[List of presidents of Georgetown University|president]] of [[Georgetown University]] in 1829. While in Maryland, he aligned himself with the [[Continental Europe]]an Jesuits in the United States, who endorsed a [[Monarchism|monarchist]] view of ecclesiastical leadership. After his presidency, Beschter remained at Georgetown for a year as a professor of German, before returning to [[Paradise Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Paradise, Pennsylvania]], where he lived out the last twelve years of his life as a priest.\n\n== Early life ==\nJohann Wilhelm Beschter was born on May 20, 1763,<ref name=\"devitt242\">{{harvnb|Devitt|1911|p=242}}</ref> in the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]],{{Efn|name=birthplace|Some sources indicate that Beschter may have been born in the [[Duchy of Limbourg]].<ref name=buckley127>{{harvnb|Buckley|2013|p=127}}</ref>}}<ref name=\"woodstockletters350, 352\">{{harvnb|''Woodstock Letters''|1901|p=350, 352}}</ref> located in the [[Austrian Netherlands]], a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"naturalization\" /> While little is known about his early life, Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] reported that before sailing for the [[New World]] from [[Amsterdam]] in 1807, Beschter was a [[pastor]] and [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] in Luxembourg.<ref name=woodstockletters350-1>{{harvnb|''Woodstock Letters''|1901|pp=350\u2013351}}</ref>\n\nAfter arriving in the United States, he was admitted to the [[Society of Jesus]] on October 10, 1807,<ref name=woodstockletters>{{harvnb|''Woodstock Letters''|1901|p=351}}</ref> and [[Anglicisation of names|anglicized]] his name as John William Beschter.<ref name=sener327>{{harvnb|Sener|1894|p=327}}</ref> On August 22, 1809, and again on April 21, 1814, he submitted petitions for [[naturalization]] while in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"naturalization\">{{Cite web|url=https://co.lancaster.pa.us/DocumentCenter/View/258/Naturalization-Index-1800---1906|title=Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Naturalization Index 1800-1906|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228010658/https://co.lancaster.pa.us/DocumentCenter/View/258/Naturalization-Index-1800---1906|archive-date=February 28, 2019|access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Missionary in the United States ==\n\n=== Pennsylvania ===\nIn the year of his arrival in the United States, Beschter was assigned as a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]] to [[St. Mary's Church (Lancaster, Pennsylvania)|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=sener327/> By the following year, he had been made pastor of the church,<ref name=devitt242/> making him the only Jesuit pastor of St. Mary's following the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|restoration of the Society]] in America.<ref name=devitt185>{{harvnb|Devitt|1933|p=185}}</ref> Though assigned to St. Mary's, he drew the praise of Archbishop Carroll for simultaneously ministering to three congregations in the area, which comprised [[Americans|American]], [[Germans|German]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] parishioners.<ref name=\"h\u00e4berlein198\" /> His appointment as pastor quieted an existing quarrel within the parish over the nationality and language of the pastor. Beschter's predecessor, Herman J. Stoecker, was not proficient in English, to the consternation of the Irish congregants. Stoecker had succeeded Francis Fitzsimons, an Irishman who could not speak [[German language|German]], which ruffled the German majority of parishioners. Beschter's proficiency in English as well as his native German made him a satisfactory solution to the dispute.<ref name=h\u00e4berlein197-8>{{harvnb|H\u00e4berlein|2009|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref>\n\nDuring his pastorate, the church established a [[Parochial mission|mission]] to [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania]], in 1810, as it had done in other locations throughout the state in the past. Beschter celebrated the laying of the [[cornerstone]] of the mission church, named St. Mary of the Assumption,<ref name=nolt185>{{harvnb|Nolt|2002|p=185}}</ref> on July 23 of that year.<ref name=sener337>{{harvnb|Sener|1894|p=337}}</ref> Presiding over the ceremony, he preached in both English and German to a congregation of Catholics and [[Protestantism|Protestants]],<ref name=chinnici727>{{harvnb|Chinnici|1979|p=727}}</ref> which included one [[Moravian Church|Moravian]], three [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and three [[Calvinism|Reformed]] pastors.<ref name=\"h\u00e4berlein198\" /> Beschter was described as having garnered the support and attachment of the congregation as pastor.<ref name=burson210>{{harvnb|Burson|Wright|2015|p=210}}</ref> Upon the end of his pastorate in 1812,<ref name=\"devitt242\" /> he was replaced by another Irishman, Michael J.

Though the Jesuits had an established presence in White Marsh dating to around 1741,<ref name=devitt173>{{harvnb|Devitt|1933|p=173}}</ref> it was not until 1814 that serious efforts to establish a new novitiate there were undertaken. Beschter escorted the first group of novices from [[Frederick, Maryland]] to the novitiate at White Marsh, where they arrived on July 12, 1814.<ref name=devitt175>{{harvnb|Devitt|1933|p=175}}</ref> For some time during that year, he acted as [[master of novices]] at White Marsh.<ref name=devitt181>{{harvnb|Devitt|1933|p=181}}</ref>\n\nHe is next noted as having been an [[Curate|assistant curate]] to [[Louis de Barth|Louis De Barth]] in [[Conewago Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania|Conewago]] in [[Adams County, Pennsylvania]], in 1816.<ref name=\"reily63\">{{harvnb|Reily|1885|p=63}}</ref> As the Catholic community surrounding Conewago grew, the initially dependent mission churches were granted greater degrees of autonomy, though still retaining an association with Conewago. Beschter was placed in charge of one of these churches\u2014Brandt Chapel\u2014in the Pigeon Hills area of [[Paradise Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Paradise]] in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]].<ref name=\"reily68\">{{harvnb|Reily|1885|p=68}}</ref> Later that year, he was stationed in Frederick, where he remained for two years.<ref name=reily200>{{harvnb|Reily|1885|p=200}}</ref> By 1818, Beschter had fallen ill and became involved in disagreements with Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan|Michael Egan]] of [[Philadelphia]],<ref name=h\u00e4berlein198>{{harvnb|H\u00e4berlein|2009|p=198}}</ref> and so left for [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"devitt242\" /> To mark the tercentenary of [[Martin Luther]]'s writing of the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'', a pamphlet was published in Philadelphia under Beschter's name titled \"The Blessed Reformation\u2014Martin Luther portrayed by himself.\" In reality, the pamphlet was written by [[Anthony Kohlmann]], who used Beschter's name as a [[pseudonym]].<ref name=devitt243>{{harvnb|Devitt|1911|p=243}}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, Beschter was appointed pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], located on the site of the present [[National Shrine of St. Alphonsus Liguori|St. Alphonsus Church]].<ref name=\"devitt242\" /> Succeeding F.&nbsp;X.

He defended the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit Superior General]] [[Luigi Fortis]]' appointment of Polish-born [[Francis Dzierozynski]] in 1820 as ''socius'', [[consultor]], and [[admonitor]] to [[Charles Neale]] (the [[Provincial superior|mission superior]] for the United States), which vested Dzierozynski with broad authority.<ref name=kuzniewski54>{{harvnb|Kuzniewski|1992|p=54}}</ref> He condemned the \"curious\" American view that \"sovereignty rests essentially in the people,\" as well as their opposition to monarchy.<ref name=kuzniewski55>{{harvnb|Kuzniewski|1992|p=55}}</ref> On February 2, 1821, Beschter was conferred the status of ''gradus'' in the Society of Jesus.{{Efn|name=glossary|''Gradus'' was an academic rank conferred on members of the Society of Jesus.<ref name=gramatowski15>{{harvnb|Gramatowski|2013|p=15}}</ref>}}<ref name=mendizabal>{{harvnb|Mendizabal|1972|p=21}}</ref> When Dzierozynski was later made mission superior in 1823, Beschter again supported him.<ref name=burson214>{{harvnb|Burson|Wright|2015|p=214}}</ref>\n\n== Georgetown University ==\n[[File:Georgetown 1828.jpg|thumb|Georgetown's campus in 1828|alt=Georgetown University in 1828]]\n\nIn 1828, Beschter was transferred to [[Georgetown University]] as minister.<ref name=\"devitt242\" /> When [[William Feiner]] was permitted to resign the presidency in 1829 (he had contracted [[tuberculosis]], to which he would succumb by June), Beschter was appointed [[president of Georgetown University]],<ref name=curran99>{{harvnb|Curran|1993|p=99}}</ref> assuming office on March 31 of that year.<ref name=shea79>{{harvnb|Shea|1891|p=79}}</ref> His selection came as a surprise and was met with opposition by the Anglo-American laymen, who claimed Beschter was not fluent in speaking or writing in English,<ref name=\"curran101\" /> despite the fact that he was competent enough to preach in English.<ref name=lee34>{{harvnb|Lee|2010|p=34}}</ref> They further asserted that he had no knowledge of the operation of a college. Likewise, nativist Jesuits opposed the leadership of Georgetown by such foreigners as Anthony Kohlmann, [[Stephen L.
