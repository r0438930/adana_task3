The people came to object to his rule when he failed to recognize the rape of [[Lucretia]], a patrician Roman, at the hands of his own son. Lucretia's kinsman, [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] (ancestor to [[Marcus Brutus]]), summoned the Senate and had Superbus and the monarchy expelled from Rome in 510&nbsp; BC. After Superbus' expulsion, the Senate voted to never again allow the rule of a king and reformed Rome into a [[Roman Republic|republican government]] is 509&nbsp; BC. In fact, the Latin word \"Rex\" meaning King became a dirty and hated word throughout the Republic and later on the Empire.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Classical Greece (5th to 4th centuries&nbsp;BC)==\n{{Main|Classical Greece}}\n[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Delian League (\"Athenian Empire\"), right before the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431&nbsp;BC]]\nThe classical period of Ancient Greece corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries&nbsp;BC, in particular, from the fall of the [[tyrant#Athens|Athenian tyranny]] in 510&nbsp;BC to the [[death of Alexander the Great]] in 323&nbsp;BC. In 510, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow the tyrant [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]], son of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]]. [[Cleomenes&nbsp;I]], king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy conducted by [[Isagoras]].\n\nThe [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499\u2013449&nbsp;BC), concluded by the [[Peace of Callias]] gave way not only to the liberation of Greece, [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], [[Thrace]], and [[Ionia]] from [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian rule]], but also resulted in giving the dominant position of [[Athens]] in the [[Delian League]], which led to conflict with [[Sparta]] and the [[Peloponnesian League]], resulting in the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404&nbsp; BC), which ended in a Spartan victory.\n\nGreece entered the 4th century under [[Spartan hegemony]]. But by 395&nbsp; BC the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. [[Athens]], [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], the latter two of which were formerly Spartan allies, challenged Spartan dominance in the [[Corinthian War]], which ended inconclusively in 387&nbsp;BC. Later, in 371&nbsp;BC, the Theban generals [[Epaminondas]] and [[Pelopidas]] won a victory at the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of [[Theban hegemony]]. Thebes sought to maintain its position until it was finally eclipsed by the rising power of [[Macedon]] in 346&nbsp; BC.\n\nUnder [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;II]], (359\u2013336&nbsp;BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the [[Paeonians]], the [[Thracians]] and the [[Illyrians]]. Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]], (356\u2013323&nbsp; BC) managed to briefly extend [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]n power not only over the central Greek city-states but also to the [[Persian Empire]], including [[Egypt]] and lands as far east as the fringes of [[India]].

Roman victory in the [[Punic Wars]] and [[Macedonian Wars]] established Rome as a super-regional power by the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, followed up by the acquisition of [[Roman Greece|Greece]] and [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]]. This tremendous increase of power was accompanied by economic instability and social unrest, leading to the [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]], the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]] and the [[First Triumvirate]], and finally the transformation to the Roman Empire in the latter half of the 1st century&nbsp;BC.\n\n== Roman Empire (1st century BC to 5th century&nbsp;AD) ==\n{{Main|Roman Empire}}\n\n[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The extent of the Roman Empire under Trajan,&nbsp;AD&nbsp;117]]\n\nThe precise end of the Republic is disputed by modern historians;{{NoteTag|The precise event which signaled the transition of the Roman Republic into the [[Roman Empire]] is a matter of interpretation.

The Roman state continued to call itself a ''res publica'' as long as it continued to use Latin as its official language.\n\nRome acquired imperial character ''de facto'' from the 130s&nbsp;BC with the acquisition of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], [[Illyria]], [[Roman Greece|Greece]] and [[Hispania]], and definitely with the addition of [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]] and [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] in the 1st century&nbsp;BC. At the time of the empire's maximal extension under [[Trajan]] (AD&nbsp;117), Rome controlled the entire [[Mediterranean]] as well as Gaul, parts of [[Germania]] and [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], the [[Balkans]], [[Dacia]], Asia Minor, the [[Caucasus]] and [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nCulturally, the Roman Empire was significantly [[Hellenization|hellenized]], but also saw the rise of syncretic \"eastern\" traditions, such as [[Mithraism]], [[Gnosticism]], and most notably [[Origins of Christianity|Christianity]].\nThe empire began to decline in the [[crisis of the third century]].\n\nWhile sometimes compared with classical Greece,{{by whom|date=February 2019}} classical Rome had vast differences within their family life. Fathers had great power over their children, and husbands over their wives and these acts were commonly compared with slave-owners and slaves. In fact the word family, \"familia\" in Latin, actually referred to those who were under the authority of a male head of household. This included non-related members such as slaves and servants. In marriage, both men and women were loyal to one another and shared property.

At the same time [[early Slavs]] settled in the Balkans.]]\n\nThe original Roman Senate continued to express decrees into the late 6th century, and the last Eastern Roman emperor to use [[Latin]] as the language of his court in Constantinople was emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], who reigned until 602. The overthrow of Maurice by his mutinying Danube army under [[Phocas]] resulted in the Slavic invasion of the Balkans and the decline of Balkan and Greek urban culture (leading to the flight of Balkan Latin speakers to the mountains, see [[Origin of the Romanians]]), and also provoked the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]] in which all the great eastern cities except Constantinople were lost. The resulting turmoil did not end until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century finalized the irreversible loss of all the largest Eastern Roman imperial cities besides the capital itself. The emperor [[Heraclius]] in [[Constantinople]], who emerged during this period, conducted his court in Greek, not Latin, though Greek had always been an administrative language of the eastern Roman regions. Eastern-Western links weakened with the ending of the [[Byzantine Papacy]].\n\nThe Eastern Roman empire's capital city of [[Constantinople]] was left as the only unconquered large urban center of the original Roman empire, as well as being the largest city in Europe. Over the next millennium the Roman culture of that city would slowly change, leading modern historians to refer to it by a new name, [[Byzantine]], though many classical books, sculptures, and technologies survived there along with classical Roman cuisine and scholarly traditions, well into the Middle Ages, when much of it was \"rediscovered\" by visiting Western crusaders. Indeed, the inhabitants of Constantinople continued to refer to themselves as Romans, as did their eventual conquerors in 1453, the [[Ottomans]]. (See [[R\u00fbm]] and [[Romaioi]].) The classical scholarship and culture that was still preserved in Constantinople were brought by refugees fleeing its conquest in 1453 and helped to spark the [[Renaissance]], see [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance]].\n\nUltimately, it was a slow, complex, and graduated change in the socioeconomic structure in [[European history]] that led to the changeover between Classical Antiquity and Medieval society and no specific date can truly exemplify that.\n\n== Political revivalism==\n{{Further|Carolingian Renaissance|Ottonian Renaissance|Renaissance|Classicism|Legacy of the Roman Empire}}\n\nIn politics, the late Roman conception of the Empire as a universal state, headed by one supreme divinely-appointed ruler, united with Christianity as a universal religion likewise headed by a supreme [[patriarch]], proved very influential, even after the disappearance of imperial authority in the west. This tendency reached its peak when [[Charlemagne]] was [[Coronation|crowned]] \"Roman Emperor\" in the year 800, an act which led to the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The notion that an [[emperor]] is a [[monarch]] who outranks a mere king dates from this period. In this political ideal, there would always be a Roman Empire, a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized world.\n\nThat model continued to exist in Constantinople for the entirety of the Middle Ages; the [[Byzantine Emperor]] was considered the sovereign of the entire Christian world. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] was the Empire's highest-ranked cleric, but even he was subordinate to the Emperor, who was \"God's Vicegerent on Earth\". The Greek-speaking Byzantines and their descendants [[Romioi|continued to call themselves \"Romans\"]] until the creation of a new Greek state in 1832.\n\nAfter the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the Russian [[Czar of Russia|Czar]]s (a title derived from ''Caesar)'' claimed the Byzantine mantle as the champion of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]; [[Moscow]] was described as the \"[[Third Rome]]\" and the Czars ruled as divinely-appointed Emperors into the 20th century.\n\nDespite the fact that the Western Roman secular authority disappeared entirely in Europe, it still left traces. The [[Papacy]] and the [[Catholic Church]] in particular maintained Latin language, culture, and literacy for centuries; to this day the popes are called ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' which in the classical period was a title belonging to the Emperor, and the ideal of [[Christendom]] carried on the legacy of a united European civilization even after its political unity had disappeared.\n\nThe political idea of an Emperor in the West to match the Emperor in the East continued after the Western Roman Empire's collapse; it was revived by the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] in&nbsp;800; the self-described [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruled over central Europe until 1806.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] idea that the classical Roman virtues had been lost under medievalism was especially powerful in European politics of the 18th and 19th centuries. Reverence for Roman republicanism was strong among the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and the Latin American revolutionaries; the Americans described their new government as a ''republic'' (from ''[[res publica]]'') and gave it a ''Senate'' and a ''President'' (another Latin term), rather than make use of available English terms like ''commonwealth'' or ''parliament''.\n\nSimilarly in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic]] France, republicanism and Roman martial virtues were upheld by the state, as can be seen in the architecture of the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on]], the [[Arc de Triomphe]], and the paintings of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. During the revolution, France itself followed the transition from kingdom to republic to dictatorship to Empire (complete with Imperial Eagles) that Rome had undergone centuries earlier.\n\n== Cultural legacy ==\n{{Main|Classicism|Classical studies}}\n[[File:Sanzio 01 cropped.png|thumb|250px|[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] walking and disputing. Detail from [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509\u20131511)]]\n''Classical antiquity'' is a broad term for a long period of cultural [[history]]. Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many rather disparate cultures and periods. \"Classical antiquity\" often refers to an idealized vision of later people, of what was, in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s words, <blockquote>\"the glory that was [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], the grandeur that was [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]!\" </blockquote>In the 18th and 19th centuries AD, reverence for classical antiquity was much greater in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] than it is today. Respect for the ancients of Greece and Rome affected [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[education]], and even [[architecture]] and [[History of sex|sexuality]].\n\n[[Epic poetry]] in [[Latin]] continued to be written and circulated well into the 19th century. [[John Milton]] and even [[Arthur Rimbaud]] received their first poetic educations in Latin. Genres like epic poetry, [[pastoral]] verse, and the endless use of characters and themes from [[Greek mythology]] left a deep mark on Western literature. In architecture, there have been several [[Greek Revival]]s, which seem more inspired in retrospect by Roman architecture than Greek. [[Washington, DC]] is filled with large [[marble]] buildings with facades made out to look like [[Roman temple]]s, with columns constructed in the [[classical orders]] of architecture.\n\nIn philosophy, the efforts of St [[Thomas Aquinas]] were derived largely from the thought of [[Aristotle]], despite the intervening change in [[religion]] from [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenic Polytheism]] to [[Christianity]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} Greek and Roman authorities such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]] formed the foundation of the practice of [[medicine]] even longer than Greek thought prevailed in philosophy. In the [[France|French]] [[theater]], [[tragedy|tragedians]] such as [[Moli\u00e8re]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]] wrote plays on mythological or classical historical subjects and subjected them to the strict rules of the [[classical unities]] derived from Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. The desire to [[dance]] like a latter-day vision of how the ancient Greeks did it moved [[Isadora Duncan]] to create her brand of [[ballet]].\n\n==Timeline==\n{{Further|Timeline of classical antiquity}}\n\n{{Timeline of classical antiquity}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|History|Ancient Greece|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[Classical architecture]]\n* [[Classical tradition]]\n* [[Classics]] (Classical education)\n* [[Outline of classical studies]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Egypt]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Greece]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Postclassical Era]] (the next period)\n\n; Regions during classical antiquity\n* [[Ancient history of Cyprus]]\n* [[Gaul]]\n* [[Hellenistic Greece]]\n* [[History of the Balkans]]\n* [[Roman Britain]]\n* [[Roman Dacia]]\n* [[Troy]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Grinin L.

In 510, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow the tyrant [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]], son of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]]. [[Cleomenes&nbsp;I]], king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy conducted by [[Isagoras]].\n\nThe [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499\u2013449&nbsp;BC), concluded by the [[Peace of Callias]] gave way not only to the liberation of Greece, [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], [[Thrace]], and [[Ionia]] from [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian rule]], but also resulted in giving the dominant position of [[Athens]] in the [[Delian League]], which led to conflict with [[Sparta]] and the [[Peloponnesian League]], resulting in the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404&nbsp; BC), which ended in a Spartan victory.\n\nGreece entered the 4th century under [[Spartan hegemony]]. But by 395&nbsp; BC the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. [[Athens]], [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], the latter two of which were formerly Spartan allies, challenged Spartan dominance in the [[Corinthian War]], which ended inconclusively in 387&nbsp;BC. Later, in 371&nbsp;BC, the Theban generals [[Epaminondas]] and [[Pelopidas]] won a victory at the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of [[Theban hegemony]]. Thebes sought to maintain its position until it was finally eclipsed by the rising power of [[Macedon]] in 346&nbsp; BC.\n\nUnder [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;II]], (359\u2013336&nbsp;BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the [[Paeonians]], the [[Thracians]] and the [[Illyrians]]. Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]], (356\u2013323&nbsp; BC) managed to briefly extend [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]n power not only over the central Greek city-states but also to the [[Persian Empire]], including [[Egypt]] and lands as far east as the fringes of [[India]].

The early [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] \"[[Roman Emperor|Emperors]]\" maintained that the ''[[res publica]]'' still existed, albeit under the protection of their extraordinary powers, and would eventually return to its full Republican form. The Roman state continued to call itself a ''res publica'' as long as it continued to use Latin as its official language.\n\nRome acquired imperial character ''de facto'' from the 130s&nbsp;BC with the acquisition of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], [[Illyria]], [[Roman Greece|Greece]] and [[Hispania]], and definitely with the addition of [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]] and [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] in the 1st century&nbsp;BC. At the time of the empire's maximal extension under [[Trajan]] (AD&nbsp;117), Rome controlled the entire [[Mediterranean]] as well as Gaul, parts of [[Germania]] and [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], the [[Balkans]], [[Dacia]], Asia Minor, the [[Caucasus]] and [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nCulturally, the Roman Empire was significantly [[Hellenization|hellenized]], but also saw the rise of syncretic \"eastern\" traditions, such as [[Mithraism]], [[Gnosticism]], and most notably [[Origins of Christianity|Christianity]].\nThe empire began to decline in the [[crisis of the third century]].\n\nWhile sometimes compared with classical Greece,{{by whom|date=February 2019}} classical Rome had vast differences within their family life. Fathers had great power over their children, and husbands over their wives and these acts were commonly compared with slave-owners and slaves. In fact the word family, \"famiglia\" in Italian, actually referred to those who were under the authority of a male head of household. This included non-related members such as slaves and servants. In marriage, both men and women were loyal to one another and shared property. Divorce was first allowed starting in the first century BC and could be done by either man or woman.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History Global Perspectives|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-8995-8|edition=2nd|date=2010-07-06}}</ref>\n\n==Late Antiquity (4th to 6th centuries&nbsp;AD)==\n[[File:Roman Empires 476AD.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] [[Roman Empire]]s by 476]]\n{{Main|Late Antiquity|Migration period|Fall of the Western Roman Empire}}\n\nLate Antiquity saw the rise of [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] under [[Constantine I]], finally ousting the [[Roman imperial cult]] with the [[Theodosian decrees]] of&nbsp;393.

At the same time [[early Slavs]] settled in the Balkans.]]\n\nThe original Roman Senate continued to express decrees into the late 6th century, and the last Eastern Roman emperor to use [[Latin]] as the language of his court in Constantinople was emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], who reigned until 602. The overthrow of Maurice by his mutinying Danube army under [[Phocas]] resulted in the Slavic invasion of the Balkans and the decline of Balkan and Greek urban culture (leading to the flight of Balkan Latin speakers to the mountains, see [[Origin of the Romanians]]), and also provoked the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]] in which all the great eastern cities except Constantinople were lost. The resulting turmoil did not end until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century finalized the irreversible loss of all the largest Eastern Roman imperial cities besides the capital itself. The emperor [[Heraclius]] in [[Constantinople]], who emerged during this period, conducted his court in Greek, not Latin, though Greek had always been an administrative language of the eastern Roman regions. Eastern-Western links weakened with the ending of the [[Byzantine Papacy]].\n\nThe Eastern Roman empire's capital city of [[Constantinople]] was left as the only unconquered large urban center of the original Roman empire, as well as being the largest city in Europe. Over the next millennium the Roman culture of that city would slowly change, leading modern historians to refer to it by a new name, [[Byzantine]], though many classical books, sculptures, and technologies survived there along with classical Roman cuisine and scholarly traditions, well into the Middle Ages, when much of it was \"rediscovered\" by visiting Western crusaders. Indeed, the inhabitants of Constantinople continued to refer to themselves as Romans, as did their eventual conquerors in 1453, the [[Ottomans]]. (See [[R\u00fbm]] and [[Romaioi]].) The classical scholarship and culture that was still preserved in Constantinople were brought by refugees fleeing its conquest in 1453 and helped to spark the [[Renaissance]], see [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance]].\n\nUltimately, it was a slow, complex, and graduated change in the socioeconomic structure in [[European history]] that led to the changeover between Classical Antiquity and Medieval society and no specific date can truly exemplify that.\n\n== Political revivalism==\n{{Further|Carolingian Renaissance|Ottonian Renaissance|Renaissance|Classicism|Legacy of the Roman Empire}}\n\nIn politics, the late Roman conception of the Empire as a universal state, headed by one supreme divinely-appointed ruler, united with Christianity as a universal religion likewise headed by a supreme [[patriarch]], proved very influential, even after the disappearance of imperial authority in the west. This tendency reached its peak when [[Charlemagne]] was [[Coronation|crowned]] \"Roman Emperor\" in the year 800, an act which led to the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The notion that an [[emperor]] is a [[monarch]] who outranks a mere king dates from this period. In this political ideal, there would always be a Roman Empire, a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized world.\n\nThat model continued to exist in Constantinople for the entirety of the Middle Ages; the [[Byzantine Emperor]] was considered the sovereign of the entire Christian world. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] was the Empire's highest-ranked cleric, but even he was subordinate to the Emperor, who was \"God's Vicegerent on Earth\". The Greek-speaking Byzantines and their descendants [[Romioi|continued to call themselves \"Romans\"]] until the creation of a new Greek state in 1832.\n\nAfter the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the Russian [[Czar of Russia|Czar]]s (a title derived from ''Caesar)'' claimed the Byzantine mantle as the champion of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]; [[Moscow]] was described as the \"[[Third Rome]]\" and the Czars ruled as divinely-appointed Emperors into the 20th century.\n\nDespite the fact that the Western Roman secular authority disappeared entirely in Europe, it still left traces. The [[Papacy]] and the [[Catholic Church]] in particular maintained Latin language, culture, and literacy for centuries; to this day the popes are called ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' which in the classical period was a title belonging to the Emperor, and the ideal of [[Christendom]] carried on the legacy of a united European civilization even after its political unity had disappeared.\n\nThe political idea of an Emperor in the West to match the Emperor in the East continued after the Western Roman Empire's collapse; it was revived by the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] in&nbsp;800; the self-described [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruled over central Europe until 1806.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] idea that the classical Roman virtues had been lost under medievalism was especially powerful in European politics of the 18th and 19th centuries. Reverence for Roman republicanism was strong among the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and the Latin American revolutionaries; the Americans described their new government as a ''republic'' (from ''[[res publica]]'') and gave it a ''Senate'' and a ''President'' (another Latin term), rather than make use of available English terms like ''commonwealth'' or ''parliament''.\n\nSimilarly in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic]] France, republicanism and Roman martial virtues were upheld by the state, as can be seen in the architecture of the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on]], the [[Arc de Triomphe]], and the paintings of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. During the revolution, France itself followed the transition from kingdom to republic to dictatorship to Empire (complete with Imperial Eagles) that Rome had undergone centuries earlier.\n\n== Cultural legacy ==\n{{Main|Classicism|Classical studies}}\n[[File:Sanzio 01 cropped.png|thumb|250px|[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] walking and disputing. Detail from [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509\u20131511)]]\n''Classical antiquity'' is a broad term for a long period of cultural [[history]]. Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many rather disparate cultures and periods. \"Classical antiquity\" often refers to an idealized vision of later people, of what was, in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s words, <blockquote>\"the glory that was [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], the grandeur that was [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]!\" </blockquote>In the 18th and 19th centuries AD, reverence for classical antiquity was much greater in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] than it is today. Respect for the ancients of Greece and Rome affected [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[education]], and even [[architecture]] and [[History of sex|sexuality]].\n\n[[Epic poetry]] in [[Latin]] continued to be written and circulated well into the 19th century. [[John Milton]] and even [[Arthur Rimbaud]] received their first poetic educations in Latin. Genres like epic poetry, [[pastoral]] verse, and the endless use of characters and themes from [[Greek mythology]] left a deep mark on Western literature. In architecture, there have been several [[Greek Revival]]s, which seem more inspired in retrospect by Roman architecture than Greek. [[Washington, DC]] is filled with large [[marble]] buildings with facades made out to look like [[Roman temple]]s, with columns constructed in the [[classical orders]] of architecture.\n\nIn philosophy, the efforts of St [[Thomas Aquinas]] were derived largely from the thought of [[Aristotle]], despite the intervening change in [[religion]] from [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenic Polytheism]] to [[Christianity]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} Greek and Roman authorities such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]] formed the foundation of the practice of [[medicine]] even longer than Greek thought prevailed in philosophy. In the [[France|French]] [[theater]], [[tragedy|tragedians]] such as [[Moli\u00e8re]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]] wrote plays on mythological or classical historical subjects and subjected them to the strict rules of the [[classical unities]] derived from Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. The desire to [[dance]] like a latter-day vision of how the ancient Greeks did it moved [[Isadora Duncan]] to create her brand of [[ballet]].\n\n==Timeline==\n{{Further|Timeline of classical antiquity}}\n\n{{Timeline of classical antiquity}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|History|Ancient Greece|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[Classical architecture]]\n* [[Classical tradition]]\n* [[Classics]] (Classical education)\n* [[Outline of classical studies]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Egypt]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Greece]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Postclassical Era]] (the next period)\n\n; Regions during classical antiquity\n* [[Ancient history of Cyprus]]\n* [[Gaul]]\n* [[Hellenistic Greece]]\n* [[History of the Balkans]]\n* [[Roman Britain]]\n* [[Roman Dacia]]\n* [[Troy]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Grinin L.
