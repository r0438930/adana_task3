It is the first in the [[Police Story (film series)|''Police Story'' series]] not to be directed by Jackie, with [[Stanley Tong]] taking over the helm.

He is sent to [[Guangzhou]], where the Chinese police force's Interpol director, Inspector Jessica Yang ([[Michelle Yeoh]]), briefs him on his next assignment. The target is Chaibat, a drug lord based in Hong Kong. To infiltrate Chaibat's organization, Ka-Kui is to get close to Chaibat's henchman Panther, who is in a Chinese prison. Ka-Kui, posing as a petty criminal prisoner, manages Panther's escape with the connivance of the guards. Grateful, Panther invites Ka-Kui to go with him to Hong Kong and join Chaibat's gang. Panther meets up with some of his other men, and vouches for Ka-Kui. The group heads for Hong Kong.\n\nOn the way, they pass through Ka-Kui's supposed home village, and Panther insists that Ka-Kui visit his family there. He does not actually know anyone in the village, but is pleasantly relieved to be greeted by undercover police posing as his family, with Yang as his sister. The local police pretend to arrest Ka-Kui in a restaurant, but Ka-Kui and Yang (also a martial-arts expert) escape after a big fight, which concludes with the faked killing of a policeman. This confirms Panther's trust in them.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Chaibat welcomes Ka-Kui and Yang to his luxurious hide-out. He takes them with him to a big [[opium]] grower's fortified compound in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] of [[Thailand]], for a meeting of big-time [[heroin]] traffickers. During the meeting, Chaibat's gang attack from outside while Ka-Kui and Yang protect him inside. In a huge gun battle, Chaibat's gang kill the rival traffickers and their guards, and smash up the compound. The grower survives, but will now sell only to Chaibat at Chaibat's price.\n\nThe action then shifts to [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], where Chaibat's wife, Chen Wen-Shi, is in prison, facing the [[Capital_punishment_in_Malaysia|death penalty]] for an unspecified crime. Chaibat needs to get her out of prison, because only she knows the secret codes to his [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss bank account]], and will not reveal them to him unless freed. Chaibat brings his gang, now including Ka-Kui and Yang, to Kuala Lumpur to stage a jailbreak.\n\nA new difficulty arises when Ka-Kui sees his girlfriend May, a tour guide, in Kuala Lumpur leading a party of Hong Kong tourists. He has told her he's on assignment. Ka-Kui evades May at first, but she sees him at the luxurious hotel where Chaibat's gang are staying, with the beautiful Yang, and confronts him in a jealous rage. This nearly blows Ka-Kui's cover, but Panther is persuaded that May is angry because Ka-Kui tried to proposition her as a prostitute. Later, Ka-Kui gets May alone and explains the situation, and she finally calms down. At one point, May even manages to keep Ka-Kui from inadvertently blowing his own cover. But then, in an elevator, May tells a co-worker about Ka-Kui, and is overheard by one of Panther's men. Chaibat takes May hostage, and forces Ka-Kui and Yang \u2013 their cover now blown \u2013 to help free Chen.\n\nChaibat's scheme is successful and May is released, as per their agreement. However, the exchange turns sour when Chaibat pushes May from his helicopter, though she survives. Furious, Ka-Kui and Yang pursue Chaibat and his men over the roads, rooftops (where Ka-Kui and Yang defeat Panther and his partner), and skies of Kuala Lumpur. In the climax on top of a speeding train, Chaibat is killed after his helicopter collides with a bridge and lands on him. Yang and Ka-Kui also recapture Chen. Since her husband is dead, she decides to tell Yang and Ka-Kui the password to Chaibat's bank account. The two partners argue whether Hong Kong or China will get the money.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as [[Royal Hong Kong Police|RHKP]] Inspector \"Kevin\" [[Chan Ka-Kui]] / Chen Chia-Chu / Lin Fu Sheng (doubled by Stanley Tong)\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]] Inspector \"Jessica\" Yang Chien-Hua / Hannah Lin\n* [[Maggie Cheung]] as May, Kevin's girlfriend\n* [[Bill Tung]] as \"Uncle\" Bill Wong, RHKP [[deputy commissioner]] and Kevin's boss\n* [[Philip Chan (actor)|Philip Chan]] as [[Commissioner of Police (Hong Kong)|RHKP Commissioner]] Y.K.

There are more laughs in this hilarious three-minute sequence than in the whole of ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]''. I can't think of a better reason to stay through the entire movie.

Later, Ka-Kui gets May alone and explains the situation, and she finally calms down. At one point, May even manages to keep Ka-Kui from inadvertently blowing his own cover. But then, in an elevator, May tells a co-worker about Ka-Kui, and is overheard by one of Panther's men. Chaibat takes May hostage, and forces Ka-Kui and Yang \u2013 their cover now blown \u2013 to help free Chen.\n\nChaibat's scheme is successful and May is released, as per their agreement. However, the exchange turns sour when Chaibat pushes May from his helicopter, though she survives. Furious, Ka-Kui and Yang pursue Chaibat and his men over the roads, rooftops (where Ka-Kui and Yang defeat Panther and his partner), and skies of Kuala Lumpur. In the climax on top of a speeding train, Chaibat is killed after his helicopter collides with a bridge and lands on him. Yang and Ka-Kui also recapture Chen. Since her husband is dead, she decides to tell Yang and Ka-Kui the password to Chaibat's bank account. The two partners argue whether Hong Kong or China will get the money.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as [[Royal Hong Kong Police|RHKP]] Inspector \"Kevin\" [[Chan Ka-Kui]] / Chen Chia-Chu / Lin Fu Sheng (doubled by Stanley Tong)\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]] Inspector \"Jessica\" Yang Chien-Hua / Hannah Lin\n* [[Maggie Cheung]] as May, Kevin's girlfriend\n* [[Bill Tung]] as \"Uncle\" Bill Wong, RHKP [[deputy commissioner]] and Kevin's boss\n* [[Philip Chan (actor)|Philip Chan]] as [[Commissioner of Police (Hong Kong)|RHKP Commissioner]] Y.K.

There are more laughs in this hilarious three-minute sequence than in the whole of ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]''. I can't think of a better reason to stay through the entire movie. Ultimately, the closing montage points out one of the chief differences between Chan's stylized, fast-paced films and those of his American counterparts: this is action with a smile, not a grimace.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James|title=Supercop (aka Police Story 3): A Film Review by James Berardinelli|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/supercop.html|accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Richard Harrington said:\n\"Chan seems to have met his soul mate in Khan [Yeoh's credited name], Asia's top female action star. Like Chan, Khan does her own fighting and stunts. Unlike the Hollywood action contingent, Chan and Khan don't rely on cinematic trickery. Theirs are not special effects, just spectacular ones.
