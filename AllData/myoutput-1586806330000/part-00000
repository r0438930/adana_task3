It is the second installment in the [[Krrish (franchise)|''Krrish'' franchise]], being the continuation to ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'', and relates the story of Krishna, the son of the previous film's protagonists, who inherits his father's superhuman abilities. After falling in love with Priya, he follows her to Singapore, where he takes on the persona of \"Krrish\" to keep his identity secret while saving children from a burning circus. From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero, and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Arya, who has a connection to Krishna's father, Rohit, the protagonist of the previous film.\n\n''Krrish '' was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert [[Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The music was composed by [[Rajesh Roshan]], with the background score by [[Salim-Sulaiman]]. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India.\n\nThe film was released worldwide on 23 June 2006 at a budget of {{INR}}400 million<ref name=\"Budget\"/> and on 1000 prints, both near-record amounts for an Indian film at the time. ''Krrish'' received mixed reviews from critics in India, but got a record opening week at the box office. A [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Krrish'' grossed a worldwide total of {{INR}}1.26 billion,<ref name=\"Kr\"/> becoming the [[List of Bollywood films of 2006|third highest earning Indian film of 2006]].\n\n''Krrish'' was nominated for eight [[Filmfare Awards]], including [[Filmfare Best Film Award|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Best Director Award|Best Director]], [[Filmfare Best Actor Award|Best Actor]] for Roshan, and [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award|Best Supporting Actress]] for Rekha, winning three, including [[Filmfare Best Special Effects Award|Best Special Effects]]. At the [[8th IIFA Awards|2007 IIFA Awards]], the film received nine nominations and won three, with one being [[IIFA Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Roshan. It also won the [[National Film Award for Best Special Effects]]. The third film in the series, ''[[Krrish 3]]'' was released in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Hatnote|The plot of the film connects with the predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see [[Koi... Mil Gaya#Plot|Koi... Mil Gaya]].}}\nFive-year-old Krishna Mehra, son of the late scientist Rohit Mehra, undergoes an [[intelligence quotient]] test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers, due to Krishna answering all the questions flawlessly. His grandmother Sonia takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna meets vacationing friends Priya and Honey when Krishna's friend Bahadur takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]] accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her.\n\nAfter returning home to [[Singapore]], Priya and Honey are fired by their boss for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. To keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Sonia objects to this, saying that people will want to exploit his abilities. She then explains the events of [[Koi... Mil Gaya|the previous film]], and that Rohit was hired by scientist Siddhant Arya to design a computer that could see the future to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. Rohit later discovered that the purpose of the computer was not for good, so he destroyed it. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of trauma shortly thereafter. Krishna promises Sonia that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself; Honey and Priya are fired again.\n\nKrishna meets circus performer Kristian Li, who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to his circus, where a fire breaks out during the performance. Several children remain trapped in the blaze. To save the children without revealing his abilities, Krishna dons a broken black mask and puts his jacket on inside-out, creating the persona of \"Krrish\". Later, when Kristian sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna is Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya discovers that Krishna is Krrish upon seeing the footage from her video camera. She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has genuinely fallen in love with Krishna, he leaves, dejected.\n\nAfter being confronted by Krishna at his apartment they talked what she said, Priya realises her mistake and stops her boss from revealing Krrish's identity. She then meets Vikram Sinha, who has been searching for Krishna for years. He tells them that Rohit is still alive; after completing the computer, he and Rohit tested it and saw Siddhant holding Rohit at gunpoint. Rohit understood that Siddhant was going to kill him and then use the computer for his own selfish needs. He was able to destroy it, before being taken prisoner by Siddhant.\n\nIn the present, Siddhant has rebuilt the computer after many years. He uses it to reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island.\n\nWhen Krrish enters the compound, there is a vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However, Vikram is shot dead by Siddhant. Krrish eventually wounds Siddhant fatally. Before Siddhant dies, Krrish reveals himself as Krishna. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and his father back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit then uses his father's special computer to contact his alien friend Jadoo, whose spaceship is later seen from a distance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hrithik Roshan]] as Rohit Mehra and Krishna \"Krrish\" Mehra\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as Dr. Siddhant Arya\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Priya Mehra / Priya Kalyanan, Krishna's love interest\n* [[Rekha]] as Sonia Mehra, Rohit's mother and Krishna's grandmother\n* [[Manini Mishra (actress)|Manini Mishra]] as Honey Arora, Priya's best friend\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as Vikram Sinha\n* [[Archana Puran Singh]] as Nayantara, Priya and Honey's boss\n* Bin Xia as Kristian Li\n* [[Hemant Pandey]] as Bahadur\n* [[Puneet Issar]] as Komal Singh\n\n===Cameo=== \n*[[Akash Khurana]] as Catholic school principal\n*[[Kiran Juneja]] as Amisha Kalyanan, Priya's mother\n*Yu Xuan as Kristian Li's little sister\n*[[Preity Zinta]] as Nisha Mehra ; Krishna's mother\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn November 2004, the Roshans confirmed he would produce a sequel to ''[[Koi...

It is the second installment in the [[Krrish (franchise)|''Krrish'' franchise]], being the continuation to ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'', and relates the story of Krishna, the son of the previous film's protagonists, who inherits his father's superhuman abilities. After falling in love with Priya, he follows her to Singapore, where he takes on the persona of \"Krrish\" to keep his identity secret while saving children from a burning circus. From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero, and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Arya, who has a connection to Krishna's father, Rohit, the protagonist of the previous film.\n\n''Krrish '' was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert [[Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The music was composed by [[Rajesh Roshan]], with the background score by [[Salim-Sulaiman]]. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India.\n\nThe film was released worldwide on 23 June 2006 at a budget of {{INR}}400 million<ref name=\"Budget\"/> and on 1000 prints, both near-record amounts for an Indian film at the time. ''Krrish'' received mixed reviews from critics in India, but got a record opening week at the box office. A [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Krrish'' grossed a worldwide total of {{INR}}1.26 billion,<ref name=\"Kr\"/> becoming the [[List of Bollywood films of 2006|third highest earning Indian film of 2006]].\n\n''Krrish'' was nominated for eight [[Filmfare Awards]], including [[Filmfare Best Film Award|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Best Director Award|Best Director]], [[Filmfare Best Actor Award|Best Actor]] for Roshan, and [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award|Best Supporting Actress]] for Rekha, winning three, including [[Filmfare Best Special Effects Award|Best Special Effects]]. At the [[8th IIFA Awards|2007 IIFA Awards]], the film received nine nominations and won three, with one being [[IIFA Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Roshan. It also won the [[National Film Award for Best Special Effects]]. The third film in the series, ''[[Krrish 3]]'' was released in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Hatnote|The plot of the film connects with the predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see [[Koi... Mil Gaya#Plot|Koi... Mil Gaya]].}}\nFive-year-old Krishna Mehra, son of the late scientist Rohit Mehra, undergoes an [[intelligence quotient]] test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers, due to Krishna answering all the questions flawlessly. His grandmother Sonia takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna meets vacationing friends Priya and Honey when Krishna's friend Bahadur takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]] accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her.\n\nAfter returning home to [[Singapore]], Priya and Honey are fired by their boss for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. To keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Sonia objects to this, saying that people will want to exploit his abilities. She then explains the events of [[Koi... Mil Gaya|the previous film]], and that Rohit was hired by scientist Siddhant Arya to design a computer that could see the future to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. Rohit later discovered that the purpose of the computer was not for good, so he destroyed it. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of trauma shortly thereafter. Krishna promises Sonia that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself; Honey and Priya are fired again.\n\nKrishna meets circus performer Kristian Li, who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to his circus, where a fire breaks out during the performance. Several children remain trapped in the blaze. To save the children without revealing his abilities, Krishna dons a broken black mask and puts his jacket on inside-out, creating the persona of \"Krrish\". Later, when Kristian sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna is Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya discovers that Krishna is Krrish upon seeing the footage from her video camera. She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has genuinely fallen in love with Krishna, he leaves, dejected.\n\nAfter being confronted by Krishna at his apartment they talked what she said, Priya realises her mistake and stops her boss from revealing Krrish's identity. She then meets Vikram Sinha, who has been searching for Krishna for years. He tells them that Rohit is still alive; after completing the computer, he and Rohit tested it and saw Siddhant holding Rohit at gunpoint. Rohit understood that Siddhant was going to kill him and then use the computer for his own selfish needs. He was able to destroy it, before being taken prisoner by Siddhant.\n\nIn the present, Siddhant has rebuilt the computer after many years. He uses it to reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island.\n\nWhen Krrish enters the compound, there is a vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However, Vikram is shot dead by Siddhant. Krrish eventually wounds Siddhant fatally. Before Siddhant dies, Krrish reveals himself as Krishna.
