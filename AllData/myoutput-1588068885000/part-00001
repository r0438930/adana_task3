Devarajan''' or '''Devarajan master''', was an Indian [[music composer]]. He is considered one of the greatest music directors in Indian film music arena. He scored music for more than three hundred [[Malayalam cinema|Malayalam films]], many dramas, and twenty [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and four [[Kannada]] movies. Many of his compositions remain ever green classics in Malayalam. His music in the Tamil film ''[[Annai Velankanni]]'' has received many accolades. Devarajan received Kerala Government's Best Music Director award five times, among other honours. He is regarded as the greatest music composer ever in the history of Malayalam cinema.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/a-melodious-obsession/article29493758.ece |title=A melodious obsession |page=6 |publisher=The Hindu |date=2019-09-24 |accessdate=2019-09-24}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn at [[Paravur, Kollam|Paravur]], Kollam district in [[Kerala]], Devarajan Master performed his first [[Indian classical music|classical concert]] at the age of 18. He was soon attracted to the [[communism|Communist movement]] and decided to dedicate his creative energy to popular music.  He joined the once famous drama troupe of Kerala, the [[Kerala People's Arts Club]] (KPAC). The work that brought him to the limelight was the drama song titled \"Ponnarivaal ambiliyil kanneriyunnoole\", written by his friend [[O. N. V. Kurup]] and composed and sung by himself. KPAC and its members had a distinctive leaning towards the communist ideology, and their dramas played a role in spreading the ideology among the Keralite masses. Through his compositions, Devarajan would cast an indelible imprint in the Malayali theatre arena, especially after the famous KPAC drama ''Ningalenne Communistaakki'', written by [[Thoppil Bhasi]] in 1952.\n\n==Film career==\nThe first movie for which he composed music was ''Kaalam Maarunnu'' (1955). He teamed up with poet-lyricist [[Vayalar Ramavarma]] in ''Chathurangam'' in 1959. His third movie \u2013 and the second with Vayalar \u2013 ''Bharya'' (1962) became a huge hit and made them a popular combination.<ref>http://msidb.org/processSearch.php?db=moviesongs&musician=G%20Devarajan&lyricist=Vayalar</ref> His music earned him pride of place among those who had striven to earn a dignified status for film songs. His collaborations with Vayalar produced the golden era of Malayalam film music. Devarajan is remembered by prominent singers in Malayalam like [[K. J. Yesudas]] and [[P. Jayachandran|Jayachandran]] as their Godfather. In fact, it was the compositions by him that brought laurels to the main singers of that age. Devarajan was at one point regarded as the doyen of film music in South India. He was much respected by all musicians and singers of that period, for his sound knowledge in classical music.{{citation needed|reason=It would be virtually impossible to verify that \"all\" musicians and singers of that period \"feared and respected\" him.|date=January 2016}} It might be due to this dominance he had over others that he was widely known as arrogant. But he enjoyed a royal status till his death among the music circles.\n\nDevarajan was the one who used the most number of [[raaga]]s in Malayalam film music. His music embraced different styles with the [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] melody lines meeting folk idioms and Western harmony. Despite being a strong [[atheism|atheist]], he composed devotional songs like \"[[Harivarasanam]]\",\n\"[[Guruvayoor Temple|Guruvayoor]] Ambalanadayil\", \"Chethi Mandaram Thulasi\", and \"Nithyavishudhayam Kanyamariyame\", which are considered classics in that genre. Also, he is particularly noted for his remarkable ability to blend the words of the lyrics with the mood of the situation in his film song compositions. Most of his hit songs were written by Vayalar Ramavarma and the combination of Vayalar-Devarajan-P Susheela-Yesudas was synonymous with beautiful songs. The Vayalar-Devarajan combine proved the most successful team till the death of Vayalar in the mid 1970s. Hundreds of songs contributed by the team are still part of Malayalis' nostalgia.{{citation needed|reason=This is a sweeping generalization that would be difficult to prove; surely there are plenty of Malayalis who don't like his music, or who don't like film music in general.|date=January 2016}} Apart from Vayalar, he has also given tunes to lyrics by other eminent poets and songwriters like [[O. N. V. Kurup]], [[P. Bhaskaran]],Yusufali Kecheri and [[Sreekumaran Thampi]].\n\nA complete work of Devarajan, ''Devageethikal'', composed by himself, has released and the book is published by Authentic books.Sangeethashastra navasudha is also a book written by devarajan master.\n\nDevarajan Master died of a heart attack at his residence in [[Chennai]] at 12:30 AM IST on 15 March 2006.
