'''John Nicholas Crispin Aubrey''' (3 January 1946 – 28 September 2012) was a British journalist.  He was one of the defendants in the [[ABC trial]] in 1978, named after the initials of the defendants' surnames, in which he and freelance journalist [[Duncan Campbell (journalist)|Duncan Campbell]] were convicted under the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]] for receiving classified information from John Berry, a former [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) operator.  The controversy over the case eventually led to amendments to the law in the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]].

==Early life and career==
Aubrey was born in [[Chipstead, Surrey]].  His father was an insurance broker, and his mother was an illustrator.  He was educated at [[Leighton Park School]], an independent Quaker school in Reading, and studied English at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].  He married Susan Jacob in 1968.  They had three daughters.

He worked as a journalist at the ''[[Hampshire Chronicle]]'', before moving to ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' in 1974 as an investigative reporter concentrating on environmental issues.  He became involved in an unsuccessful campaign to prevent the government deporting two Americans - former [[CIA]] [[case officer]] [[Philip Agee]] and ''Time Out'' journalist [[Mark Hosenball]] - on national security grounds after they wrote an article on [[GCHQ]].

==ABC trial==
{{main|ABC trial}}
In February 1977, Aubrey and freelance journalist [[Duncan Campbell (journalist)|Duncan Campbell]] were arrested as the left the flat where they had been interviewing John Berry, a former member of Signals Intelligence, which is based at GCHQ.  They were charged with unlawful disclosure and receipt of classified information, contrary to section 2 of the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]], and charges were later added under section 1 of the Official Secrets Act.  During a period of a year while they were awaiting trial, all three suffered intimidation and harassment, including house searches, were followed by plain clothes officers, and were required to report to the police each day.

Their defence was supported by the [[National Union of Journalists]] and civil liberties groups.  A first trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in September 1978 collapsed after one of the members of the jury was identified as a former officer in the [[Special Air Service]].  A second trial opened in October 1978.   The prosecution admitted that much of the information was in the public domain, and charges under section 1 were dropped.  Many witnesses testified under code letters - one, Colonel B, was identified as Colonel [[Hugh Johnstone]], head of Signals Intelligence, and protesters chanted his name outside the court. They were convicted in November 1978 but received non-custodial sentences.

==Later life==
Aubrey moved to [[Nether Stowey]] in Somerset after the trial, where he became a [[smallholder]] and freelance journalist.  He published a book in 1981, '' Who's Watching You? Britain's Security Service and the Official Secrets Act''.  He also became involved in environmental issues.  He advocated wind power, editing the magazine of the [[European Wind Energy Association]], and opposed nuclear power.  He published two books on environmental issues, ''Meltdown, the Collapse of the Nuclear Dream'' (1991), and ''Thorp: the Whitehall Nightmare'' (1993).  He campaigned against the building of a new nuclear reactor at [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station]] in Somerset.  After working as a press officer for the [[Glastonbury Festival]] since the 1990s, he was co-editor of a book ''Glastonbury Festival Tales'' (2004) with [[John Shearlaw]].

He died of a heart attack in [[Bridgwater]] in Somerset.

:''\"TSPS\" redirects here. For the school, see The Sheffield Private School.''

The '''Traffic Service Position System''' ('''TSPS''') was developed by [[Bell Labs]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] to replace traditional cord [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]]s.  The first TSPS was deployed in 1969 and used the [[Stored Program Control exchange|Stored Program Control]]-1A CPU, \"Piggyback\" [[twistor memory]] (a proprietary technology developed by [[Bell Labs]] similar to core memory) and [[IGFET|Insulated Gate Field Effect Transistor]] solid state memory devices similar to [[DRAM|dynamic random access memory]].

==Features==
The TSPS system utilized special [[analog transmission|analog]] trunks that originated at [[Class 5 telephone switch|Class 5]] end office circuit switch systems and [[Class 4 telephone switch|Class 4]] toll access circuit switch systems that were connected to Class 3 primary toll circuit switch systems such as the 4A-ETS/PBC and [[4ESS switch]] systems.  The TSPS system did not perform switching between the originating end office switch and the toll switch for the subscriber voice path.

The TSPS system included the \"Remote Trunking Arrangement\" (RTA) feature that consolidated the trunk connection at the originating switch and provided a switched connection to a [[Switchboard operator|telephone operator]] only as required for a short duration at the beginning of a call to obtain billing information or at the end of a call in which the caller requested \"time and charges\".

The TSPS system provided a temporary switched connection to a toll operator who helped facilitate calls requiring human assistance such as person-to-person, collect, third-party-billed, and hotel billing.  The TSPS system supported up to seven \"Chief Operator Groups\" (COGs) with each COG supporting up to 31 operator consoles.  Operator consoles initially used [[nixie tube]] displays that were quickly replaced by [[light-emitting diode]] displays due to reliability issues.

The TSPS system was replaced by the Operator Service Position System (OSPS) feature package developed for the [[5ESS switch]]ing system. During the era of TSPS systems, calls to mobile and marine radiotelephone customers were initially handled by operators at a Special Operator Service Treatment cord switchboard.  Operator assisted calls to international destinations were handled by \"Code 10\" and \"Code 11\" operators generally co-located at special gateway international switching systems.

==Hotel Billing Information System==
The TSPS system included the ''Hotel Billing Information System'' (HoBIS) special feature to provide automated billing of [[long-distance call]]s from hotel front desks so guests could be charged for calls made almost immediately prior to their departure.  Private [[Teleprinter|Teletype]] data links were provisioned to large [[hotel]]s that subscribed to this service.

==Automated Coin Toll System==
Debuted in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1977 the ''Automated Coin Toll System'' (ACTS) was an addition to TSPS which provided an automated way to perform charge advisory and toll collection of coin paid calls, reducing the need for operator involvement.  The ACTS sub-system handled the automated voice announcements, e.g. \"Please deposit five cents for the next three minutes\" (initially voiced by [[Jane Barbe]] , and later  [[Pat Fleet]]), and worked with TSPS for coin deposit (start of call) coin collection/coin return (at end of call).<ref>{{cite web |title=Automated Coin Toll System (ACTS) |url=http://www.phworld.org/payphone/acts.htm}}</ref>

[[Category:Professional titles and certifications]]","A '''nexus degree''' is an [[undergraduate degree]] awarded after a course of post-secondary study. It is a level of qualification with hour requirements comparable to an [[associate degree]]. However, it incorporates an [[internship]] or [[apprenticeship]] requirement as well as a number of upper-division specialization courses that are more typical for a [[bachelor's degree]] or [[master's degree]]. The nexus degree can serve as a [[first degree]] or a [[professional degree]] depending on the context.<ref name=\"usg\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usg.edu/academic_programs/nexus_degree|title=Academic Programs - Nexus Degree|website=University System of Georgia|accessdate=2020-03-10}}</ref><ref name=\"ihe\">{{cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/12/04/georgias-public-colleges-soon-will-be-offering-new-form-two-year-degree|title=Nexus Degrees in Georgia|last=St. Amour|first=Madeline|newspaper=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|date=December 4, 2019|accessdate=2020-03-10}}</ref>

The nexus degree was introduced in the state of [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]] in 2020.<ref name=\"ihe\"/> It is the first new accredited degree type introduced in the United States since associate degrees were first awarded in 1898.<ref name=\"che\">{{cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/New-2-Year-Degree-Promises/247600|title=New 2-Year Degree Promises Gen-Ed Basics and Fast-Track Career Skills|last=Kafka|first=Alexander|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=November 24, 2019|accessdate=2020-03-10}}</ref> It was designed to create more flexibility in higher education, compete with [[professional certifications]] and [[microcredential]]s, make career transitions easier, and offer more specialization for traditional students wanting to enter high-demand fields.<ref name=\"ihe\"/>

==History==
The nexus degree was developed as part of the [[University System of Georgia]]'s College 2025 initiative.<ref name=\"ihe\"/><ref name=\"albanyherald\">{{cite news|url=https://www.albanyherald.com/news/local/asu-columbus-state-to-offer-nexus-degrees/article_e24f9d61-6a4b-54f7-ba82-e511cca48bba.html|title=ASU, Columbus State to offer nexus degrees|newspaper=[[Albany Herald]]|last=Haynes|first=Jada|date=August 15, 2018|accessdate=2020-03-10}}</ref> The initiative was launched in 2017 by USG chancellor Steve Wrigley. The goal of the initiative was to create a plan to address concerns about the costs and quality of higher education as well as how well a college education prepares students for the modern workforce. The solutions explored by the College 2025 initiative were based on the research of USG chief academic officer Dr. Tristan Denley.<ref name=\"ihe\"/><ref name=\"college2025\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usg.edu/college2025/|title=College 2025|publisher=University System of Georgia|accessdate=2020-03-10}}</ref> To develop the new degree, the USG consulted and collaborated with university representatives, employers, and other stakeholders.<ref name=\"ihe\"/>

In 2018, [[Albany State University]] and [[Columbus State University]] were approved to become the first two schools in Georgia to offer the new degree type.<ref name=\"albanyherald\"/> Columbus State University began offering nexus degrees in Film Production and the Cybersecurity of Financial Technology beginning in January 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://academics.columbusstate.edu/catalogs/current/reqs/coa_nexus_filmprod.php|title=Nexus Film Production|website=2019-2020 Academic Catalog|publisher=Columbus State University|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://academics.columbusstate.edu/catalogs/current/reqs/cobcs_nxcybersec.php|title=Nexus Cybersecurity of Financial Technology|website=2019-2020 Academic Catalog|publisher=Columbus State University|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>

==Structure==
The nexus degree is designed to serve as both a standalone, two-year degree program and as a stackable credential, depending on the needs of the student.<ref name=\"usg\"/><ref name=\"che\"/> Students pursuing a standalone degree are required to complete 42 general studies credit hours, 18 credit hours of specialized instruction, and six credit hours of paid [[internship]]s or [[apprenticeship]]s.<ref name=\"usg\"/> The nexus degree requirements may also be transferred to or stacked with a [[bachelor's degree]] curriculum without the need to repeat core credit requirements.<ref name=\"ihe\"/><ref name=\"che\"/>

The '''Narvik Shield''' ({{Lang-de|Narvikschild}}) was a [[World War II]] [[Nazi Germany|German]] military decoration awarded to all German forces that took part in the [[battles of Narvik]] between 9 April and 8 June 1940. It was instituted on 19 August 1940 by [[Adolf Hitler]]. The ''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht'' (OKW) published the order the same day. It was bestowed by General [[Eduard Dietl]], the commander of Army Group Narvik.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=276}}{{sfn|Ailsby|1987|p=96}}

The award was the first of a series of [[Campaign shields (Wehrmacht)|arm shield campaign awards]].{{sfn|Littlejohn|1968|p=142}} A total of 8,577 personnel received the award.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=276}} Specifically: 2,755 to the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|army]], 2,161 to the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', and 3,661 to the [[Luftwaffe]].{{sfn| Williamson|2012|p=18}} 

==Design==
Designed by Professor Dr. [[Richard Klein (artist)|Richard Klein]] of Munich, the shield is narrow with a pointed base and, at its apex, has an eagle with down-swept wings clutching a laurel wreath that surrounds a swastika. Below this in capital letters is written <tt>NARVIK</tt>. The body of the shield features an [[edelweiss]] (representing the [[Gebirgsjäger|army mountain troops]]), an anchor (representing the ''Kriegsmarine''), and propeller (for the Luftwaffe).

'''HMS ''G12''''' was a [[British G-class submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during World War I.

==Description==
The G-class submarines were designed by the [[Admiralty]] in response to a rumour that the Germans were building [[double hull|double-hulled]] submarines for overseas duties. The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>

The boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>

==Career==
Like the rest of her class, ''G12''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]]. She survived the war and was sold for scrap in 1920.

'''Sir Bernard Hale''' (1677–1729) was an English-born  [[barrister]]  and judge who became [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]]. Two of his sons became Generals  in the British Army.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921''  London  John Murray 1926</ref>

==Background==
He was born at [[King's Walden]], [[Hertfordshire]], the  eighth son of William Hale and his wife Mary Elwes. The Hale family, who  originally made their fortune as [[grocers]]  in London,  had owned property in King's Walden since the sixteenth century,<ref>{{cite DNB|last=Rigg|first=J. M.|wstitle=Hale, Bernard|volume=24|page=17}}</ref> and Bernard's own descendants were still living there in Victorian times.<ref>Baker, J. H.  \"Bernard Hale\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> His father William was the son of Rowland Hale,  [[High Sheriff of Hertfordshire]] in 1648, and was himself a political figure of some consequence, being  MP for [[Hertfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Hertfordshire]] in the [[English Parliament]] of 1679 and in the short-lived English  Parliament of 1681. His mother Mary was the daughter of Jeremy (Jeremiah) Elwes of [[Roxby, Lincolnshire]].

Bernard  was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]], graduating  from Peterhouse  as Bachelor of Arts in 1699 and Master of Arts in 1702: he subsequently became a fellow of Peterhouse.<ref>Baker</ref> He entered [[Gray's Inn]] in 1699, and was [[called to the Bar]] in 1705. He became one of the leaders of the English Bar, and was one of its top earners. He later transferred to [[Lincoln's Inn]], and was briefly one of its Benchers.<ref>Baker</ref>

==Family==
He married Anne Thoresby  (or Thursby) daughter of John Thoresby  of [[Northampton]]. They had seven children including:
*[[Bernard Hale (British Army officer)|General Bernard Hale]] (died 1798),
*[[John Hale (British Army officer)|General John Hale]], [[Governor of Londonderry]] (died 1806),
*William Hale, 
*Richard Hale,  
*Jane Hale, who married Martin Madan; her portrait was painted by [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepeerage.com/p47082.htm#i470817 |title=Person Page |publisher=Thepeerage.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-12}}</ref>

[[File:John Hale by Joshua Reynolds.png|thumb|200px|Chief Baron Hale's youngest son John Hale, [[Governor of Londonderry]], painted by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]

==Irish career==
In 1722 he was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and earned a high  reputation in Ireland for integrity and efficiency.<ref>Ball ''Judges in Ireland''</ref> In 1725 he and his junior Baron, [[John St Leger (1674–1743)|Sir John St Leger]], narrowly escaped death when on [[assize]] at [[Monaghan]]: the roof of Monaghan courthouse, which like many Irish courthouses of the time was in an appalling state of repair, fell in. It narrowly missed the judges, who  adjourned outside and continued the assize.<ref>Ball</ref>

Later the same year, it was rumoured that he was to be appointed [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]].<ref>Ball</ref> In fact he was offered the office of [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]]: but his English colleagues advised him to refuse it, on the ground that he would shortly be offered a place on the English Bench. Hale admitted that the prospect of being Irish Lord Chief Justice was tempting enough to \"perplex him\", but his preference was to go back to England. Although he had been happy enough in Ireland, he admitted that \"it is impossible for me to forget England or not to wish to return there\".<ref>Baker</ref>

==Last years==
He went back to England  in the autumn of 1725  to take up  office as a [[Baron of the Exchequer]]: to qualify for that office he was made a [[Serjeant-at-law]], and received a [[knighthood]].<ref>Baker</ref>

He died at [[Red Lion Square]], London in 1729 and was buried at King's Walden.<ref>Rigg p.17</ref>

'''Radio Essex''' is a local contemporary hit music radio station broadcasting to [[Essex]], England via [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] and Mid and South Essex via [[Frequency Modulation|FM]], from studios in The Icon Building on Southend Seafront, owned by the [[Adventure Radio]] Group.

==History==
{{further information|Chelmsford Radio|Southend Radio}}

The station until 2015, two separate stations with separate names.

107.7 FM began broadcasting as Chelmer FM in 1998, under the ownership of Mid Essex Radio Ltd. The station was re-branded twice, first in 2002 by the [[Tindle Radio Group]] as Dream 107.7 (in line with Dream 100, also owned by Tindle Radio), then again in 2009 by [[Adventure Radio]] as [[Chelmsford Radio]].

105.1 FM was launched in 2008 as [[Southend Radio]].

'''Roger Verte d'Este Burford''' (1904–1981) was an English poet, novelist and [[screenwriter]]. He also wrote crime fiction as '''Roger East'''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Library of Congress. Copyright Office|title=Catalog of Copyright Entries. New Series: 1934|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raMhAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA178|year=1935|publisher=Copyright Office, Library of Congress|page=178}}</ref>

Burford attended Cambridge University, being a friend of [[Christopher Isherwood]]. Both were members of the Cambridge University Kinema Club. He is given the pseudonym \"Roger East\" in Isherwood's early memoir ''Lions and Shadows''; Burford later married Stella Wilkinson, who appears as \"Polly\" in the same book. The two men corresponded throughout the 1930s and Burford's letters are preserved in Isherwood's papers. <ref>David Garrett Izzo, ''Christopher Isherwood Encyclopedia'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co., 2005, 28</ref> After graduating he published the well-received \"realist\" novel ''Kay Walters, A Woman of the People'' in 1928. He remained active in British literary circles, publishing his poetry regularly in \"little magazines\" such as ''Seed'' and ''Booster'' and becoming a member of the editorial board of the poetry magazine ''Delta'' in April 1938. A collection of his verse was published in 1937.

In the late 1920s he also began a career as a writer of screen scenarios and scripts in the British film industry. He expanded into television in the 1950s, as well as writing the film ''Three Steps in the Dark'' (1953) and contributing scripts for the series ''Maigret'' and ''Dr. Finlay's Casebook'' in the 1960s.

Burford was a diplomat in Moscow during World War II.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19850713&id=gH4xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uKUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5820,829516&hl=en|title=Good detectives who age gracefully|last=Carbray|first=Paul|date=13 July 1985|work=The Montreal Gazette|via=[[Google Search]]|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>

'''Roger Verte d'Este Burford''' (1904–1981) was an English poet, novelist and [[screenwriter]]. He also wrote crime fiction as '''Roger East'''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Library of Congress. Copyright Office|title=Catalog of Copyright Entries. New Series: 1934|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raMhAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA178|year=1935|publisher=Copyright Office, Library of Congress|page=178}}</ref>

Burford attended Cambridge University, being a friend of Christopher Isherwood. Both were members of the Cambridge University Kinema Club. He is fictionalised as \"Roger East\" in Isherwood's novel ''Lions and Shadows''; Burford later married Stella Wilkinson, who appears as \"Polly\" in the same novel. The two men corresponded throughout the 1930s and Burford's letters are preserved in Isherwood's papers. <ref>David Garrett Izzo, ''Christopher Isherwood Encyclopedia'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co., 2005, 28</ref> After graduating he published the well-received \"realist\" novel ''Kay Walters, A Woman of the People'' in 1928. He remained active in British literary circles, publishing his poetry regularly in \"little magazines\" such as ''Seed'' and ''Booster'' and becoming a member of the editorial board of the poetry magazine ''Delta'' in April 1938. A collection of his verse was published in 1947.

In the late 1920s he also began a career as a writer of screen scenarios and scripts in the British film industry. He expanded into television in the 1950s, writing the BBC drama ''Three Steps in the Dark'' (1953) and contributing scripts for the series ''Maigret'' and ''Dr. Finlay's Casebook'' in the 1960s.
  
Burford was a diplomat in Moscow during World War II.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19850713&id=gH4xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uKUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5820,829516&hl=en|title=Good detectives who age gracefully|last=Carbray|first=Paul|date=13 July 1985|work=The Montreal Gazette|via=[[Google Search]]|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>

'''Daniel Paul Charles''' was a French [[musician]], [[musicologist]] and [[philosopher]]. He was born on 27 November 1935 in [[Oran]] ([[Algeria]]) and died on 21 August 2008 in [[Antibes]] ([[France]]).

== Biography ==

He was a student of [[Olivier Messiaen]] at the Paris Conservatory of Music (First Prize, 1956), he received the aggregation in philosophy in 1959 and a PhD under the direction of [[Mikel Dufrenne]] in 1977.

After leading (late 1968) the Commission charged with establishing the status of professorship of music at the French Ministry of Education, he founded and lead for twenty years (1969–1989) the Department of Music of [[University of Paris VIII]] (Vincennes, and St. Denis). He was also responsible, from 1970 to 1980, for the teaching of general aesthetics at the [[University of Paris IV]] (Sorbonne). He decided to end his career by teaching philosophy at the [[University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis]] (1989–1999).

When he graduated from the [[Paris Conservatory of Music]] in 1956, he participated in the [[Groupe de Recherches Musicales|GRM]] under the leadership of [[Pierre Schaeffer]], and proposed to set into electronic music [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]'s \"[[Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard (Mallarmé)|Coup de dés]]\" in [[Darmstadt]], a project which caught the attention of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. But his lack of enthusiasm toward the \"solfège des bruits\" of Schaeffer led him to focus instead on [[John Cage]], whom he met in 1958. He contributed then to present Cage's music and philosophy in France: [[Pour les oiseaux]] (co-signed with Cage), published first in French (Paris, Belfond, 1976) became a classic book. It was later published in English: [[For the Birds (book)|For the Birds]].

Daniel Charles has been invited by many universities to lecture (usually across the Atlantic, but also including Japan and the Philippines), and has published many articles and several books, five of which have been translated into German, and two into Japanese.

Two people are selected to go into a closet or other dark enclosed space and do whatever they like for seven minutes. It is common for the participants to [[kiss]] or [[Making out|make out]], but they may instead choose to talk, engage in some other (usually quiet) activity, or simply do nothing at all and wait for the time to expire. 

The participants can be selected by various methods, such as [[Spin the bottle|spinning a bottle]], drawing lots or votes.

Dr. Neuwirth devoted his career to crafting and refining noninvasive practices promoting women's health. He was one of the first doctors to employ [[endoscopy]] in gynecological practice, in which a small optical instrument called an [[endoscope]] is used to examine areas tucked deep into the body. He is known as the first doctor to introduce laparoscopy to the United States, in 1968. 

Neuwrith is also known for his work in the pharmaceutical industry and  sold several of his patents, primarily to [[Johnson & Johnson]], between 1994 and 2003.

From 1974 to 1991, Dr. Neuwirth acted as chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at [[St. Luke's–Roosevelt Hospital Center|St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital]] in [[Manhattan]], at which time he published a critical analysis of the gynecological uses of [[hysteroscopy]]. In 1977 he was appointed as the first Babcock Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at [[Columbia University]]. During that tenure, he served as an examiner for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology from 1982 to 1998.

Dr. Neuwirth contributed to at least 55 medical journals and publications in his lifetime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vitals.com/doctors/Dr_Robert_S_Neuwirth/credentials|title=Dr. Robert S. Neuwirth Hospital Affiliations, Awards and Credentials, Obstetrician & Gynecologist, New York, NY|website=Vitals|access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref>

== Gynecologic endoscopy ==
One of Dr. Neuwirth's greatest priorities was lessening the need for [[hysterectomy]], a common gynecological surgical procedure that removes the uterus while often posing significant risks of infection and other severe complications.

The surgical discipline of gynecological endoscopy, which Dr. Neuwirth pioneered, utilizes optical instruments to help diagnose common female-specific disorders and pathologies, including but not limited to infertility and vaginal hemorrhaging. Gynecological endoscopy is performed using at least one of two methods: hysteroscopy and laparoscopy.

Dr. Neuwirth is credited as the first doctor to introduce [[laparoscopy]] to the United States in 1968, authoring several research articles on laparosopic sterilization and ovarian biopsies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In 1969 he introduced hysteroscopy to the American gynecological community and authored a monograph on the technique in 1974. In 1976, Dr. Neuwirth developed resectoscopic surgery of submucous fibroids, arguably the most important development in modern gynecology.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Radiological Interventions in Obstetrics and Gynaecology|last=Reidy|first=John|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=3642279759|location=|pages=119|via=}}</ref> The technique enabled doctors to minimize uterine perforation.

In 1992, Dr. Neuwirth authored the first report on long-term outcome of menstrual function following hysteroscopic [[endometrial ablation]], a treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding. He is also the inventor of balloon endometrial ablation.

SS ''Josiah Parker'' was one of the 37 ships carrying [[United States Navy Armed Guard]]s in Convoy UGS-37, April 11-12, 1944.
<blockquote>
\"They were some 35 miles east of [[Algiers]] near midnight of April 11 and 12 when an undetermined number of enemy planes attacked. No ship carrying Armed Guards was hit by the enemy, but several ships received minor damage from the gunfire of other ships. Practically all ships opened fire and the amount of flak falling was quite heavy ... The ''Josiah Parker'' reported an explosion on one of the escorts and indicated that she too was hit by shell fragments.\"<ref>{{Cite book

== Convoy UGS-37, 1944 ==
SS ''Josiah Parker'' was one of the 37 ships carrying [[United States Navy Armed Guard]]s in Convoy UGS-37, April 11-12, 1944.
<blockquote>
\"They were some 35 miles east of [[Algiers]] near midnight of April 11 and 12 when an undetermined number of enemy planes attacked. No ship carrying Armed Guards was hit by the enemy, but several ships received minor damage from the gunfire of other ships. Practically all ships opened fire and the amount of flak falling was quite heavy ... The ''Josiah Parker'' reported an explosion on one of the escorts and indicated that she too was hit by shell fragments.\"<ref>{{Cite book
