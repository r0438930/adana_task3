He became a fellow of King's College London in 2018.\n\nPercy's theological outlook is rooted in his long-standing commitment to [[Central churchmanship|middle-way Anglicanism]]. His writings fall into three distinct-but-related groups: [[ecclesiology]]; contemporary Christianity, religious movements and sociological trends; and anthropological interpretations of denominations and congregations; and spiritual devotional writings.<ref>{{cite news|author=Simon Coleman|pages=213\u2013228|title=Locating the Church|editor=Abby Day|journal=Contemporary Issues in the Worldwide Communion|publisher=Routledge|year=2016}}</ref> He has also written extensively about theological education, as well as contextual, [[pastoral theology|pastoral]] and [[practical theology]].\n\nIn 2013, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' praised Percy for his work towards unity within the [[Anglican Communion]] and Church of England, describing him as displaying a \"peaceable, polite and restrained\" approach whilst \"making peace between competing communities of conviction.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Peter Cornwell|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/reviews/other_categories/article1331024.ece|title=Quiet, please|publisher=Times Literary Supplement|date=25 October 2013 |page=29}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nPercy was born on 31 July 1962.<ref>{{Who's Who | surname = Percy | othernames = Martyn William | id = U4000736 | volume = 2019 | edition = 1 December 2018 online | accessed = 27 January 2019}}</ref> He was educated at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood]], the [[University of Bristol]] (BA), the [[University of Durham]] (Cert.
