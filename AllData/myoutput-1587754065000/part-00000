It offers a wide range of courses including A-levels, BTECs and Secretarial. It is now one of two campuses of USP College.\n\n===History===\n\nPalmer's was first opened in 1706 when the merchant William Palmer founded a [[charity school]] for \"ten poore children\" of the parish of Grays Essex, endowing it with valuable property in the town and Lombard Street in the City of London. Initially located in a small building inside the churchyard the school evolved into a boys' school. However, in response to the changing educational landscape initiated by the 1870 Education Act, the trustees of Palmer's charity re-launched the school on a new site on the hill above the town in 1874. To this a girls' school was added in 1876.<ref>Herbert Brooks, ''William Palmer and his School. Being an account of the founder of Palmer's Charity at Grays Thurrock, Essex'' (Colchester, 1928).</ref> The schools were [[grammar schools]] for both boys' and girls', and [[William Strang, 1st Baron Strang]], perhaps Palmer's most distinguished alumnus, recalled it in 1905 as 'a modest establishment, modest that is in size and in material equipment, but not at all modest in the opinion which it held of itself'.<ref>Lord Strang, 'Fifty Years Ago', in J. R. Hayston (ed.), ''250 Years on. To commemorate the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the trust deed by which William Palmer endowed in 1706 a school in Grays Thurrock'' (1956), p. 59. See also Strang's autobiography, ''Home and abroad'' (1956)</ref> The boy school which admitted both day pupils and boarders until 1970, achieved the status of a [[state school|public school]] in 1931\u201346. In 1972, as part of the reorganisation of education in Essex, the boys' and girls' schools amalgamated, together with Aveley Technical High School, to constitute a sixth form college. During the mid-1970s, the boys' and Aveley schools relocated to the College's present site (until then occupied by the Girls' School alone). The College was supported by the William Palmer College Education Trust, the direct successor of the trustees William Palmer appointed to administer his charity. Artifacts from the schools' past can be seen in the College library.\n\nA 2007 inspection by [[Ofsted]] concluded: \"Palmer's is an outstanding college.\" Student achievement and the standard of work were good and success rates overall 'well above national averages for learners from all backgrounds'. The College was also praised for its retention rates and value-added scores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/40/130682|title=''2007 Palmers College Report'' - Ofsted May 2017|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 a subsequent report rated the college as \"Requires Improvement\" because few students studying academic courses were achieving high grades, there were no consistent standards of teaching, learning and assessment, and the college's leadership had failed to maintain the high standards reached in 2007, with many of the implemented measures, particularly regarding the performance management of teachers, being ineffective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/2319935/urn/130682.pdf |title=Further Education and Skills Inspection report: Palmer's College |date=18 November 2013 |publisher=[[Ofsted]]}}</ref>\n\n2008 saw a record number of students applying to the College with over 2000 students enrolling. The College was equipped with modern teaching facilities set in landscaped grounds. Both students and the general public had access to a newly refurbished sports and fitness centre (including gym), Palmer's hosts a variety of events for children from local schools on its playing fields.\n\nThe Student Executive were the \"voice of the students\" within the college; they were responsible for organising various college events. The Student Executive of 2007\u20132008 raised \u00a34,000 for Little Havens Children's Hospice while the Student Executive of 2008/9 raised \u00a33,000 for Cancer Research UK as well as hosting various social events and fundraising days over the course of the year.\n\nThe school had a good record of students attaining places on the prestigious [[Prime Minister's Global Fellowship]] programme. The school achieved its first two students in the inaugural year of the programme, 2008. In 2009 it had another successful applicant.<ref>British Council website [http://www.global-fellowship.org/default.aspx?page=2 \"Fellows\"] accessed 10 November 2009.{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912082919/http://www.global-fellowship.org/default.aspx?page=2 |date=12 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Palmer's College celebrated its 300th anniversary and is able to trace its roots back over 300 years.\n\n===Location===\nThe college is situated on Chadwell Road (B149) next to the A1089 just north of the A126 junction (Marshfoot Interchange).<ref>https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/39601</ref> It is close to the boundary between [[Little Thurrock]] (to the west) and Chadwell St Mary.

It offers a wide range of courses including A-levels, BTECs and Secretarial. It is now one of two campuses of USP College.\n\n===History===\n\nPalmer's was first opened in 1706 when the merchant William Palmer founded a [[charity school]] for \"ten poore children\" of the parish of Grays Essex, endowing it with valuable property in the town and Lombard Street in the City of London. Initially located in a small building inside the churchyard the school evolved into a boys' school. However, in response to the changing educational landscape initiated by the 1870 Education Act, the trustees of Palmer's charity re-launched the school on a new site on the hill above the town in 1874. To this a girls' school was added in 1876.<ref>Herbert Brooks, ''William Palmer and his School. Being an account of the founder of Palmer's Charity at Grays Thurrock, Essex'' (Colchester, 1928).</ref> The schools were [[grammar schools]] for both boys' and girls', and [[William Strang, 1st Baron Strang]], perhaps Palmer's most distinguished alumnus, recalled it in 1905 as 'a modest establishment, modest that is in size and in material equipment, but not at all modest in the opinion which it held of itself'.<ref>Lord Strang, 'Fifty Years Ago', in J. R. Hayston (ed.), ''250 Years on. To commemorate the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the trust deed by which William Palmer endowed in 1706 a school in Grays Thurrock'' (1956), p. 59. See also Strang's autobiography, ''Home and abroad'' (1956)</ref> The boy school which admitted both day pupils and boarders until 1970, achieved the status of a [[state school|public school]] in 1931\u201346. In 1972, as part of the reorganisation of education in Essex, the boys' and girls' schools amalgamated, together with Aveley Technical High School, to constitute a sixth form college. During the mid-1970s, the boys' and Aveley schools relocated to the College's present site (until then occupied by the Girls' School alone). The College was supported by the William Palmer College Education Trust, the direct successor of the trustees William Palmer appointed to administer his charity. Artifacts from the schools' past can be seen in the College library.\n\nA 2007 inspection by [[Ofsted]] concluded: \"Palmer's is an outstanding college.\" Student achievement and the standard of work were good and success rates overall 'well above national averages for learners from all backgrounds'. The College was also praised for its retention rates and value-added scores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/40/130682|title=''2007 Palmers College Report'' - Ofsted May 2017|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 a subsequent report rated the college as \"Requires Improvement\" because few students studying academic courses were achieving high grades, there were no consistent standards of teaching, learning and assessment, and the college's leadership had failed to maintain the high standards reached in 2007, with many of the implemented measures, particularly regarding the performance management of teachers, being ineffective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/2319935/urn/130682.pdf |title=Further Education and Skills Inspection report: Palmer's College |date=18 November 2013 |publisher=[[Ofsted]]}}</ref>\n\n2008 saw a record number of students applying to the College with over 2000 students enrolling. The College was equipped with modern teaching facilities set in landscaped grounds. Both students and the general public had access to a newly refurbished sports and fitness centre (including gym), Palmer's hosts a variety of events for children from local schools on its playing fields.\n\nThe Student Executive were the \"voice of the students\" within the college; they were responsible for organising various college events. The Student Executive of 2007\u20132008 raised \u00a34,000 for Little Havens Children's Hospice while the Student Executive of 2008/9 raised \u00a33,000 for Cancer Research UK as well as hosting various social events and fundraising days over the course of the year.\n\nThe school had a good record of students attaining places on the prestigious [[Prime Minister's Global Fellowship]] programme. The school achieved its first two students in the inaugural year of the programme, 2008. In 2009 it had another successful applicant.<ref>British Council website [http://www.global-fellowship.org/default.aspx?page=2 \"Fellows\"] accessed 10 November 2009.{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912082919/http://www.global-fellowship.org/default.aspx?page=2 |date=12 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Palmer's College celebrated its 300th anniversary and is able to trace its roots back over 300 years.\n\n===Location===\nThe college is situated on Chadwell Road (B149) next to the A1089 just north of the A126 junction (Marshfoot Interchange).<ref>https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/39601</ref> It is close to the boundary between [[Little Thurrock]] (to the west) and Chadwell St Mary.
