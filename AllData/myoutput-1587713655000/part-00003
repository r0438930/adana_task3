Studies have shown that a specific class of mineral found in the dust, known as [[K-feldspar]], triggers ice formation particularly well. K-feldspar is particularly susceptible to corrosion by acidic atmospheric pollution such as nitrates and phosphates. Exposure to these constituents reduces the ability of the dust to trigger water droplet formation. Further, the traveling dust redistributes minerals from the Taklamakan to the western U.S.A. via rainfall.<ref name=\"The Dust Detectives\">{{cite magazine |last=Fox |first=Douglas |date=2014-12-22 |title=The Dust Detectives |url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/46.22/the-dust-detectives |magazine=High Country News |volume=46 |issue=22 |access-date=2017-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819133725/http://www.hcn.org/issues/46.22/the-dust-detectives |archive-date=2017-08-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe desert is the main setting for Chinese film series ''[[Painted Skin (2008 film)|Painted Skin]]'' and ''[[Painted Skin: The Resurrection]]''. The Chinese TV series ''[[Candle in the Tomb (TV series)|Candle in the Tomb]]'' is mostly spent in this desert as they are searching for the ancient city of Jinjue (see [[Niya (Tarim Basin)]].)\n\nThe issue #39 'Soft Places' of Neil Gaiman's ''[[The Sandman_(Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' takes place in the desert, when [[Marco Polo]] gets lost in the desert.\n\nA portion of the Korean quasi-historical TV drama series ''[[Queen_Seondeok_(TV_series)|Queen Seondeok]]'' takes place in the Taklamakan Desert. Sohwa escapes from Silla with baby Deokman and raises her in the desert. As a teenager, Deokman returns to Silla and uses the knowledge and experience gained from life among international traders in the Taklamakan trading centers to gain the throne of Silla.\n\nThe desert is showcased in the Japanese animation [[Mobile Suit Gundam 00|Gundam 00]], set in the year 2307. On the series, the Taklamakan Desert is the setting of a large-scale military joint operation performed by all the world's blocks of power, and interdicted by the paramilitary organization Celestial Being.\n\n''[[Code Geass]]'' depicts a fictionalized version of Taklamakan Desert within the Chinese Federation, one of three superstates in the series. It serves as the setting of a key battle between the Holy Britannian Empire and Japanese insurrectionists backed by the Chinese Federation. Later, the presence of an underground city is revealed, where members of the Geass Order are being used by Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his consort Marianne vi Britannia to bring about the [[Ragnarok|Ragnar\u00f6k Connection]].\n<br />\n\nIn the third book of the Temeraire series, [[Black Powder War]] by Naomi Novik, Captain Laurence and his crew must cross the desert to return home to England from China.\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Bezeklik Caves}}\n*{{annotated link|Cities along the Silk Road}}\n*{{annotated link|List of deserts by area}}\n*{{annotated link|Tarim Basin}}\n*{{annotated link|Tarim mummies}}\n*{{annotated link|Turpan water system}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Jarring, Gunnar (1997). \"The [[toponym]] Takla-makan\", ''Turkic Languages'', Vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;227\u2013240.\n* [[Hopkirk, Peter]] (1980).

Studies have shown that a specific class of mineral found in the dust, known as [[K-feldspar]], triggers ice formation particularly well. K-feldspar is particularly susceptible to corrosion by acidic atmospheric pollution such as nitrates and phosphates. Exposure to these constituents reduces the ability of the dust to trigger water droplet formation. Further, the traveling dust redistributes minerals from the Taklamakan to the western U.S.A. via rainfall.<ref name=\"The Dust Detectives\">{{cite magazine |last=Fox |first=Douglas |date=2014-12-22 |title=The Dust Detectives |url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/46.22/the-dust-detectives |magazine=High Country News |volume=46 |issue=22 |access-date=2017-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819133725/http://www.hcn.org/issues/46.22/the-dust-detectives |archive-date=2017-08-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe desert is the main setting for Chinese film series ''[[Painted Skin (2008 film)|Painted Skin]]'' and ''[[Painted Skin: The Resurrection]]''. The Chinese TV series ''[[Candle in the Tomb (TV series)|Candle in the Tomb]]'' is mostly spent in this desert as they are searching for the ancient city of Jinjue (see [[Niya (Tarim Basin)]].)\n\nThe issue #39 'Soft Places' of Neil Gaiman's ''[[The Sandman_(Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' takes place in the desert, when [[Marco Polo]] gets lost in the desert.\n\nA portion of the Korean quasi-historical TV drama series ''[[Queen_Seondeok_(TV_series)|Queen Seondeok]]'' takes place in the Taklamakan Desert. Sohwa escapes from Silla with baby Deokman and raises her in the desert. As a teenager, Deokman returns to Silla and uses the knowledge and experience gained from life among international traders in the Taklamakan trading centers to gain the throne of Silla.\n\nThe desert is showcased in the Japanese animation [[Mobile Suit Gundam 00|Gundam 00]], set in the year 2307. On the series, the Taklamakan Desert is the setting of a large-scale military joint operation performed by all the world's blocks of power, and interdicted by the paramilitary organization Celestial Being.\n\n''[[Code Geass]]'' depicts a fictionalized version of Taklamakan Desert within the Chinese Federation, one of three superstates in the series. It serves as the setting of a key battle between the Holy Britannian Empire and Japanese insurrectionists backed by the Chinese Federation. Later, the presence of an underground city is revealed, where members of the Geass Order are being used by Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his consort Marianne vi Britannia to bring about the [[Ragnarok|Ragnar\u00f6k Connection]].\n<br />\n\nIn the third book of the Temeraire series, [[Black Powder War]] by Naomi Novik, Captain Laurence and his crew must cross the desert to return home to England from China.\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Bezeklik Caves}}\n*{{annotated link|Cities along the Silk Road}}\n*{{annotated link|List of deserts by area}}\n*{{annotated link|Tarim Basin}}\n*{{annotated link|Tarim mummies}}\n*{{annotated link|Turpan water system}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Jarring, Gunnar (1997). \"The [[toponym]] Takla-makan\", ''Turkic Languages'', Vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;227\u2013240.\n* [[Hopkirk, Peter]] (1980).
