'''Beeston''' is a town in [[Nottinghamshire]], England, {{convert|5.5|km|mi|order=flip}} south-west of [[Nottingham]] city centre. To the immediate north-east is the [[University of Nottingham]]'s main campus, [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park]]. The [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] and retail chemist group [[Boots UK|Boots]] has its headquarters {{convert|1|km|mi|1|order=flip}} east of the centre of Beeston, on the border with [[Borough of Broxtowe|Broxtowe]] and the City of Nottingham. To the south lies the [[River Trent]] and the village of [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]], with extensive wetlands.<ref>[http://www.attenboroughnaturecentre.co.uk/docs/anr-map.pdf Attenborough Nature Centre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704165209/http://www.attenboroughnaturecentre.co.uk/docs/anr-map.pdf |date=4 July 2010}} Map of Attenborough wetlands</ref>

==Geography==
Suburban development in the mid-20th century has extended the built-up area of Beeston to the former villages of [[Chilwell]] to the west, and [[Wollaton]] and [[Lenton Abbey]] to the north. It is separated from [[Bramcote]] to the north-west by the Beeston Fields Golf Course. The Broxtowe-City of Nottingham border essentially forms the town's eastern edge. The main area and shopping district lies to the north of the [[Midland Main Line|railway line]], and the mixed residential and industrial area of Beeston Rylands to the south.

===Beeston Rylands===
[[File:Beeston Canal - geograph.org.uk - 53033.jpg|thumb|right|The Beeston Canal passing through Rylands]]
Rylands was originally a small settlement around Beeston Lock, comprising some tens of houses and two pubs, although the name now refers to all of the area south of the railway line. The ''Jolly Angler'' was originally on the river side of the canal, but has since moved.<ref>[http://www.beeston-notts.co.uk/landmark_pubs3.shtml Beeston history website] ''Jolly Angler''</ref> Beeston began to spread south of the railway line in the late 19th century, when a few Victorian villas were built near the level crossing by the station.

Over the first few decades of the 20th century, several estates were built to house workers at [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|Ericssons]] and Boots, both of which had large factories south of the railway line. These estates joined Beeston and Rylands. Further development after the Second World War filled gaps, initially with an estate of council houses and flats, and latterly with private houses and bungalows. The last significant development, in 1970, was Meadow Farm, now the four roads of timber-framed semi-detached houses between Beech Avenue and the canal.  Since then Beeston Rylands has had a small amount of infill development.

Beeston Rylands was historically at risk of flooding from the [[River Trent]] to the south. This reduced property values and the size of houses built there, predominantly for the rental market. The last serious flood, in 1947, reached beyond the railway line: most of Queens Road was flooded, as was Nether Street. Strengthened flood defences have reduced the risk of flooding to a probability of once every fifty years. A series of flood-defence improvements, costing £51 million and designed to decrease the expected flood incidence to once in a hundred years, began in 2009 along a {{convert|27|km|mi|order=flip}} stretch of the Trent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8602573.stm BBC News] Attenborough flood defence plans submitted</ref>

===University of Nottingham===
The eastern edge of Beeston abuts the [[University of Nottingham]]'s University Park campus, through which runs Beeston Lane.

Although most of the University is within the City of Nottingham, around half the self-catering flats in the [[Broadgate Park]] hall of residence fall within Beeston. Nearer still is Albion House, which is associated with the main Broadgate Park site.

Beeston has a large population of postgraduate students, who supposedly prefer the quieter atmosphere compared to [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]] and [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]], where many undergraduates live.

===Wards===
{{see also|Borough of Broxtowe#Wards}}
Beeston divides into four [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] for local electoral purposes within the borough of Broxtowe: Beeston North, Beeston Central, Beeston Rylands and Beeston West.<ref name=\"Wards\">[http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe Boundary Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509213923/http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe |date=9 May 2011}} – Broxtowe</ref>

Beeston's town centre is largely within the West and Central wards. The North ward includes some residential estates north of the A52 (Derby Road), including a small part of the Wollaton urban area that falls within Broxtowe. To the west lie [[Bramcote Hills]] and the Bramcote ward. The original Beeston/Bramcote boundary is still marked on the A52.

The Beeston Rylands ward has a larger area than the other three wards as it includes unpopulated [[floodplain]]s of the River Trent and industrial areas, including the part of the Boots campus. The Rylands ward also extends north of the railway line to Queens Road and includes the former site of Nottingham Rugby Club.

To the west of Beeston Rylands lies the [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]] ward; while the Chilwell East ward lies to the west of Beeston West.  
[[File:Beeston wards map.png|thumb|right|The historic area of the town (the 1933 civil parish area) in blue, and the present-day ward boundaries within the borough of Broxtowe]]
A review of ward boundaries in 2000 brought changes to Beeston's western boundary. In the north-west, Beeston Cemetery and the residential streets surrounding it (to the south of Derby Road) such as Coniston Road and Windermere Road, as well as the ''Nuseryman'' pub and the eastern part of Beeston Fields Golf Course, were transferred to Bramcote ward. Beeston gained some territory from Chilwell in residential streets such as Park Road, Grove Avenue and Cumberland Avenue, and in Nottingham College and the industrial patch between Holly Lane and Wilmot Lane.<ref name=\"Wards\"/> The original boundary between the old Beeston and Chilwell parishes can still be identified by a road-name change on the site of the ''Hop Pole'' pub, from [[Chilwell Road, Beeston|Chilwell Road]] on the Beeston side to High Road on the Chilwell side.

====Elections====
{{see also|Broxtowe local elections}}
Beeston's four wards each return two councillors to Broxtowe Borough Council. For Nottinghamshire County Council the town is covered by two [[electoral division]]s, each with a county councillor: Beeston North (North and West wards) and Beeston South & Attenborough (Central, Rylands and Attenborough wards).<ref>[http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/home/your_council/councilelections/electionresultsbydivision09.htm?division=19#84 Nottinghamshire County Council]</ref>

For elections to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] the town is part of the [[Broxtowe (UK Parliament constituency)|Broxtowe constituency]]. From 1974 to 1983 a [[Beeston (UK Parliament constituency)|Beeston constituency]] existed. The present Member of Parliament is [[Darren Henry]], of the [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative party]].

===History of local government===
Beeston is an [[unparished area]] and has no town council, but it was a [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] until 1935.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120917204026/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10256665 Vision of Britain] Beeston (ancient/civil parish)</ref> The parish area was reduced in 1933, with some lands in the east transferred to the City of Nottingham; boundary posts were erected on the new Beeston-Nottingham boundary and many are still in place today, with \"1933\" marked on them. The present four wards cover the same post-1933 area of the old parish, with the two recent alterations made to the western boundary, as described in the \"Wards\" section above.

From 1935 until 1974 (when the borough of Broxtowe was formed) Beeston was paired with the town of [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] (2&nbsp;km to the west) in the [[Beeston and Stapleford]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]. Previously a [[Beeston Urban District]] existed, covering Beeston parish. The town was the administrative centre of Beeston and Stapleford Urban District Council and is the administrative centre for Broxtowe Borough Council, which has its head offices in Foster Avenue at Beeston Town Hall and the other council buildings there.

==Origins of the name==
The earliest name of the settlement was ''Bestune'', recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=The Place-Names of Nottinghamshire |last=Gover |first=J. E.

[[File:Sculpture on the High Road.jpg|thumb|The Beekeeper on Beeston High Road]]

The putative \"bee\" derivation encouraged the notion of Beeston as a \"hive of industry\". The bee was adopted as the [[emblem]] of the town council. Beehives appear carved in the brick of the town-hall exterior, and in 1959 three bees were included in the [[coat of arms]] adopted by [[Beeston and Stapleford]] Urban District Council.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/notts_ob.html |title=CIVIC HERALDRY OF ENGLAND AND WALES-NOTTINGHAMSHIRE (OBSOLETE) |publisher=}}</ref> The [[College of Arms]] included long grasses entwined with meadow crocuses in the arms as an alternative [[canting arms]] on the likelier origin as \"farmstead where bent-grass grows.\" With the formation of Broxtowe District (later Borough) Council in 1974, the bees were retained on its coat of arms.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=234 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609153435/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=234 |date=9 June 2011}} Coat of Arms</ref> The bee tradition continues – litter bins and other street furniture in the High Road are decorated in black and gold with a bee symbol on each. There is a sculpture in the High Road of a man sitting next to a beehive, popularly known as the \"Bee-man\", \"the man of Beeston\", etc., though officially called \"The Beeston Seat\". The sculptor was Sioban Coppinger in 1987, modelling a friend, Stephen Hodges, for his \"timeless ability to exude calm when all else are succumbing to stress.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.siobancoppinger.co.uk/work/64d87/ |title=BEESTON SEAT – Sioban Coppinger |first=Designed by Brown & |last=Brown |publisher=}}</ref>

==History==
===Domesday===
In Bestune at the Conquest, the Saxons Alfag, Alwine and UIchel had three manors consisting of three [[carucate]]s of land assessed. These were taken from them and given to William Peverel, lord of Nottingham Castle, who had in his [[demesne]] two plough teams, 17 bond tenants called [[villeins]], unable to leave the estate without the lord's consent, each farming some {{convert|15|acre|ha}} of arable, and one ordinary tenant or sochman. Together they had nine plough teams. There were {{convert|24|acre|ha}} of meadow. The annual yield of the estate was 30 shillings.

===19th century===
[[File:Walskipper-Beeston Boiler-001.jpg|thumb|A Beeston Boiler still in use in South Africa, 2008]]
Beeston outgrew its village status as a silk weaving centre in the early 19th century. The first silk mill was burnt down (along with [[Nottingham Castle]]) in the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]] riots of 1831. With the decline of the silk industry, many former mills gained light industrial uses in the early 20th century. Equipment made by the [[Beeston Boiler Company]] is still found all over the former [[British Empire]].

Between 1880 and the turn of the century, [[Thomas Humber]] and partners made bicycles and eventually motor-cycles and cars at a factory at the junction of what are now Queens Road and Humber Road. At its height it employed 2000, although this ended abruptly in 1907 when the firm moved to Coventry.

===20th century===
[[File:Population of Beeston, Nottinghamshire.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Population of Beeston, now just over 21,000 inhabitants]]<!-- Calculated from four Beeston wards. This is NOT the population of the Beeston-Stapleford urban district-->
In 1901 the [[National Telephone Company]] built a factory in Beeston for telephone materials. This was taken over by the British [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|L.M. Ericsson Manufacturing Co. Ltd.]] in 1903. Shortly before the transfer, most of the old factory was destroyed by fire, and in the rebuilding it was extended. A new power station was built. In 1906 and 1907 a large building was erected, chiefly devoted to cabinet work. The old factory building covered an area of {{convert|63000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, the cabinet factory {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, and the power station {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, making a total of {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Although most of the factory buildings were low rise, a [[paternoster lift]] survived in E-block at the site until it was demolished in 2016.

Under the [[Plessey]] name these large premises continued as a major source of employment through the 1980s. Plessey became [[GEC-Plessey Telecommunications|GPT]] with [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]]'s involvement. With the various restructurings of the [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] group and its rebranding as [[Marconi Electronic Systems|Marconi]], much of the site was sold to [[Siemens]] along with the private telephone-network side of the business. Siemens sublet much of the site as a \"technology park\" when it moved most manufacturing overseas.

SMS Electronics was formed from a [[management buyout]] of the manufacturing facility of Siemens in 2003. It won the [[Queens Award for Export]] in 2012 and employs over 200. The whole site was acquired by [[HSBC]] in 2006 for a mixed-use \"employment-led\" redevelopment. In 2007 a building was constructed for [[Atos|Atos Origin]] which at the time was the largest pre-let buildings in the Midlands.

The Boots campus includes three [[listed building|listed]] modernist buildings designed by engineer [[Owen Williams (engineer)|Owen Williams]] (two Grade I, one Grade II), though they are difficult to see from outside. It also has a later, Grade II* listed building by [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]].<ref name=\"listed\">[http://beestoncivicsociety.org.uk/gallery-1.html Beeston and District Civic Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812075138/http://beestoncivicsociety.org.uk/gallery-1.html |date=12 August 2011}} Listed buildings.</ref>

Motor manufacture returned to Beeston for a short period in 1987, when the Middlebridge Company set up a small factory in Lilac Grove and produced 77 [[Reliant Scimitar|Scimitar]] cars. The firm went into liquidation in 1990.
[[File:BeestonMaltings.jpg|thumb|Beeston Maltings]]
Beeston Maltings was in operation until the late 20th century. The buildings were in Dovecote Lan, opposite the [[Victoria Hotel, Beeston|Victoria Hotel]], but were demolished in 2012–2013.

===21st century===
Proposals for a light rail (tram) line through Beeston as an extension to the [[Nottingham Express Transit]] system were approved by the government in 2009,<ref>[http://www.netphasetwo.com/ Nottingham City Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206173051/http://netphasetwo.com/ |date=6 February 2009}} NET Phase 2 website</ref> due to traffic jams. There was some opposition to this by local traders and others along the proposed route, fearing business losses during the construction period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/Anger-tram-markings/article-702551-detail/article.html |title=Anger over tram markings |date=17 February 2009 |publisher= |access-date=10 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221075553/http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/Anger-tram-markings/article-702551-detail/article.html|archive-date=21 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, a survey in 2004 by Nottingham Express Transit showed strong general support for the scheme.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/3571298.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Living with your house on the line |quote=The people behind Nottingham's tram system, known as NET, do not share this view. The development manager for phase two of NET, Chris Deas, says the planned routes were carefully selected with help from the public. He says: \"We involve the public at every stage and as such have conducted an unprecedented amount of public consultation.\" Many factors were used to choose the tram routes, including integration with other transport, environmental impact, operational capability and cost benefit. |last=Haran |first=Brady |accessdate=7 August 2008 |date=17 August 2004}}</ref> The line opened on 25 August 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History made as new tram routes open |publisher=[[Nottingham Express Transit]] |date=25 August 2015 |url=http://www.thetram.net/history-made-as-new-tram-routes-open.aspx#Historymadeasnewtramroutesopen |accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>

==Economy==
Beeston is home to many national and international companies. Of the 470 companies based in Beeston, the largest are [[Boots UK|Boots]], [[Changan]], [[Imperial Tobacco]], ZF, [[Siemens]], [[Atos]] and [[Chinook Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.changanuk.com/ |title=Changan UK R&D Centre |publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinooksciences.com/ |title=Home |publisher=}}</ref> Other wide-reaching local companies include [[Lathe (metal)|metalworking lathe]] manufacturer [[Myford]] and the internet firm Webfusion (later Hosteurope and then part of [[PIPEX Communications]]).

==Demography==
Beeston has a population of 37,000 people, of whom 71.2 per cent are classed as [[White British]] and 28.8 per cent as different ethnicities, with 10.3 per cent Chinese, 10.25 per cent European, 2.7 per cent Indian, and 2.11 per cent [[Pakistani]], and others 3.4 per cent.

The average household size is 2.40 and the population density 49.40 per hectare. The age ranges are 20.9% 30–44, 16.3% 16–24 and 18.06% the 45–59 age range.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/broxtowe-e07000172#sthash.u8P7k5uy.6dJ056SG.dpbs |title=Broxtowe – UK Census Data 2011 |first=Good Stuff IT |last=Services |publisher=}}</ref>

==Transport==
===Trains===
{{main|Beeston railway station}}
[[File:Beeston Station 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beeston railway station|Beeston station]] in 2004]] 
The [[Midland Counties Railway]] from [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] to [[Derby railway station|Derby]] through Beeston opened on 30 May 1839. It later became part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] company and then the [[London Midland Region (British Railways)|London Midland Region]] of British Railways.

[[Beeston railway station|Beeston station]]today has frequent rail links served by [[East Midlands Railway]] and [[CrossCountry]]. Direct trains to and from [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]] call hourly, with typical journey times for {{convert|123|mi|km}} of just under two hours. Other regular direct services serve [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]], [[Derby railway station|Derby]], [[Lincoln railway station|Lincoln]], [[Bedford railway station|Bedford]], [[Burton-on-Trent railway station|Burton-on-Trent]], [[Leicester railway station|Leicester]], [[Loughborough railway station|Loughborough]], [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]], [[Newark Castle railway station|Newark Castle]], [[Luton railway station|Luton]], [[East Midlands Parkway railway station|East Midlands Parkway]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] and [[Matlock railway station|Matlock]]. There are daily weekday trains to [[Gloucester railway station|Gloucester]], [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]] and [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]].

===Trams and buses===
[[File:Trent Barton in Beeston in 2008.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Trentbarton]] bus travelling along High Road, heading into Nottingham]]
Beeston is served by the [[Nottingham Express Transit]] tram system for Nottingham city centre and other local destinations. Frequent bus services operate to Nottingham, East Midlands Airport, [[Derby]], [[Loughborough]] and other local towns, operated mainly by [[Trentbarton]] and [[Nottingham City Transport]].

===Roads===
The Nottingham and [[Derby]] Road was [[turnpike trust|turnpiked]] in 1758–1759. Tolls were removed in 1870. A branch of the Nottingham and [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch|Ashby]] Turnpike Road, usually called the Sawley branch, went through Beeston. In 1831 a four-horse daily coach to [[Birmingham]] was advertised.

The present Nottingham–Derby road ([[A52 road|A52]]) touches the north of the town. Junction 25 of the [[M1 motorway]] is {{convert|6.4|km|mi}}. The town centre has municipal car parks owned by Broxtowe Borough Council, as well as supermarket car parks.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=962 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029175043/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=962 |date=29 October 2010}} – Car parks in Beeston</ref>

===Canals===
[[File:Entrance to Beeston Lock - geograph.org.uk - 52633.jpg|thumb|left|Boats at Beeston Marina, situated on the River Trent, near where Beeston Lock allows for travel on the Beeston Canal (avoiding Beeston Weir)]]
The [[Nottingham Canal]] from [[Trent Bridge (bridge)|Trent Bridge]] to [[Langley Mill]], via Nottingham and [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]] was authorised in 1790 and completed by 1802. It allowed goods traffic from the Erewash valley to bypass the [[River Erewash]] and [[River Trent]]. In response, a Beeston Canal was promoted by the [[Trent Navigation Company]] in 1794. This stretched from Beeston Cut to Lenton, over a weir at Beeston Rylands. Originally there was a second lock at Beeston Cut for small vessels to enter the Trent below the weir, but this was abandoned about 1940.

===Cycles===
The [[National Cycle Route 6]] (London – Keswick) passes through Long Lane Attenborough, then along the pavement of Queens Road and Lilac Grove, past Nottingham University and the [[Queen's Medical Centre]], where it turns left towards Wollaton and Bulwell. A circular \"Big Track\" for cyclists and pedestrians follows towpaths along the Trent and Beeston Canal. The Erewash Valley trail passes along the western side of Beeston. Several other cycle routes are signposted.

==Built environment==
[[File:BeestonStJohntheBaptist.JPG|thumb|The Parish Church of [[St John the Baptist Church, Beeston]]]]
[[File:DovecoteLane.jpg|thumb|Victorian villas on Dovecote Lane]]
Beeston has a number of historic buildings, including a manor house and the parish church of [[St. John the Baptist Church, Beeston|St John the Baptist]]. The church dates from the 11th century, but was largely rebuilt in 1843 by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]]. Both are included in the West End [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|conservation area]], which covers several buildings, many historical or of character, along Dovecote Lane, Grange Avenue, West End, and Church Street. Included in the area is the historic Village Cross.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4232 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609154002/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4232 |date=9 June 2011 }} – Beeston West End conservation area</ref>

An [[Inclosure acts|enclosure act]] was passed for the parish of Beeston, and in 1809 the Commissioners stated that the lands amounted to {{convert|822|acre|km2}}, to be made tithe free, and the ancient enclosed lands and homesteads liable to tithe was £687 2s 29d. They then proceeded to fix the width of the roads. The Nottingham and Derby turnpike road was fixed at {{convert|50|foot|m}}. Wollaton Road, then called Cowgate, was {{convert|30|foot|m}}. The enclosures altered the appearance of part of the parish from a moor growing poor grass to cultivated fields with hedges, and so increased the food supply. It relieved farmers of their duty to pay a tenth of their product in kind.

Some lands on or near [[Bramcote Moor]], but in Beeston parish, were enclosed in 1847, by provisional order of the Inclosure Commissioners.

Before the general introduction of gas in the parish, there was a limited supply from the Mill to separate houses. The church was first lit with gas in 1857. A Public Lighting Act was adopted at a vestry meeting on 13 November 1862. Opposition to the street lamps was strong, and the effigy of an active promoter of it was carried on an ass round the village and hung on a lamp-post, and but for police interference would have been burned. In 1861 gas was supplied from Nottingham by the [[Nottingham Corporation Gas Department#Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company|Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company]] and for street lamps in 1872. Beeston was connected to the mains water supply in 1876.

[[File:AngloScotianMills.JPG|thumb|left|[[Anglo Scotian Mills]] on Wollaton Road by [[James Huckerby]] 1892]]

The [[crenellation|crenellated]] [[listed building]] of the [[Anglo Scotian Mills]]<ref name=\"listed\"/> remains on Wollaton Road to the north of the town centre. It is a solitary reminder of the former dominance of silk and lace mills on the skyline. The buildings have been converted into apartments by a developer. A cottage on the north side of Anglo Scotian Mills was reputed to have the tallest domestic chimney in England.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Its length was necessary to reach over the roof of the Mill. Although the cottage has been demolished for several years, the chimney can still be seen attached to the Mill wall.

A rare survival is the G H Hurt & Son Shawl Factory, which is occasionally open to the public. Shawls are produced on knitting machines and hand finished in much the same way as they have been for centuries. The factory contains examples of knitting frames from the 17th century.

Lost industrial buildings include the rebuilt silk mill and the looming bulk of the Neville Works mill on the boundary with Chilwell (later occupied by the Myford lathe factory).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===The Land Societies===
====St John's Grove Estate====
After the enclosure of the land surrounding Beeston in 1809, the area of [[St John's Grove, Beeston|St John's Grove]] was allotted to the vicar of the parish church. In 1878 the land was acquired from the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] by the Beeston Land Society, a group of citizens, who divided it into 28 plots of between three-quarters and {{convert|1|acre|ha|adj=on}} and laid out wide, straight streets. Most of the houses date from Edwardian and late Victorian times. The Land Society set conditions for developers. There were to be no public houses, and strict building lines would ensure that properties were set back a consistent distance from the road. The St John's Grove Estate is now a conservation area.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 St John's Conservation Area description – Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918002310/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 |date=18 September 2009 }}</ref>

====Imperial Park Estate====
Shortly after 1878, the Imperial Park Land Society and its sister the Beeston Building Society were founded. They aimed to assist the development and financing of superior housing around what is now Imperial Road, north of Newton Street, adjacent to the St John's Grove development and bounded on the north by North Street. The early model was to have savings made by a group of subscribers and funds allocated by the drawing of lots, in turn for each of them to build a house.

====Bellevue Park Estate====
This initial success was repeated when, in 1881, a syndicate acquired land from George Fellows, of the banking family that had its home at Belle Vue, now Beeston Fields Golf Club. The Belle Vue Land Society was formed to develop this land using similar methods to Imperial Park. The development lay to the north as a continuation to Imperial Park. Denison Street formed its northern extreme and Montague Street defined its eastern limit.

====Cottage Grove====
Cottage Grove, historically was just outside Beeston parish and part of [[Chilwell]], was promoted by the [[Labourer's Friend Society]] in the 1840s as plots for cottages with allotments for the labouring poor. The scheme failed and the area now consists mostly of Victorian and Edwardian houses laid out along the parallel Park Road and Grove Avenue and the two short cross streets Cedar Road and North Drive. The area retains a leafy character and the roads remain unkerbed. It has been a conservation area since 2008.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236  Cottage Grove Conservation Area description – Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918015056/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236 |date=18 September 2009}}</ref>

====The Estates today====
Some areas originally developed by the Land Societies have been spoiled where original plots have been subdivided and more modern properties built in styles not in keeping with the original buildings. Many properties in the Imperial Park and Bellvue Estates have lost their original elegance with the lowering of chimney stacks, inappropriate replacement of windows and doors with modern PVC, the loss of hedged fronts to brick walls or fencing, and paving over front gardens for parking.

===Other development===
[[File:ChilwellRoadMethodistChurch.JPG|thumb|Methodist Church on Chilwell Road]]
[[File:BeestonBaptistChurch.jpg|thumb|left|Baptist Church on Dovecote Lane, formerly known as John Clifford Baptist Church]]
A [[Chilwell Road Methodist Church|particularly fine Methodist Church]] was built by the architect W. J. Morley of Bradford on Chilwell Road in 1902. Its landmark spire became visible from afar after the demolition of several large mill buildings in the 1990s. The front of the building was floodlit at night.

The Baptist Church in Dovecote Lane built in 1898 by [[Charles Nelson Holloway]], but demolished in 2015 and replaced by semi-detached housing.

===Almshouses===
The United Charities of [[Abel Collin]] moved from the centre of Nottingham to their current location in Derby Road, Beeston, in the 1950s.

Beeston's main shopping area is along the [[High Road, Beeston|High Road]], much of which has been pedestrianised. There are some chain stores in Beeston, and independent stores including specialist [[east Asian]] and [[Mediterranean]] food shops.

There are takeaways and several restaurants, offering a selection of food including Chinese, Thai, and Indian cuisine. Cafés are to be found around the main shopping centre, \"The Square\" — the centre of Beeston — is a 1960s shopping development, most of which is pedestrianised.[[File:Beeston High Road in 2006.jpg|thumb|High Road during improvements in September 2006]] A£1.4-million environmental improvement scheme covered pavements and lighting for the non-pedestrianised eastern end of the High Road. Further east Broadgate saw improvements, with a new space at the top entrance to Broadgate Recreation Ground. The works were completed in late 2006.

The shopping centre is traversed by Wollaton Road. An area south-east of the shopping centre has made room for a [[Tesco]] superstore, which opened 1 November 2010, rivalling the [[Sainsbury's]] store in the town centre and the recent [[Lidl]] store in Wollaton Road to the north of the town centre. Beeston Fire Station on an adjacent plot was closed and relocated to a new site on Hassocks Lane.

Beeston town centre was redeveloped when the [[Nottingham Express Transit]] extension was built, including the construction of a large gym and a [[Costa Coffee]] shop.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Countdown-new-gym-opening-Beeston/story-25778631-detail/story.html |title=Countdown to new gym opening in Beeston |date=29 December 2014 |publisher =|access-date=7 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428225255/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Countdown-new-gym-opening-Beeston/story-25778631-detail/story.html |archive-date=28 April 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This redevelopment was undertaken by Henry Boot.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Gym-set-help-energise-work-new-look-square/story-20510560-detail/story.html |title=Beeston: Gym set to help energise work on new-look square |date=28 January 2014 |publisher= |access-date=7 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402182924/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Gym-set-help-energise-work-new-look-square/story-20510560-detail/story.html |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Royal Mail===
Beeston has three post offices. Until 2017, the main post office was in Chilwell Road (on a site that also originally housed the delivery office), but moved to share premises with the town's branch of WHSmith. There is another post office in the High Road towards Broadgate, and a third in Central Avenue in the north of the town. A fourth post office in the Rylands part of town closed in January 2008.<ref>[http://www.beestonexpress.co.uk/images/beestonexpress/Dec14pdfs/Dec14p1.pdf Beeston Express]{{dead link |date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Issue 116, December 2007.</ref>

The [[Royal Mail]]'s main [[sorting office]] for the Nottingham area (the [[NG postcode area]]) stands on the eastern edge of Beeston at Padge Road, with the City of Nottingham boundary running round the building. It was built in 1995<ref name=\"Wetherspoons\"/> and includes a new delivery office for local distribution of Beeston's mail.

==Sport==
Beeston is home to England Hockey Premier League team [[Beeston Hockey Club]] who play at Highfields Sports Club on University Boulevard.

Until 2006, Beeston was home to [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham Rugby Club]], which sold the land next to the railway line (now the Birkin Fields housing development) and moved to share the [[Meadow Lane]] pitch at the Notts County ground. Nottingham Casuals Rugby Club still plays on the rugby pitches at Weirfields near the canal.

The two [[golf course]]s adjacent to the town are Beeston Fields and Chilwell Manor. A short distance to the north is [[Bramcote Hills|Bramcote Hill]] Golf Club and to the north-east the golf course at [[Wollaton Park]].

Beeston is home to several well-established football clubs, including Beeston Amateur Football Club (Beeston AFC), which has two men's Saturday sides that play in the Nottinghamshire Senior League and the Midland Amateur Alliance respectively, and Beeston Town FC, which plays its home games at Highfields and competes in Division One of the Long Eaton Sunday League.

Beeston Athletics, formally Ericsson AC & Plessey AC, is now based at Chilwell Olympia and meets on Wednesday and Friday evenings and on Sunday morning. It also organises a five-mile race in May or June

'''Beeston''' is a town in [[Nottinghamshire]], England, {{convert|5.5|km|mi|order=flip}} south-west of [[Nottingham]] city centre. To the immediate north-east is the [[University of Nottingham]]'s main campus, [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park]]. The [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] and retail chemist group [[Boots UK|Boots]] has its headquarters {{convert|1|km|mi|1|order=flip}} east of the centre of Beeston, on the border with [[Borough of Broxtowe|Broxtowe]] and the City of Nottingham. To the south lies the [[River Trent]] and the village of [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]], with extensive wetlands.<ref>[http://www.attenboroughnaturecentre.co.uk/docs/anr-map.pdf Attenborough Nature Centre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704165209/http://www.attenboroughnaturecentre.co.uk/docs/anr-map.pdf |date=4 July 2010}} Map of Attenborough wetlands</ref>

==Geography==
Suburban development in the mid-20th century has extended the built-up area of Beeston to the former villages of [[Chilwell]] to the west, and [[Wollaton]] and [[Lenton Abbey]] to the north. It is separated from [[Bramcote]] to the north-west by the Beeston Fields Golf Course. The Broxtowe-City of Nottingham border essentially forms the town's eastern edge. The main area and shopping district lies to the north of the [[Midland Main Line|railway line]], and the mixed residential and industrial area of Beeston Rylands to the south.

===Beeston Rylands===
[[File:Beeston Canal - geograph.org.uk - 53033.jpg|thumb|right|The Beeston Canal passing through Rylands]]
Rylands was originally a small settlement around Beeston Lock, comprising some tens of houses and two pubs, although the name now refers to all of the area south of the railway line. The ''Jolly Angler'' was originally on the river side of the canal, but has since moved.<ref>[http://www.beeston-notts.co.uk/landmark_pubs3.shtml Beeston history website] ''Jolly Angler''</ref> Beeston began to spread south of the railway line in the late 19th century, when a few Victorian villas were built near the level crossing by the station.

Over the first few decades of the 20th century, several estates were built to house workers at [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|Ericssons]] and Boots, both of which had large factories south of the railway line. These estates joined Beeston and Rylands. Further development after the Second World War filled gaps, initially with an estate of council houses and flats, and latterly with private houses and bungalows. The last significant development, in 1970, was Meadow Farm, now the four roads of timber-framed semi-detached houses between Beech Avenue and the canal.  Since then Beeston Rylands has had a small amount of infill development.

Beeston Rylands was historically at risk of flooding from the [[River Trent]] to the south. This reduced property values and the size of houses built there, predominantly for the rental market. The last serious flood, in 1947, reached beyond the railway line: most of Queens Road was flooded, as was Nether Street. Strengthened flood defences have reduced the risk of flooding to a probability of once every fifty years. A series of flood-defence improvements, costing £51 million and designed to decrease the expected flood incidence to once in a hundred years, began in 2009 along a {{convert|27|km|mi|order=flip}} stretch of the Trent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8602573.stm BBC News] Attenborough flood defence plans submitted</ref>

===University of Nottingham===
The eastern edge of Beeston abuts the [[University of Nottingham]]'s University Park campus, through which runs Beeston Lane.

Although most of the University is within the City of Nottingham, around half the self-catering flats in the [[Broadgate Park]] hall of residence fall within Beeston. Nearer still is Albion House, which is associated with the main Broadgate Park site.

Beeston has a large population of postgraduate students, who supposedly prefer the quieter atmosphere compared to [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]] and [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]], where many undergraduates live.

===Wards===
{{see also|Borough of Broxtowe#Wards}}
Beeston divides into four [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] for local electoral purposes within the borough of Broxtowe: Beeston North, Beeston Central, Beeston Rylands and Beeston West.<ref name=\"Wards\">[http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe Boundary Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509213923/http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe |date=9 May 2011}} – Broxtowe</ref>

Beeston's town centre is largely within the West and Central wards. The North ward includes some residential estates north of the A52 (Derby Road), including a small part of the Wollaton urban area that falls within Broxtowe. To the west lie [[Bramcote Hills]] and the Bramcote ward. The original Beeston/Bramcote boundary is still marked on the A52.

The Beeston Rylands ward has a larger area than the other three wards as it includes unpopulated [[floodplain]]s of the River Trent and industrial areas, including the part of the Boots campus. The Rylands ward also extends north of the railway line to Queens Road and includes the former site of Nottingham Rugby Club.

To the west of Beeston Rylands lies the [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]] ward; while the Chilwell East ward lies to the west of Beeston West.  
[[File:Beeston wards map.png|thumb|right|The historic area of the town (the 1933 civil parish area) in blue, and the present-day ward boundaries within the borough of Broxtowe]]
A review of ward boundaries in 2000 brought changes to Beeston's western boundary. In the north-west, Beeston Cemetery and the residential streets surrounding it (to the south of Derby Road) such as Coniston Road and Windermere Road, as well as the ''Nuseryman'' pub and the eastern part of Beeston Fields Golf Course, were transferred to Bramcote ward. Beeston gained some territory from Chilwell in residential streets such as Park Road, Grove Avenue and Cumberland Avenue, and in Nottingham College and the industrial patch between Holly Lane and Wilmot Lane.<ref name=\"Wards\"/> The original boundary between the old Beeston and Chilwell parishes can still be identified by a road-name change on the site of the ''Hop Pole'' pub, from [[Chilwell Road, Beeston|Chilwell Road]] on the Beeston side to High Road on the Chilwell side.

====Elections====
{{see also|Broxtowe local elections}}
Beeston's four wards each return two councillors to Broxtowe Borough Council. For Nottinghamshire County Council the town is covered by two [[electoral division]]s, each with a county councillor: Beeston North (North and West wards) and Beeston South & Attenborough (Central, Rylands and Attenborough wards).<ref>[http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/home/your_council/councilelections/electionresultsbydivision09.htm?division=19#84 Nottinghamshire County Council]</ref>

For elections to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] the town is part of the [[Broxtowe (UK Parliament constituency)|Broxtowe constituency]]. From 1974 to 1983 a [[Beeston (UK Parliament constituency)|Beeston constituency]] existed. The present Member of Parliament is [[Darren Henry]], of the [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative party]].

===History of local government===
Beeston is an [[unparished area]] and has no town council, but it was a [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] until 1935.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120917204026/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10256665 Vision of Britain] Beeston (ancient/civil parish)</ref> The parish area was reduced in 1933, with some lands in the east transferred to the City of Nottingham; boundary posts were erected on the new Beeston-Nottingham boundary and many are still in place today, with \"1933\" marked on them. The present four wards cover the same post-1933 area of the old parish, with the two recent alterations made to the western boundary, as described in the \"Wards\" section above.

From 1935 until 1974 (when the borough of Broxtowe was formed) Beeston was paired with the town of [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] (2&nbsp;km to the west) in the [[Beeston and Stapleford]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]. Previously a [[Beeston Urban District]] existed, covering Beeston parish. The town was the administrative centre of Beeston and Stapleford Urban District Council and is the administrative centre for Broxtowe Borough Council, which has its head offices in Foster Avenue at Beeston Town Hall and the other council buildings there.

The putative \"bee\" derivation encouraged the notion of Beeston as a \"hive of industry\". The bee was adopted as the [[emblem]] of the town council. Beehives appear carved in the brick of the town-hall exterior, and in 1959 three bees were included in the [[coat of arms]] adopted by [[Beeston and Stapleford]] Urban District Council.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/notts_ob.html |title=CIVIC HERALDRY OF ENGLAND AND WALES-NOTTINGHAMSHIRE (OBSOLETE) |publisher=}}</ref> The [[College of Arms]] included long grasses entwined with meadow crocuses in the arms as an alternative [[canting arms]] on the likelier origin as \"farmstead where bent-grass grows.\" With the formation of Broxtowe District (later Borough) Council in 1974, the bees were retained on its coat of arms.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=234 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609153435/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=234 |date=9 June 2011}} Coat of Arms</ref> The bee tradition continues – litter bins and other street furniture in the High Road are decorated in black and gold with a bee symbol on each. There is a sculpture in the High Road of a man sitting next to a beehive, popularly known as the \"Bee-man\", \"the man of Beeston\", etc., though officially called \"The Beeston Seat\".

==History==
===Domesday===
In Bestune at the Conquest, the Saxons Alfag, Alwine and UIchel had three manors consisting of three [[carucate]]s of land assessed. These were taken from them and given to William Peverel, lord of Nottingham Castle, who had in his [[demesne]] two plough teams, 17 bond tenants called [[villeins]], unable to leave the estate without the lord's consent, each farming some {{convert|15|acre|ha}} of arable, and one ordinary tenant or sochman. Together they had nine plough teams. There were {{convert|24|acre|ha}} of meadow. The annual yield of the estate was 30 shillings.

===19th century===
[[File:Walskipper-Beeston Boiler-001.jpg|thumb|A Beeston Boiler still in use in South Africa, 2008]]
Beeston outgrew its village status as a silk weaving centre in the early 19th century. The first silk mill was burnt down (along with [[Nottingham Castle]]) in the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]] riots of 1831. With the decline of the silk industry, many former mills gained light industrial uses in the early 20th century. Equipment made by the [[Beeston Boiler Company]] is still found all over the former [[British Empire]].

Between 1880 and the turn of the century, [[Thomas Humber]] and partners made bicycles and eventually motor-cycles and cars at a factory at the junction of what are now Queens Road and Humber Road. At its height it employed 2000, although this ended abruptly in 1907 when the firm moved to Coventry.

===20th century===
[[File:Population of Beeston, Nottinghamshire.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Population of Beeston, now just over 21,000 inhabitants]]<!-- Calculated from four Beeston wards. This is NOT the population of the Beeston-Stapleford urban district-->
In 1901 the [[National Telephone Company]] built a factory in Beeston for telephone materials. This was taken over by the British [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|L.M. Ericsson Manufacturing Co. Ltd.]] in 1903. Shortly before the transfer, most of the old factory was destroyed by fire, and in the rebuilding it was extended. A new power station was built. In 1906 and 1907 a large building was erected, chiefly devoted to cabinet work. The old factory building covered an area of {{convert|63000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, the cabinet factory {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, and the power station {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, making a total of {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Although most of the factory buildings were low rise, a [[paternoster lift]] survived in E-block at the site until it was demolished in 2016.

Under the [[Plessey]] name these large premises continued as a major source of employment through the 1980s. Plessey became [[GEC-Plessey Telecommunications|GPT]] with [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]]'s involvement. With the various restructurings of the [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] group and its rebranding as [[Marconi Electronic Systems|Marconi]], much of the site was sold to [[Siemens]] along with the private telephone-network side of the business. Siemens sublet much of the site as a \"technology park\" when it moved most manufacturing overseas.

SMS Electronics was formed from a [[management buyout]] of the manufacturing facility of Siemens in 2003. It won the [[Queens Award for Export]] in 2012 and employs over 200. The whole site was acquired by [[HSBC]] in 2006 for a mixed-use \"employment-led\" redevelopment. In 2007 a building was constructed for [[Atos|Atos Origin]] which at the time was the largest pre-let buildings in the Midlands.

The Boots campus includes three [[listed building|listed]] modernist buildings designed by engineer [[Owen Williams (engineer)|Owen Williams]] (two Grade I, one Grade II), though they are difficult to see from outside. It also has a later, Grade II* listed building by [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]].<ref name=\"listed\">[http://beestoncivicsociety.org.uk/gallery-1.html Beeston and District Civic Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812075138/http://beestoncivicsociety.org.uk/gallery-1.html |date=12 August 2011}} Listed buildings.</ref>

Motor manufacture returned to Beeston for a short period in 1987, when the Middlebridge Company set up a small factory in Lilac Grove and produced 77 [[Reliant Scimitar|Scimitar]] cars. The firm went into liquidation in 1990.
[[File:BeestonMaltings.jpg|thumb|Beeston Maltings]]
Beeston Maltings was in operation until the late 20th century. The buildings were in Dovecote Lan, opposite the [[Victoria Hotel, Beeston|Victoria Hotel]], but were demolished in 2012–2013.

===21st century===
Proposals for a light rail (tram) line through Beeston as an extension to the [[Nottingham Express Transit]] system were approved by the government in 2009,<ref>[http://www.netphasetwo.com/ Nottingham City Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206173051/http://netphasetwo.com/ |date=6 February 2009}} NET Phase 2 website</ref> due to traffic jams.

==Economy==
Beeston is home to many national and international companies. Of the 470 companies based in Beeston, the largest are [[Boots UK|Boots]], [[Changan]], [[Imperial Tobacco]], ZF, [[Siemens]], [[Atos]] and [[Chinook Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.changanuk.com/ |title=Changan UK R&D Centre |publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinooksciences.com/ |title=Home |publisher=}}</ref> Other wide-reaching local companies include [[Lathe (metal)|metalworking lathe]] manufacturer [[Myford]] and the internet firm Webfusion (later Hosteurope and then part of [[PIPEX Communications]]).

==Demography==
Beeston has a population of 37,000 people, of whom 71.2 per cent are classed as [[White British]] and 28.8 per cent as different ethnicities, with 10.3 per cent Chinese, 10.25 per cent European, 2.7 per cent Indian, and 2.11 per cent [[Pakistani]], and others 3.4 per cent.

The average household size is 2.40 and the population density 49.40 per hectare. The age ranges are 20.9% 30–44, 16.3% 16–24 and 18.06% the 45–59 age range.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/broxtowe-e07000172#sthash.u8P7k5uy.6dJ056SG.dpbs |title=Broxtowe – UK Census Data 2011 |first=Good Stuff IT |last=Services |publisher=}}</ref>

==Transport==
===Trains===
{{main|Beeston railway station}}
[[File:Beeston Station 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beeston railway station|Beeston station]] in 2004]] 
The [[Midland Counties Railway]] from [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] to [[Derby railway station|Derby]] through Beeston opened on 30 May 1839. It later became part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] company and then the [[London Midland Region (British Railways)|London Midland Region]] of British Railways.

[[Beeston railway station|Beeston station]]today has frequent rail links served by [[East Midlands Railway]] and [[CrossCountry]]. Direct trains to and from [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]] call hourly, with typical journey times for {{convert|123|mi|km}} of just under two hours. Other regular direct services serve [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]], [[Derby railway station|Derby]], [[Lincoln railway station|Lincoln]], [[Bedford railway station|Bedford]], [[Burton-on-Trent railway station|Burton-on-Trent]], [[Leicester railway station|Leicester]], [[Loughborough railway station|Loughborough]], [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]], [[Newark Castle railway station|Newark Castle]], [[Luton railway station|Luton]], [[East Midlands Parkway railway station|East Midlands Parkway]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] and [[Matlock railway station|Matlock]]. There are daily weekday trains to [[Gloucester railway station|Gloucester]], [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]] and [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]].

===Trams and buses===
[[File:Trent Barton in Beeston in 2008.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Trentbarton]] bus travelling along High Road, heading into Nottingham]]
Beeston is served by the [[Nottingham Express Transit]] tram system for Nottingham city centre and other local destinations. Frequent bus services operate to Nottingham, East Midlands Airport, [[Derby]], [[Loughborough]] and other local towns, operated mainly by [[Trentbarton]] and [[Nottingham City Transport]].

===Roads===
The Nottingham and [[Derby]] Road was [[turnpike trust|turnpiked]] in 1758–1759. Tolls were removed in 1870. A branch of the Nottingham and [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch|Ashby]] Turnpike Road, usually called the Sawley branch, went through Beeston. In 1831 a four-horse daily coach to [[Birmingham]] was advertised.

The present Nottingham–Derby road ([[A52 road|A52]]) touches the north of the town. Junction 25 of the [[M1 motorway]] is {{convert|6.4|km|mi}}. The town centre has municipal car parks owned by Broxtowe Borough Council, as well as supermarket car parks.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=962 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029175043/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=962 |date=29 October 2010}} – Car parks in Beeston</ref>

===Canals===
[[File:Entrance to Beeston Lock - geograph.org.uk - 52633.jpg|thumb|left|Boats at Beeston Marina, situated on the River Trent, near where Beeston Lock allows for travel on the Beeston Canal (avoiding Beeston Weir)]]
The [[Nottingham Canal]] from [[Trent Bridge (bridge)|Trent Bridge]] to [[Langley Mill]], via Nottingham and [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]] was authorised in 1790 and completed by 1802. It allowed goods traffic from the Erewash valley to bypass the [[River Erewash]] and [[River Trent]]. In response, a Beeston Canal was promoted by the [[Trent Navigation Company]] in 1794. This stretched from Beeston Cut to Lenton, over a weir at Beeston Rylands. Originally there was a second lock at Beeston Cut for small vessels to enter the Trent below the weir, but this was abandoned about 1940.

===Cycles===
The [[National Cycle Route 6]] (London – Keswick) passes through Long Lane Attenborough, then along the pavement of Queens Road and Lilac Grove, past Nottingham University and the [[Queen's Medical Centre]], where it turns left towards Wollaton and Bulwell. A circular \"Big Track\" for cyclists and pedestrians follows towpaths along the Trent and Beeston Canal. The Erewash Valley trail passes along the western side of Beeston. Several other cycle routes are signposted.

==Built environment==
[[File:BeestonStJohntheBaptist.JPG|thumb|The Parish Church of [[St John the Baptist Church, Beeston]]]]
[[File:DovecoteLane.jpg|thumb|Victorian villas on Dovecote Lane]]
Beeston has a number of historic buildings, including a manor house and the parish church of [[St. John the Baptist Church, Beeston|St John the Baptist]]. The church dates from the 11th century, but was largely rebuilt in 1843 by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]]. Both are included in the West End [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|conservation area]], which covers several buildings, many historical or of character, along Dovecote Lane, Grange Avenue, West End, and Church Street. Included in the area is the historic Village Cross.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4232 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609154002/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4232 |date=9 June 2011 }} – Beeston West End conservation area</ref>

An [[Inclosure acts|enclosure act]] was passed for the parish of Beeston, and in 1809 the Commissioners stated that the lands amounted to {{convert|822|acre|km2}}, to be made tithe free, and the ancient enclosed lands and homesteads liable to tithe was £687 2s 29d. They then proceeded to fix the width of the roads. The Nottingham and Derby turnpike road was fixed at {{convert|50|foot|m}}. Wollaton Road, then called Cowgate, was {{convert|30|foot|m}}. The enclosures altered the appearance of part of the parish from a moor growing poor grass to cultivated fields with hedges, and so increased the food supply. It relieved farmers of their duty to pay a tenth of their product in kind.

Some lands on or near [[Bramcote Moor]], but in Beeston parish, were enclosed in 1847, by provisional order of the Inclosure Commissioners.

Before the general introduction of gas in the parish, there was a limited supply from the Mill to separate houses. The church was first lit with gas in 1857. A Public Lighting Act was adopted at a vestry meeting on 13 November 1862. Opposition to the street lamps was strong, and the effigy of an active promoter of it was carried on an ass round the village and hung on a lamp-post, and but for police interference would have been burned. In 1861 gas was supplied from Nottingham by the [[Nottingham Corporation Gas Department#Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company|Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company]] and for street lamps in 1872. Beeston was connected to the mains water supply in 1876.

[[File:AngloScotianMills.JPG|thumb|left|[[Anglo Scotian Mills]] on Wollaton Road by [[James Huckerby]] 1892]]

The [[crenellation|crenellated]] [[listed building]] of the [[Anglo Scotian Mills]]<ref name=\"listed\"/> remains on Wollaton Road to the north of the town centre. It is a solitary reminder of the former dominance of silk and lace mills on the skyline. The buildings have been converted into apartments by a developer. A cottage on the north side of Anglo Scotian Mills was reputed to have the tallest domestic chimney in England.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Its length was necessary to reach over the roof of the Mill. Although the cottage has been demolished for several years, the chimney can still be seen attached to the Mill wall.

A rare survival is the G H Hurt & Son Shawl Factory, which is occasionally open to the public. Shawls are produced on knitting machines and hand finished in much the same way as they have been for centuries. The factory contains examples of knitting frames from the 17th century.

Lost industrial buildings include the rebuilt silk mill and the looming bulk of the Neville Works mill on the boundary with Chilwell (later occupied by the Myford lathe factory).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===The Land Societies===
====St John's Grove Estate====
After the enclosure of the land surrounding Beeston in 1809, the area of [[St John's Grove, Beeston|St John's Grove]] was allotted to the vicar of the parish church. In 1878 the land was acquired from the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] by the Beeston Land Society, a group of citizens, who divided it into 28 plots of between three-quarters and {{convert|1|acre|ha|adj=on}} and laid out wide, straight streets. Most of the houses date from Edwardian and late Victorian times. The Land Society set conditions for developers. There were to be no public houses, and strict building lines would ensure that properties were set back a consistent distance from the road. The St John's Grove Estate is now a conservation area.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 St John's Conservation Area description – Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918002310/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 |date=18 September 2009 }}</ref>

====Imperial Park Estate====
Shortly after 1878, the Imperial Park Land Society and its sister the Beeston Building Society were founded. They aimed to assist the development and financing of superior housing around what is now Imperial Road, north of Newton Street, adjacent to the St John's Grove development and bounded on the north by North Street. The early model was to have savings made by a group of subscribers and funds allocated by the drawing of lots, in turn for each of them to build a house.

====Bellevue Park Estate====
This initial success was repeated when, in 1881, a syndicate acquired land from George Fellows, of the banking family that had its home at Belle Vue, now Beeston Fields Golf Club. The Belle Vue Land Society was formed to develop this land using similar methods to Imperial Park. The development lay to the north as a continuation to Imperial Park. Denison Street formed its northern extreme and Montague Street defined its eastern limit.

====Cottage Grove====
Cottage Grove, historically was just outside Beeston parish and part of [[Chilwell]], was promoted by the [[Labourer's Friend Society]] in the 1840s as plots for cottages with allotments for the labouring poor. The scheme failed and the area now consists mostly of Victorian and Edwardian houses laid out along the parallel Park Road and Grove Avenue and the two short cross streets Cedar Road and North Drive. The area retains a leafy character and the roads remain unkerbed. It has been a conservation area since 2008.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236  Cottage Grove Conservation Area description – Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918015056/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236 |date=18 September 2009}}</ref>

====The Estates today====
Some areas originally developed by the Land Societies have been spoiled where original plots have been subdivided and more modern properties built in styles not in keeping with the original buildings. Many properties in the Imperial Park and Bellvue Estates have lost their original elegance with the lowering of chimney stacks, inappropriate replacement of windows and doors with modern PVC, the loss of hedged fronts to brick walls or fencing, and paving over front gardens for parking.

===Other development===
[[File:ChilwellRoadMethodistChurch.JPG|thumb|Methodist Church on Chilwell Road]]
[[File:BeestonBaptistChurch.jpg|thumb|left|Baptist Church on Dovecote Lane, formerly known as John Clifford Baptist Church]]
A [[Chilwell Road Methodist Church|particularly fine Methodist Church]] was built by the architect W. J. Morley of Bradford on Chilwell Road in 1902. Its landmark spire became visible from afar after the demolition of several large mill buildings in the 1990s. The front of the building was floodlit at night.

The Baptist Church in Dovecote Lane built in 1898 by [[Charles Nelson Holloway]], but demolished in 2015 and replaced by semi-detached housing.

===Almshouses===
The United Charities of [[Abel Collin]] moved from the centre of Nottingham to their current location in Derby Road, Beeston, in the 1950s.

Beeston's main shopping area is along the [[High Road, Beeston|High Road]], much of which has been pedestrianised. There are some chain stores in Beeston, and independent stores including specialist [[east Asian]] and [[Mediterranean]] food shops.

There are takeaways and several restaurants, offering a selection of food including Chinese, Thai, and Indian cuisine. Cafés are to be found around the main shopping centre, \"The Square\" — the centre of Beeston — is a 1960s shopping development, most of which is pedestrianised.[[File:Beeston High Road in 2006.jpg|thumb|High Road during improvements in September 2006]] A£1.4-million environmental improvement scheme covered pavements and lighting for the non-pedestrianised eastern end of the High Road. Further east Broadgate saw improvements, with a new space at the top entrance to Broadgate Recreation Ground. The works were completed in late 2006.

The shopping centre is traversed by Wollaton Road. An area south-east of the shopping centre has made room for a [[Tesco]] superstore, which opened 1 November 2010, rivalling the [[Sainsbury's]] store in the town centre and the recent [[Lidl]] store in Wollaton Road to the north of the town centre. Beeston Fire Station on an adjacent plot was closed and relocated to a new site on Hassocks Lane.

Beeston town centre was redeveloped when the [[Nottingham Express Transit]] extension was built, including the construction of a large gym and a [[Costa Coffee]] shop.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Countdown-new-gym-opening-Beeston/story-25778631-detail/story.html |title=Countdown to new gym opening in Beeston |date=29 December 2014 |publisher =|access-date=7 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428225255/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Countdown-new-gym-opening-Beeston/story-25778631-detail/story.html |archive-date=28 April 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This redevelopment was undertaken by Henry Boot.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Gym-set-help-energise-work-new-look-square/story-20510560-detail/story.html |title=Beeston: Gym set to help energise work on new-look square |date=28 January 2014 |publisher= |access-date=7 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402182924/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Gym-set-help-energise-work-new-look-square/story-20510560-detail/story.html |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Royal Mail===
Beeston has three post offices. Until 2017, the main post office was in Chilwell Road (on a site that also originally housed the delivery office), but moved to share premises with the town's branch of WHSmith. There is another post office in the High Road towards Broadgate, and a third in Central Avenue in the north of the town. A fourth post office in the Rylands part of town closed in January 2008.<ref>[http://www.beestonexpress.co.uk/images/beestonexpress/Dec14pdfs/Dec14p1.pdf Beeston Express]{{dead link |date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Issue 116, December 2007.</ref>

The [[Royal Mail]]'s main [[sorting office]] for the Nottingham area (the [[NG postcode area]]) stands on the eastern edge of Beeston at Padge Road, with the City of Nottingham boundary running round the building. It was built in 1995<ref name=\"Wetherspoons\"/> and includes a new delivery office for local distribution of Beeston's mail.

==Sport==
Beeston is home to England Hockey Premier League team [[Beeston Hockey Club]] who play at Highfields Sports Club on University Boulevard.

Until 2006, Beeston was home to [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham Rugby Club]], which sold the land next to the railway line (now the Birkin Fields housing development) and moved to share the [[Meadow Lane]] pitch at the Notts County ground. Nottingham Casuals Rugby Club still plays on the rugby pitches at Weirfields near the canal.

The two [[golf course]]s adjacent to the town are Beeston Fields and Chilwell Manor. A short distance to the north is [[Bramcote Hills|Bramcote Hill]] Golf Club and to the north-east the golf course at [[Wollaton Park]].

Beeston is home to several well-established football clubs, including Beeston Amateur Football Club (Beeston AFC), which has two men's Saturday sides that play in the Nottinghamshire Senior League and the Midland Amateur Alliance respectively, and Beeston Town FC, which plays its home games at Highfields and competes in Division One of the Long Eaton Sunday League.

Beeston Athletics, formally Ericsson AC & Plessey AC, is now based at Chilwell Olympia and meets on Wednesday and Friday evenings and on Sunday morning. It also organises a five-mile race in May or June

'''Transport''' (commonly used in the U.K.), or '''transportation''' (used in the U.S.), is the [[Motion|movement]] of humaaneille sekä alkuasukkaille, animals and [[cargo|goods]] from one location to another. In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A (a place in space) to a point B.  [[Modes of transport]] include [[aviation|air]], [[land transport|land]] ([[rail transport|rail]] and [[road transport|road]]), [[ship transport|water]], [[cable transport|cable]], [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[space transport|space]]. The field can be divided into [[infrastructure]], [[vehicle]]s and [[business operations|operations]]. Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of [[civilization]]s.

Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, [[airway (aviation)|airways]], [[waterway]]s, [[canal]]s and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] and terminals such as [[airport]]s, [[train station|railway stations]], [[bus station]]s, [[warehouse]]s, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and [[fuel station]]s) and [[seaport]]s. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.

Vehicles traveling on these networks may include [[automobiles]], [[bicycles]], [[buses]], [[train]]s, [[truck]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[watercraft]], [[spacecraft]] and [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]].

Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.

Passenger transport may be [[public transport|public]], where operators provide scheduled services, or [[private transport|private]]. Freight transport has become focused on [[containerization]], although [[Bulk material handling|bulk transport]] is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and [[globalization]], but most types cause [[air pollution]] and [[Land use|use large amounts of land]]. While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make [[traffic flow]] and restrain [[urban sprawl]].

==History==
{{Main|History of transport}}
[[File:Bronocice drawn.png|thumb|[[Bronocice pot]] with the earliest known image of a wheeled vehicle in the world, found in [[Poland]]]]
[[File:Bullock team.jpg|thumb|A [[Cattle|bullock]] team hauling [[wool]] in [[Australia]]]]
Humans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. The [[domestication]] of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and the sled helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of [[vehicle]]s. Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to [[time immemorial]], and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The first forms of [[road transport]] involved animals, such as [[horse]]s ([[Domestication of the horse|domesticated]] in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), [[ox]]en (from about 8000 BCE)<ref>

or humans carrying goods over [[dirt]] tracks that often followed [[game (food)|game]] [[trail]]s. Many early civilizations, including those in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], constructed paved roads.  In [[classical antiquity]], the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval [[Caliphate]] later built [[Tarmacadam|tar-paved]] roads. The first watercraft were [[canoe]]s cut out from [[tree trunk]]s. Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the [[wind]] for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible.

===Mechanical===
[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|The [[Wright brothers]]' first flight in 1903]]
The [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With [[telegraphy]], communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects. The invention of the [[steam engine]], closely followed by its application in [[rail transport]], made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the [[steam ship]], which sped up global transport.

With the development of the [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated. The first \"modern\" highways were constructed during the 19th century{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} with [[macadam]]. Later, [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] and [[concrete]] became the dominant paving materials. In 1903 the [[Wright brothers]] demonstrated the first successful controllable [[airplane]], and after World War I (1914–1918) aircraft became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 158</ref>

After World War II (1939–1945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger services.<ref name=cooper277>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 277</ref> Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled. In the 1950s the introduction of [[containerization]] gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering [[globalization]].<ref name=bcn21114>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 211–14</ref> International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s with the commercialization of the [[jet engine]]. Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance. After the introduction of the [[Shinkansen]] in Japan in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe started attracting passengers on long-haul routes away from the airlines.<ref name=cooper277 />

Early in [[U.S. history]],{{when|date=February 2016}} [[privately held company|private]] [[joint-stock]] [[corporations]] owned most [[Navigable aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[bridge]]s, [[canals]], [[railroads]], [[roads]], and [[tunnels]]. Most such transport infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the [[nationalization]] of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of [[Amtrak]]. Recently,{{when|date=February 2016}} however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some{{quantify|date=February 2016}} ground and adherents.<ref>

==Modes==
{{Main|Mode of transport}}
A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of vehicle, infrastructure, and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen for a trip on the basis of cost, capability, and route.

===Human-powered===
{{Main|Human-powered transport}}
[[File:Sherpa carrying woods.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Human-powered transport]] remains common in developing countries.]]
Human-powered transport, a form of [[sustainable transport]], is the transport of people and/or goods using [[human]] muscle-power, in the form of [[walking]], [[running]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Modern [[technology]] has allowed [[machine]]s to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, [[leisure]], [[physical exercise]], and [[environmentalism]]; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.

Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and [[inline skates]]. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by [[watercraft rowing]] and [[skiing]]; even the air can be entered with [[human-powered aircraft]].

===Animal-powered===
{{Main|Animal-powered transport}}
Animal-powered transport is the use of [[working animal]]s for the movement of people and commodities. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as [[pack animal]]s for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in [[team]]s, to pull [[sled]]s or wheeled [[vehicle]]s.

===Air===
{{Main|Aviation}}
[[File:Airfrance.a318-100.f-guga.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Air France]] [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A320 family|A318]] lands at [[London Heathrow Airport]].|alt=White jet aircraft coming into land, undercarriage fully extended. Under each wing is a turbofan engine]]
A [[fixed-wing aircraft]], commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish this from [[rotorcraft|rotary-wing aircraft]], where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A [[gyroplane]] is both fixed-wing and rotary wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large [[airliner]]s and military cargo aircraft.

Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for [[lift (soaring)|lift]] and an area for [[landing]]. The majority of aircraft also need an [[airport]] with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water.

The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the [[rocket]]. Commercial jets can reach up to {{convert|955|km/h|mph}}, single-engine aircraft {{convert|555|km/h|mph}}. Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places, [[helicopter]]s can be used.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 281</ref> As of April 28, 2009, ''The Guardian'' article notes that \"the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' April 28, 2009.</ref>

===Land===
{{Main|Land transport}}
Land transport covers all land-based transport systems that provide for the movement of people, goods and services. Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in [[urban planning]]. It consists of 2 kinds, rail and road.

====Rail====
{{Main|Rail transport}}
[[File:ICE1 Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|[[Intercity Express]], a German [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] passenger train|alt=White electric train with red cheatline emerging from tunnel in the countryside]]
[[File:Monday morning rush at Xi'erqi Station, southbound (20170904084423).jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Beijing Subway]] is one of the world's largest and busiest rapid transit networks.]]
Rail transport is where a [[train]] runs along a set of two parallel [[steel]] [[rail tracks#Railway rail|rails]], known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored [[perpendicular]] to [[railroad tie|ties]] (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or [[rail gauge|gauge]]. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed [[soil|earth]] and [[gravel]] in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include [[monorail]] and [[maglev (transport)|maglev]].

A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a [[locomotive]], that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by [[steam locomotive|steam]], [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] or by [[electric locomotive|electricity]] supplied by [[railway electrification system|trackside systems]]. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a [[multiple unit]]. Also, a train can be powered by [[horsecar|horses]], [[funicular|cables]], [[gravity]], [[pneumatics]] and [[gas turbine]]s. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]], though not as efficient as ships.

[[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] trains are long-haul services connecting cities;<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 279</ref> modern [[high-speed rail]] is capable of speeds up to {{convert|350|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but this requires specially built track. [[Regional rail|Regional]] and [[commuter rail|commuter]] trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity [[tram]]ways and [[rapid transit]]s, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. [[Freight trains]] traditionally used [[box car]]s, requiring manual loading and unloading of the [[cargo]]. Since the 1960s, [[container train]]s have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.

====Road====

A road is an identifiable [[route number|route]], way or [[trail|path]] between two or more [[location (geography)|places]].<ref Name=\"Major_Roads_of_the_United_States\">{{cite web |title=Major Roads of the United States |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |date=2006-03-13 |url=http://nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413153426/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |archivedate=13 April 2007 |df= }}</ref> Roads are typically smoothed, [[pavement (material)|paved]], or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel;<ref Name=\"RoadInfrastructureStrategicFrameworkforSouthAfrica\">{{cite web|title=Road Infrastructure Strategic Framework for South Africa |publisher=National Department of Transport (South Africa) |date= |url=http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927063243/http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}</ref> though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal [[construction]] or [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]].<ref>Lay, 1992: 6–7</ref> In [[urban area]]s, roads may pass through a [[city]] or [[village]] and be named as [[street]]s, serving a dual function as urban space [[easement]] and route.<ref name=\"difference_between_road_and_street\">{{cite web | title=What is the difference between a road and a street? |work=Word FAQ |publisher=Lexico Publishing Group |year=2007 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/d01.html |accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref>

The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a [[wheel]]ed passenger vehicle that carries its own [[car engine|motor]]. Other users of roads include [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[motorcycles]], [[bicycles]] and [[pedestrians]]. As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide.
Road transport offers a complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. It is possible to provide door to door service only by road transport.

Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of harmful [[noise pollution|noise]] and [[air pollution]] in cities;<ref>{{Cite news|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/05/one-in-five-europeans-exposed-to-harmful-noise-pollution-study|title=One in five Europeans exposed to harmful noise pollution – study|date=2020-03-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-05|url-status=live|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 278</ref> Road transport by truck is often the initial and [[Last mile|final stage]] of freight transport.

===Water===
{{Main|Ship transport}}
[[File:Jadrolinija supetar ferry.JPG|thumb|Automobile ferry in [[Croatia]]|alt=White ferry with ramps in the up-position, moored at jetty]]
Water transport is movement by means of a [[watercraft]]—such as a [[barge]], [[boat]], [[ship]] or [[sailboat]]—over a body of water, such as a [[sea]], [[ocean]], [[lake]], [[canal]] or [[river]]. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.

In the 19th century, the first [[steam ships]] were developed, using a [[steam engine]] to drive a [[paddle wheel]] or [[propeller]] to move the ship. The [[steam]] was produced in a [[boiler]] using wood or [[coal]] and fed through a steam [[external combustion engine]]. Now most ships have an [[internal combustion engine]] using a slightly refined type of [[petroleum]] called [[bunker fuel]]. Some ships, such as [[submarine]]s, use [[nuclear power]] to produce the steam. [[Recreation]]al or [[education]]al craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use [[internal combustion engines]] to drive one or more [[propeller]]s, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, [[hovercraft]] are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. (See [[Marine propulsion]].)

Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern [[sea transport]] is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods. [[Commercial vessel]]s, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4&nbsp;billion tons of cargo in 2007.<ref>The [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) 2007, p. ''x'' and p. 32.</ref> Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental [[shipping]];<ref>Stopford, 1997: 4–6</ref> [[short sea shipping]] and [[ferry|ferries]] remain viable in coastal areas.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 8–9</ref><ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 280</ref>

===Other modes===
[[File:Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Luca Galuzzi 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] for [[crude oil]]|alt=Oil pipeline winding through cold Alaskan country-side. In the background are mountains, partly snow-capped]]
[[Pipeline transport]] sends goods through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but [[pneumatic tube]]s can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for [[sewage]], [[slurry]], [[water]] and [[beer]], while long-distance networks are used for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].

[[Cable transport]] is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by [[Wire rope|cables]] instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep [[gradient]]. Typical solutions include [[aerial tramway]], [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]] and [[ski lift]]s; some of these are also categorized as [[conveyor belt|conveyor]] transport.

[[Space transport|Spaceflight]] is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into [[outer space]] by means of a [[spacecraft]]. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments. However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System.

[[Suborbital spaceflight]] is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant \"other place\" on Earth. Faster transport could be achieved through part of a [[low Earth orbit]], or following that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it.

Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the [[Airway (aviation)|airway]] and [[sea lane|seaway]] do not need to be constructed. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals.

Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits. For instance, [[airport rail link]]s connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are [[parking lot]]s, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 275–76</ref> For freight, terminals act as [[transshipment]] points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use.

The [[transport finance|financing]] of infrastructure can either be [[government|public]] or [[private enterprise|private]]. Transport is often a [[natural monopoly]] and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through [[taxation]]. New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through [[debt]]. Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as [[landing fees]] at airports, or [[toll plaza]]s on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose [[tax]]es on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.<ref>Bent Flyvbjerg, Mette K. Skamris Holm, and Søren L. Buhl, \"How (In)Accurate Are Demand Forecasts in Public Works Projects\", ''Journal of the American Planning Association'' '''71''':2, pp. 131–46.</ref>

===Vehicles===
{{Main|Vehicle}}
[[File:1992 Fiat Uno IE 1.0 Front.jpg|thumb|A [[Fiat Uno]] in 2018]]
A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a [[steam engine]], [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]], [[electric motor]], a [[jet engine]] or a [[rocket]], though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through [[wheel]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[pressure]].

Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a [[driving|driver]]. However, some systems, such as [[people mover]]s and some rapid transits, are fully [[automation|automated]]. For [[passenger]] transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver.

===Operation===
[[File:Incheon International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Incheon International Airport]], South Korea|alt=Tilted aerial view of modern airport. Aircraft are parked next to \"arms\" that extend from the central building]]
Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through [[private enterprise]] or by [[government]]s. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a [[flag carrier|national airline]] and [[railway company|national railway]]. Since the 1980s, many of these have been [[privatization|privatized]]. International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation,<ref>Stopford, 1997: 422</ref> but ports can be public-owned.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 29</ref>

===Policy===
As the population of the world increases, cities grow in size and population—according to the United Nations, 55% of the world’s population live in cities, and by 2050 this number is expected to rise to 68%.<ref>{{cite news |last=Meredith |first=Sam |date=2018-05-17 |title=Two-thirds of global population will live in cities by 2050, UN says |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/two-thirds-of-global-population-will-live-in-cities-by-2050-un-says.html |work=CNBC |access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref> Public transport policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The evolution of urban mobility: The interplay of academic and policy perspectives |last=Jones |first=Peter |date=July 2014 |journal=IATSS Research |volume=38 |pages=7–13 |doi=10.1016/j.iatssr.2014.06.001 }}</ref> The institution of policy enforces order in transport, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible. This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.

==Functions==
Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical [[military logistics|relocation]] of [[armed force]]s during [[warfare]], or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment.

{{Main|Travel|Public transit}}
[[File:ACTION Bus-467.jpg|thumb|A local transit bus operated by [[ACTION]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]|alt=Light green, orange and white bus stopping in front of multi-story building.]]
Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into [[public transport|public]] and [[private transport]]. Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact. Travel may be as part of daily [[commuting]], for [[business travel|business]], leisure or [[human migration|migration]].

Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of [[bus]]es in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and [[rapid transit]] in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]] and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. [[Intermodal passenger transport]] is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a [[transport hub]], such as a [[bus station|bus]] or [[railway station]].

Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum. Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is [[demand-responsive transport]], offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable.

[[International travel]] may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and [[visa (document)|visa]] requirements.

===Medical===
[[File:World War I ambulance Pittsburgh 20th Century Club.png|thumb|An ambulance from World War I]]An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment,<ref>[[Henry Alan Skinner|Skinner, Henry Alan]]. 1949, \"The Origin of Medical Terms\". Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins</ref> and in some instances will also provide out-of-hospital medical care to the patient. The word is often associated with road-going \"emergency ambulances\", which form part of [[emergency medical service]]s, administering [[emergency medicine|emergency care]] to those with acute medical problems.

''Air medical services'' is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transport to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes. Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations, aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft.<ref name=\"pmid15928284\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Branas CC, MacKenzie EJ, Williams JC, Schwab CW, Teter HM, Flanigan MC | title=Access to trauma centers in the United States. | journal=JAMA | year= 2005 | volume= 293 | issue= 21 | pages= 2626–33 | pmid=15928284 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.21.2626 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=15928284  |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid7832345\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Burney RE, Hubert D, Passini L, Maio R | title=Variation in air medical outcomes by crew composition: a two-year follow-up. | journal=Ann Emerg Med | year= 1995 | volume= 25 | issue= 2 | pages= 187–92 | pmid=7832345 | doi= 10.1016/s0196-0644(95)70322-5|doi-access=free| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=7832345  }}</ref>

===Freight===
{{Main|Shipping}}

Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the [[value chain]] in manufacturing.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 3</ref> With increased specialization and [[globalization]], production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 63–64</ref> Transport creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption. While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 54</ref> [[Logistics]] refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 4</ref> [[Incoterm]] deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of [[risk]] during transport.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 473</ref>

[[File:WCML freight train.jpg|thumb|[[Freight train]] with [[shipping container]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]]]
[[Containerization]], with the standardization of [[ISO container]]s on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized [[International trade|international]] and [[domestic trade]], offering a huge reduction in [[transshipment]] costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in [[economy of scale]] in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s.<ref name=bcn21114 />

[[Bulk material handling|Bulk transport]] is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are [[ore]], coal, [[cereals]] and [[petroleum]]. Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.

[[Cargo airline|Air freight]] has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as [[postponement]] and [[just in time (business)|just-in-time]] within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 328</ref> In addition to mail, common items sent by air include [[electronics]] and [[fashion]] clothing.

==Impact==
{{Main|Sustainable transport}}

===Economic===
{{Main|Transport economics}}
[[File:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in [[Seattle, Washington]], United States.|alt=Skyline of city at dawn. A major highway winds itself into the downtown area.]]

Transport is a key necessity for [[Departmentalization|specialization]]—allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations.  Throughout history, transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more [[trade]] and a greater spread of people. [[Economic growth]] has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 2</ref> But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making [[transport sustainability]] a major issue.

Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of [[tourism]], a major part of [[recreation]]al transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed.

===Planning===
{{Main|Transport planning}}

Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of [[transport forecasting]], planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the [[supply chain]]. Transport as a field is also studied through [[transport economics]], a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. [[Transport engineering]], a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]], must take into account [[trip generation]], [[trip distribution]], [[mode choice]] and [[route assignment]], while the operative level is handled through [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]].

[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving.|alt=Aerial view of roundabout, a junction of several streets. Vehicles traverse around the roundabout, which is surrounded by buildings, mostly multi-storey]]
Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a [[tragedy of the commons]], where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. [[land use|Density of development]] depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization. Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There are [[economies of agglomeration]]. Beyond transport, some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transport facilities consume land, and in cities pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.

Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput mean that in many cities there is too much traffic and many—if not all—of the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places; as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on—spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociology and economics—the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned.

'''Transport''' (commonly used in the U.K.), or '''transportation''' (used in the U.S.), is the [[Motion|movement]] of humans, animals and [[cargo|goods]] from one location to another. In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A (a place in space) to a point B.  [[Modes of transport]] include [[aviation|air]], [[land transport|land]] ([[rail transport|rail]] and [[road transport|road]]), [[ship transport|water]], [[cable transport|cable]], [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[space transport|space]]. The field can be divided into [[infrastructure]], [[vehicle]]s and [[business operations|operations]]. Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of [[civilization]]s.

Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, [[airway (aviation)|airways]], [[waterway]]s, [[canal]]s and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] and terminals such as [[airport]]s, [[train station|railway stations]], [[bus station]]s, [[warehouse]]s, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and [[fuel station]]s) and [[seaport]]s. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.

Vehicles traveling on these networks may include [[automobiles]], [[bicycles]], [[buses]], [[train]]s, [[truck]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[watercraft]], [[spacecraft]] and [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]].

Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.

Passenger transport may be [[public transport|public]], where operators provide scheduled services, or [[private transport|private]]. Freight transport has become focused on [[containerization]], although [[Bulk material handling|bulk transport]] is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and [[globalization]], but most types cause [[air pollution]] and [[Land use|use large amounts of land]]. While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make [[traffic flow]] and restrain [[urban sprawl]].

[[File:Bullock team.jpg|thumb|A [[Cattle|bullock]] team hauling [[wool]] in [[Australia]]]]
Humans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. The [[domestication]] of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and the sled helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of [[vehicle]]s. Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to [[time immemorial]], and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The first forms of [[road transport]] involved animals, such as [[horse]]s ([[Domestication of the horse|domesticated]] in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), [[ox]]en (from about 8000 BCE)<ref>

or humans carrying goods over [[dirt]] tracks that often followed [[game (food)|game]] [[trail]]s. Many early civilizations, including those in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], constructed paved roads.  In [[classical antiquity]], the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval [[Caliphate]] later built [[Tarmacadam|tar-paved]] roads. The first watercraft were [[canoe]]s cut out from [[tree trunk]]s. Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the [[wind]] for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible.

===Mechanical===
[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|The [[Wright brothers]]' first flight in 1903]]
The [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With [[telegraphy]], communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects. The invention of the [[steam engine]], closely followed by its application in [[rail transport]], made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the [[steam ship]], which sped up global transport.

With the development of the [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated. The first \"modern\" highways were constructed during the 19th century{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} with [[macadam]]. Later, [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] and [[concrete]] became the dominant paving materials. In 1903 the [[Wright brothers]] demonstrated the first successful controllable [[airplane]], and after World War I (1914–1918) aircraft became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 158</ref>

After World War II (1939–1945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger services.<ref name=cooper277>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 277</ref> Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled. In the 1950s the introduction of [[containerization]] gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering [[globalization]].<ref name=bcn21114>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 211–14</ref> International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s with the commercialization of the [[jet engine]]. Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance. After the introduction of the [[Shinkansen]] in Japan in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe started attracting passengers on long-haul routes away from the airlines.<ref name=cooper277 />

==Modes==
{{Main|Mode of transport}}
A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of vehicle, infrastructure, and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen for a trip on the basis of cost, capability, and route.

===Human-powered===
{{Main|Human-powered transport}}
[[File:Sherpa carrying woods.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Human-powered transport]] remains common in developing countries.]]
Human-powered transport, a form of [[sustainable transport]], is the transport of people and/or goods using [[human]] muscle-power, in the form of [[walking]], [[running]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Modern [[technology]] has allowed [[machine]]s to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, [[leisure]], [[physical exercise]], and [[environmentalism]]; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.

Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and [[inline skates]]. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by [[watercraft rowing]] and [[skiing]]; even the air can be entered with [[human-powered aircraft]].

===Animal-powered===
{{Main|Animal-powered transport}}
Animal-powered transport is the use of [[working animal]]s for the movement of people and commodities. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as [[pack animal]]s for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in [[team]]s, to pull [[sled]]s or wheeled [[vehicle]]s.

===Air===
{{Main|Aviation}}
[[File:Airfrance.a318-100.f-guga.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Air France]] [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A320 family|A318]] lands at [[London Heathrow Airport]].|alt=White jet aircraft coming into land, undercarriage fully extended. Under each wing is a turbofan engine]]
A [[fixed-wing aircraft]], commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish this from [[rotorcraft|rotary-wing aircraft]], where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A [[gyroplane]] is both fixed-wing and rotary wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large [[airliner]]s and military cargo aircraft.

Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for [[lift (soaring)|lift]] and an area for [[landing]]. The majority of aircraft also need an [[airport]] with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water.

The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the [[rocket]]. Commercial jets can reach up to {{convert|955|km/h|mph}}, single-engine aircraft {{convert|555|km/h|mph}}. Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places, [[helicopter]]s can be used.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 281</ref> As of April 28, 2009, ''The Guardian'' article notes that \"the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' April 28, 2009.</ref>

===Land===
{{Main|Land transport}}
Land transport covers all land-based transport systems that provide for the movement of people, goods and services. Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in [[urban planning]]. It consists of 2 kinds, rail and road.

====Rail====
{{Main|Rail transport}}
[[File:ICE1 Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|[[Intercity Express]], a German [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] passenger train|alt=White electric train with red cheatline emerging from tunnel in the countryside]]
[[File:Monday morning rush at Xi'erqi Station, southbound (20170904084423).jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Beijing Subway]] is one of the world's largest and busiest rapid transit networks.]]
Rail transport is where a [[train]] runs along a set of two parallel [[steel]] [[rail tracks#Railway rail|rails]], known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored [[perpendicular]] to [[railroad tie|ties]] (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or [[rail gauge|gauge]]. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed [[soil|earth]] and [[gravel]] in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include [[monorail]] and [[maglev (transport)|maglev]].

A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a [[locomotive]], that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by [[steam locomotive|steam]], [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] or by [[electric locomotive|electricity]] supplied by [[railway electrification system|trackside systems]]. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a [[multiple unit]]. Also, a train can be powered by [[horsecar|horses]], [[funicular|cables]], [[gravity]], [[pneumatics]] and [[gas turbine]]s. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]], though not as efficient as ships.

[[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] trains are long-haul services connecting cities;<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 279</ref> modern [[high-speed rail]] is capable of speeds up to {{convert|350|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but this requires specially built track. [[Regional rail|Regional]] and [[commuter rail|commuter]] trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity [[tram]]ways and [[rapid transit]]s, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. [[Freight trains]] traditionally used [[box car]]s, requiring manual loading and unloading of the [[cargo]]. Since the 1960s, [[container train]]s have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.

====Road====
{{Main|Road transport}}
[[File:Harborfreeway2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Harbor Freeway]] is often heavily congested at rush hour in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].]]
A road is an identifiable [[route number|route]], way or [[trail|path]] between two or more [[location (geography)|places]].<ref Name=\"Major_Roads_of_the_United_States\">{{cite web |title=Major Roads of the United States |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |date=2006-03-13 |url=http://nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413153426/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |archivedate=13 April 2007 |df= }}</ref> Roads are typically smoothed, [[pavement (material)|paved]], or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel;<ref Name=\"RoadInfrastructureStrategicFrameworkforSouthAfrica\">{{cite web|title=Road Infrastructure Strategic Framework for South Africa |publisher=National Department of Transport (South Africa) |date= |url=http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927063243/http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}</ref> though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal [[construction]] or [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]].<ref>Lay, 1992: 6–7</ref> In [[urban area]]s, roads may pass through a [[city]] or [[village]] and be named as [[street]]s, serving a dual function as urban space [[easement]] and route.<ref name=\"difference_between_road_and_street\">{{cite web | title=What is the difference between a road and a street? |work=Word FAQ |publisher=Lexico Publishing Group |year=2007 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/d01.html |accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref>

The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a [[wheel]]ed passenger vehicle that carries its own [[car engine|motor]]. Other users of roads include [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[motorcycles]], [[bicycles]] and [[pedestrians]]. As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide.
Road transport offers a complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. It is possible to provide door to door service only by road transport.

Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of harmful [[noise pollution|noise]] and [[air pollution]] in cities;<ref>{{Cite news|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/05/one-in-five-europeans-exposed-to-harmful-noise-pollution-study|title=One in five Europeans exposed to harmful noise pollution – study|date=2020-03-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-05|url-status=live|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 278</ref> Road transport by truck is often the initial and [[Last mile|final stage]] of freight transport.

===Water===
{{Main|Ship transport}}
[[File:Jadrolinija supetar ferry.JPG|thumb|Automobile ferry in [[Croatia]]|alt=White ferry with ramps in the up-position, moored at jetty]]
Water transport is movement by means of a [[watercraft]]—such as a [[barge]], [[boat]], [[ship]] or [[sailboat]]—over a body of water, such as a [[sea]], [[ocean]], [[lake]], [[canal]] or [[river]]. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.

In the 19th century, the first [[steam ships]] were developed, using a [[steam engine]] to drive a [[paddle wheel]] or [[propeller]] to move the ship. The [[steam]] was produced in a [[boiler]] using wood or [[coal]] and fed through a steam [[external combustion engine]]. Now most ships have an [[internal combustion engine]] using a slightly refined type of [[petroleum]] called [[bunker fuel]]. Some ships, such as [[submarine]]s, use [[nuclear power]] to produce the steam. [[Recreation]]al or [[education]]al craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use [[internal combustion engines]] to drive one or more [[propeller]]s, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, [[hovercraft]] are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. (See [[Marine propulsion]].)

Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern [[sea transport]] is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods. [[Commercial vessel]]s, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4&nbsp;billion tons of cargo in 2007.<ref>The [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) 2007, p. ''x'' and p. 32.</ref> Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental [[shipping]];<ref>Stopford, 1997: 4–6</ref> [[short sea shipping]] and [[ferry|ferries]] remain viable in coastal areas.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 8–9</ref><ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 280</ref>

===Other modes===
[[File:Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Luca Galuzzi 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] for [[crude oil]]|alt=Oil pipeline winding through cold Alaskan country-side. In the background are mountains, partly snow-capped]]
[[Pipeline transport]] sends goods through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but [[pneumatic tube]]s can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for [[sewage]], [[slurry]], [[water]] and [[beer]], while long-distance networks are used for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].

[[Cable transport]] is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by [[Wire rope|cables]] instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep [[gradient]]. Typical solutions include [[aerial tramway]], [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]] and [[ski lift]]s; some of these are also categorized as [[conveyor belt|conveyor]] transport.

[[Space transport|Spaceflight]] is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into [[outer space]] by means of a [[spacecraft]]. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments. However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System.

[[Suborbital spaceflight]] is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant \"other place\" on Earth. Faster transport could be achieved through part of a [[low Earth orbit]], or following that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it.

==Elements==

===Infrastructure===
{{Main|Infrastructure}}
[[File:GoldenGateBridge BakerBeach MC.jpg|thumb|Bridges, such as [[Golden Gate Bridge]], allow roads and railways to cross bodies of water.]]
Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the [[Airway (aviation)|airway]] and [[sea lane|seaway]] do not need to be constructed. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals.

Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits. For instance, [[airport rail link]]s connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are [[parking lot]]s, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 275–76</ref> For freight, terminals act as [[transshipment]] points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use.

The [[transport finance|financing]] of infrastructure can either be [[government|public]] or [[private enterprise|private]]. Transport is often a [[natural monopoly]] and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through [[taxation]]. New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through [[debt]]. Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as [[landing fees]] at airports, or [[toll plaza]]s on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose [[tax]]es on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.<ref>Bent Flyvbjerg, Mette K. Skamris Holm, and Søren L. Buhl, \"How (In)Accurate Are Demand Forecasts in Public Works Projects\", ''Journal of the American Planning Association'' '''71''':2, pp. 131–46.</ref>

===Vehicles===
{{Main|Vehicle}}
[[File:1992 Fiat Uno IE 1.0 Front.jpg|thumb|A [[Fiat Uno]] in 2018]]
A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a [[steam engine]], [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]], [[electric motor]], a [[jet engine]] or a [[rocket]], though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through [[wheel]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[pressure]].

Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a [[driving|driver]]. However, some systems, such as [[people mover]]s and some rapid transits, are fully [[automation|automated]]. For [[passenger]] transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver.

===Operation===
[[File:Incheon International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Incheon International Airport]], South Korea|alt=Tilted aerial view of modern airport. Aircraft are parked next to \"arms\" that extend from the central building]]
Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through [[private enterprise]] or by [[government]]s. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a [[flag carrier|national airline]] and [[railway company|national railway]]. Since the 1980s, many of these have been [[privatization|privatized]]. International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation,<ref>Stopford, 1997: 422</ref> but ports can be public-owned.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 29</ref>

===Policy===
As the population of the world increases, cities grow in size and population—according to the United Nations, 55% of the world’s population live in cities, and by 2050 this number is expected to rise to 68%.<ref>{{cite news |last=Meredith |first=Sam |date=2018-05-17 |title=Two-thirds of global population will live in cities by 2050, UN says |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/two-thirds-of-global-population-will-live-in-cities-by-2050-un-says.html |work=CNBC |access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref> Public transport policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The evolution of urban mobility: The interplay of academic and policy perspectives |last=Jones |first=Peter |date=July 2014 |journal=IATSS Research |volume=38 |pages=7–13 |doi=10.1016/j.iatssr.2014.06.001 }}</ref> The institution of policy enforces order in transport, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible. This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.

==Functions==
Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical [[military logistics|relocation]] of [[armed force]]s during [[warfare]], or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment.

===Passenger===

{{Main|Travel|Public transit}}
[[File:ACTION Bus-467.jpg|thumb|A local transit bus operated by [[ACTION]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]|alt=Light green, orange and white bus stopping in front of multi-story building.]]
Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into [[public transport|public]] and [[private transport]]. Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact. Travel may be as part of daily [[commuting]], for [[business travel|business]], leisure or [[human migration|migration]].

Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of [[bus]]es in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and [[rapid transit]] in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]] and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. [[Intermodal passenger transport]] is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a [[transport hub]], such as a [[bus station|bus]] or [[railway station]].

Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum. Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is [[demand-responsive transport]], offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable.

[[International travel]] may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and [[visa (document)|visa]] requirements.

===Medical===
[[File:World War I ambulance Pittsburgh 20th Century Club.png|thumb|An ambulance from World War I]]An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment,<ref>[[Henry Alan Skinner|Skinner, Henry Alan]]. 1949, \"The Origin of Medical Terms\". Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins</ref> and in some instances will also provide out-of-hospital medical care to the patient. The word is often associated with road-going \"emergency ambulances\", which form part of [[emergency medical service]]s, administering [[emergency medicine|emergency care]] to those with acute medical problems.

''Air medical services'' is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transport to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes. Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations, aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft.<ref name=\"pmid15928284\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Branas CC, MacKenzie EJ, Williams JC, Schwab CW, Teter HM, Flanigan MC | title=Access to trauma centers in the United States. | journal=JAMA | year= 2005 | volume= 293 | issue= 21 | pages= 2626–33 | pmid=15928284 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.21.2626 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=15928284  |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid7832345\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Burney RE, Hubert D, Passini L, Maio R | title=Variation in air medical outcomes by crew composition: a two-year follow-up. | journal=Ann Emerg Med | year= 1995 | volume= 25 | issue= 2 | pages= 187–92 | pmid=7832345 | doi= 10.1016/s0196-0644(95)70322-5|doi-access=free| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=7832345  }}</ref>

===Freight===
{{Main|Shipping}}

Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the [[value chain]] in manufacturing.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 3</ref> With increased specialization and [[globalization]], production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 63–64</ref> Transport creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption. While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 54</ref> [[Logistics]] refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 4</ref> [[Incoterm]] deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of [[risk]] during transport.<ref>Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 473</ref>

[[File:WCML freight train.jpg|thumb|[[Freight train]] with [[shipping container]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]]]
[[Containerization]], with the standardization of [[ISO container]]s on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized [[International trade|international]] and [[domestic trade]], offering a huge reduction in [[transshipment]] costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in [[economy of scale]] in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s.<ref name=bcn21114 />

[[Bulk material handling|Bulk transport]] is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are [[ore]], coal, [[cereals]] and [[petroleum]]. Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.

[[Cargo airline|Air freight]] has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as [[postponement]] and [[just in time (business)|just-in-time]] within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio.<ref>Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 328</ref> In addition to mail, common items sent by air include [[electronics]] and [[fashion]] clothing.

==Impact==
{{Main|Sustainable transport}}

===Economic===
{{Main|Transport economics}}
[[File:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in [[Seattle, Washington]], United States.|alt=Skyline of city at dawn. A major highway winds itself into the downtown area.]]

Transport is a key necessity for [[Departmentalization|specialization]]—allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations.  Throughout history, transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more [[trade]] and a greater spread of people. [[Economic growth]] has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 2</ref> But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making [[transport sustainability]] a major issue.

Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of [[tourism]], a major part of [[recreation]]al transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed.

===Planning===
{{Main|Transport planning}}

Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of [[transport forecasting]], planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the [[supply chain]]. Transport as a field is also studied through [[transport economics]], a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. [[Transport engineering]], a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]], must take into account [[trip generation]], [[trip distribution]], [[mode choice]] and [[route assignment]], while the operative level is handled through [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]].

[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving.|alt=Aerial view of roundabout, a junction of several streets. Vehicles traverse around the roundabout, which is surrounded by buildings, mostly multi-storey]]
Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a [[tragedy of the commons]], where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. [[land use|Density of development]] depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization. Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There are [[economies of agglomeration]]. Beyond transport, some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transport facilities consume land, and in cities pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.

Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput mean that in many cities there is too much traffic and many—if not all—of the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places; as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on—spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociology and economics—the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned.

{{Main|Environmental impact of transport}}

Transport is a major use of [[energy (society)|energy]] and burns most of the world's [[petroleum]]. This creates air pollution, including [[nitrous oxide]]s and [[particulate]]s, and is a significant contributor to [[global warming]] through emission of [[carbon dioxide]],<ref name = \"pnas_pdf\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0702958104v1.pdf |title=Climate forcing from the transport sectors |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=454–458 |author=Fuglestvet |display-authors=etal|publisher= [[Center for International Climate and Environmental Research]] |year=2007|bibcode=2008PNAS..105..454F |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702958104 |pmid=18180450 |pmc=2206557 }}</ref> for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5579 |title=Analysis: Nano Hypocrisy? |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=16 January 2008 |access-date=17 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013141752/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5579 |archive-date=13 October 2013 |url-status=dead |author-link=Worldwatch Institute }}</ref> By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jan Fuglestvedt |display-authors=etal |title=Climate forcing from the transport sectors |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=454–458 |date=Jan 15, 2008 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702958104 |pmid=18180450 |pmc=2206557 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/105/2/454.full.pdf|bibcode=2008PNAS..105..454F }}</ref> [[Environmental regulation]]s in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle.<ref name=\"pnas_pdf\" /> Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-pathways-analysis-informing-development-of-a-carbon-reduction-strategy-for-the-transport-sector.html |title=Claverton-Energy.com |publisher=Claverton-Energy.com |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref><ref>Data on the barriers and motivators to more sustainable transport behaviour is available in the UK Department for Transport study \"[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/scienceresearch/social/climatechangetransportchoices/ Climate Change and Transport Choices] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530124709/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/scienceresearch/social/climatechangetransportchoices/ |date=2011-05-30 }}\" published in December 2010.</ref> Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, as well as increased [[transport electrification]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

Other environmental impacts of transport systems include [[traffic congestion]] and automobile-oriented [[urban sprawl]], which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands. By reducing transport emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's [[air quality]], [[acid rain]], [[smog]] and climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Transportation-WS800CCAF9-1_En.htm |title=Transportation |author=Environment Canada |accessdate=30 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713192836/http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Transportation-WS800CCAF9-1_En.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2007 |author-link=Environment Canada }}</ref>

'''Fountain County''' lies in the western part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]] on the east side of the [[Wabash River]].  The [[county (United States)|county]] was officially established in 1826 and was the 53rd in Indiana.

==History==
The state of Indiana was established in 1816. The first non-indigenous settler in the future Fountain County is thought to have been a Mr.&nbsp;Forbes, who arrived here in early 1823 and was soon followed by others.<ref>Clifton 1913, p. 47.</ref> The legislative act creating Fountain County was passed on December 30, 1825, setting an effective date of April 1, 1826. The county's boundaries have remained unchanged since that time.<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 57–59.</ref> It was named for Major [[James Fontaine]] of [[Kentucky]] who was killed at [[Harmar's Defeat]] (near modern [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]) on October 22, 1790, during the [[Northwest Indian War]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|publisher=US Government Printing Office|author=Gannett, Henry|year=1905|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n119 130]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Goodrich|first1=De Witt Clinton|last2=Tuttle|first2=Charles Richard|publisher=Richard S.

The first Fountain County courthouse was a two-story frame building constructed in Covington in 1827; Abraham Griffith submitted the winning bid of $335.{{#tag:ref|A $335 capital expense in 1827 would be roughly equivalent to $200,000 in 2009.<ref name=\"Williamson\">Williamson, Samuel H. (April 2010).  ''Seven Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount, 1774 to present''. [http://www.measuringworth.com MeasuringWorth].</ref>|group=\"n\"}} In 1829, plans were made for a larger courhouse building, but then an act of the legislature called for the county seat to be moved. In the end it was decided that the county seat should remain in Covington, and the brick courthouse was completed in 1833. A third courthouse was commissioned in 1856, and was completed in 1857 at a cost of $33,500.{{#tag:ref|A $33,500 capital expense in 1857 would be roughly equivalent to $10,900,000 in 2009.<ref name=\"Williamson\" />|group=\"n\"}} The circuit court met for the first time in the new building in January 1860, and the building was largely destroyed by fire the same day. [[Isaac Hodgson (architect)|Isaac Hodgson]] was the architect for the rebuilt courthouse, which was first occupied in January 1861; the total cost, including the reconstruction, totaled $54,624.05.{{#tag:ref|A $54,624 capital expense in 1861 would be roughly equivalent to $17,600,000 in 2009.<ref name=\"Williamson\" />|group=\"n\"}}<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 64–67.</ref> The current courthouse was built in 1936–37 at a cost of $246,734;{{#tag:ref|A $246,734 capital expense in 1936 would be roughly equivalent to $17,300,000 in 2009.<ref name=\"Williamson\" />|group=\"n\"}} it replaced the previous building which had been declared unsafe. The 1937 building was constructed by the Jacobson Brothers of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]; the architects were Louis R. Johnson and Walter Scholar of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]]. The courthouse walls display murals painted by [[Eugene Francis Savage (painter)|Eugene Francis Savage]] and others from 1937 to 1940, covering {{convert|2500|sqft|m2|0}} of wall space and depicting the settlement of western Indiana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Counts|first=Will|author2=Jon Dilts|title=The 92 Magnificent Indiana Courthouses|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1991|location=Bloomington IN|isbn=978-0-253-33638-5|pages=52, 53}}</ref>

Digging on the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]] began in 1832 and worked southwest; it reached Lafayette by 1842. In 1846 it reached Covington, and by 1847 traffic was moving through the county via the canal. Completion of the county's first railroad line in the 1850s heralded an end to the canal's usefulness, and in 1875 the last canal boat passed through Covington.<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 130–131.</ref>

The first railway line through the county was the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway (later the [[Wabash Railroad]]) which was built from the east across the northern part of the county and reached Attica in 1856; it continued west through Warren County and reached the Illinois state line the following year. The Indianapolis, Crawfordsville and Danville Railroad (later the [[Indiana, Bloomington and Western Railway]]), was started in 1855, but the general state of the economy halted construction in 1858. It was completed by another owner in 1870, and traffic started in 1871. It passed through Covington, Veedersburg and Hillsboro.<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 131–132.</ref>

Fountain County's northern and western borders are defined by the [[Wabash River]] which flows out of [[Tippecanoe County, Indiana|Tippecanoe County]] to the northeast.

According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of {{convert|397.88|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|395.66|sqmi}} (or 99.44%) is land and {{convert|2.22|sqmi}} (or 0.56%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/> Elevations range from {{convert|770|ft}} above sea level in the northeastern part of the county to {{convert|465|ft}} in the southwest where the Wabash River leaves the county. The county is within the drainage basin of the Wabash River, sloping to the southwest. It is covered with [[loess]] ranging in thickness from a few inches to more than {{convert|7|ft}}.  Approximately 84 percent of the county's land is use for agriculture.<ref>{{cite report|title=Soil Survey of Fountain County IN|url=http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/Manuscripts/IN045/0/Fountain_IN.pdf|author=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s Natural Resources Conservation Service|year=2003|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=February 14, 2011|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009032141/http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/Manuscripts/IN045/0/Fountain_IN.pdf|archivedate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>

The [[Portland Arch Nature Preserve]] and the Miller-Campbell Memorial Tract, a {{convert|435|acre|adj=on}} preserve managed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, are located adjacent to the Wabash River.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/dnr/naturepreserve/files/np-Portland_Arch022609.pdf|title=Portland Arch Nature Preserve and the Miller-Campbell Memorial Tract|publisher=Indiana Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=January 2, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119052841/http://www.in.gov/dnr/naturepreserve/files/np-Portland_Arch022609.pdf|archivedate=November 19, 2011}}</ref>

'''Fountain County''' lies in the western part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]] on the east side of the [[Wabash River]].

==History==
The state of Indiana was established in 1816. The first non-indigenous settler in the future Fountain County is thought to have been a Mr.&nbsp;Forbes, who arrived here in early 1823 and was soon followed by others.<ref>Clifton 1913, p. 47.</ref> The legislative act creating Fountain County was passed on December 30, 1825, setting an effective date of April 1, 1826. The county's boundaries have remained unchanged since that time.<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 57–59.</ref> It was named for Major [[James Fontaine]] of [[Kentucky]] who was killed at [[Harmar's Defeat]] (near modern [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]) on October 22, 1790, during the [[Northwest Indian War]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|publisher=US Government Printing Office|author=Gannett, Henry|year=1905|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n119 130]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Goodrich|first1=De Witt Clinton|last2=Tuttle|first2=Charles Richard|publisher=Richard S.

The first Fountain County courthouse was a two-story frame building constructed in Covington in 1827; Abraham Griffith submitted the winning bid of $335.{{#tag:ref|A $335 capital expense in 1827 would be roughly equivalent to $200,000 in 2009.<ref name=\"Williamson\">Williamson, Samuel H. (April 2010).  ''Seven Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount, 1774 to present''. [http://www.measuringworth.com MeasuringWorth].</ref>|group=\"n\"}} In 1829, plans were made for a larger courhouse building, but then an act of the legislature called for the county seat to be moved. In the end it was decided that the county seat should remain in Covington, and the brick courthouse was completed in 1833. A third courthouse was commissioned in 1856, and was completed in 1857 at a cost of $33,500.{{#tag:ref|A $33,500 capital expense in 1857 would be roughly equivalent to $10,900,000 in 2009.<ref name=\"Williamson\" />|group=\"n\"}} The circuit court met for the first time in the new building in January 1860, and the building was largely destroyed by fire the same day. [[Isaac Hodgson (architect)|Isaac Hodgson]] was the architect for the rebuilt courthouse, which was first occupied in January 1861; the total cost, including the reconstruction, totaled $54,624.05.{{#tag:ref|A $54,624 capital expense in 1861 would be roughly equivalent to $17,600,000 in 2009.<ref name=\"Williamson\" />|group=\"n\"}}<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 64–67.</ref> The current courthouse was built in 1936–37 at a cost of $246,734;{{#tag:ref|A $246,734 capital expense in 1936 would be roughly equivalent to $17,300,000 in 2009.<ref name=\"Williamson\" />|group=\"n\"}} it replaced the previous building which had been declared unsafe. The 1937 building was constructed by the Jacobson Brothers of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]; the architects were Louis R. Johnson and Walter Scholar of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]]. The courthouse walls display murals painted by [[Eugene Francis Savage (painter)|Eugene Francis Savage]] and others from 1937 to 1940, covering {{convert|2500|sqft|m2|0}} of wall space and depicting the settlement of western Indiana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Counts|first=Will|author2=Jon Dilts|title=The 92 Magnificent Indiana Courthouses|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1991|location=Bloomington IN|isbn=978-0-253-33638-5|pages=52, 53}}</ref>

Digging on the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]] began in 1832 and worked southwest; it reached Lafayette by 1842. In 1846 it reached Covington, and by 1847 traffic was moving through the county via the canal. Completion of the county's first railroad line in the 1850s heralded an end to the canal's usefulness, and in 1875 the last canal boat passed through Covington.<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 130–131.</ref>

The first railway line through the county was the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway (later the [[Wabash Railroad]]) which was built from the east across the northern part of the county and reached Attica in 1856; it continued west through Warren County and reached the Illinois state line the following year. The Indianapolis, Crawfordsville and Danville Railroad (later the [[Indiana, Bloomington and Western Railway]]), was started in 1855, but the general state of the economy halted construction in 1858. It was completed by another owner in 1870, and traffic started in 1871. It passed through Covington, Veedersburg and Hillsboro.<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 131–132.</ref>

Fountain County's northern and western borders are defined by the [[Wabash River]] which flows out of [[Tippecanoe County, Indiana|Tippecanoe County]] to the northeast.

According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of {{convert|397.88|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|395.66|sqmi}} (or 99.44%) is land and {{convert|2.22|sqmi}} (or 0.56%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/> Elevations range from {{convert|770|ft}} above sea level in the northeastern part of the county to {{convert|465|ft}} in the southwest where the Wabash River leaves the county. The county is within the drainage basin of the Wabash River, sloping to the southwest. It is covered with [[loess]] ranging in thickness from a few inches to more than {{convert|7|ft}}.  Approximately 84 percent of the county's land is use for agriculture.<ref>{{cite report|title=Soil Survey of Fountain County IN|url=http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/Manuscripts/IN045/0/Fountain_IN.pdf|author=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s Natural Resources Conservation Service|year=2003|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=February 14, 2011|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009032141/http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/Manuscripts/IN045/0/Fountain_IN.pdf|archivedate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>

The council members serve four-year terms and are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes and service taxes.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=September 16, 2008|publisher=Government of Indiana}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title=Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=September 16, 2008|format=PDF|publisher=Government of Indiana}}</ref>  In 2010, the county budgeted approximately $9.8&nbsp;million for the district's schools and $3.2&nbsp;million for other county operations and services, for a total annual budget of approximately $13&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|author=State of Indiana Department of Local Government Finance|title=2010 Budget Order (Fountain County IN)|url=http://in.gov/dlgf/files/BudgetOrder_2010_FountainCounty.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:BradyTreatiseOfCitiesTitlePage.PNG|thumb|right|240px|An early historical analysis of cities and boroughs by [[Robert Brady (writer)|Robert Brady]] (1704)]]
[[File:SaxonWallsWarehamDorset.jpg|thumb|The burh wall at Wareham]]
The '''ancient boroughs''' were a historic unit of lower-tier local government in [[England and Wales]]. The ancient [[borough]]s covered only important towns and were established by charters granted at different times by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]]. Their history is largely concerned with the origin of such towns and how they gained the right of [[Self-governance|self-government]]. Ancient boroughs were reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which introduced directly elected corporations and allowed the incorporation of new industrial towns. Municipal boroughs ceased to be used for the purposes of local government in 1974, with [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] retained as an honorific title granted by [[the Crown]].

==Anglo-Saxon burhs==
{{main|burh}}
Throughout western Europe, the effect of the [[Migration Period|Germanic invasions]] which completed the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] was to destroy the [[Western Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Local government|municipal organisation]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} After the [[Anglo-Saxon conquest of England|Anglo-Saxon]] settlement of Britain, the ruins of Roman colonies and camps were used by the early English to form tribal strongholds.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|pp=268–269}} Despite their location, [[burh]]s on the sites of [[Roman Britain|Roman colonies]] show no continuity with Roman municipal organisation,{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}  and instead resemble the parallel revival of urban centres in continental Europe.{{sfn|Tait|1936|p={{page needed|date=December 2016}} }} The resettlement of the Roman Durovernum under the name \"burh of the men of Kent,\" ''Cant-wara-byrig''  or [[Canterbury]], illustrates this point. The burh of the men of West Kent was Hrofesceaster (Durobrivae), [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], and many other ceasters mark the existence of a Roman camp occupied by an early English burh. The tribal burh was protected by an earthen wall, and a general obligation to build and maintain burhs at the royal command was enforced by [[Anglo-Saxon law]].{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

Offences in disturbance of the peace of the burh were punished by higher fines than breaches of the peace of the ''hām'' or ordinary dwelling. However, neither in the early English language nor in the contemporary Latin was there any fixed usage differentiating the various words descriptive of the several forms of human settlement, and the fortified communal refuges cannot accordingly be clearly distinguished from villages or the strongholds of individuals by any purely nomenclative test.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

===Danish invasions===
At the end of the 9th century and beginning of the 10th century there is evidence of a systematic \"[[fortification|timbering]]\" of new burhs, with the object of providing strongholds for the defence of [[Wessex]] against the Danes, and it appears that the surrounding districts were charged with their maintenance. It is not until after the Danish invasions that it becomes easier to draw a distinction between the burhs that served as military strongholds for national defence and the [[royal vill]]s which served no such purpose. Some of the royal [[vill]]s eventually entered the class of boroughs, but by another route, and for the present the private stronghold and the royal dwelling may be neglected. It was the public stronghold and the administrative centre of a dependent district which was the source of the main features peculiar to the borough. Many causes tended to create peculiar conditions in the boroughs built for national defence. They were placed where artificial defence was most needed, at the junction of roads, in the plains, on the rivers, at the centres naturally marked out for trade, seldom where hills or marshes formed a sufficient natural defence.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}} Typically, the fortification of a burh consisted of earth [[defensive wall|ramparts]] faced with timber. [[Palisade]]s were sometimes used.

The concept of a network of burhs as a [[defence in depth]] is usually attributed to [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]].

{{quote|
The solution that Alfred devised for this apparently intractable predicament was nothing short of a revolution and that revolution began now in the 880s. If the Vikings could attack anywhere at any time, then the West Saxons had to be able to defend everywhere all the time. To make this possible Alfred ordered the construction of a network of defended centres across his kingdom, some built on refortified Roman and Iron Age sites, some built completely from scratch. These burhs were to be distributed so that no West Saxon was more than twenty or so miles – a day's march – from one of them.{{sfn|Pollard|2005|page={{page needed|date=December 2016}}}}
}}

This network is described in a manuscript document which has survived in later iterations, named by scholars the [[Burghal Hidage]], which lists thirty three burhs in Wessex and English Mercia. Most of these survived into the post [[Norman Conquest]] era and are the core of later [[Parliamentary Borough]]s and municipal corporations.

===Commercial significance===
Following the successful reconquest from the Vikings by Alfred's descendants Edward and [[Æthelstan]], the latter made a series of reforms in law, the Codes issued at the Council of Grately, which gave additional impetus to the urban development of the burhs which hitherto had been mainly forts.{{citation needed|date=December 2016|reason=It may well be in EB1911 but it is not a direct copy so needs verification}} The burhs drew commerce by every channel; the camp and the palace, the administrative centre, the ecclesiastical centre (for the mother-church of the state was placed in its chief burh), all looked to the market for their maintenance. The burh was provided by law with a mint and royal moneyers and exchangers, with an authorised scale for weights and measures. Mercantile transactions in the burhs or ports, as they were called when their commercial rather than their military importance was accentuated, were placed by law under special legal privileges in order no doubt to secure the king's hold upon his toll. Over the burh or port was set a reeve, a royal officer answerable to the king for his dues from the burh, his rents for lands and houses, his customs on commerce, his share of the profits from judicial fines.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

===Legal and administrative roles===
[[File:Edgar.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Edgar, King of England 959 to 975]]
At least from the 10th century the burh had a [[Moot hall|moot]] or court, the relation of which to the other courts is matter of speculation. A law of [[Edgar of England|Edgar]], about 960, required that it should meet three times a year, these being in all likelihood assemblies at which attendance was compulsory on all tenants of the burghal district, when pleas concerning life and liberty and land were held, and men were compelled to find pledges answerable for their good conduct. At these great meetings the borough [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] (''gerefa'') presided, declaring the law and guiding the judgments given by the suitors of the court. The reeve was supported by a group of assistants, called in Devon the ''[[Witenagemot|witan]]'', in the boroughs of the [[Danelaw]] by a group of (generally twelve) \" lawmen,\" in other towns probably by a group of aldermen, senior burgesses, with military and police authority, whose office was in some cases hereditary. These persons assisted the reeve at the great meetings of the full court, and sat with him as judges at the subordinate meetings which were held to settle the unfinished cases and minor causes. There was no compulsion on those not specially summoned to attend these extra meetings. At these subordinate jurisdictional assemblies, held in public, and acting by the same authority as the annual gathering of all the burh-wara, other business concerning borough administration was decided, at least in later days, and it is to these assemblies that the origin of the [[town council]] may in many cases be ascribed.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

In the larger towns the division into [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]], with a separate police system, can be traced at an early time, appearing as a unit of military organisation, answerable for the defence of a gate of the town. The police system of London is described in detail in a record of 930–940. Here the free people were grouped in associations of ten, each under the superintendence of a headman. The bishops and reeves who belonged to the \"court of London\" appear as the directors of the system, and in them we may see the aldermen of the wards of a later time. The use of the word ''bertha'' for ward at Canterbury, and the fact that the London ''wardmoot'' at a later time was used for the [[frankpledge]] system as well as for the organisation of the muster, point to a connexion between the military and the police systems in the towns.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

In charters of the Anglo-Saxon period a ''haw'', or enclosed area within a burh, was often conveyed by charter as if it were an apanage of the lands in the neighbourhood with which it was conveyed; the Norman settlers who succeeded to lands in the county succeeded therewith to houses in the burhs, for a close association existed between the [[thegns]] of the shire and the ''shirestow'', an association partly perhaps of duty and also of privilege. The king granted borough haws as places of refuge in Kent, and in London he gave them with commercial privileges to his bishops. What has been called the heterogeneous tenure of the shirestow, one of the most conspicuous characteristics of that particular type of borough, was further increased by the liberty which some burgesses enjoyed to \"commend\" themselves to a lord of their own choosing, promising to that lord suit and service and perhaps rent in return for protection. Over these burgesses the lords could claim jurisdictional rights, and these were in some cases increased by royal grants of special rights within certain [[Soke (legal)|sokes]]. The great boroughs were honeycombed with sokes, or areas of seignorial jurisdiction, within which the royal reeve's authority was greatly restricted while that of the lord's reeve took precedence. Even the haws, being \"burhs\" or strongholds within a stronghold, enjoyed a local \"peace\" which protected from official intrusion.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

Besides heterogeneity of tenure and jurisdiction in the borough, there was also heterogeneity of status; there were burh-thegns and [[Knight|cnihts]], mercatores, burgesses of various kinds, the three groups representing perhaps military, commercial and agricultural elements. The burh generally shows signs of having been originally a village settlement, surrounded by open fields, of which the borough boundary before 1835 will suggest the outline. This area was as a rule eventually the area of borough jurisdiction. There is some evidence pointing to the fact that the restriction of the borough authority to this area is not ancient, but due to the Norman settlement.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

==Boroughs in Norman England==
The wide districts over which the boroughs had had authority were placed under the control of the [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] castle which was itself built by means of the old English levy of ''burhwork''. The borough court was allowed to continue its work only within its own immediate territory, and, to prevent conflict, the castle was placed outside the borough. Losing their place in the national scheme of defence, the burgess ''cnihts'' made commerce their principal object under the encouragement of the old privileges of the walled place. Besides the great co-operative strongholds in which many lords had burgesses, there were small boroughs held by a single lord. In many cases boroughs of this \"seignorial\" type were created upon the royal estates. Out of the king's vill, as a rule the jurisdictional centre of a [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]], there was sometimes created a borough. The lines of division before Domesday Book are obscure, but it is probable that in some cases, by a royal grant of jurisdiction, the inhabitants of a populous royal vill, where a hundred court for the district was already held, were authorised to establish a permanent court, for the settlement of their disputes, distinct from the hundred court of the district. Boroughs of this type with a uniform tenure were created not only on the king's estates but also on those of his tenants-in-chief, and in 1086 they were probably already numerous.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

===Town and manor===
As noted by Stenton, the practice evident in the Norman period whereby [[Lord of the Manor|lords]] living in country [[Manor house|manors]] owned houses in the nearest borough was a continuation of a custom developed earlier by the Anglo-Saxons:
{{quote|
It is clear from the [[Domesday Book]] that in 1086 a piece of borough property – a [[messuage]], a house, or a group of houses – was often annexed to a manor in the open country. At [[Leicester]], for example, 134 houses were thus attached, singly or in groups, to 27 different manors. So far as can be seen the borough property was treated as a profit-yielding appendage of the manor. It provided the lord with a lodging when he came to the borough on business and with a place of refuge in time of trouble.... Most of the evidence which illustrates this practice relates to the time after the conquest, but it can be traced far back into the Anglo-Saxon period, and the Anglo-Saxon kings had encouraged it.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p={{page needed|date=December 2016}} }}
}}

===Privileges granted to boroughs to encourage settlement near castles===
A borough was usually, though perhaps not invariably, the companion of a Norman castle. In some cases a French ''bourg'' was created by the side of an English borough, and the two remained for many generations distinct in their laws and customs: in other cases a French ''bourg'' was settled by the side of an English village. A large number of the followers of the Norman lords had been almost certainly town-dwellers in their own  country, and lost none of their burghal privileges by the migration. Every castle needed for its maintenance a group of skilled artisans, and the lords wished to draw to the castle gates all kinds of commodities for the castle's provision. The strength of the garrison made the neighbourhood of the castle a place of danger to men unprotected by legal privilege; and to invite to its neighbourhood desirable settlers, legal privileges similar to those enjoyed in Norman or English boroughs were guaranteed to those who would build on the plots which were offered to colonists. A low fixed rental, release from the renders required of villeins, release from the jurisdiction of the castle, and the creation of a separate borough jurisdiction, with or without the right to choose their own officers, rules fixing the maximum of fees and fines, or promising  assessment of the fines by the burgesses themselves, the cancelling of all the castellan's rights, especially the right to take a forced levy of food for the castle from all within the area of his jurisdiction, freedom from arbitrary tallage, freedom of movement, the right to alienate property and devise land, these and many other privileges named in the early seignorial charters were what constituted the Norman liber burgus of the seignorial type.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=270}}

Not all these privileges were enjoyed by all boroughs; some very meagre releases of seignorial rights accompanied the lord's charter which created a borough and made burgesses out of villeins. However liberal the grant, the lord or his reeve still remained in close personal relation with the burgesses of such places, and this character, together with the uniformity of their tenure, continued to hold them apart from the boroughs of the old English type, where all varieties of personal relationship between the lords and their groups of tenants might subsist. The royal charters granting the right to retain old customs prevented the systematic introduction into the old boroughs of some of the incidents of feudalism. Rights of the king took precedence of those of the lord, and devise with the king's consent was legal. By these means the lords' position was weakened, and other seignorial claims were later evaded or contested. The rights which the lords failed to keep were divided between the king and the municipality; in London, for instance, the king obtained all escheats, while the borough court secured the right of wardship of burgess orphans. From Norman times the yearly profit of the royal boroughs was as a rule included in the general \"farm\" rendered for the county by the sheriff; sometimes it was rendered by a royal farmer apart from the county-farm. The king generally accepted a composition for all the various items due from the borough. The burgesses were united in their efforts to keep that composition unchanged in amount, and to secure the provision of the right amount at the right time for fear that it should be increased by way of punishment.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=270}}

===Charters===
The levy of fines on rent arrear, and the distraints for debt due, which were obtained through the borough court, were a matter of interest to the burgesses of the court, and first taught the burgesses co-operative action. Money was raised, possibly by order of the borough court, to buy a charter from the king giving the right to choose officers who should answer directly to the exchequer and not through the sheriff of the county. The sheriff was in many cases also the constable of the castle, set by the Normans to overawe the English boroughs; his powers were great and dangerous enough to make him an officer specially obnoxious to the boroughs. [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] about 1131 gave the London citizens the right to choose their own sheriffs and a justiciar answerable for keeping the pleas of the crown. In 1130 the Lincoln citizens paid to hold their city in chief of the king. By the end of the 12th century many towns paid by the hand of their own reeves, and [[King John of England|John]]'s charters began to make rules as to the freedom of choice to be allowed in the nomination of borough officers and as to the royal power of dismissal.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=270}}

In [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]'s reign London imitated the French communes in styling the chief officer a mayor; in 1208 Winchester also had a mayor, and the title soon became no rarity. The chartered right to choose two or more citizens to keep the pleas of the crown gave to many boroughs the control of their coroners, who occupied the position of the London justiciar of earlier days, subject to those considerable modifications which [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s systematisation of the criminal law had introduced. Burgesses who had gone for criminal and civil justice to their own court in disputes between themselves, or between themselves and strangers who were in their town, secured confirmation of this right by charter, not to exclude the justices in eyre, but to exempt themselves from the necessity of pleading in a distant court. The burgess, whether plaintiff or defendant, was a privileged person, and could claim in this respect a \"benefit\" somewhat similar to the benefit of clergy. In permitting the boroughs to answer through their own officers for his dues, the king handed over to the boroughs the farming of his rents and a large number of rights which would eventually prove to be sources of great profit. No records exist showing the nature of municipal proceedings at the time of the first purchase of charters. Certain it is that the communities in the 12th century became alive to the possibilities of their new position, that trade received a new impulse, and the vague constitutional powers of the borough court acquired a new need for definition. At first the selection of officers who were to treat with the exchequer and to keep the royal pleas was almost certainly restricted to a few rich persons who could find the necessary securities. Nominated probably in one of the smaller judicial assemblies, the choice was announced at the great [[Michaelmas]] assembly of the whole community, and it is not till the next century that we hear of any attempt of the ''vulgus'' to make a different selection from that of the magnates. The ''vulgus'' were able to take effective action by means of the several craft organisations, and first found the necessity to do so when taxation was heavy or when questions of trade legislation were mooted.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=270}}

===Taxation leads to political reformation===
The taxation of the boroughs in the reign of Henry II was assessed by the king's justices, who fixed the sums due per capita; but if the borough made an offer of a gift, the assessment was made by the burgesses. In the first case the taxation fell on the magnates. In the levy per communam the assessment was made through the wardmoots (in London) and the burden fell on the poorer class. In Henry II's reign London was taxed by both methods, the barones majores by head, the barones minores through the wardmoot.  The pressure of taxation led in the 13th century to a closer definition of the burghal constitutions; the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]] sought to get an audit of accounts, and (in London) not only to hear but to treat of municipal affairs. By the end of the century London had definitely established two councils, that of the mayor and aldermen, representing the old borough court, and a common council, representing the voice of the commonalty, as expressed through the city wards. The choice of councillors in the wards rested probably with the aldermen and the ward jury summoned by them to make the presentments. In some cases juries were summoned not to represent different areas but different classes; thus at Lincoln there were in 1272 juries of the rich, the middling and the poor, chosen presumably by authority from groups divided by means of the tax roll. Elsewhere the several groups of traders and artisans made of their gilds all-powerful agencies for organising joint action among classes of commons united by a trade interest, and the history of the towns becomes the history of the struggle between the gilds which captured control of the council and the gilds which were excluded therefrom.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|pp=270–271}}

Many municipal revolutions took place, and a large number of constitutional experiments were tried all over the country from the 13th century onward. Schemes which directed a gradual co-optation, two to choose four, these six to choose more, and so in widening circles from a centre of officialdom, found much favour throughout the Middle Ages. A plan, like the London plan, of two companies, alderman and council, was widely favoured in the 14th century, perhaps in imitation of the Houses of [[House of Lords|Lords]] and [[House of Commons of England|Commons]]. The mayor was sometimes styled the \"sovereign\" and was given many prerogatives. Great respect was paid to the \"ancients,\" those, namely, who had already held municipal office. Not till the 15th century were orderly arrangements for counting \"voices\" arrived at in a few of the most highly developed towns, and these were used only in the small assemblies of the governingbody, not in the large electoral assemblies of the people. In London in the 13th century there was aregular system for the admission of new members to the borough \"franchise,\" which was at first regarded not as conferring any form of suffrage but as a means to secure a privileged position in the borough court and in the trade of the borough. Admission could be obtained by inheritance, by purchase or gift, in some places by marriage, and in London, at least from 1275, by a municipal register of apprenticeship. The new freeman in return for his privileges was bound to share with the other burgesses all the burdens of taxation, control, &c., which fell upon burgesses. Personal service was not always necessary, and in some towns there were many non- resident burgesses. When in later times admission to this freedom came to be used as means to secure the parliamentary franchise, the freedom of the borough was freely sold and given.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}}

The elections in which the commons of the boroughs first took interest were those of the borough magistrates. Where the commons succeeded for a time in asserting their right to take part in borough elections they were rarely able to keep it, not in all cases perhaps because their power was feared, but sometimes because of the riotous proceedings which ensued. These led to government interference, which no party in the borough desired. The possibility of a forfeiture of their enfranchised position made the burgesses on the whole fairly submissive. In the 13th century London repeatedly was \"taken into the king's hand,\" subjected to heavy fines and put under the constable of the Tower.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}}

==Charters of incorporation==
In the 15th century disturbances in the boroughs led to the creation of new constitutions, some of which were the outcome of royal charters, others the result of parliamentary legislation. The development of the law of corporations also at this time compelled the boroughs to seek new charters which should satisfy the now exacting demands of the law. The charters of incorporation were issued at a time when the king's government was looking more and more to the borough authorities as part of its executive and judicial staff, and thus the government was closely interested in the manner of their selection. The new charters were drafted in such a way as to narrow the popular control.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}} The boroughs were placed under the control of a corporation headed by a mayor, and in most cases leading to no concept of popular control, the whole system of appointment to the corporation being one of [[co-option]] by existing members.{{citation needed|date=December 2016|reason=This is a change in this sentence from \"The corporations were placed under a council and in a number of cases popular control was excluded altogether, the whole system being made one of co-optation.\" This change is not supported with a source}} Absence of popular protest to this may in part be due to old popular control being more nominal than real, and the new charters gave as a rule two councils of considerable size. These councils bore a heavy burden of taxation in meeting royal loans and benevolences, paying per capita, like the magnates of the 12th century, and for a time there is on the whole little evidence of friction between the governors and the governed. Throughout, unpopular changes or neglect in the closest of corporations had a means of official protest, though no means of execution, in the presentments of the leet juries and sessions juries. By means of their \"verdicts\" they could use threats against the governing body, express their resentment against acts of the council which benefited the governing body rather than the town, and call in the aid of the justices of the [[assizes]] (judges, in the seasons of sittings outside of London, \"assizes\") where the members of the governing body were suspected of fraud.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}}

Elizabeth repeatedly declared her dislike of incorporations \"because of the abuses committed by their head rulers,\" but in her reign they were fairly easily controlled by the [[Privy Council of England|privy council]], which directed their choice of members of parliament and secured supporters of the government policy to fill vacancies on the borough bench. The practice in [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] charters of specifying by name the members of the governing body and holders of special offices opened the way to a \"purging\" of the hostile spirits when new charters were required. There were also rather vaguely worded clauses authorising the dismissal of officers for misconduct, although as a rule the appointments were for life. When under the Stuarts and under the Commonwealth political and religious feeling ran high in the boroughs, use was made of these clauses both by the majority on the council and by the central government to mould the character of the council by a drastic \"purging\". Another means of control first used under the Commonwealth was afforded by the various acts of parliament, which subjected all holders of municipal office to the test of an oath. Under the Commonwealth there was no improvement in the methods used by the central government to control the boroughs.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}}

All opponents of the ruling policy were disfranchised and disqualified from office by act of parliament in 1652. Cases arising out of the act were to be tried by commissioners, and the commissions of the major-generals gave them opportunity to control the borough policy. Few Commonwealth charters have been preserved, although several were issued in response to the requests of the corporations. In some cases the charters used words which appeared to point to an opportunity for popular elections in boroughs, where a usage of election to the corporation by the town council had been established. In 1598 the judges gave an opinion that the town councils could make [[by-law]]s determining the government of the towns regardless of the terms of the charter. In the 18th century the judges decided to the contrary. But even where a usage of popular election was established, there were means of controlling the result of a parliamentary election. The close corporations, though their right to choose a member of parliament might be doubtful, had the sole right to admit new burgesses, and whether in parliamentary elections to enfranchise non-residents. Where conflicts arose over the choice of a member of parliament, two competing selections were typically made and the matter came before the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]. The Commons quite often decided in favour of the more popularly elected candidate against the nominee of the town council, on the general principle that neither the royal charter nor a by-law could curtail the usual franchise. But as each case rested on the national body swayed by the dominant political party, no principle was steadily adhered to in the trial of election petitions. The royal right to create boroughs was freely used by Elizabeth and James I as a means of securing a submissive parliament.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}}

===Crown control of boroughs in the restoration===
The later Stuarts abandoned this method, and the few new boroughs made by the [[Georgian era|Georges]] were not made for political reasons. The object of the later Stuarts was to control the corporations already in existence, not to make new ones. Charles II, from the time of his restoration decided to exercise a strict control of the close corporations to secure not only submissive parliaments, but also a pliant executive among the borough justices, and pliant juries, which were impanelled at the selection of the borough officers. In 1660 it was made a rule that all future (town) Charters should reserve expressly to the crown the first nomination (naming) of the aldermen, recorder and town-clerk, and a proviso should be entered placing with the common council the return of the member of parliament. The [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation Act of 1661]] gave power to royal commissioners to settle the composition of the town councils, and to remove all who refused the sacraments of the Church of England or were suspected of disaffection, even though they offered to take the necessary oaths. Even so, the difficulty of securing submissive juries was again so great in 1682 that a general attack on the borough franchises was begun by the crown. A London jury having returned a verdict hostile to the crown and taxation, after various attempts to bend the city to his will, Charles II issued a ''[[quo warranto]]'' against the mayor and commonalty to charge the citizens with illegal encroachments beyond their chartered rights. The way this was analogous to well-precedented Crown rights to regulate the actions of organised groups of men such as rebels, made it easy for the crown judges to find legally flawed actions of the boroughs, and also made it possible for the Londoners to argue that no execution could be taken against the mayor, commonalty and citizens, a \"body politic invisible\"; that the indictment lay only against every particular member of the governing body; and that the corporation as a corporation was incapable of suffering a forfeiture or of making a surrender. The judges gave a judgment for the king, the charters were forfeited and the government placed with a court of aldermen of the king's own choosing. Until James II yielded, there was no common council in London. The novelty of the proceedings of Charles II and James II lay in using the weapon of the ''quo warranto'' systematically to ensure a general revocation of charters. The new charters which were then granted required the king's consent for the more important appointments, and gave him power to remove officers without reason given.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|pp=271–272}}

Under James II in 1687 six commissioners were appointed to \"regulate\" the corporations and remove from them all persons who were opposed to the abolition of the penal laws against Catholics. The new appointments were made under a writ which ran, \"We will and require you to elect\" (a named person). When James II sought to withdraw from his disastrous policy, he issued a proclamation restoring to the boroughs their ancient charters. The governing charter thenceforth in many boroughs, though not in all, was the charter which had established a close corporation, and from this time on to 1835 the boroughs made no progress in constitutional growth.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}}

==Reform and replacement==
The tendency for the close corporation to treat the members of the governing body as the only corporators, and to repudiate the idea that the corporation was answerable to the inhabitants of the borough if the corporate property was squandered, became more and more manifest as the history of the past slipped into oblivion. The corporators came to regard themselves as members of a club, legally warranted in dividing the lands and goods of the same among themselves whensoever such a division should seem profitable. Even where the constitution of the corporation was not close by charter, the franchise tended to become restricted to an ever-dwindling electorate, as the old methods for the extension of the municipal franchise by other means than inheritance died out of use. At Ipswich in 1833 the \"freemen\" numbered only one fifty-fifth of the population. If the electorate was increased, it was done so by the wholesale admission to borough freedom (burgess status) to voters willing to vote as directed by the corporation at parliamentary elections.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} The corporation of [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]] before the 1830s reforms for example was the governing body of its [[grammar school]] which was the major endowed landowner in the town.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Growth of boroughs' corruption continued unchecked (but sometimes a little side-stepped see below) until the era of the Reform Bill. Several boroughs had by that time become insolvent, and some had recourse to their member of parliament to eke out their revenues. In Buckingham the mayor received the whole town revenue without rendering account; sometimes, however, heavy criminal charges fell upon the officers.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}}

Before the Reform era dissatisfaction came to occasional fruition in Local Acts (of Parliament) which placed under the authority of special commissioners a variety of administrative details, which if the corporation had not been suspected would certainly not have been assigned to its care. The trust offered another convenient means of escape from difficulty, and in some towns out of the trust was developed a system of municipal administration where there was no recognised corporation. Thus at Peterborough the [[feoffee]]s who had succeeded to the control of certain ancient charities constituted a form of town council with very restricted powers. In the 17th century Sheffield was brought under the act \"to redress the misemployment of lands given to charitable uses\",{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} and the municipal administration of what had been a borough passed into the hands of the trustees of the Burgery or [[Sheffield Town Trust|Town Trust]]. The many special authorities created under act of parliament led to much confusion, conflict and overlapping, and increased the need for a general reform.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}}

The reform of the boroughs was treated as part of the question of parliamentary reform. In [[Reform Act 1832|1832]] the exclusive privileges of the corporations in parliamentary elections having been abolished and male occupiers enfranchised, the question of the municipal franchise was next dealt with.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} In effect this made the borough parliamentary franchise the same as the county franchise. In 1833 a commission inquired into the administration of the municipal corporations,{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} the commissioners found far more corporations than [[parliamentary Borough]]s, many of which had fallen into desuetude or were purely nominal if not moribund. Those that were active were essentially oligarchies of a closed number of families, there were a few exceptions whereby the councils were elected by all the local residents or those born there. The majority were not representative of the inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The result of the inquiry was the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which gave the municipal franchise to the ratepayers, but also allowed the [[Free tenant|freemen]] to remain on the Roll. In all the municipal corporations dealt with by the act, the town council came to consist of a mayor, aldermen and councillors, and the councils were given like powers, being divided into those with and those without a commission of the peace.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} The Commissions of the Peace were also an instrument of reform. Many Boroughs had borough courts of the previous oligarchies of Mayor and Aldermen, advised by a [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]], these were abolished with the magistrates being appointed as per in the counties – many indeed were supposedly '[[county boroughs]]'. This reform was as crucial as that of the constitution of the council itself.

The minutes were to be open to the inspection of any burgess, and an audit of accounts was required. Exclusive rights of retail trading, which in some towns were restricted to freemen of the borough,{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} or to specialist guilds and companies (similar to those of the London [[livery companies]]),{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} were abolished.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} The system of police, which in some places was still medieval in character{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} as a town watch, was modernised along the lines of the [[Robert Peel|Peel]] reforms for constabulary{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} placed under the control of the council. The various privileged areas within the bounds of a borough were with few exceptions made part of the borough. The powers of the council to alienate corporate property were closely restricted. The operations of the act were extended by later legislation, and the diverse amendments and enactments which followed were consolidated in the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]].{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}}

[[File:SaxonWallsWarehamDorset.jpg|thumb|The burh wall at Wareham]]
The '''ancient boroughs''' were a historic unit of lower-tier local government in [[England and Wales]]. The ancient [[borough]]s covered only important towns and were established by charters granted at different times by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]]. Their history is largely concerned with the origin of such towns and how they gained the right of [[Self-governance|self-government]]. Ancient boroughs were reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which introduced directly elected corporations and allowed the incorporation of new industrial towns. Municipal boroughs ceased to be used for the purposes of local government in 1974, with [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] retained as an honorific title granted by [[the Crown]].

==Anglo-Saxon burhs==
{{main|burh}}
Throughout western Europe, the effect of the [[Migration Period|Germanic invasions]] which completed the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] was to destroy the [[Western Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Local government|municipal organisation]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} After the [[Anglo-Saxon conquest of England|Anglo-Saxon]] settlement of Britain, the ruins of Roman colonies and camps were used by the early English to form tribal strongholds.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|pp=268–269}} Despite their location, [[burh]]s on the sites of [[Roman Britain|Roman colonies]] show no continuity with Roman municipal organisation,{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}  and instead resemble the parallel revival of urban centres in continental Europe.{{sfn|Tait|1936|p={{page needed|date=December 2016}} }} The resettlement of the Roman Durovernum under the name \"burh of the men of Kent,\" ''Cant-wara-byrig''  or [[Canterbury]], illustrates this point. The burh of the men of West Kent was Hrofesceaster (Durobrivae), [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], and many other ceasters mark the existence of a Roman camp occupied by an early English burh. The tribal burh was protected by an earthen wall, and a general obligation to build and maintain burhs at the royal command was enforced by [[Anglo-Saxon law]].{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

Offences in disturbance of the peace of the burh were punished by higher fines than breaches of the peace of the ''hām'' or ordinary dwelling. However, neither in the early English language nor in the contemporary Latin was there any fixed usage differentiating the various words descriptive of the several forms of human settlement, and the fortified communal refuges cannot accordingly be clearly distinguished from villages or the strongholds of individuals by any purely nomenclative test.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

===Danish invasions===
At the end of the 9th century and beginning of the 10th century there is evidence of a systematic \"[[fortification|timbering]]\" of new burhs, with the object of providing strongholds for the defence of [[Wessex]] against the Danes, and it appears that the surrounding districts were charged with their maintenance. It is not until after the Danish invasions that it becomes easier to draw a distinction between the burhs that served as military strongholds for national defence and the [[royal vill]]s which served no such purpose. Some of the royal [[vill]]s eventually entered the class of boroughs, but by another route, and for the present the private stronghold and the royal dwelling may be neglected. It was the public stronghold and the administrative centre of a dependent district which was the source of the main features peculiar to the borough. Many causes tended to create peculiar conditions in the boroughs built for national defence. They were placed where artificial defence was most needed, at the junction of roads, in the plains, on the rivers, at the centres naturally marked out for trade, seldom where hills or marshes formed a sufficient natural defence.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}} Typically, the fortification of a burh consisted of earth [[defensive wall|ramparts]] faced with timber. [[Palisade]]s were sometimes used.

The concept of a network of burhs as a [[defence in depth]] is usually attributed to [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]].

{{quote|
The solution that Alfred devised for this apparently intractable predicament was nothing short of a revolution and that revolution began now in the 880s. If the Vikings could attack anywhere at any time, then the West Saxons had to be able to defend everywhere all the time. To make this possible Alfred ordered the construction of a network of defended centres across his kingdom, some built on refortified Roman and Iron Age sites, some built completely from scratch. These burhs were to be distributed so that no West Saxon was more than twenty or so miles – a day's march – from one of them.{{sfn|Pollard|2005|page={{page needed|date=December 2016}}}}
}}

This network is described in a manuscript document which has survived in later iterations, named by scholars the [[Burghal Hidage]], which lists thirty three burhs in Wessex and English Mercia. Most of these survived into the post [[Norman Conquest]] era and are the core of later [[Parliamentary Borough]]s and municipal corporations.

===Commercial significance===
Following the successful reconquest from the Vikings by Alfred's descendants Edward and [[Æthelstan]], the latter made a series of reforms in law, the Codes issued at the Council of Grately, which gave additional impetus to the urban development of the burhs which hitherto had been mainly forts.{{citation needed|date=December 2016|reason=It may well be in EB1911 but it is not a direct copy so needs verification}} The burhs drew commerce by every channel; the camp and the palace, the administrative centre, the ecclesiastical centre (for the mother-church of the state was placed in its chief burh), all looked to the market for their maintenance. The burh was provided by law with a mint and royal moneyers and exchangers, with an authorised scale for weights and measures. Mercantile transactions in the burhs or ports, as they were called when their commercial rather than their military importance was accentuated, were placed by law under special legal privileges in order no doubt to secure the king's hold upon his toll. Over the burh or port was set a reeve, a royal officer answerable to the king for his dues from the burh, his rents for lands and houses, his customs on commerce, his share of the profits from judicial fines.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

===Legal and administrative roles===
[[File:Edgar.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Edgar, King of England 959 to 975]]
At least from the 10th century the burh had a [[Moot hall|moot]] or court, the relation of which to the other courts is matter of speculation. A law of [[Edgar of England|Edgar]], about 960, required that it should meet three times a year, these being in all likelihood assemblies at which attendance was compulsory on all tenants of the burghal district, when pleas concerning life and liberty and land were held, and men were compelled to find pledges answerable for their good conduct. At these great meetings the borough [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] (''gerefa'') presided, declaring the law and guiding the judgments given by the suitors of the court. The reeve was supported by a group of assistants, called in Devon the ''[[Witenagemot|witan]]'', in the boroughs of the [[Danelaw]] by a group of (generally twelve) \" lawmen,\" in other towns probably by a group of aldermen, senior burgesses, with military and police authority, whose office was in some cases hereditary. These persons assisted the reeve at the great meetings of the full court, and sat with him as judges at the subordinate meetings which were held to settle the unfinished cases and minor causes. There was no compulsion on those not specially summoned to attend these extra meetings. At these subordinate jurisdictional assemblies, held in public, and acting by the same authority as the annual gathering of all the burh-wara, other business concerning borough administration was decided, at least in later days, and it is to these assemblies that the origin of the [[town council]] may in many cases be ascribed.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

In the larger towns the division into [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]], with a separate police system, can be traced at an early time, appearing as a unit of military organisation, answerable for the defence of a gate of the town. The police system of London is described in detail in a record of 930–940. Here the free people were grouped in associations of ten, each under the superintendence of a headman. The bishops and reeves who belonged to the \"court of London\" appear as the directors of the system, and in them we may see the aldermen of the wards of a later time. The use of the word ''bertha'' for ward at Canterbury, and the fact that the London ''wardmoot'' at a later time was used for the [[frankpledge]] system as well as for the organisation of the muster, point to a connexion between the military and the police systems in the towns.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

In charters of the Anglo-Saxon period a ''haw'', or enclosed area within a burh, was often conveyed by charter as if it were an apanage of the lands in the neighbourhood with which it was conveyed; the Norman settlers who succeeded to lands in the county succeeded therewith to houses in the burhs, for a close association existed between the [[thegns]] of the shire and the ''shirestow'', an association partly perhaps of duty and also of privilege. The king granted borough haws as places of refuge in Kent, and in London he gave them with commercial privileges to his bishops. What has been called the heterogeneous tenure of the shirestow, one of the most conspicuous characteristics of that particular type of borough, was further increased by the liberty which some burgesses enjoyed to \"commend\" themselves to a lord of their own choosing, promising to that lord suit and service and perhaps rent in return for protection. Over these burgesses the lords could claim jurisdictional rights, and these were in some cases increased by royal grants of special rights within certain [[Soke (legal)|sokes]]. The great boroughs were honeycombed with sokes, or areas of seignorial jurisdiction, within which the royal reeve's authority was greatly restricted while that of the lord's reeve took precedence. Even the haws, being \"burhs\" or strongholds within a stronghold, enjoyed a local \"peace\" which protected from official intrusion.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

Besides heterogeneity of tenure and jurisdiction in the borough, there was also heterogeneity of status; there were burh-thegns and [[Knight|cnihts]], mercatores, burgesses of various kinds, the three groups representing perhaps military, commercial and agricultural elements. The burh generally shows signs of having been originally a village settlement, surrounded by open fields, of which the borough boundary before 1835 will suggest the outline. This area was as a rule eventually the area of borough jurisdiction. There is some evidence pointing to the fact that the restriction of the borough authority to this area is not ancient, but due to the Norman settlement.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

==Boroughs in Norman England==
The wide districts over which the boroughs had had authority were placed under the control of the [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] castle which was itself built by means of the old English levy of ''burhwork''. The borough court was allowed to continue its work only within its own immediate territory, and, to prevent conflict, the castle was placed outside the borough. Losing their place in the national scheme of defence, the burgess ''cnihts'' made commerce their principal object under the encouragement of the old privileges of the walled place. Besides the great co-operative strongholds in which many lords had burgesses, there were small boroughs held by a single lord. In many cases boroughs of this \"seignorial\" type were created upon the royal estates. Out of the king's vill, as a rule the jurisdictional centre of a [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]], there was sometimes created a borough. The lines of division before Domesday Book are obscure, but it is probable that in some cases, by a royal grant of jurisdiction, the inhabitants of a populous royal vill, where a hundred court for the district was already held, were authorised to establish a permanent court, for the settlement of their disputes, distinct from the hundred court of the district. Boroughs of this type with a uniform tenure were created not only on the king's estates but also on those of his tenants-in-chief, and in 1086 they were probably already numerous.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=269}}

===Town and manor===
As noted by Stenton, the practice evident in the Norman period whereby [[Lord of the Manor|lords]] living in country [[Manor house|manors]] owned houses in the nearest borough was a continuation of a custom developed earlier by the Anglo-Saxons:
{{quote|
It is clear from the [[Domesday Book]] that in 1086 a piece of borough property – a [[messuage]], a house, or a group of houses – was often annexed to a manor in the open country. At [[Leicester]], for example, 134 houses were thus attached, singly or in groups, to 27 different manors. So far as can be seen the borough property was treated as a profit-yielding appendage of the manor. It provided the lord with a lodging when he came to the borough on business and with a place of refuge in time of trouble.... Most of the evidence which illustrates this practice relates to the time after the conquest, but it can be traced far back into the Anglo-Saxon period, and the Anglo-Saxon kings had encouraged it.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p={{page needed|date=December 2016}} }}

===Privileges granted to boroughs to encourage settlement near castles===
A borough was usually, though perhaps not invariably, the companion of a Norman castle. In some cases a French ''bourg'' was created by the side of an English borough, and the two remained for many generations distinct in their laws and customs: in other cases a French ''bourg'' was settled by the side of an English village. A large number of the followers of the Norman lords had been almost certainly town-dwellers in their own  country, and lost none of their burghal privileges by the migration. Every castle needed for its maintenance a group of skilled artisans, and the lords wished to draw to the castle gates all kinds of commodities for the castle's provision. The strength of the garrison made the neighbourhood of the castle a place of danger to men unprotected by legal privilege; and to invite to its neighbourhood desirable settlers, legal privileges similar to those enjoyed in Norman or English boroughs were guaranteed to those who would build on the plots which were offered to colonists. A low fixed rental, release from the renders required of villeins, release from the jurisdiction of the castle, and the creation of a separate borough jurisdiction, with or without the right to choose their own officers, rules fixing the maximum of fees and fines, or promising  assessment of the fines by the burgesses themselves, the cancelling of all the castellan's rights, especially the right to take a forced levy of food for the castle from all within the area of his jurisdiction, freedom from arbitrary tallage, freedom of movement, the right to alienate property and devise land, these and many other privileges named in the early seignorial charters were what constituted the Norman liber burgus of the seignorial type.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=270}}

Not all these privileges were enjoyed by all boroughs; some very meagre releases of seignorial rights accompanied the lord's charter which created a borough and made burgesses out of villeins. However liberal the grant, the lord or his reeve still remained in close personal relation with the burgesses of such places, and this character, together with the uniformity of their tenure, continued to hold them apart from the boroughs of the old English type, where all varieties of personal relationship between the lords and their groups of tenants might subsist. The royal charters granting the right to retain old customs prevented the systematic introduction into the old boroughs of some of the incidents of feudalism. Rights of the king took precedence of those of the lord, and devise with the king's consent was legal. By these means the lords' position was weakened, and other seignorial claims were later evaded or contested. The rights which the lords failed to keep were divided between the king and the municipality; in London, for instance, the king obtained all escheats, while the borough court secured the right of wardship of burgess orphans. From Norman times the yearly profit of the royal boroughs was as a rule included in the general \"farm\" rendered for the county by the sheriff; sometimes it was rendered by a royal farmer apart from the county-farm. The king generally accepted a composition for all the various items due from the borough. The burgesses were united in their efforts to keep that composition unchanged in amount, and to secure the provision of the right amount at the right time for fear that it should be increased by way of punishment.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=270}}

===Charters===
The levy of fines on rent arrear, and the distraints for debt due, which were obtained through the borough court, were a matter of interest to the burgesses of the court, and first taught the burgesses co-operative action. Money was raised, possibly by order of the borough court, to buy a charter from the king giving the right to choose officers who should answer directly to the exchequer and not through the sheriff of the county. The sheriff was in many cases also the constable of the castle, set by the Normans to overawe the English boroughs; his powers were great and dangerous enough to make him an officer specially obnoxious to the boroughs. [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] about 1131 gave the London citizens the right to choose their own sheriffs and a justiciar answerable for keeping the pleas of the crown. In 1130 the Lincoln citizens paid to hold their city in chief of the king. By the end of the 12th century many towns paid by the hand of their own reeves, and [[King John of England|John]]'s charters began to make rules as to the freedom of choice to be allowed in the nomination of borough officers and as to the royal power of dismissal.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=270}}

In [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]'s reign London imitated the French communes in styling the chief officer a mayor; in 1208 Winchester also had a mayor, and the title soon became no rarity. The chartered right to choose two or more citizens to keep the pleas of the crown gave to many boroughs the control of their coroners, who occupied the position of the London justiciar of earlier days, subject to those considerable modifications which [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s systematisation of the criminal law had introduced. Burgesses who had gone for criminal and civil justice to their own court in disputes between themselves, or between themselves and strangers who were in their town, secured confirmation of this right by charter, not to exclude the justices in eyre, but to exempt themselves from the necessity of pleading in a distant court. The burgess, whether plaintiff or defendant, was a privileged person, and could claim in this respect a \"benefit\" somewhat similar to the benefit of clergy. In permitting the boroughs to answer through their own officers for his dues, the king handed over to the boroughs the farming of his rents and a large number of rights which would eventually prove to be sources of great profit. No records exist showing the nature of municipal proceedings at the time of the first purchase of charters. Certain it is that the communities in the 12th century became alive to the possibilities of their new position, that trade received a new impulse, and the vague constitutional powers of the borough court acquired a new need for definition. At first the selection of officers who were to treat with the exchequer and to keep the royal pleas was almost certainly restricted to a few rich persons who could find the necessary securities. Nominated probably in one of the smaller judicial assemblies, the choice was announced at the great [[Michaelmas]] assembly of the whole community, and it is not till the next century that we hear of any attempt of the ''vulgus'' to make a different selection from that of the magnates. The ''vulgus'' were able to take effective action by means of the several craft organisations, and first found the necessity to do so when taxation was heavy or when questions of trade legislation were mooted.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=270}}

===Taxation leads to political reformation===
The taxation of the boroughs in the reign of Henry II was assessed by the king's justices, who fixed the sums due per capita; but if the borough made an offer of a gift, the assessment was made by the burgesses. In the first case the taxation fell on the magnates. In the levy per communam the assessment was made through the wardmoots (in London) and the burden fell on the poorer class. In Henry II's reign London was taxed by both methods, the barones majores by head, the barones minores through the wardmoot.  The pressure of taxation led in the 13th century to a closer definition of the burghal constitutions; the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]] sought to get an audit of accounts, and (in London) not only to hear but to treat of municipal affairs. By the end of the century London had definitely established two councils, that of the mayor and aldermen, representing the old borough court, and a common council, representing the voice of the commonalty, as expressed through the city wards. The choice of councillors in the wards rested probably with the aldermen and the ward jury summoned by them to make the presentments. In some cases juries were summoned not to represent different areas but different classes; thus at Lincoln there were in 1272 juries of the rich, the middling and the poor, chosen presumably by authority from groups divided by means of the tax roll. Elsewhere the several groups of traders and artisans made of their gilds all-powerful agencies for organising joint action among classes of commons united by a trade interest, and the history of the towns becomes the history of the struggle between the gilds which captured control of the council and the gilds which were excluded therefrom.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|pp=270–271}}

Many municipal revolutions took place, and a large number of constitutional experiments were tried all over the country from the 13th century onward. Schemes which directed a gradual co-optation, two to choose four, these six to choose more, and so in widening circles from a centre of officialdom, found much favour throughout the Middle Ages. A plan, like the London plan, of two companies, alderman and council, was widely favoured in the 14th century, perhaps in imitation of the Houses of [[House of Lords|Lords]] and [[House of Commons of England|Commons]]. The mayor was sometimes styled the \"sovereign\" and was given many prerogatives. Great respect was paid to the \"ancients,\" those, namely, who had already held municipal office. Not till the 15th century were orderly arrangements for counting \"voices\" arrived at in a few of the most highly developed towns, and these were used only in the small assemblies of the governingbody, not in the large electoral assemblies of the people. In London in the 13th century there was aregular system for the admission of new members to the borough \"franchise,\" which was at first regarded not as conferring any form of suffrage but as a means to secure a privileged position in the borough court and in the trade of the borough. Admission could be obtained by inheritance, by purchase or gift, in some places by marriage, and in London, at least from 1275, by a municipal register of apprenticeship. The new freeman in return for his privileges was bound to share with the other burgesses all the burdens of taxation, control, &c., which fell upon burgesses. Personal service was not always necessary, and in some towns there were many non- resident burgesses. When in later times admission to this freedom came to be used as means to secure the parliamentary franchise, the freedom of the borough was freely sold and given.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}}

The elections in which the commons of the boroughs first took interest were those of the borough magistrates. Where the commons succeeded for a time in asserting their right to take part in borough elections they were rarely able to keep it, not in all cases perhaps because their power was feared, but sometimes because of the riotous proceedings which ensued. These led to government interference, which no party in the borough desired. The possibility of a forfeiture of their enfranchised position made the burgesses on the whole fairly submissive. In the 13th century London repeatedly was \"taken into the king's hand,\" subjected to heavy fines and put under the constable of the Tower.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}}

==Charters of incorporation==
In the 15th century disturbances in the boroughs led to the creation of new constitutions, some of which were the outcome of royal charters, others the result of parliamentary legislation. The development of the law of corporations also at this time compelled the boroughs to seek new charters which should satisfy the now exacting demands of the law. The charters of incorporation were issued at a time when the king's government was looking more and more to the borough authorities as part of its executive and judicial staff, and thus the government was closely interested in the manner of their selection. The new charters were drafted in such a way as to narrow the popular control.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}} The boroughs were placed under the control of a corporation headed by a mayor, and in most cases leading to no concept of popular control, the whole system of appointment to the corporation being one of [[co-option]] by existing members.{{citation needed|date=December 2016|reason=This is a change in this sentence from \"The corporations were placed under a council and in a number of cases popular control was excluded altogether, the whole system being made one of co-optation.\" This change is not supported with a source}} Absence of popular protest to this may in part be due to old popular control being more nominal than real, and the new charters gave as a rule two councils of considerable size. These councils bore a heavy burden of taxation in meeting royal loans and benevolences, paying per capita, like the magnates of the 12th century, and for a time there is on the whole little evidence of friction between the governors and the governed. Throughout, unpopular changes or neglect in the closest of corporations had a means of official protest, though no means of execution, in the presentments of the leet juries and sessions juries. By means of their \"verdicts\" they could use threats against the governing body, express their resentment against acts of the council which benefited the governing body rather than the town, and call in the aid of the justices of the [[assizes]] (judges, in the seasons of sittings outside of London, \"assizes\") where the members of the governing body were suspected of fraud.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}}

Elizabeth repeatedly declared her dislike of incorporations \"because of the abuses committed by their head rulers,\" but in her reign they were fairly easily controlled by the [[Privy Council of England|privy council]], which directed their choice of members of parliament and secured supporters of the government policy to fill vacancies on the borough bench. The practice in [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] charters of specifying by name the members of the governing body and holders of special offices opened the way to a \"purging\" of the hostile spirits when new charters were required. There were also rather vaguely worded clauses authorising the dismissal of officers for misconduct, although as a rule the appointments were for life. When under the Stuarts and under the Commonwealth political and religious feeling ran high in the boroughs, use was made of these clauses both by the majority on the council and by the central government to mould the character of the council by a drastic \"purging\". Another means of control first used under the Commonwealth was afforded by the various acts of parliament, which subjected all holders of municipal office to the test of an oath. Under the Commonwealth there was no improvement in the methods used by the central government to control the boroughs.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}}

All opponents of the ruling policy were disfranchised and disqualified from office by act of parliament in 1652. Cases arising out of the act were to be tried by commissioners, and the commissions of the major-generals gave them opportunity to control the borough policy. Few Commonwealth charters have been preserved, although several were issued in response to the requests of the corporations. In some cases the charters used words which appeared to point to an opportunity for popular elections in boroughs, where a usage of election to the corporation by the town council had been established. In 1598 the judges gave an opinion that the town councils could make [[by-law]]s determining the government of the towns regardless of the terms of the charter. In the 18th century the judges decided to the contrary. But even where a usage of popular election was established, there were means of controlling the result of a parliamentary election. The close corporations, though their right to choose a member of parliament might be doubtful, had the sole right to admit new burgesses, and whether in parliamentary elections to enfranchise non-residents. Where conflicts arose over the choice of a member of parliament, two competing selections were typically made and the matter came before the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]. The Commons quite often decided in favour of the more popularly elected candidate against the nominee of the town council, on the general principle that neither the royal charter nor a by-law could curtail the usual franchise. But as each case rested on the national body swayed by the dominant political party, no principle was steadily adhered to in the trial of election petitions. The royal right to create boroughs was freely used by Elizabeth and James I as a means of securing a submissive parliament.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=271}}

===Crown control of boroughs in the restoration===
The later Stuarts abandoned this method, and the few new boroughs made by the [[Georgian era|Georges]] were not made for political reasons. The object of the later Stuarts was to control the corporations already in existence, not to make new ones. Charles II, from the time of his restoration decided to exercise a strict control of the close corporations to secure not only submissive parliaments, but also a pliant executive among the borough justices, and pliant juries, which were impanelled at the selection of the borough officers. In 1660 it was made a rule that all future (town) Charters should reserve expressly to the crown the first nomination (naming) of the aldermen, recorder and town-clerk, and a proviso should be entered placing with the common council the return of the member of parliament. The [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation Act of 1661]] gave power to royal commissioners to settle the composition of the town councils, and to remove all who refused the sacraments of the Church of England or were suspected of disaffection, even though they offered to take the necessary oaths. Even so, the difficulty of securing submissive juries was again so great in 1682 that a general attack on the borough franchises was begun by the crown. A London jury having returned a verdict hostile to the crown and taxation, after various attempts to bend the city to his will, Charles II issued a ''[[quo warranto]]'' against the mayor and commonalty to charge the citizens with illegal encroachments beyond their chartered rights. The way this was analogous to well-precedented Crown rights to regulate the actions of organised groups of men such as rebels, made it easy for the crown judges to find legally flawed actions of the boroughs, and also made it possible for the Londoners to argue that no execution could be taken against the mayor, commonalty and citizens, a \"body politic invisible\"; that the indictment lay only against every particular member of the governing body; and that the corporation as a corporation was incapable of suffering a forfeiture or of making a surrender. The judges gave a judgment for the king, the charters were forfeited and the government placed with a court of aldermen of the king's own choosing. Until James II yielded, there was no common council in London. The novelty of the proceedings of Charles II and James II lay in using the weapon of the ''quo warranto'' systematically to ensure a general revocation of charters. The new charters which were then granted required the king's consent for the more important appointments, and gave him power to remove officers without reason given.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|pp=271–272}}

Under James II in 1687 six commissioners were appointed to \"regulate\" the corporations and remove from them all persons who were opposed to the abolition of the penal laws against Catholics. The new appointments were made under a writ which ran, \"We will and require you to elect\" (a named person). When James II sought to withdraw from his disastrous policy, he issued a proclamation restoring to the boroughs their ancient charters. The governing charter thenceforth in many boroughs, though not in all, was the charter which had established a close corporation, and from this time on to 1835 the boroughs made no progress in constitutional growth.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}}

==Reform and replacement==
The tendency for the close corporation to treat the members of the governing body as the only corporators, and to repudiate the idea that the corporation was answerable to the inhabitants of the borough if the corporate property was squandered, became more and more manifest as the history of the past slipped into oblivion. The corporators came to regard themselves as members of a club, legally warranted in dividing the lands and goods of the same among themselves whensoever such a division should seem profitable. Even where the constitution of the corporation was not close by charter, the franchise tended to become restricted to an ever-dwindling electorate, as the old methods for the extension of the municipal franchise by other means than inheritance died out of use. At Ipswich in 1833 the \"freemen\" numbered only one fifty-fifth of the population. If the electorate was increased, it was done so by the wholesale admission to borough freedom (burgess status) to voters willing to vote as directed by the corporation at parliamentary elections.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} The corporation of [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]] before the 1830s reforms for example was the governing body of its [[grammar school]] which was the major endowed landowner in the town.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Growth of boroughs' corruption continued unchecked (but sometimes a little side-stepped see below) until the era of the Reform Bill. Several boroughs had by that time become insolvent, and some had recourse to their member of parliament to eke out their revenues. In Buckingham the mayor received the whole town revenue without rendering account; sometimes, however, heavy criminal charges fell upon the officers.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}}

Before the Reform era dissatisfaction came to occasional fruition in Local Acts (of Parliament) which placed under the authority of special commissioners a variety of administrative details, which if the corporation had not been suspected would certainly not have been assigned to its care. The trust offered another convenient means of escape from difficulty, and in some towns out of the trust was developed a system of municipal administration where there was no recognised corporation. Thus at Peterborough the [[feoffee]]s who had succeeded to the control of certain ancient charities constituted a form of town council with very restricted powers. In the 17th century Sheffield was brought under the act \"to redress the misemployment of lands given to charitable uses\",{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} and the municipal administration of what had been a borough passed into the hands of the trustees of the Burgery or [[Sheffield Town Trust|Town Trust]]. The many special authorities created under act of parliament led to much confusion, conflict and overlapping, and increased the need for a general reform.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}}

The reform of the boroughs was treated as part of the question of parliamentary reform. In [[Reform Act 1832|1832]] the exclusive privileges of the corporations in parliamentary elections having been abolished and male occupiers enfranchised, the question of the municipal franchise was next dealt with.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} In effect this made the borough parliamentary franchise the same as the county franchise. In 1833 a commission inquired into the administration of the municipal corporations,{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} the commissioners found far more corporations than [[parliamentary Borough]]s, many of which had fallen into desuetude or were purely nominal if not moribund. Those that were active were essentially oligarchies of a closed number of families, there were a few exceptions whereby the councils were elected by all the local residents or those born there. The majority were not representative of the inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The result of the inquiry was the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which gave the municipal franchise to the ratepayers, but also allowed the [[Free tenant|freemen]] to remain on the Roll. In all the municipal corporations dealt with by the act, the town council came to consist of a mayor, aldermen and councillors, and the councils were given like powers, being divided into those with and those without a commission of the peace.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} The Commissions of the Peace were also an instrument of reform. Many Boroughs had borough courts of the previous oligarchies of Mayor and Aldermen, advised by a [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]], these were abolished with the magistrates being appointed as per in the counties – many indeed were supposedly '[[county boroughs]]'. This reform was as crucial as that of the constitution of the council itself.

The minutes were to be open to the inspection of any burgess, and an audit of accounts was required. Exclusive rights of retail trading, which in some towns were restricted to freemen of the borough,{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} or to specialist guilds and companies (similar to those of the London [[livery companies]]),{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} were abolished.{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} The system of police, which in some places was still medieval in character{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}} as a town watch, was modernised along the lines of the [[Robert Peel|Peel]] reforms for constabulary{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} placed under the control of the council. The various privileged areas within the bounds of a borough were with few exceptions made part of the borough. The powers of the council to alienate corporate property were closely restricted. The operations of the act were extended by later legislation, and the diverse amendments and enactments which followed were consolidated in the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]].{{sfn|Bateson|1911|p=272}}

An installment in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, it follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s quest to stop his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] from enslaving an alien race and taking over the world. The gameplay is similar to prior ''Sonic'' games, with players collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies; the camera perspective occasionally switches from [[Third-person view|third-person]] to [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] perspectives. The game also introduces [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, [[power-ups]] the player can use to increase attack power and reach new areas.

Development of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. Examining criticisms of past games, the developers made Sonic the only playable character and worked to balance speed and platforming; the Wisps were introduced to diversify the gameplay without slowing it down. Two versions of the game were developed: one for the [[Wii]] by [[Sonic Team]], and one for the [[Nintendo DS]] by [[Dimps]]. The game was designed for a wider demographic than previous games, specifically children and fans of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted several ''Sonic'' games with sub-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand.

''Sonic Colors'' received positive reviews. Critics recommended the title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered it an improvement over previous installments. However, some criticized its difficulty and weak [[multiplayer]] mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million copies. The Wisp power-ups introduced in ''Sonic Colors'' became a staple of the ''Sonic'' series.

==Gameplay==
===Premise and setting===
[[File:Sonic_Colors_gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Sonic Colors'', showing Sonic in one of the game's levels]]
''Sonic Colors'' is a 2D [[platform game]] set in [[outer space]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], whose goal is to save the [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, an alien race that has been enslaved by [[Doctor Eggman]].<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> The game's main [[Overworld#Platform games|hub]] is Doctor Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, an interplanetary [[amusement park]] that consists of six small planets chained to each other.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> Sonic must be guided through these planets to destroy the power source at their center.<ref name=\"nwr\"/>

Each planet is split into seven parts: six main [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] called acts and a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] level.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> In each act, players must guide Sonic to the goal, whilst defeating enemies and dodging obstacles. In boss levels, players face one of Eggman's large robots, and must defeat it. Gameplay seamlessly shifts between [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] and [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspectives.<ref name=\"gswii\" /><ref name=\"wired\" /> Upon completion of a level, players are given a grade dependent on their performance, with an \"S\" being the best and a \"D\" being the worst.<ref name=\"James Newton\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/sonic_colours_wii|title=Sonic Colours Review – Wii|last=Newton|first=James|website=Nintendo Life|publisher=Gamer Network|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126165734/http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/sonic_colours_wii|archive-date=January 26, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref> As the player progresses through the game, more planets become available to select. Once each planet has been completed, a bonus seventh, which concludes the story, is unlocked.<ref name=\"brady\" />

Players control Sonic using the [[Wii Remote]] (with or without the [[Wii Nunchuck|Nunchuck]]),<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> the [[Wii Classic Controller|Classic Controller]], or the [[Nintendo GameCube Controller]]. Sonic retains most of his abilities from ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'':<ref name=\"sonicstadiuminterview\" /> he can perform a \"Sonic Boost\" which greatly increases his speed and allows him to smash through various objects;<ref name=\"wisp\">{{cite web|last1=Towell|first1=Justin|title=Sonic Colors power-ups are looking a bit... familiar|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/sonic-colors-power-ups-are-looking-a-bit-familiar/|website=GamesRadar|publisher=Future Publishing|accessdate=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922145735/http://www.gamesradar.com/sonic-colors-power-ups-are-looking-a-bit-familiar/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> a homing attack that allows him to destroy enemies from long distances;<ref name=\"eurog\" /> and a stomp that enables him to quickly destroy objects below him. In certain levels, players are sent at high speeds and must perform a quick step maneuver to dodge walls and other hazards;<ref name=\"destructrev\" /> others see Sonic using a drift mechanic in order to make sharp turns. Sonic is also given a double-jump ability, which allows him to perform an additional jump in mid-air.<ref name=\"eurog\" />

[[File:Sonic_Colors_Wisp_example.jpg|thumb|right|Sonic uses the Orange Rocket, one of the eight Wisps in ''Sonic Colors'']]
A major aspect of ''Sonic Colors'' is the ability to activate Wisp [[power-up]]s.<ref name=\"grrev\" /> There are eight different types of Wisps, each with their own unique advantage dependent on their color.<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> Normal white-colored Wisps allow the player to get a speed boost at any time.<ref name=\"wisp\"/> The \"Cyan Laser\" turns Sonic into a laser that can bounce off solid surfaces to change the laser's path and to travel through power lines,<ref name=\"grrev\" /> while the \"Yellow Drill\" allows Sonic to drill through soft ground and water.<ref name=\"grrev\" /> The \"Orange Rocket\" allows Sonic to blast upward to tremendous heights;<ref name=\"gids\" /> the \"Pink Spikes\" allows Sonic to bond to walls and ceilings and to perform a spin dash to gain velocity and to destroy objects;<ref name=\"grrev\" /> the \"Green Hover\" enables Sonic to hover and to perform dashes across lines of rings;<ref name=\"gswii\" /> the \"Blue Cube\" gives Sonic the ability to turn blue blocks into blue rings and vice versa;<ref name=\"James Newton\" /> and the \"Purple Frenzy\", which turns Sonic into a berserker that chomps through anything in its path, increasing in size as it continues to eat.<ref name=\"gswii\" />

Like previous games, Sonic collects golden [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]],<ref name=\"gswii\" /> which protect him from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts the game with a limited number of [[Life (gaming)|lives]]; if he is hit with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life.<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> If a player exhausts their lives, they will receive a [[game over]].<ref name=\"brady\" />

===Multiplayer===
''Sonic Colors'' features a [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative]] [[two-player]] mode, ''Eggman's Sonic Simulator,'' in which players control Sonic-modeled robots or their [[Mii]] characters through a series of levels.<ref name=\"nwr\" /> These levels can be unlocked by collecting special Red Star Rings hidden throughout each act.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> Completing ''Sonic Simulator'' levels rewards the player [[Chaos Emeralds]], and once all seven are collected, Sonic can transform into [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Super transformation|Super Sonic]] after collecting 50 rings in normal levels. As Super Sonic, players are invincible and can boost infinitely, though they cannot use Wisps and lose one ring per second, de-transforming when the ring counter hits zero.<ref name=\"brady\" /> The game also features online leaderboards, allowing players to upload their scores via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]].<ref name=\"gsds\">{{cite web|last1=Douglas|first1=Jane|title=Sonic Colors Review|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-colours-review/1900-6284273/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002729/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-colours-review/1900-6284273/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref>

===Nintendo DS===
[[File:SonicColorsDS.jpg|thumb|right|A version of ''Sonic Colors'' (pictured) was developed by [[Dimps]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]]]
Unlike the [[Wii]] version, the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''Sonic Colors'' is a side-scroller reminiscent of the original [[Sega Genesis]] games that takes advantage of the system's dual-screen.<ref name=\"gids\">{{cite web|last1=Turi|first1=Tim|title=Dimps Crafts Another Amazing 2D Sonic Game|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_colors/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2010/11/09/sonic-colors-ds-review.aspx|website=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67FIv0ZvE?url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_colors/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2010/11/09/sonic-colors-ds-review.aspx|archivedate=April 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"ignds\" /> Exclusive to the DS version are [[touchscreen]]-controlled special stages similar to the ones seen in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'',<ref name=\"gids\"/> missions featuring various characters from throughout the franchise, a competitive multiplayer mode,<ref name=\"ignds\">{{cite web|last1=Gallegos|first1=Anthony|title=Sonic Colors DS Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/08/sonic-colors-ds-review|website=IGN|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821212017/http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/08/sonic-colors-ds-review|archivedate=August 21, 2017}}</ref> and an extra final boss.<ref name=\"brady\" /> The game features two additional Wisp types: \"Red Burst\", which allows Sonic to burst in midair and can activate certain objects such as a hot air balloon, Ferris wheel, and popcorn cannons;<ref name=\"brady\" /> and \"Violet Void\", which gives Sonic the ability to float and to suck up nearby objects, growing bigger in the process.<ref name=\"gids\"/> Unlockable concept art is also included.<ref name=\"gids\"/>

==Plot==
Doctor Eggman opens an amusement park in space called Dr. Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, allegedly turning over a new leaf and making up for past transgressions. The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend [[Tails (character)|Tails]] investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.

Sonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans.{{efn|name=DS}} After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.

However, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes.{{efn|name=DS|Only in the Nintendo DS version.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen [[Orbot and Cubot]].

{{nihongo foot|'''''Sonic Colors'''''|ソニックカラーズ|Sonikku Karāzu|known as '''''Sonic Colours''''' in PAL regions|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2010 [[platform video game]] published by [[Sega]]. An installment in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, it follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s quest to stop his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] from enslaving an alien race and taking over the world. The gameplay is similar to prior ''Sonic'' games, with players collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies; the camera perspective occasionally switches from [[Third-person view|third-person]] to [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] perspectives. The game also introduces [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, [[power-ups]] the player can use to increase attack power and reach new areas.

Development of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. Examining criticisms of past games, the developers made Sonic the only playable character and worked to balance speed and platforming; the Wisps were introduced to diversify the gameplay without slowing it down. Two versions of the game were developed: one for the [[Wii]] by [[Sonic Team]], and one for the [[Nintendo DS]] by [[Dimps]]. The game was designed for a wider demographic than previous games, specifically children and fans of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted several ''Sonic'' games with sub-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand.

''Sonic Colors'' received positive reviews. Critics recommended the title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered it an improvement over previous installments. However, some criticized its difficulty and weak [[multiplayer]] mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million copies. The Wisp power-ups introduced in ''Sonic Colors'' became a staple of the ''Sonic'' series.

==Gameplay==
===Premise and setting===
[[File:Sonic_Colors_gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Sonic Colors'', showing Sonic in one of the game's levels]]
''Sonic Colors'' is a [[platform game]] set in [[outer space]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], whose goal is to save the [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, an alien race that has been enslaved by [[Doctor Eggman]].<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> The game's main [[Overworld#Platform games|hub]] is Doctor Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, an interplanetary [[amusement park]] that consists of six small planets chained to each other.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> Sonic must be guided through these planets to destroy the power source at their center.<ref name=\"nwr\"/>

Each planet is split into seven parts: six main [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] called acts and a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] level.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> In each act, players must guide Sonic to the goal, whilst defeating enemies and dodging obstacles. In boss levels, players face one of Eggman's large robots, and must defeat it. Gameplay seamlessly shifts between [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] and [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspectives.<ref name=\"gswii\" /><ref name=\"wired\" /> Upon completion of a level, players are given a grade dependent on their performance, with an \"S\" being the best and a \"D\" being the worst.<ref name=\"James Newton\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/sonic_colours_wii|title=Sonic Colours Review – Wii|last=Newton|first=James|website=Nintendo Life|publisher=Gamer Network|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126165734/http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/sonic_colours_wii|archive-date=January 26, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref> As the player progresses through the game, more planets become available to select. Once each planet has been completed, a bonus seventh, which concludes the story, is unlocked.<ref name=\"brady\" />

Players control Sonic using the [[Wii Remote]] (with or without the [[Wii Nunchuck|Nunchuck]]),<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> the [[Wii Classic Controller|Classic Controller]], or the [[Nintendo GameCube Controller]].

[[File:Sonic_Colors_Wisp_example.jpg|thumb|right|Sonic uses the Orange Rocket, one of the eight Wisps in ''Sonic Colors'']]
A major aspect of ''Sonic Colors'' is the ability to activate Wisp [[power-up]]s.<ref name=\"grrev\" /> There are eight different types of Wisps, each with their own unique advantage dependent on their color.<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> Normal white-colored Wisps allow the player to get a speed boost at any time.<ref name=\"wisp\"/> The \"Cyan Laser\" turns Sonic into a laser that can bounce off solid surfaces to change the laser's path and to travel through power lines,<ref name=\"grrev\" /> while the \"Yellow Drill\" allows Sonic to drill through soft ground and water.<ref name=\"grrev\" /> The \"Orange Rocket\" allows Sonic to blast upward to tremendous heights;<ref name=\"gids\" /> the \"Pink Spikes\" allows Sonic to bond to walls and ceilings and to perform a spin dash to gain velocity and to destroy objects;<ref name=\"grrev\" /> the \"Green Hover\" enables Sonic to hover and to perform dashes across lines of rings;<ref name=\"gswii\" /> the \"Blue Cube\" gives Sonic the ability to turn blue blocks into blue rings and vice versa;<ref name=\"James Newton\" /> and the \"Purple Frenzy\", which turns Sonic into a berserker that chomps through anything in its path, increasing in size as it continues to eat.<ref name=\"gswii\" />

Like previous games, Sonic collects golden [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]],<ref name=\"gswii\" /> which protect him from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts the game with a limited number of [[Life (gaming)|lives]]; if he is hit with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life.<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> If a player exhausts their lives, they will receive a [[game over]].<ref name=\"brady\" />

===Multiplayer===
''Sonic Colors'' features a [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative]] [[two-player]] mode, ''Eggman's Sonic Simulator,'' in which players control Sonic-modeled robots or their [[Mii]] characters through a series of levels.<ref name=\"nwr\" /> These levels can be unlocked by collecting special Red Star Rings hidden throughout each act.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> Completing ''Sonic Simulator'' levels rewards the player [[Chaos Emeralds]], and once all seven are collected, Sonic can transform into [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Super transformation|Super Sonic]] after collecting 50 rings in normal levels. As Super Sonic, players are invincible and can boost infinitely, though they cannot use Wisps and lose one ring per second, de-transforming when the ring counter hits zero.<ref name=\"brady\" /> The game also features online leaderboards, allowing players to upload their scores via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]].<ref name=\"gsds\">{{cite web|last1=Douglas|first1=Jane|title=Sonic Colors Review|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-colours-review/1900-6284273/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002729/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-colours-review/1900-6284273/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref>

==Plot==
Doctor Eggman opens an amusement park in space called Dr. Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, allegedly turning over a new leaf and making up for past transgressions. The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend [[Tails (character)|Tails]] investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.

Sonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans.{{efn|name=DS}} After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.

However, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes.{{efn|name=DS|Only in the Nintendo DS version.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen [[Orbot and Cubot]].

The game's presentation was well received. Pedro Hernandez of ''Nintendo World Report'' described the graphics and animations as \"beautiful\" and \"gorgeous\".<ref name=\"nwr\">{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Pedro|title=Sonic Colors Review|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/24566/sonic-colors-wii|website=Nintendo World Report|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208191120/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/24566/sonic-colors-wii|archivedate=December 8, 2015}}</ref> Arthur Gies of ''[[IGN]]'' considered them to be among the best available on the Wii, praising the lighting, detail, and variety they offered.<ref name=\"ignwii\"/> Both Hernandez and Jane Douglas of ''[[GameSpot]]'' both praised the audio for incorporating familiar aspects of past ''Sonic'' games, and Douglas admired the \"jazzy, high-energy\" soundtrack as fitting for all levels.<ref name=\"nwr\"/><ref name=\"gswii\">{{cite web|last1=Douglas|first1=Jane|title=Sonic Colors Review|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-colors-review/1900-6284005/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002419/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-colors-review/1900-6284005/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> The new voice casting was also appreciated; Gies elaborated that the cast was \"much less annoying\" than the previous voice actors, and Hernandez considered their voices to be fitting for the characters.<ref name=\"ignwii\"/><ref name=\"nwr\"/>

The gameplay was praised, particularly for the Wisps and its replay value. Al Bickham of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' considered the game's intertwining of platforming and speed to be successful, and also praised its use of the Wii Remote.<ref name=\"eurog\">{{cite web|last1=Bickham|first1=Al|title=Sonic Colours Review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-11-11-sonic-colours-review|website=Eurogamer|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67FIo26cf?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-11-11-sonic-colours-review|archivedate=April 27, 2012}}</ref> Gies, Douglas, and John Meyer of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' praised the shift from third-person to side-scrolling, which Meyer described as \"elegant and cohesive\".<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=John|title=Review: No-Nonsense Sonic Colors is The Best Hedgehog Game in Years|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/11/sonic-colors-review/|website=Wired|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002608/https://www.wired.com/2010/11/sonic-colors-review/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> Matthew Keast of ''[[GamesRadar]]'' called the Wisps the game's best feature, describing the element of backtracking to previously completed levels after unlocking more types as clever.<ref name=\"grrev\">{{cite web|last1=Keast|first1=Matthew|title=Sonic Colors review|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/sonic-colors-review/|website=GamesRadar|publisher=Future Publishing|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67FIxrzjs?url=http://www.gamesradar.com/sonic-colors-review/|archivedate=April 27, 2012}}</ref> Tim Turi of ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the Wisps for adding \"an interesting new gameplay mechanic without succumbing to Werehog-itis\",<ref name=\"gids\"/> and Gies compared the Wisps to power-ups from the ''Super Mario'' franchise, though he felt that ''Colors'' still felt distinctive and fresh.<ref name=\"ignwii\"/> Douglas, however, preferred basic platforming over using the Wisps.<ref name=\"gswii\"/>

Some aspects of the game were criticized, however. Writing for ''[[Destructoid]]'', [[Jim Sterling]] described ''Sonic Colors'' as \"terribly designed\". He criticized the controls and physics, and felt the developers had not addressed problems present in previous games and concluded that the game was poor.<ref name=\"destructrev\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-sonic-colors-187691.phtml|title=Review: Sonic Colors|last=Sterling|first=Jim|date=November 13, 2010|website=Destructoid|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713055746/https://www.destructoid.com/review-sonic-colors-187691.phtml|archive-date=July 13, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=July 10, 2017}}</ref> Gies, Hernandez, Meyer, Turi, and Keast criticized the game's high difficulty level,<ref name=\"ignwii\"/><ref name=\"nwr\"/><ref name=\"wired\"/><ref name=\"grrev\" /><ref name=\"giwii\">{{cite web|last1=Turi|first1=Tim|title=Sonic Drops The Ball Juggling The Second And Third Dimensions|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_colors/b/wii/archive/2010/11/09/sonic-colors-ds-review.aspx|website=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|accessdate=September 20, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922003851/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_colors/b/wii/archive/2010/11/09/sonic-colors-ds-review.aspx|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> with Keast going as far to describe it as \"hardcore\".<ref name=\"grrev\"/> Both Gies and Douglas spoke negatively of the co-op ''Eggman's Sonic Simulator''; Gies described it as not fun,<ref name=\"ignwii\"/> and Douglas called it \"ugly\" and ultimately concluded that the multiplayer was weak.

Kono requiem da.

Development of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. Examining criticisms of past games, the developers made Sonic the only playable character and worked to balance speed and platforming; the Wisps were introduced to diversify the gameplay without slowing it down. Two versions of the game were developed: one for the [[Wii]] by [[Sonic Team]], and one for the [[Nintendo DS]] by [[Dimps]]. The game was designed for a wider demographic than previous games, specifically children and fans of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted several ''Sonic'' games with sub-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand.

''Sonic Colors'' received positive reviews. Critics recommended the title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered it an improvement over previous installments. However, some criticized its difficulty and weak [[multiplayer]] mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million copies. The Wisp power-ups introduced in ''Sonic Colors'' became a staple of the ''Sonic'' series.

==Gameplay==
===Premise and setting===
[[File:Sonic_Colors_gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Sonic Colors'', showing Sonic in one of the game's levels]]
''Sonic Colors'' is a [[platform game]] set in [[outer space]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], whose goal is to save the [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, an alien race that has been enslaved by [[Doctor Eggman]].<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> The game's main [[Overworld#Platform games|hub]] is Doctor Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, an interplanetary [[amusement park]] that consists of six small planets chained to each other.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> Sonic must be guided through these planets to destroy the power source at their center.<ref name=\"nwr\"/>

Each planet is split into seven parts: six main [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] called acts and a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] level.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> In each act, players must guide Sonic to the goal, whilst defeating enemies and dodging obstacles. In boss levels, players face one of Eggman's large robots, and must defeat it. Gameplay seamlessly shifts between [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] and [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspectives.<ref name=\"gswii\" /><ref name=\"wired\" /> Upon completion of a level, players are given a grade dependent on their performance, with an \"S\" being the best and a \"D\" being the worst.<ref name=\"James Newton\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/sonic_colours_wii|title=Sonic Colours Review – Wii|last=Newton|first=James|website=Nintendo Life|publisher=Gamer Network|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126165734/http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/sonic_colours_wii|archive-date=January 26, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref> As the player progresses through the game, more planets become available to select. Once each planet has been completed, a bonus seventh, which concludes the story, is unlocked.<ref name=\"brady\" />

Players control Sonic using the [[Wii Remote]] (with or without the [[Wii Nunchuck|Nunchuck]]),<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> the [[Wii Classic Controller|Classic Controller]], or the [[Nintendo GameCube Controller]]. Sonic retains most of his abilities from ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'':<ref name=\"sonicstadiuminterview\" /> he can perform a \"Sonic Boost\" which greatly increases his speed and allows him to smash through various objects;<ref name=\"wisp\">{{cite web|last1=Towell|first1=Justin|title=Sonic Colors power-ups are looking a bit... familiar|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/sonic-colors-power-ups-are-looking-a-bit-familiar/|website=GamesRadar|publisher=Future Publishing|accessdate=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922145735/http://www.gamesradar.com/sonic-colors-power-ups-are-looking-a-bit-familiar/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> a homing attack that allows him to destroy enemies from long distances;<ref name=\"eurog\" /> and a stomp that enables him to quickly destroy objects below him. In certain levels, players are sent at high speeds and must perform a quick step maneuver to dodge walls and other hazards;<ref name=\"destructrev\" /> others see Sonic using a drift mechanic in order to make sharp turns. Sonic is also given a double-jump ability, which allows him to perform an additional jump in mid-air.<ref name=\"eurog\" />

[[File:Sonic_Colors_Wisp_example.jpg|thumb|right|Sonic uses the Orange Rocket, one of the eight Wisps in ''Sonic Colors'']]
A major aspect of ''Sonic Colors'' is the ability to activate Wisp [[power-up]]s.<ref name=\"grrev\" /> There are eight different types of Wisps, each with their own unique advantage dependent on their color.<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> Normal white-colored Wisps allow the player to get a speed boost at any time.<ref name=\"wisp\"/> The \"Cyan Laser\" turns Sonic into a laser that can bounce off solid surfaces to change the laser's path and to travel through power lines,<ref name=\"grrev\" /> while the \"Yellow Drill\" allows Sonic to drill through soft ground and water.<ref name=\"grrev\" /> The \"Orange Rocket\" allows Sonic to blast upward to tremendous heights;<ref name=\"gids\" /> the \"Pink Spikes\" allows Sonic to bond to walls and ceilings and to perform a spin dash to gain velocity and to destroy objects;<ref name=\"grrev\" /> the \"Green Hover\" enables Sonic to hover and to perform dashes across lines of rings;<ref name=\"gswii\" /> the \"Blue Cube\" gives Sonic the ability to turn blue blocks into blue rings and vice versa;<ref name=\"James Newton\" /> and the \"Purple Frenzy\", which turns Sonic into a berserker that chomps through anything in its path, increasing in size as it continues to eat.<ref name=\"gswii\" />

Like previous games, Sonic collects golden [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]],<ref name=\"gswii\" /> which protect him from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts the game with a limited number of [[Life (gaming)|lives]]; if he is hit with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life.<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> If a player exhausts their lives, they will receive a [[game over]].<ref name=\"brady\" />

===Multiplayer===
''Sonic Colors'' features a [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative]] [[two-player]] mode, ''Eggman's Sonic Simulator,'' in which players control Sonic-modeled robots or their [[Mii]] characters through a series of levels.<ref name=\"nwr\" /> These levels can be unlocked by collecting special Red Star Rings hidden throughout each act.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> Completing ''Sonic Simulator'' levels rewards the player [[Chaos Emeralds]], and once all seven are collected, Sonic can transform into [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Super transformation|Super Sonic]] after collecting 50 rings in normal levels. As Super Sonic, players are invincible and can boost infinitely, though they cannot use Wisps and lose one ring per second, de-transforming when the ring counter hits zero.<ref name=\"brady\" /> The game also features online leaderboards, allowing players to upload their scores via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]].<ref name=\"gsds\">{{cite web|last1=Douglas|first1=Jane|title=Sonic Colors Review|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-colours-review/1900-6284273/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002729/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-colours-review/1900-6284273/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref>

===Nintendo DS===
[[File:SonicColorsDS.jpg|thumb|right|A version of ''Sonic Colors'' (pictured) was developed by [[Dimps]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]]]
Unlike the [[Wii]] version, the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''Sonic Colors'' is a side-scroller reminiscent of the original [[Sega Genesis]] games that takes advantage of the system's dual-screen.<ref name=\"gids\">{{cite web|last1=Turi|first1=Tim|title=Dimps Crafts Another Amazing 2D Sonic Game|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_colors/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2010/11/09/sonic-colors-ds-review.aspx|website=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67FIv0ZvE?url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_colors/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2010/11/09/sonic-colors-ds-review.aspx|archivedate=April 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"ignds\" /> Exclusive to the DS version are [[touchscreen]]-controlled special stages similar to the ones seen in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'',<ref name=\"gids\"/> missions featuring various characters from throughout the franchise, a competitive multiplayer mode,<ref name=\"ignds\">{{cite web|last1=Gallegos|first1=Anthony|title=Sonic Colors DS Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/08/sonic-colors-ds-review|website=IGN|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821212017/http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/08/sonic-colors-ds-review|archivedate=August 21, 2017}}</ref> and an extra final boss.<ref name=\"brady\" /> The game features two additional Wisp types: \"Red Burst\", which allows Sonic to burst in midair and can activate certain objects such as a hot air balloon, Ferris wheel, and popcorn cannons;<ref name=\"brady\" /> and \"Violet Void\", which gives Sonic the ability to float and to suck up nearby objects, growing bigger in the process.<ref name=\"gids\"/> Unlockable concept art is also included.<ref name=\"gids\"/>

==Plot==
Doctor Eggman opens an amusement park in space called Dr. Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, allegedly turning over a new leaf and making up for past transgressions. The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend [[Tails (character)|Tails]] investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.

Sonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans.{{efn|name=DS}} After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.

However, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes.{{efn|name=DS|Only in the Nintendo DS version.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen [[Orbot and Cubot]].

{{nihongo foot|'''''Sonic Colors'''''|ソニックカラーズ|Sonikku Karāzu|known as '''''Sonic Colours''''' in PAL regions|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2010 [[platform video game]] published by [[Sega]]. An installment in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, it follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s quest to stop his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] from enslaving an alien race and taking over the world. The gameplay is similar to prior ''Sonic'' games, with players collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies; the camera perspective occasionally switches from [[Third-person view|third-person]] to [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] perspectives. The game also introduces [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, [[power-ups]] the player can use to increase attack power and reach new areas.

Development of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. Examining criticisms of past games, the developers made Sonic the only playable character and worked to balance speed and platforming; the Wisps were introduced to diversify the gameplay without slowing it down. Two versions of the game were developed: one for the [[Wii]] by [[Sonic Team]], and one for the [[Nintendo DS]] by [[Dimps]]. The game was designed for a wider demographic than previous games, specifically children and fans of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted several ''Sonic'' games with sub-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand.

''Sonic Colors'' received positive reviews. Critics recommended the title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered it an improvement over previous installments. However, some criticized its difficulty and weak [[multiplayer]] mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million copies. The Wisp power-ups introduced in ''Sonic Colors'' became a staple of the ''Sonic'' series.

==Gameplay==
===Premise and setting===
[[File:Sonic_Colors_gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Sonic Colors'', showing Sonic in one of the game's levels]]
''Sonic Colors'' is a [[platform game]] set in [[outer space]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], whose goal is to save the [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, an alien race that has been enslaved by [[Doctor Eggman]].<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> The game's main [[Overworld#Platform games|hub]] is Doctor Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, an interplanetary [[amusement park]] that consists of six small planets chained to each other.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> Sonic must be guided through these planets to destroy the power source at their center.<ref name=\"nwr\"/>

Each planet is split into seven parts: six main [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] called acts and a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] level.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> In each act, players must guide Sonic to the goal, whilst defeating enemies and dodging obstacles. In boss levels, players face one of Eggman's large robots, and must defeat it. Gameplay seamlessly shifts between [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] and [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspectives.<ref name=\"gswii\" /><ref name=\"wired\" /> Upon completion of a level, players are given a grade dependent on their performance, with an \"S\" being the best and a \"D\" being the worst.<ref name=\"James Newton\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/sonic_colours_wii|title=Sonic Colours Review – Wii|last=Newton|first=James|website=Nintendo Life|publisher=Gamer Network|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126165734/http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/sonic_colours_wii|archive-date=January 26, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref> As the player progresses through the game, more planets become available to select. Once each planet has been completed, a bonus seventh, which concludes the story, is unlocked.<ref name=\"brady\" />

Players control Sonic using the [[Wii Remote]] (with or without the [[Wii Nunchuck|Nunchuck]]),<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> the [[Wii Classic Controller|Classic Controller]], or the [[Nintendo GameCube Controller]]. Sonic retains most of his abilities from ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'':<ref name=\"sonicstadiuminterview\" /> he can perform a \"Sonic Boost\" which greatly increases his speed and allows him to smash through various objects;<ref name=\"wisp\">{{cite web|last1=Towell|first1=Justin|title=Sonic Colors power-ups are looking a bit... familiar|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/sonic-colors-power-ups-are-looking-a-bit-familiar/|website=GamesRadar|publisher=Future Publishing|accessdate=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922145735/http://www.gamesradar.com/sonic-colors-power-ups-are-looking-a-bit-familiar/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> a homing attack that allows him to destroy enemies from long distances;<ref name=\"eurog\" /> and a stomp that enables him to quickly destroy objects below him. In certain levels, players are sent at high speeds and must perform a quick step maneuver to dodge walls and other hazards;<ref name=\"destructrev\" /> others see Sonic using a drift mechanic in order to make sharp turns. Sonic is also given a double-jump ability, which allows him to perform an additional jump in mid-air.<ref name=\"eurog\" />

[[File:Sonic_Colors_Wisp_example.jpg|thumb|right|Sonic uses the Orange Rocket, one of the eight Wisps in ''Sonic Colors'']]
A major aspect of ''Sonic Colors'' is the ability to activate Wisp [[power-up]]s.<ref name=\"grrev\" /> There are eight different types of Wisps, each with their own unique advantage dependent on their color.<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> Normal white-colored Wisps allow the player to get a speed boost at any time.<ref name=\"wisp\"/> The \"Cyan Laser\" turns Sonic into a laser that can bounce off solid surfaces to change the laser's path and to travel through power lines,<ref name=\"grrev\" /> while the \"Yellow Drill\" allows Sonic to drill through soft ground and water.<ref name=\"grrev\" /> The \"Orange Rocket\" allows Sonic to blast upward to tremendous heights;<ref name=\"gids\" /> the \"Pink Spikes\" allows Sonic to bond to walls and ceilings and to perform a spin dash to gain velocity and to destroy objects;<ref name=\"grrev\" /> the \"Green Hover\" enables Sonic to hover and to perform dashes across lines of rings;<ref name=\"gswii\" /> the \"Blue Cube\" gives Sonic the ability to turn blue blocks into blue rings and vice versa;<ref name=\"James Newton\" /> and the \"Purple Frenzy\", which turns Sonic into a berserker that chomps through anything in its path, increasing in size as it continues to eat.<ref name=\"gswii\" />

Like previous games, Sonic collects golden [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]],<ref name=\"gswii\" /> which protect him from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts the game with a limited number of [[Life (gaming)|lives]]; if he is hit with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life.<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> If a player exhausts their lives, they will receive a [[game over]].<ref name=\"brady\" />

===Multiplayer===
''Sonic Colors'' features a [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative]] [[two-player]] mode, ''Eggman's Sonic Simulator,'' in which players control Sonic-modeled robots or their [[Mii]] characters through a series of levels.<ref name=\"nwr\" /> These levels can be unlocked by collecting special Red Star Rings hidden throughout each act.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> Completing ''Sonic Simulator'' levels rewards the player [[Chaos Emeralds]], and once all seven are collected, Sonic can transform into [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Super transformation|Super Sonic]] after collecting 50 rings in normal levels. As Super Sonic, players are invincible and can boost infinitely, though they cannot use Wisps and lose one ring per second, de-transforming when the ring counter hits zero.<ref name=\"brady\" /> The game also features online leaderboards, allowing players to upload their scores via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]].<ref name=\"gsds\">{{cite web|last1=Douglas|first1=Jane|title=Sonic Colors Review|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-colours-review/1900-6284273/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002729/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-colours-review/1900-6284273/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref>

===Nintendo DS===
[[File:SonicColorsDS.jpg|thumb|right|A version of ''Sonic Colors'' (pictured) was developed by [[Dimps]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]]]
Unlike the [[Wii]] version, the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''Sonic Colors'' is a side-scroller reminiscent of the original [[Sega Genesis]] games that takes advantage of the system's dual-screen.<ref name=\"gids\">{{cite web|last1=Turi|first1=Tim|title=Dimps Crafts Another Amazing 2D Sonic Game|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_colors/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2010/11/09/sonic-colors-ds-review.aspx|website=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67FIv0ZvE?url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_colors/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2010/11/09/sonic-colors-ds-review.aspx|archivedate=April 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"ignds\" /> Exclusive to the DS version are [[touchscreen]]-controlled special stages similar to the ones seen in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'',<ref name=\"gids\"/> missions featuring various characters from throughout the franchise, a competitive multiplayer mode,<ref name=\"ignds\">{{cite web|last1=Gallegos|first1=Anthony|title=Sonic Colors DS Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/08/sonic-colors-ds-review|website=IGN|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821212017/http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/08/sonic-colors-ds-review|archivedate=August 21, 2017}}</ref> and an extra final boss.<ref name=\"brady\" /> The game features two additional Wisp types: \"Red Burst\", which allows Sonic to burst in midair and can activate certain objects such as a hot air balloon, Ferris wheel, and popcorn cannons;<ref name=\"brady\" /> and \"Violet Void\", which gives Sonic the ability to float and to suck up nearby objects, growing bigger in the process.<ref name=\"gids\"/> Unlockable concept art is also included.<ref name=\"gids\"/>

==Plot==
Doctor Eggman opens an amusement park in space called Dr. Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, allegedly turning over a new leaf and making up for past transgressions. The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend [[Tails (character)|Tails]] investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.

Sonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans.{{efn|name=DS}} After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.

However, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes.{{efn|name=DS|Only in the Nintendo DS version.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen [[Orbot and Cubot]].

Because of de Pablo's exit, showrunner Gary Glasberg had to change his planned storyline for season 11. \"Someone asked me if I was planning for this, but I really wasn't, so basically the minute that this became real, I had to throw out a lot of what I was planning to do and start from scratch\".<ref name=tvl>{{cite web|last=Mitovich|first=Matt Webb|title=NCIS Boss Opens Up About Cote de Pablo's Surprising Decision ('I Really Wasn't Planning for This'), Hints at 'Romantic' Exit Storyline|url=http://tvline.com/2013/07/29/ncis-season-11-ziva-exit-storyline-tiva-payoff/|work=TV Line|accessdate=August 15, 2013|date=July 29, 2013}}</ref> Glasberg has stated that there will be rotating characters coming to fill Ziva's role.

The theme for the season is \"unlocking demons\", both figurative and literal according to Glasberg.

'''[[Music]]''' is found in every known culture and religion, past and present, varying widely between times and places. Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently, the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallin|first=Nils Lennart|title=The Origins of Music|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-262-73143-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&printsec=frontcover |author2=Steven Brown |author3=[[Björn Merker]]}}</ref><ref>Krause, Bernie (2012). ''The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places''. New York: Little Brown/Hachette </ref>

A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, access to technology and what religion is believed.  The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. \"[[Music history]]\" is the distinct subfield of [[musicology]] and history which studies music (particularly [[Art music|Western art music]]) from a chronological perspective.

===Prehistoric music===
{{Main|Prehistoric music}}
Prehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in [[Literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Historical geology|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.

Prehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional [[Native American music]] of preliterate tribes and [[Australian Aboriginal music]]. However, it is more common to refer to the \"prehistoric\" music of non-European continents – especially that which still survives – as [[Folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring [[sound]]s and [[rhythm]]s. Human music may echo these [[phenomena]] using [[patterns]], [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and [[tonality]].

\"Ancient music\" is the name given to the music that follows music of the prehistoric era. The \"oldest known song\" was written in [[cuneiform]], dating to 3400 years ago from [[Ugarit]] in [[Syria]]. It was a part of the [[Hurrian songs]], more specifically Hurrian hymn no. 6. It was deciphered by Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and was demonstrated to be composed in harmonies of thirds, like ancient ''[[gymel]]'',<ref>Kilmer, Crocker, Brown, ''Sounds from Silence'', 1976, Bit Enki, Berkeley, Calif., {{LCCN|76-16729}}</ref> and also was written using a [[Pythagorean tuning]] of the [[diatonic scale]]. The oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world, is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], dated to either the 1st or the 2nd century AD.

Double pipes, such as those used by the [[Music of ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], and ancient bagpipes, as well as a review of ancient drawings on vases and walls, etc., and ancient writings (such as in Aristotle, ''Problems,'' Book XIX.12) which described musical techniques of the time, indicate [[polyphony]]. One pipe in the aulos pairs (double flutes) likely served as a [[Drone (music)|drone]] or \"keynote,\" while the other played melodic passages. Instruments, such as the seven holed flute and various types of stringed instruments have been recovered from the [[Indus valley civilization]] archaeological sites.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yySNDP9XVggC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=seven+holed+flute+and+various+types+of+stringed+instruments|title=The Music of India|first1=Reginald|last1=Massey|first2=Jamila|last2=Massey|date=28 March 1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-81-7017-332-8}}</ref>

[[Indian classical music]] (''marga'') can be found from the scriptures of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas, describes music at length.

[[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of King [[Ravana]]. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world history.

The history of musical development in Iran ([[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to the days of the [[Elamite Empire]] (2500–644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The [[Sassanid]] period (AD 226–651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.

The [[Early music]] era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including [[Asian music]], Persian music, [[music of India]], [[Jewish music]], [[Greek music]], [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]], the [[music of Mesopotamia]], the [[music of Egypt]], and [[Muslim music]].

'''Greece'''{{Main|Music of Greece}}
Greek written history extends far back into [[Ancient Greece]], and was a major part of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons.  Instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked [[string instrument]], the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music was an important part of education in ancient Greece, and boys were taught music starting at age six.

===Biblical period===
{{main|History of music in the biblical period}}
[[Image:David-harp.jpg|thumb|<center>\"David with his harp\" [[Paris Psalter]],<br> c. 960, [[Constantinople]]</center>]]
According to [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was named by the Bible as the inventor of musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The [[Hebrews]] were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the first mention of music is in the account of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s interview with [[Jacob]] (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the [[Red Sea]], [[Moses]] and the [[children of Israel]] sang their song of [[Book of Exodus|deliverance]] (Ex. 15). But the period of [[Samuel]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]] was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]]. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the [[prophet]]s (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). [[Solomon's Temple]], however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1–6). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4–6; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).<ref>''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', \"Music\", 1897</ref>

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] with those of the later cultures of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a \"social phenomenon called [[litany]],\" a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, \"Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:\"<ref name=JRT>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html \"A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional\"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.</ref>

:While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the \"father of all such as handle the harp and pipe\", the [[Pentateuch]] is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of [[Israel]]. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. \"One finds in the biblical text\", writes Alfred Sendrey, \"a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.\" This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]].<ref name=JRT/>

===Early music===
{{Main|Early music}}
Early music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], in 476 AD, until the end of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] in the middle of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known.  What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.

===Medieval music===
{{Main|Medieval music}}
While musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early [[Medieval]] era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the [[plainsong]] liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death.  Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend.  Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and [[Charlemagne]].

During the 9th century several important developments took place.  First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy.  Second, the earliest [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as [[organum]].  Third, and of greatest significance for music history, [[music notation|notation]] was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.

Several schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100:  the [[St. Martial school]] of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, which included the composers [[Léonin]] and [[Pérotin]], and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the [[Codex Calixtinus]]; and the English school, the music of which survives in the [[Worcester Fragments]] and the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].  Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the [[troubadour]]s, [[trouvère]]s and [[minnesinger|Minnesänger]].  Much of the later secular music of the early [[Renaissance]] evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the early 13th century.

Forms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the [[motet]], [[conductus]], [[discant]], and [[Clausula (music)|clausulae]].  One unusual development was the ''[[Geisslerlieder]]'', the music of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the [[Black Death]], around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music.  Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the ''[[ars nova]]'', which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and [[aesthetics]].  Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the [[formes fixes]]:  the [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], the [[virelai]], the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], the [[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], which correspond to poetic forms of the same names.  Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment:  famous composers include [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Francesco Landini]].

===Renaissance music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->
{{Main|Renaissance music}}
[[Image:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]

The beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in [[Italy]], but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]].  The style of the [[Burgundian school|Burgundian]] composers, as the first generation of the [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century  ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and contained clear, singable melody and balanced [[polyphony]] in all voices.  The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], and [[Antoine Busnois]].

By the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the [[Low Countries]] and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the [[Medici]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[Sforza]] families).  They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate.  Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], and the [[laude]]; secular forms included the [[chanson]], the [[frottola]], and later the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].

The invention of [[printing]] had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included [[Johannes Ockeghem]], who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of [[canon (music)|canonical]] devices; [[Jacob Obrecht]], one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and [[Josquin des Prez]], probably the most famous composer in Europe before [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of [[counterpoint]]; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of [[Nicolas Gombert]], whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the [[canzona]] and the [[ricercar]], ultimately culminating in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[fugue|fugal]] forms.

By the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident:  a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the [[Counter-Reformation]] [[Council of Trent]], exemplified in the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]; a trend towards complexity and [[chromaticism]] in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the [[avant-garde]] style of the [[Ferrara School]] of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]] and the late century madrigalist [[Carlo Gesualdo]]; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]], which used the architecture of the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] to create [[polychoral|antiphonal]] contrasts.  The music of the Venetian school included the development of [[orchestration]], ornamented instrumental parts, and [[basso continuo|continuo]] bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600.  Famous composers in [[Venice]] included the Gabrielis, [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi]], one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.

Most parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century.  In England, composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]] wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes:  famous composers included [[Thomas Morley]], [[John Wilbye]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]]. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]] writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar.  Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant [[chorale]]s, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there).  In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of [[organ (music)|organ]] music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]].  France developed a unique style of musical diction known as [[musique mesurée]], used in secular chansons, with composers such as [[Guillaume Costeley]] and [[Claude Le Jeune]] prominent in the movement.

One of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]], who ironically had a reactionary intent:  dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks.  Chief among them were [[Vincenzo Galilei]], the father of the astronomer, and [[Giulio Caccini]].  The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as [[monody]], and a corresponding staged dramatic form:  a form known today as [[opera]].  The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.

Music prior to 1600 was [[musical mode|modal]] rather than [[Tonality|tonal]].  Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on [[mode (music)|modes]] by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], led directly to the development of common practice tonality.  The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old [[church modes]], a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive.  Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the [[common practice period]].

The Baroque era took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe and, during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}<!--But not in the Renaissance? Or what?--> German, Italian, French, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, and English Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.<ref name=\"sdsu\">{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D. |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}</ref> The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[François Couperin]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]].

===Classical music era===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->
{{Main|Classical period (music)}}
The music of the Classical period is characterized by [[homophonic texture]], or an obvious [[melody]] with [[accompaniment]].  These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music.  Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced [[opera]] and other sung forms (such as [[oratorio]]) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition.  However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).

[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s compositions characterized music of the classical era.]]
Along with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].  In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, [[Alberti bass]] (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice.  The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], the [[symphony]], and the [[concerto]], though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in [[music theory]].  All three derive from [[sonata form]], which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.

The early Classical period was ushered in by the [[Mannheim School]], which included such composers as [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Franz Xaver Richter]], [[Carl Stamitz]], and [[Christian Cannabich]]. It exerted a profound influence on [[Joseph Haydn]] and, through him, on all subsequent European music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.

[[Image:Siegfried - Heinrich Gudehus.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The title character from a 19th-century performance of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'']]
In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and in the role of concerts as part of [[urban culture|urban]] society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex&nbsp;– and often much longer&nbsp;– musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[César Franck|Franck]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].

===Africa===
{{Main|African music}}
Sub-Saharan African music is by a strong rhythmic interest that exhibits common characteristics in all regions of this vast territory, so that Arthur Morris Jones (1889–1980) has described the many local approaches as constituting one main system.
C. K.  also affirms the profound homogeneity of approach. West African rhythmic techniques carried over the Atlantic were fundamental ingredients in various musical styles of the Americas: [[samba]], [[forró]], [[maracatu]] and [[Coco (music)|coco]] in Brazil, Afro-Cuban music and Afro-American musical genres such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]], [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop]] and [[rock and roll]] were thereby of immense importance in 20th-century popular music.{{Clarify|date=February 2018}}<!--What has any of this to do with extra-European \"classical\" music?-->

===Byzantium===
{{Main|Byzantine music}}
[[Byzantine music]] (Greek: Βυζαντινή Μουσική) is the music of the Byzantine Empire composed to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music. Greek and foreign historians agree that the ecclesiastical tones and in general the whole system of Byzantine music is closely related to the ancient Greek system. It remains the oldest genre of extant music, of which the manner of performance and (with increasing accuracy from the 5th century onwards) the names of the composers, and sometimes the particulars of each musical work's circumstances, are known.

India's classical music tradition is millennia long and remains important to the lives of Indians today as a source of religious inspiration, cultural expression, and entertainment.

Indian classical music (marga) is monophonic, and based on a single melody line or [[raga]] rhythmically organized through [[Tala (music)|talas]]. Carnatic music is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are a lot of songs emphasising love and other social issues. In contrast to Carnatic music, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, Vedic philosophy and native Indian sounds but also by the Persian performance practices of the Afghan Mughals. The origins of Indian classical music can be found from the oldest of scriptures, part of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas describes music at length.

===China===
{{Main|Chinese classical music}}
Chinese classical music is the traditional art or court music of China. It has a long history stretching for more than three thousand years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres.  Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5+7 = 12) as does European-influenced music.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''[[Music]]''' is found in every known culture and religion, past and present, varying widely between times and places. Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently, the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallin|first=Nils Lennart|title=The Origins of Music|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-262-73143-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&printsec=frontcover |author2=Steven Brown |author3=[[Björn Merker]]}}</ref><ref>Krause, Bernie (2012). ''The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places''. New York: Little Brown/Hachette </ref>

A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, access to technology and what religion is believed.  The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. \"[[Music history]]\" is the distinct subfield of [[musicology]] and history which studies music (particularly [[Art music|Western art music]]) from a chronological perspective.

===Prehistoric music===
{{Main|Prehistoric music}}
Prehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in [[Literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Historical geology|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.

Prehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional [[Native American music]] of preliterate tribes and [[Australian Aboriginal music]]. However, it is more common to refer to the \"prehistoric\" music of non-European continents – especially that which still survives – as [[Folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring [[sound]]s and [[rhythm]]s. Human music may echo these [[phenomena]] using [[patterns]], [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and [[tonality]]. Even today, some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]]. In some instances, this feature is related to [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|shamanistic beliefs or practice]].<ref name=onom>[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}</ref><ref name=soy>Diószegi 1960: 203</ref> It may also serve entertainment (game)<ref name=natt>Nattiez: 5</ref><ref name=desch>{{cite web|url=http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm|title=Inuit Throat-Singing|first=Bruno |last=Deschênes |date=January 3, 2002|website=www.mustrad.org.uk|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> or practical (luring animals in hunt)<ref name=natt/> functions.

It is probable that the first [[musical instrument]] was the [[human voice]] itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from singing, [[Hum (sound)|humming]] and [[whistling]] through to [[Click consonant|clicking]], [[cough]]ing and [[yawn]]ing.

===Ancient music===
{{Main|Ancient music}}
[[Image:Harp-Sassanid.png|thumb|[[Sassanid]] women playing [[Chang (instrument)]] in [[Taq-e Bostan]], [[Iran]] (c. 379 AD)]]
\"Ancient music\" is the name given to the music that follows music of the prehistoric era. The \"oldest known song\" was written in [[cuneiform]], dating to 3400 years ago from [[Ugarit]] in [[Syria]]. It was a part of the [[Hurrian songs]], more specifically Hurrian hymn no. 6. It was deciphered by Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and was demonstrated to be composed in harmonies of thirds, like ancient ''[[gymel]]'',<ref>Kilmer, Crocker, Brown, ''Sounds from Silence'', 1976, Bit Enki, Berkeley, Calif., {{LCCN|76-16729}}</ref> and also was written using a [[Pythagorean tuning]] of the [[diatonic scale]]. The oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world, is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], dated to either the 1st or the 2nd century AD.

Double pipes, such as those used by the [[Music of ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], and ancient bagpipes, as well as a review of ancient drawings on vases and walls, etc., and ancient writings (such as in Aristotle, ''Problems,'' Book XIX.12) which described musical techniques of the time, indicate [[polyphony]]. One pipe in the aulos pairs (double flutes) likely served as a [[Drone (music)|drone]] or \"keynote,\" while the other played melodic passages. Instruments, such as the seven holed flute and various types of stringed instruments have been recovered from the [[Indus valley civilization]] archaeological sites.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yySNDP9XVggC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=seven+holed+flute+and+various+types+of+stringed+instruments|title=The Music of India|first1=Reginald|last1=Massey|first2=Jamila|last2=Massey|date=28 March 1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-81-7017-332-8}}</ref>

[[Indian classical music]] (''marga'') can be found from the scriptures of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas, describes music at length.

[[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of King [[Ravana]]. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world history.

The history of musical development in Iran ([[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to the days of the [[Elamite Empire]] (2500–644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The [[Sassanid]] period (AD 226–651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.

The [[Early music]] era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including [[Asian music]], Persian music, [[music of India]], [[Jewish music]], [[Greek music]], [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]], the [[music of Mesopotamia]], the [[music of Egypt]], and [[Muslim music]].

'''Greece'''{{Main|Music of Greece}}
Greek written history extends far back into [[Ancient Greece]], and was a major part of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons.  Instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked [[string instrument]], the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music was an important part of education in ancient Greece, and boys were taught music starting at age six.

===Biblical period===
{{main|History of music in the biblical period}}
[[Image:David-harp.jpg|thumb|<center>\"David with his harp\" [[Paris Psalter]],<br> c. 960, [[Constantinople]]</center>]]
According to [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was named by the Bible as the inventor of musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The [[Hebrews]] were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the first mention of music is in the account of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s interview with [[Jacob]] (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the [[Red Sea]], [[Moses]] and the [[children of Israel]] sang their song of [[Book of Exodus|deliverance]] (Ex. 15). But the period of [[Samuel]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]] was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]]. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the [[prophet]]s (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). [[Solomon's Temple]], however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1–6). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4–6; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).<ref>''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', \"Music\", 1897</ref>

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] with those of the later cultures of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a \"social phenomenon called [[litany]],\" a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, \"Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:\"<ref name=JRT>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html \"A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional\"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.</ref>

:While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the \"father of all such as handle the harp and pipe\", the [[Pentateuch]] is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of [[Israel]]. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. \"One finds in the biblical text\", writes Alfred Sendrey, \"a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.\" This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]].<ref name=JRT/>

===Early music===
{{Main|Early music}}
Early music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], in 476 AD, until the end of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] in the middle of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known.  What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.

===Medieval music===
{{Main|Medieval music}}
While musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early [[Medieval]] era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the [[plainsong]] liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death.  Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend.  Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and [[Charlemagne]].

During the 9th century several important developments took place.  First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy.  Second, the earliest [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as [[organum]].  Third, and of greatest significance for music history, [[music notation|notation]] was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.

Several schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100:  the [[St. Martial school]] of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, which included the composers [[Léonin]] and [[Pérotin]], and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the [[Codex Calixtinus]]; and the English school, the music of which survives in the [[Worcester Fragments]] and the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].  Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the [[troubadour]]s, [[trouvère]]s and [[minnesinger|Minnesänger]].  Much of the later secular music of the early [[Renaissance]] evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the early 13th century.

Forms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the [[motet]], [[conductus]], [[discant]], and [[Clausula (music)|clausulae]].  One unusual development was the ''[[Geisslerlieder]]'', the music of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the [[Black Death]], around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music.  Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the ''[[ars nova]]'', which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and [[aesthetics]].  Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the [[formes fixes]]:  the [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], the [[virelai]], the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], the [[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], which correspond to poetic forms of the same names.  Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment:  famous composers include [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Francesco Landini]].

{{Main|Renaissance music}}
[[Image:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]

The beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in [[Italy]], but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]].  The style of the [[Burgundian school|Burgundian]] composers, as the first generation of the [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century  ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and contained clear, singable melody and balanced [[polyphony]] in all voices.  The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], and [[Antoine Busnois]].

By the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the [[Low Countries]] and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the [[Medici]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[Sforza]] families).  They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate.  Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], and the [[laude]]; secular forms included the [[chanson]], the [[frottola]], and later the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].

The invention of [[printing]] had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included [[Johannes Ockeghem]], who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of [[canon (music)|canonical]] devices; [[Jacob Obrecht]], one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and [[Josquin des Prez]], probably the most famous composer in Europe before [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of [[counterpoint]]; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of [[Nicolas Gombert]], whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the [[canzona]] and the [[ricercar]], ultimately culminating in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[fugue|fugal]] forms.

By the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident:  a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the [[Counter-Reformation]] [[Council of Trent]], exemplified in the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]; a trend towards complexity and [[chromaticism]] in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the [[avant-garde]] style of the [[Ferrara School]] of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]] and the late century madrigalist [[Carlo Gesualdo]]; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]], which used the architecture of the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] to create [[polychoral|antiphonal]] contrasts.  The music of the Venetian school included the development of [[orchestration]], ornamented instrumental parts, and [[basso continuo|continuo]] bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600.  Famous composers in [[Venice]] included the Gabrielis, [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi]], one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.

Most parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century.  In England, composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]] wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes:  famous composers included [[Thomas Morley]], [[John Wilbye]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]]. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]] writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar.  Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant [[chorale]]s, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there).  In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of [[organ (music)|organ]] music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]].  France developed a unique style of musical diction known as [[musique mesurée]], used in secular chansons, with composers such as [[Guillaume Costeley]] and [[Claude Le Jeune]] prominent in the movement.

One of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]], who ironically had a reactionary intent:  dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks.  Chief among them were [[Vincenzo Galilei]], the father of the astronomer, and [[Giulio Caccini]].  The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as [[monody]], and a corresponding staged dramatic form:  a form known today as [[opera]].  The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.

Music prior to 1600 was [[musical mode|modal]] rather than [[Tonality|tonal]].  Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on [[mode (music)|modes]] by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], led directly to the development of common practice tonality.  The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old [[church modes]], a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive.  Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the [[common practice period]].

The Baroque era took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe and, during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}<!--But not in the Renaissance? Or what?--> German, Italian, French, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, and English Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.<ref name=\"sdsu\">{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D. |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}</ref> The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[François Couperin]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]].

===Classical music era===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->
{{Main|Classical period (music)}}
The music of the Classical period is characterized by [[homophonic texture]], or an obvious [[melody]] with [[accompaniment]].  These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music.  Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced [[opera]] and other sung forms (such as [[oratorio]]) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition.  However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).

[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s compositions characterized music of the classical era.]]
Along with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].  In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, [[Alberti bass]] (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice.  The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], the [[symphony]], and the [[concerto]], though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in [[music theory]].  All three derive from [[sonata form]], which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.

The early Classical period was ushered in by the [[Mannheim School]], which included such composers as [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Franz Xaver Richter]], [[Carl Stamitz]], and [[Christian Cannabich]]. It exerted a profound influence on [[Joseph Haydn]] and, through him, on all subsequent European music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.

[[Image:Siegfried - Heinrich Gudehus.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The title character from a 19th-century performance of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'']]
In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and in the role of concerts as part of [[urban culture|urban]] society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex&nbsp;– and often much longer&nbsp;– musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[César Franck|Franck]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].

Sub-Saharan African music is by a strong rhythmic interest that exhibits common characteristics in all regions of this vast territory, so that Arthur Morris Jones (1889–1980) has described the many local approaches as constituting one main system.
C. K.  also affirms the profound homogeneity of approach. West African rhythmic techniques carried over the Atlantic were fundamental ingredients in various musical styles of the Americas: [[samba]], [[forró]], [[maracatu]] and [[Coco (music)|coco]] in Brazil, Afro-Cuban music and Afro-American musical genres such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]], [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop]] and [[rock and roll]] were thereby of immense importance in 20th-century popular music.{{Clarify|date=February 2018}}<!--What has any of this to do with extra-European \"classical\" music?-->

[[Byzantine music]] (Greek: Βυζαντινή Μουσική) is the music of the Byzantine Empire composed to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music. Greek and foreign historians agree that the ecclesiastical tones and in general the whole system of Byzantine music is closely related to the ancient Greek system. It remains the oldest genre of extant music, of which the manner of performance and (with increasing accuracy from the 5th century onwards) the names of the composers, and sometimes the particulars of each musical work's circumstances, are known.

Nidel (p. 10)</ref> Early Indian musical tradition also speaks of three accents and vocal music known as \"Samagan\" (Sama meaning melody and Gan meaning to sing).<ref>The Music of India By Jamila Massey, Reginald Massey (p. 13)</ref> The classical music of India includes two major traditions: the southern [[Carnatic music]] and the northern [[Hindustani classical music]]. India's classical music tradition is millennia long and remains important to the lives of Indians today as a source of religious inspiration, cultural expression, and entertainment.

Indian classical music (marga) is monophonic, and based on a single melody line or [[raga]] rhythmically organized through [[Tala (music)|talas]]. Carnatic music is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are a lot of songs emphasising love and other social issues. In contrast to Carnatic music, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, Vedic philosophy and native Indian sounds but also by the Persian performance practices of the Afghan Mughals. The origins of Indian classical music can be found from the oldest of scriptures, part of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas describes music at length.

===China===
{{Main|Chinese classical music}}
Chinese classical music is the traditional art or court music of China. It has a long history stretching for more than three thousand years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres.  Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5+7 = 12) as does European-influenced music.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===South Carolina===
US&nbsp;501 in South Carolina is a north&ndash;south [[United States highway]] that traverses {{convert|73.8|mi}}; it is one of main routes to the [[Grand Strand]]. US{{nbsp}}501 begins at [[U.S. Route 17 Business (Myrtle Beach, South Carolina)|US 17 Bus.]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. From [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] to [[Marion, South Carolina|Marion]], US 501 is a multilane highway, some sections [[dual carriageway|divided]], some [[single carriageway|undivided]], mostly with [[at-grade intersection]]s but having a number of [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s along the length. The first of these interchanges is with US 17, which is a cloverleaf interchanges that includes railroad crossings at the ramps along the east side. After the bridge over the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] it has two more interchanges with local roads. Next there is an unusual [[interchange (road)#Hybrid four-way interchanges|hybrid interchange]] with [[South Carolina Highway 31]], similar to a [[partial cloverleaf interchange#Clover-stack|cloverstack]], with elements of a [[interchange (road)#Trumpet interchange|trumpet interchange]], in which two [[overpass#Highway and road|flyover]] ramps from SC&nbsp;31 to US&nbsp;501 [[right- and left-hand traffic#Right-hand traffic|exit left]] from SC&nbsp;31 and wrap around the interchange's loop ramps. After this interchange, this limited-access portion comes to an end. US{{nbsp}}501 passes through the city of [[Conway, South Carolina|Conway]] where it has a short overlap with [[U.S. Route 701]]. South of [[Aynor, South Carolina|Aynor]] it serves as the western terminus of [[South Carolina Highway 22|SC 22]], which has another unconventional interchange, and various interchanges can also be found along the road before reaching Marion, where US 501 bypasses the town to the east. North of Marion, US 501 meets [[South Carolina Highway 38|SC 38]], a connector to [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]]. From SC 38, US 501 heads to the northeast, meeting [[U.S. Route 301 in South Carolina|US 301]] in [[Latta, South Carolina|Latta]]. US 301 merges with US 501, forming a concurrency through [[Dillon, South Carolina|Dillon]] to the [[North Carolina]] border, where it passes [[South Of The Border (attraction)|South of the Border]] prior to simultaneously exiting South Carolina and interchanging with [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]] near [[Hamer, South Carolina|Hamer]] in [[Dillon County, South Carolina|Dillon County]].

[[File:15-501 in Durham, NC.jpg|US 15-501 turns left in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]|thumb|left]]
US&nbsp;501 is a north–south [[United States highway]] that traverses the majority of [[North Carolina]] in [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[U.S. Route 15 in North Carolina|US&nbsp;15]], known as \"15-501\" (\"Fifteen Five-o-one\"). It enters North Carolina at the [[South Carolina]] state line with an intersection of [[Interstate 95 in North Carolina|Interstate 95]] (I-95) while overlapping [[U.S. Route 301 in North Carolina|US 301]], near [[South of the Border (attraction)|South of the Border]]. It goes northwest through [[Rowland, North Carolina|Rowland]] where the overlap with US 301 terminates, and then travels through [[Raemon, North Carolina|Raemon]] to [[Laurinburg, North Carolina|Laurinburg]].  Once at Laurinburg, it overlaps briefly with [[Interstate 74 in North Carolina|I-74]]/[[U.S. Route 74|US 74]] before connecting with [[U.S. Route 15 in North Carolina|US 15]].  The majority of the route, to this point, is a two-lane rural road.<ref name=google2/>

Merging with US 15, it becomes what is known by local residents as \"15-501\" (\"Fifteen Five-o-one\"), a concurrency that extends for {{convert|106|mi|km}} across central North Carolina. After Laurinburg it goes north to [[Aberdeen, North Carolina|Aberdeen]], linking briefly with [[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|US 1]] before continuing to [[Pinehurst, North Carolina|Pinehurst]].  In Pinehurst, 15-501 goes through a [[roundabout]] then continues north through [[Carthage, North Carolina|Carthage]], then back to US&nbsp;1.  After traveling through [[Sanford, North Carolina|Sanford]] on another brief concurrency with US&nbsp;1, it exits off the freeway and goes due north to [[Pittsboro, North Carolina|Pittsboro]].  After Pittsboro, 15-501 goes through Chapel Hill and then into Durham. [[North Carolina Department of Transportation|NCDOT]] has been trying to remedy traffic problems by making the route a [[superstreet]] for better traffic flow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.gov/doh/preconstruct/traffic/congestion/docs/superstreet.pdf |title=NCDOT: Super Street |accessdate=February 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528020114/http://www.ncdot.gov/doh/preconstruct/traffic/congestion/docs/superstreet.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2010 }}</ref>  In Durham, 15-501 upgrades to an urban [[freeway]], allowing for quick access to Interstate 85, and from south Durham to north; the freeway ends merging into [[Interstate 85 in North Carolina|I-85]].  At exit 176B on I-85, US 501 splits off towards [[Roxboro, North Carolina|Roxboro]], while US&nbsp;15 continues with I-85 towards [[Oxford, North Carolina|Oxford]].<ref name=google2/>

After Durham, US 501 goes north to Roxboro, then into [[South Boston, Virginia]] after crossing the state line; the majority of this section is a four-lane expressway.<ref name=google2/>

====North Carolina to Lynchburg====
[[Image:US501 Northern Terminus Buena Vista VA.JPG|thumb|right|Northern terminus of US 501 at US 60 in Buena Vista, Virginia]]
US 501 enters [[Halifax County, Virginia]] south of Cluster Springs.  The U.S. Highway is a two-lane road at the North Carolina state line but immediately expands to a four-lane divided highway named Huell Matthews Highway.  US 501 parallels the [[Mayo River (Dan River)|Mayo River]] north to the hamlet of Mayo, where the highway meets the western end of [[Virginia State Route 96|SR 96]] (Virgilina Road) and crosses the [[Hyco River]].  The U.S. Highway passes through Cluster Springs to the community of [[Riverdale, Halifax County, Virginia|Riverdale]] just south of South Boston.  US 501 becomes an undivided highway and intersects [[U.S. Route 58|US 58]] and [[U.S. Route 360|US 360]], which together head west as Philpott Road and east as Bill Tuck Highway.  US 501 crosses the [[Dan River]] into the town of South Boston.  Just north of the river, the highway has a grade crossing of [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s Clover Spur, which follows the former [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]]&ndash;[[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] rail line, and splits into a [[one-way pair]]: Broad Street northbound and Main Street southbound.  Both directions intersect [[Virginia State Route 304|SR 304]] (Seymour Drive).  When Main Street veers northeast as two-way [[Virginia State Route 129|SR 129]], southbound US 501 continues on two-way Wilborn Avenue to the northern end of the one-way pair.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps US 501 VA\"/>

US 501 continues through South Boston on Wilborn Avenue, a five-lane road with center turn lane.  The U.S. Highway becomes four-lane divided Halifax Road at Hamilton Boulevard.  US 501 receives the northern end of SR 129 (Old Halifax Road) shortly before leaving the town of South Boston.  The U.S. Highway enters the town of [[Halifax, Virginia|Halifax]] and becomes Main Street, a three-lane road with center turn lane, at its grade crossing of Norfolk Southern's [[Durham District (Norfolk Southern Railway)|Durham District]].  US 501 continues to the county courthouse, where the highway intersects the very short [[Virginia State Route 349|SR 349]] (Edmunds Boulevard) and [[Virginia State Route 360|SR 360]] (Mountain Road), which [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with the U.S. Highway through the northern part of the town.  The two highways diverge: SR 360 heads northeast as Bethel Road and US 501 heads northwest as two-lane L.P. Bailey Memorial Highway. which crosses Banister Lake, an impoundment of the [[Banister River]], as it leaves the town of Halifax.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps US 501 VA\"/>

US 501 passes through [[Volens, Virginia|Volens]] and [[Acorn, Virginia|Acorn]] on its way to the hamlet of North Halifax, where the highway begins to run concurrently with [[Virginia State Route 40|SR 40]] (Stage Coach Road).  The highways cross the [[Roanoke River]] into the town of [[Brookneal, Virginia|Brookneal]] in [[Campbell County, Virginia|Campbell County]] and pass under Norfolk Southern's [[Altavista District]] rail line.  The highways continue as Lusardi Drive to Lynchburg Avenue in the center of town; SR 40 turns southeast while US 501 turns north west onto the street just north of the highways' grade crossing of the Durham District rail line.  US 501 leaves the town as Brookneal Highway, which parallels the rail line through the communities of Naruna and Gladys on its way to [[Rustburg, Virginia|Rustburg]], the [[county seat]] of Campbell County.  The U.S. Highway intersects [[Virginia State Route 24|SR 24]] (Colonial Highway) at the southern edge of the village.  The highways have a short concurrency before SR 24 continues east as Village Highway and US 501 heads northwest as Campbell Highway.  North of Rustburg, US 501 expands to a four-lane divided highway into the [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] of Lynchburg, where the highway meets [[U.S. Route 29 in Virginia|US 29]] and [[U.S. Route 460 in Virginia|US 460]] (Richmond Highway) at a [[partial cloverleaf]] interchange.  [[#Lynchburg business route|US 501 Business]] and [[U.S. Route 460 Business (Lynchburg, Virginia)|US 460 Business]] head straight on Campbell Avenue while US 501 joins the freeway heading southwest.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps US 501 VA\"/>

====Lynchburg to Buena Vista====
[[File:2017-06-13 17 33 01 View south along U.S. Route 501 (Beech Avenue) at Factory Street in Buena Vista, Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|View south along US 501 just south of US 60 in Buena Vista]]
US 501 runs concurrently with US 29 and US 460 southwest along the northern slope of Candlers Mountain to a [[full Y interchange]] where US 501 heads northwest from the freeway.  The U.S. Highway has an intersection with [[Virginia State Route 128|SR 128]] (Mayflower Drive) and Candlers Mountain Road just east of the highway's crossing of Norfolk Southern's [[Danville District]].  SR 128 joins US 501 on Candlers Mountain Road between the intersection and the highway's [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 29 Business (Lynchburg, Virginia)|US 29 Business]] (Lynchburg Expressway).  US 501 exits onto the expressway while SR 128 continues west to its terminus.  US 501 and US 29 Business head southwest along the freeway until the business route exits onto Wards Road to head toward [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]].  US 501 curves northwest and has a cloverleaf interchange with US 460 Business (Timberlake Road), crosses Norfolk Southern's [[Blue Ridge District]], and has a [[diamond interchange]] with Graves Mill Road.  The freeway ends at [[U.S. Route 221 in Virginia|US 221]] (Lakeside Drive).  US 501 heads north along Old Forest Road as a five-lane road with center turn lane before turning onto a two-lane segment of the Lynchburg Expressway.  This segment has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Wiggington Road before ending at US 501 Business (Boonsboro Road).<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps US 501 VA\"/>

US 501 heads northwest on two-lane Boonsboro Road, which becomes Lee Jackson Highway when it exits the city of Lynchburg into [[Bedford County, Virginia|Bedford County]].  The U.S. Highway curvaceously crosses Fleming Mountain and descends into the [[James River Gorge]] at Coleman Falls.  US 501 follows the south bank of the river through [[Big Island, Virginia|Big Island]], where the highway meets the northern end of [[Virginia State Route 122|SR 122]] (Big Island Highway) and has an interchange with the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]].  North of Big Island, the U.S. Highway crosses the river and immediately intersects [[Virginia State Route 130|SR 130]] (Elon Road) on the [[Amherst County, Virginia|Amherst County]] side.  The two highways have a curvaceous crossing of the spine of the Blue Ridge Mountains before descending to the town of [[Glasgow, Virginia|Glasgow]] at the mouth of the [[Maury River]].  The two routes follow the river upstream a short distance before SR 130 (Wert Faulkner Highway) crosses the river into the town.  US 501, now named Glasgow Highway, parallels the river and Norfolk Southern's [[Roanoke District]] rail line north to the city of Buena Vista, which the highway enters as Magnolia Avenue.  South of the downtown area, US 501 veers onto Sycamore Street while [[#Buena Vista business route|US 501 Business]] continues along Magnolia Avenue.  At 22nd Street, the U.S. Highway veers onto Beech Avenue, which receives the northern end of US 501 Business (Park Avenue) west of [[Southern Virginia University]].  Two blocks to the north, US 501 reaches its northern terminus at US 60 (29th Street).<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps US 501 VA\"/>

==History==
===South Carolina===
Established in 1935 as in extension from [[North Carolina]].  US&nbsp;501 replaced part of [[U.S. Route 117 in South Carolina|US&nbsp;117]] between [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] to [[Socastee, South Carolina|Socastee]], then from there through [[Conway, South Carolina|Conway]], [[Marion, South Carolina|Marion]], and [[Latta, South Carolina|Latta]] on what was [[South Carolina Highway 38|SC&nbsp;38]].  North of Latta, it overlapped with [[U.S. Route 301 in South Carolina|US&nbsp;301]], through [[Dillon, South Carolina|Dillon]], and into North Carolina.

During the 1940s, because of the need for a more direct route to [[Myrtle Beach Air Force Base]] from Conway, 2-lane US&nbsp;501 was built through the Buist Tract owned by Southern Kraft Company (later part of [[International Paper]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hcac.lyrasistechnology.org/islandora/object/hcac%253A2786/datastream/OBJ/download/Independent_Republic_Quarterly__2006__Vol__40__No__1-4.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFjKC3C_n8JgvEaZ3Dqx9u_ovAyzQ&bvm=bv.119028448,d.cWw|title=History of the 'Infamous Buist Tract' and Its Wildfires|first1=Thomas J.|last1=Straka|first2=David W.|last2=Dantzler|first3=Greg K.|last3=Yarrow|first4=J.

In 1950, US&nbsp;501 was moved onto new construction between Conway and [[Aynor, South Carolina|Aynor]], its old alignment renumbered to [[South Carolina Highway 319|SC&nbsp;319]].  By 1964, US&nbsp;501 was moved to its current southern bypass from downtown Conway, creating [[U.S. Route 501 Business (Conway, South Carolina)|US&nbsp;501 Bus]].  By 1990, US&nbsp;501 was moved to its current eastern bypass from downtown Marion, creating another [[U.S. Route 501 Business (Marion, South Carolina)|US&nbsp;501 Bus]].

===North Carolina===
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}
When US&nbsp;501 was established in 1927, it was aligned along [[#North Carolina Highway 13 (1921-1930)|North Carolina Highway 13]] (NC&nbsp;13) from Durham north through Roxboro to the Virginia state line.

In 1934, it was overlapped with US&nbsp;15 from Durham south to Laurinburg. From there, it went southeast to Rowland and then to the South Carolina border.  This extension south replaced [[North Carolina Highway 22|NC 22]], [[North Carolina Highway 71|NC 71]], and [[North Carolina Highway 241|NC 241]].

In 1953, US 501 was bypassed around Chapel Hill.  In 1956 or 1957, US 501 was bypassed west of Sanford.  Between 1960-1962, US 501 was bypassed around Laurinburg.<ref name=NCRoads.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.vahighways.com/ncannex/route-log/us015501.html|title=NCRoads.com: U.S. 15 and 501|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}{{self-published source|date=June 2016}}</ref>

===South Carolina===
US&nbsp;501 in South Carolina is a north&ndash;south [[United States highway]] that traverses {{convert|73.8|mi}}; it is one of main routes to the [[Grand Strand]]. US{{nbsp}}501 begins at [[U.S. Route 17 Business (Myrtle Beach, South Carolina)|US 17 Bus.]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. From [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] to [[Marion, South Carolina|Marion]], US 501 is a multilane highway, some sections [[dual carriageway|divided]], some [[single carriageway|undivided]], mostly with [[at-grade intersection]]s but having a number of [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s along the length. The first of these interchanges is with US 17, which is a cloverleaf interchanges that includes railroad crossings at the ramps along the east side. After the bridge over the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] it has two more interchanges with local roads. Next there is an unusual [[interchange (road)#Hybrid four-way interchanges|hybrid interchange]] with [[South Carolina Highway 31]], similar to a [[partial cloverleaf interchange#Clover-stack|cloverstack]], with elements of a [[interchange (road)#Trumpet interchange|trumpet interchange]], in which two [[overpass#Highway and road|flyover]] ramps from SC&nbsp;31 to US&nbsp;501 [[right- and left-hand traffic#Right-hand traffic|exit left]] from SC&nbsp;31 and wrap around the interchange's loop ramps. After this interchange, this limited-access portion comes to an end. US{{nbsp}}501 passes through the city of [[Conway, South Carolina|Conway]] where it has a short overlap with [[U.S. Route 701]]. South of [[Aynor, South Carolina|Aynor]] it serves as the western terminus of [[South Carolina Highway 22|SC 22]], which has another unconventional interchange, and various interchanges can also be found along the road before reaching Marion, where US 501 bypasses the town to the east. North of Marion, US 501 meets [[South Carolina Highway 38|SC 38]], a connector to [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]]. From SC 38, US 501 heads to the northeast, meeting [[U.S. Route 301 in South Carolina|US 301]] in [[Latta, South Carolina|Latta]]. US 301 merges with US 501, forming a concurrency through [[Dillon, South Carolina|Dillon]] to the [[North Carolina]] border, where it passes [[South Of The Border (attraction)|South of the Border]] prior to simultaneously exiting South Carolina and interchanging with [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]] near [[Hamer, South Carolina|Hamer]] in [[Dillon County, South Carolina|Dillon County]].

[[File:15-501 in Durham, NC.jpg|US 15-501 turns left in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]|thumb|left]]
US&nbsp;501 is a north–south [[United States highway]] that traverses the majority of [[North Carolina]] in [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[U.S. Route 15 in North Carolina|US&nbsp;15]], known as \"15-501\" (\"Fifteen Five-o-one\"). It enters North Carolina at the [[South Carolina]] state line with an intersection of [[Interstate 95 in North Carolina|Interstate 95]] (I-95) while overlapping [[U.S. Route 301 in North Carolina|US 301]], near [[South of the Border (attraction)|South of the Border]]. It goes northwest through [[Rowland, North Carolina|Rowland]] where the overlap with US 301 terminates, and then travels through [[Raemon, North Carolina|Raemon]] to [[Laurinburg, North Carolina|Laurinburg]].  Once at Laurinburg, it overlaps briefly with [[Interstate 74 in North Carolina|I-74]]/[[U.S. Route 74|US 74]] before connecting with [[U.S. Route 15 in North Carolina|US 15]].  The majority of the route, to this point, is a two-lane rural road.<ref name=google2/>

Merging with US 15, it becomes what is known by local residents as \"15-501\" (\"Fifteen Five-o-one\"), a concurrency that extends for {{convert|106|mi|km}} across central North Carolina. After Laurinburg it goes north to [[Aberdeen, North Carolina|Aberdeen]], linking briefly with [[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|US 1]] before continuing to [[Pinehurst, North Carolina|Pinehurst]].  In Pinehurst, 15-501 goes through a [[roundabout]] then continues north through [[Carthage, North Carolina|Carthage]], then back to US&nbsp;1.  After traveling through [[Sanford, North Carolina|Sanford]] on another brief concurrency with US&nbsp;1, it exits off the freeway and goes due north to [[Pittsboro, North Carolina|Pittsboro]].  After Pittsboro, 15-501 goes through Chapel Hill and then into Durham. [[North Carolina Department of Transportation|NCDOT]] has been trying to remedy traffic problems by making the route a [[superstreet]] for better traffic flow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.gov/doh/preconstruct/traffic/congestion/docs/superstreet.pdf |title=NCDOT: Super Street |accessdate=February 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528020114/http://www.ncdot.gov/doh/preconstruct/traffic/congestion/docs/superstreet.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2010 }}</ref>  In Durham, 15-501 upgrades to an urban [[freeway]], allowing for quick access to Interstate 85, and from south Durham to north; the freeway ends merging into [[Interstate 85 in North Carolina|I-85]].  At exit 176B on I-85, US 501 splits off towards [[Roxboro, North Carolina|Roxboro]], while US&nbsp;15 continues with I-85 towards [[Oxford, North Carolina|Oxford]].<ref name=google2/>

After Durham, US 501 goes north to Roxboro, then into [[South Boston, Virginia]] after crossing the state line; the majority of this section is a four-lane expressway.<ref name=google2/>

====North Carolina to Lynchburg====
[[Image:US501 Northern Terminus Buena Vista VA.JPG|thumb|right|Northern terminus of US 501 at US 60 in Buena Vista, Virginia]]
US 501 enters [[Halifax County, Virginia]] south of Cluster Springs.  The U.S. Highway is a two-lane road at the North Carolina state line but immediately expands to a four-lane divided highway named Huell Matthews Highway.  US 501 parallels the [[Mayo River (Dan River)|Mayo River]] north to the hamlet of Mayo, where the highway meets the western end of [[Virginia State Route 96|SR 96]] (Virgilina Road) and crosses the [[Hyco River]].  The U.S. Highway passes through Cluster Springs to the community of [[Riverdale, Halifax County, Virginia|Riverdale]] just south of South Boston.  US 501 becomes an undivided highway and intersects [[U.S. Route 58|US 58]] and [[U.S. Route 360|US 360]], which together head west as Philpott Road and east as Bill Tuck Highway.  US 501 crosses the [[Dan River]] into the town of South Boston.  Just north of the river, the highway has a grade crossing of [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s Clover Spur, which follows the former [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]]&ndash;[[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] rail line, and splits into a [[one-way pair]]: Broad Street northbound and Main Street southbound.  Both directions intersect [[Virginia State Route 304|SR 304]] (Seymour Drive).  When Main Street veers northeast as two-way [[Virginia State Route 129|SR 129]], southbound US 501 continues on two-way Wilborn Avenue to the northern end of the one-way pair.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps US 501 VA\"/>

US 501 continues through South Boston on Wilborn Avenue, a five-lane road with center turn lane.  The U.S. Highway becomes four-lane divided Halifax Road at Hamilton Boulevard.  US 501 receives the northern end of SR 129 (Old Halifax Road) shortly before leaving the town of South Boston.  The U.S. Highway enters the town of [[Halifax, Virginia|Halifax]] and becomes Main Street, a three-lane road with center turn lane, at its grade crossing of Norfolk Southern's [[Durham District (Norfolk Southern Railway)|Durham District]].  US 501 continues to the county courthouse, where the highway intersects the very short [[Virginia State Route 349|SR 349]] (Edmunds Boulevard) and [[Virginia State Route 360|SR 360]] (Mountain Road), which [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with the U.S. Highway through the northern part of the town.  The two highways diverge: SR 360 heads northeast as Bethel Road and US 501 heads northwest as two-lane L.P. Bailey Memorial Highway. which crosses Banister Lake, an impoundment of the [[Banister River]], as it leaves the town of Halifax.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps US 501 VA\"/>

US 501 passes through [[Volens, Virginia|Volens]] and [[Acorn, Virginia|Acorn]] on its way to the hamlet of North Halifax, where the highway begins to run concurrently with [[Virginia State Route 40|SR 40]] (Stage Coach Road).  The highways cross the [[Roanoke River]] into the town of [[Brookneal, Virginia|Brookneal]] in [[Campbell County, Virginia|Campbell County]] and pass under Norfolk Southern's [[Altavista District]] rail line.  The highways continue as Lusardi Drive to Lynchburg Avenue in the center of town; SR 40 turns southeast while US 501 turns north west onto the street just north of the highways' grade crossing of the Durham District rail line.  US 501 leaves the town as Brookneal Highway, which parallels the rail line through the communities of Naruna and Gladys on its way to [[Rustburg, Virginia|Rustburg]], the [[county seat]] of Campbell County.  The U.S. Highway intersects [[Virginia State Route 24|SR 24]] (Colonial Highway) at the southern edge of the village.  The highways have a short concurrency before SR 24 continues east as Village Highway and US 501 heads northwest as Campbell Highway.  North of Rustburg, US 501 expands to a four-lane divided highway into the [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] of Lynchburg, where the highway meets [[U.S. Route 29 in Virginia|US 29]] and [[U.S. Route 460 in Virginia|US 460]] (Richmond Highway) at a [[partial cloverleaf]] interchange.  [[#Lynchburg business route|US 501 Business]] and [[U.S. Route 460 Business (Lynchburg, Virginia)|US 460 Business]] head straight on Campbell Avenue while US 501 joins the freeway heading southwest.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps US 501 VA\"/>

====Lynchburg to Buena Vista====
[[File:2017-06-13 17 33 01 View south along U.S. Route 501 (Beech Avenue) at Factory Street in Buena Vista, Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|View south along US 501 just south of US 60 in Buena Vista]]
US 501 runs concurrently with US 29 and US 460 southwest along the northern slope of Candlers Mountain to a [[full Y interchange]] where US 501 heads northwest from the freeway.  The U.S. Highway has an intersection with [[Virginia State Route 128|SR 128]] (Mayflower Drive) and Candlers Mountain Road just east of the highway's crossing of Norfolk Southern's [[Danville District]].  SR 128 joins US 501 on Candlers Mountain Road between the intersection and the highway's [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 29 Business (Lynchburg, Virginia)|US 29 Business]] (Lynchburg Expressway).  US 501 exits onto the expressway while SR 128 continues west to its terminus.  US 501 and US 29 Business head southwest along the freeway until the business route exits onto Wards Road to head toward [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]].  US 501 curves northwest and has a cloverleaf interchange with US 460 Business (Timberlake Road), crosses Norfolk Southern's [[Blue Ridge District]], and has a [[diamond interchange]] with Graves Mill Road.  The freeway ends at [[U.S. Route 221 in Virginia|US 221]] (Lakeside Drive).  US 501 heads north along Old Forest Road as a five-lane road with center turn lane before turning onto a two-lane segment of the Lynchburg Expressway.  This segment has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Wiggington Road before ending at US 501 Business (Boonsboro Road).<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps US 501 VA\"/>

US 501 heads northwest on two-lane Boonsboro Road, which becomes Lee Jackson Highway when it exits the city of Lynchburg into [[Bedford County, Virginia|Bedford County]].  The U.S. Highway curvaceously crosses Fleming Mountain and descends into the [[James River Gorge]] at Coleman Falls.  US 501 follows the south bank of the river through [[Big Island, Virginia|Big Island]], where the highway meets the northern end of [[Virginia State Route 122|SR 122]] (Big Island Highway) and has an interchange with the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]].  North of Big Island, the U.S. Highway crosses the river and immediately intersects [[Virginia State Route 130|SR 130]] (Elon Road) on the [[Amherst County, Virginia|Amherst County]] side.  The two highways have a curvaceous crossing of the spine of the Blue Ridge Mountains before descending to the town of [[Glasgow, Virginia|Glasgow]] at the mouth of the [[Maury River]].  The two routes follow the river upstream a short distance before SR 130 (Wert Faulkner Highway) crosses the river into the town.  US 501, now named Glasgow Highway, parallels the river and Norfolk Southern's [[Roanoke District]] rail line north to the city of Buena Vista, which the highway enters as Magnolia Avenue.  South of the downtown area, US 501 veers onto Sycamore Street while [[#Buena Vista business route|US 501 Business]] continues along Magnolia Avenue.  At 22nd Street, the U.S. Highway veers onto Beech Avenue, which receives the northern end of US 501 Business (Park Avenue) west of [[Southern Virginia University]].  Two blocks to the north, US 501 reaches its northern terminus at US 60 (29th Street).<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps US 501 VA\"/>

==History==
===South Carolina===
Established in 1935 as in extension from [[North Carolina]].  US&nbsp;501 replaced part of [[U.S. Route 117 in South Carolina|US&nbsp;117]] between [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] to [[Socastee, South Carolina|Socastee]], then from there through [[Conway, South Carolina|Conway]], [[Marion, South Carolina|Marion]], and [[Latta, South Carolina|Latta]] on what was [[South Carolina Highway 38|SC&nbsp;38]].  North of Latta, it overlapped with [[U.S. Route 301 in South Carolina|US&nbsp;301]], through [[Dillon, South Carolina|Dillon]], and into North Carolina.

During the 1940s, because of the need for a more direct route to [[Myrtle Beach Air Force Base]] from Conway, 2-lane US&nbsp;501 was built through the Buist Tract owned by Southern Kraft Company (later part of [[International Paper]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hcac.lyrasistechnology.org/islandora/object/hcac%253A2786/datastream/OBJ/download/Independent_Republic_Quarterly__2006__Vol__40__No__1-4.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFjKC3C_n8JgvEaZ3Dqx9u_ovAyzQ&bvm=bv.119028448,d.cWw|title=History of the 'Infamous Buist Tract' and Its Wildfires|first1=Thomas J.|last1=Straka|first2=David W.|last2=Dantzler|first3=Greg K.|last3=Yarrow|first4=J.

In 1950, US&nbsp;501 was moved onto new construction between Conway and [[Aynor, South Carolina|Aynor]], its old alignment renumbered to [[South Carolina Highway 319|SC&nbsp;319]].  By 1964, US&nbsp;501 was moved to its current southern bypass from downtown Conway, creating [[U.S. Route 501 Business (Conway, South Carolina)|US&nbsp;501 Bus]].  By 1990, US&nbsp;501 was moved to its current eastern bypass from downtown Marion, creating another [[U.S. Route 501 Business (Marion, South Carolina)|US&nbsp;501 Bus]].

===North Carolina===
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}
When US&nbsp;501 was established in 1927, it was aligned along [[#North Carolina Highway 13 (1921-1930)|North Carolina Highway 13]] (NC&nbsp;13) from Durham north through Roxboro to the Virginia state line.

In 1934, it was overlapped with US&nbsp;15 from Durham south to Laurinburg. From there, it went southeast to Rowland and then to the South Carolina border.  This extension south replaced [[North Carolina Highway 22|NC 22]], [[North Carolina Highway 71|NC 71]], and [[North Carolina Highway 241|NC 241]].

In 1953, US 501 was bypassed around Chapel Hill.  In 1956 or 1957, US 501 was bypassed west of Sanford.  Between 1960-1962, US 501 was bypassed around Laurinburg.<ref name=NCRoads.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.vahighways.com/ncannex/route-log/us015501.html|title=NCRoads.com: U.S. 15 and 501|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}{{self-published source|date=June 2016}}</ref>

'''[[Music]]''' is found in every known culture and religion, past and present, varying widely between times and places. Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently, the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallin|first=Nils Lennart|title=The Origins of Music|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-262-73143-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&printsec=frontcover |author2=Steven Brown |author3=[[Björn Merker]]}}</ref><ref>Krause, Bernie (2012). ''The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places''. New York: Little Brown/Hachette </ref>

A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, access to technology and what religion is believed.  The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. \"[[Music history]]\" is the distinct subfield of [[musicology]] and history which studies music (particularly [[Art music|Western art music]]) from a chronological perspective.

===Prehistoric music===
{{Main|Prehistoric music}}
Prehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in [[Literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Historical geology|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.

Prehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional [[Native American music]] of preliterate tribes and [[Australian Aboriginal music]]. However, it is more common to refer to the \"prehistoric\" music of non-European continents – especially that which still survives – as [[Folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring [[sound]]s and [[rhythm]]s. Human music may echo these [[phenomena]] using [[patterns]], [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and [[tonality]]. Even today, some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]]. In some instances, this feature is related to [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|shamanistic beliefs or practice]].<ref name=onom>[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}</ref><ref name=soy>Diószegi 1960: 203</ref> It may also serve entertainment (game)<ref name=natt>Nattiez: 5</ref><ref name=desch>{{cite web|url=http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm|title=Inuit Throat-Singing|first=Bruno |last=Deschênes |date=January 3, 2002|website=www.mustrad.org.uk|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> or practical (luring animals in hunt)<ref name=natt/> functions.

It is probable that the first [[musical instrument]] was the [[human voice]] itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from singing, [[Hum (sound)|humming]] and [[whistling]] through to [[Click consonant|clicking]], [[cough]]ing and [[yawn]]ing.

===Ancient music===
{{Main|Ancient music}}
[[Image:Harp-Sassanid.png|thumb|[[Sassanid]] women playing [[Chang (instrument)]] in [[Taq-e Bostan]], [[Iran]] (c. 379 AD)]]
\"Ancient music\" is the name given to the music that follows music of the prehistoric era. The \"oldest known song\" was written in [[cuneiform]], dating to 3400 years ago from [[Ugarit]] in [[Syria]]. It was a part of the [[Hurrian songs]], more specifically Hurrian hymn no. 6. It was deciphered by Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and was demonstrated to be composed in harmonies of thirds, like ancient ''[[gymel]]'',<ref>Kilmer, Crocker, Brown, ''Sounds from Silence'', 1976, Bit Enki, Berkeley, Calif., {{LCCN|76-16729}}</ref> and also was written using a [[Pythagorean tuning]] of the [[diatonic scale]]. The oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world, is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], dated to either the 1st or the 2nd century AD.

Double pipes, such as those used by the [[Music of ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], and ancient bagpipes, as well as a review of ancient drawings on vases and walls, etc., and ancient writings (such as in Aristotle, ''Problems,'' Book XIX.12) which described musical techniques of the time, indicate [[polyphony]]. One pipe in the aulos pairs (double flutes) likely served as a [[Drone (music)|drone]] or \"keynote,\" while the other played melodic passages. Instruments, such as the seven holed flute and various types of stringed instruments have been recovered from the [[Indus valley civilization]] archaeological sites.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yySNDP9XVggC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=seven+holed+flute+and+various+types+of+stringed+instruments|title=The Music of India|first1=Reginald|last1=Massey|first2=Jamila|last2=Massey|date=28 March 1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-81-7017-332-8}}</ref>

[[Indian classical music]] (''marga'') can be found from the scriptures of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas, describes music at length.

[[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of King [[Ravana]]. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world history.

The history of musical development in Iran ([[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to the days of the [[Elamite Empire]] (2500–644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The [[Sassanid]] period (AD 226–651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.

The [[Early music]] era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including [[Asian music]], Persian music, [[music of India]], [[Jewish music]], [[Greek music]], [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]], the [[music of Mesopotamia]], the [[music of Egypt]], and [[Muslim music]].

'''Greece'''{{Main|Music of Greece}}
Greek written history extends far back into [[Ancient Greece]], and was a major part of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons.  Instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked [[string instrument]], the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music was an important part of education in ancient Greece, and boys were taught music starting at age six.

===Biblical period===
{{main|History of music in the biblical period}}
[[Image:David-harp.jpg|thumb|<center>\"David with his harp\" [[Paris Psalter]],<br> c. 960, [[Constantinople]]</center>]]
According to [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was named by the Bible as the inventor of musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The [[Hebrews]] were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the first mention of music is in the account of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s interview with [[Jacob]] (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the [[Red Sea]], [[Moses]] and the [[children of Israel]] sang their song of [[Book of Exodus|deliverance]] (Ex. 15). But the period of [[Samuel]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]] was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]]. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the [[prophet]]s (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). [[Solomon's Temple]], however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1–6). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4–6; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).<ref>''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', \"Music\", 1897</ref>

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] with those of the later cultures of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a \"social phenomenon called [[litany]],\" a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, \"Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:\"<ref name=JRT>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html \"A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional\"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.</ref>

:While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the \"father of all such as handle the harp and pipe\", the [[Pentateuch]] is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of [[Israel]]. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. \"One finds in the biblical text\", writes Alfred Sendrey, \"a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.\" This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]].<ref name=JRT/>

===Early music===
{{Main|Early music}}
Early music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], in 476 AD, until the end of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] in the middle of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known.  What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.

===Medieval music===
{{Main|Medieval music}}
While musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early [[Medieval]] era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the [[plainsong]] liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death.  Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend.  Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and [[Charlemagne]].

During the 9th century several important developments took place.  First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy.  Second, the earliest [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as [[organum]].  Third, and of greatest significance for music history, [[music notation|notation]] was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.

Several schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100:  the [[St. Martial school]] of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, which included the composers [[Léonin]] and [[Pérotin]], and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the [[Codex Calixtinus]]; and the English school, the music of which survives in the [[Worcester Fragments]] and the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].  Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the [[troubadour]]s, [[trouvère]]s and [[minnesinger|Minnesänger]].  Much of the later secular music of the early [[Renaissance]] evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the early 13th century.

Forms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the [[motet]], [[conductus]], [[discant]], and [[Clausula (music)|clausulae]].  One unusual development was the ''[[Geisslerlieder]]'', the music of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the [[Black Death]], around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music.  Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the ''[[ars nova]]'', which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and [[aesthetics]].  Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the [[formes fixes]]:  the [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], the [[virelai]], the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], the [[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], which correspond to poetic forms of the same names.  Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment:  famous composers include [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Francesco Landini]].

===Renaissance music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->
{{Main|Renaissance music}}
[[Image:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]

The beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in [[Italy]], but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]].  The style of the [[Burgundian school|Burgundian]] composers, as the first generation of the [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century  ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and contained clear, singable melody and balanced [[polyphony]] in all voices.  The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], and [[Antoine Busnois]].

By the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the [[Low Countries]] and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the [[Medici]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[Sforza]] families).  They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate.  Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], and the [[laude]]; secular forms included the [[chanson]], the [[frottola]], and later the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].

The invention of [[printing]] had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included [[Johannes Ockeghem]], who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of [[canon (music)|canonical]] devices; [[Jacob Obrecht]], one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and [[Josquin des Prez]], probably the most famous composer in Europe before [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of [[counterpoint]]; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of [[Nicolas Gombert]], whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the [[canzona]] and the [[ricercar]], ultimately culminating in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[fugue|fugal]] forms.

By the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident:  a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the [[Counter-Reformation]] [[Council of Trent]], exemplified in the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]; a trend towards complexity and [[chromaticism]] in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the [[avant-garde]] style of the [[Ferrara School]] of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]] and the late century madrigalist [[Carlo Gesualdo]]; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]], which used the architecture of the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] to create [[polychoral|antiphonal]] contrasts.  The music of the Venetian school included the development of [[orchestration]], ornamented instrumental parts, and [[basso continuo|continuo]] bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600.  Famous composers in [[Venice]] included the Gabrielis, [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi]], one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.

Most parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century.  In England, composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]] wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes:  famous composers included [[Thomas Morley]], [[John Wilbye]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]]. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]] writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar.  Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant [[chorale]]s, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there).  In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of [[organ (music)|organ]] music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]].  France developed a unique style of musical diction known as [[musique mesurée]], used in secular chansons, with composers such as [[Guillaume Costeley]] and [[Claude Le Jeune]] prominent in the movement.

One of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]], who ironically had a reactionary intent:  dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks.  Chief among them were [[Vincenzo Galilei]], the father of the astronomer, and [[Giulio Caccini]].  The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as [[monody]], and a corresponding staged dramatic form:  a form known today as [[opera]].  The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.

Music prior to 1600 was [[musical mode|modal]] rather than [[Tonality|tonal]].  Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on [[mode (music)|modes]] by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], led directly to the development of common practice tonality.  The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old [[church modes]], a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive.  Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the [[common practice period]].

The Baroque era took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe and, during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}<!--But not in the Renaissance? Or what?--> German, Italian, French, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, and English Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.<ref name=\"sdsu\">{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D. |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}</ref> The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented.

===Classical music era===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->
{{Main|Classical period (music)}}
The music of the Classical period is characterized by [[homophonic texture]], or an obvious [[melody]] with [[accompaniment]].  These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music.  Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced [[opera]] and other sung forms (such as [[oratorio]]) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition.  However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).

[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s compositions characterized music of the classical era.]]
Along with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].  In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, [[Alberti bass]] (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice.  The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], the [[symphony]], and the [[concerto]], though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in [[music theory]].  All three derive from [[sonata form]], which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.

The early Classical period was ushered in by the [[Mannheim School]], which included such composers as [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Franz Xaver Richter]], [[Carl Stamitz]], and [[Christian Cannabich]]. It exerted a profound influence on [[Joseph Haydn]] and, through him, on all subsequent European music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.

===Romantic music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->

[[Image:Siegfried - Heinrich Gudehus.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The title character from a 19th-century performance of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'']]
In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and in the role of concerts as part of [[urban culture|urban]] society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex&nbsp;– and often much longer&nbsp;– musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[César Franck|Franck]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].

Sub-Saharan African music is by a strong rhythmic interest that exhibits common characteristics in all regions of this vast territory, so that Arthur Morris Jones (1889–1980) has described the many local approaches as constituting one main system.
C. K.  also affirms the profound homogeneity of approach. West African rhythmic techniques carried over the Atlantic were fundamental ingredients in various musical styles of the Americas: [[samba]], [[forró]], [[maracatu]] and [[Coco (music)|coco]] in Brazil, Afro-Cuban music and Afro-American musical genres such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]], [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop]] and [[rock and roll]] were thereby of immense importance in 20th-century popular music.{{Clarify|date=February 2018}}<!--What has any of this to do with extra-European \"classical\" music?-->

[[Byzantine music]] (Greek: Βυζαντινή Μουσική) is the music of the Byzantine Empire composed to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music. Greek and foreign historians agree that the ecclesiastical tones and in general the whole system of Byzantine music is closely related to the ancient Greek system. It remains the oldest genre of extant music, of which the manner of performance and (with increasing accuracy from the 5th century onwards) the names of the composers, and sometimes the particulars of each musical work's circumstances, are known.

India's classical music tradition is millennia long and remains important to the lives of Indians today as a source of religious inspiration, cultural expression, and entertainment.

Indian classical music (marga) is monophonic, and based on a single melody line or [[raga]] rhythmically organized through [[Tala (music)|talas]]. Carnatic music is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are a lot of songs emphasising love and other social issues. In contrast to Carnatic music, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, Vedic philosophy and native Indian sounds but also by the Persian performance practices of the Afghan Mughals. The origins of Indian classical music can be found from the oldest of scriptures, part of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas describes music at length.

===China===
{{Main|Chinese classical music}}
Chinese classical music is the traditional art or court music of China. It has a long history stretching for more than three thousand years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres.  Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5+7 = 12) as does European-influenced music.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''[[Music]]''' is found in every known culture and religion, past and present, varying widely between times and places. Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently, the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallin|first=Nils Lennart|title=The Origins of Music|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-262-73143-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&printsec=frontcover |author2=Steven Brown |author3=[[Björn Merker]]}}</ref><ref>Krause, Bernie (2012). ''The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places''. New York: Little Brown/Hachette </ref>

A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, access to technology and what religion is believed.  The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. \"[[Music history]]\" is the distinct subfield of [[musicology]] and history which studies music (particularly [[Art music|Western art music]]) from a chronological perspective.

===Prehistoric music===
{{Main|Prehistoric music}}
Prehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in [[Literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Historical geology|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.

Prehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional [[Native American music]] of preliterate tribes and [[Australian Aboriginal music]]. However, it is more common to refer to the \"prehistoric\" music of non-European continents – especially that which still survives – as [[Folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring [[sound]]s and [[rhythm]]s. Human music may echo these [[phenomena]] using [[patterns]], [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and [[tonality]]. Even today, some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]]. In some instances, this feature is related to [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|shamanistic beliefs or practice]].<ref name=onom>[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}</ref><ref name=soy>Diószegi 1960: 203</ref> It may also serve entertainment (game)<ref name=natt>Nattiez: 5</ref><ref name=desch>{{cite web|url=http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm|title=Inuit Throat-Singing|first=Bruno |last=Deschênes |date=January 3, 2002|website=www.mustrad.org.uk|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> or practical (luring animals in hunt)<ref name=natt/> functions.

===Ancient music===
{{Main|Ancient music}}
[[Image:Harp-Sassanid.png|thumb|[[Sassanid]] women playing [[Chang (instrument)]] in [[Taq-e Bostan]], [[Iran]] (c. 379 AD)]]
\"Ancient music\" is the name given to the music that follows music of the prehistoric era. The \"oldest known song\" was written in [[cuneiform]], dating to 3400 years ago from [[Ugarit]] in [[Syria]]. It was a part of the [[Hurrian songs]], more specifically Hurrian hymn no. 6. It was deciphered by Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and was demonstrated to be composed in harmonies of thirds, like ancient ''[[gymel]]'',<ref>Kilmer, Crocker, Brown, ''Sounds from Silence'', 1976, Bit Enki, Berkeley, Calif., {{LCCN|76-16729}}</ref> and also was written using a [[Pythagorean tuning]] of the [[diatonic scale]]. The oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world, is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], dated to either the 1st or the 2nd century AD.

Double pipes, such as those used by the [[Music of ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], and ancient bagpipes, as well as a review of ancient drawings on vases and walls, etc., and ancient writings (such as in Aristotle, ''Problems,'' Book XIX.12) which described musical techniques of the time, indicate [[polyphony]]. One pipe in the aulos pairs (double flutes) likely served as a [[Drone (music)|drone]] or \"keynote,\" while the other played melodic passages. Instruments, such as the seven holed flute and various types of stringed instruments have been recovered from the [[Indus valley civilization]] archaeological sites.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yySNDP9XVggC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=seven+holed+flute+and+various+types+of+stringed+instruments|title=The Music of India|first1=Reginald|last1=Massey|first2=Jamila|last2=Massey|date=28 March 1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-81-7017-332-8}}</ref>

[[Indian classical music]] (''marga'') can be found from the scriptures of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas, describes music at length.

[[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of King [[Ravana]]. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world history.

The history of musical development in Iran ([[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to the days of the [[Elamite Empire]] (2500–644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The [[Sassanid]] period (AD 226–651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.

The [[Early music]] era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including [[Asian music]], Persian music, [[music of India]], [[Jewish music]], [[Greek music]], [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]], the [[music of Mesopotamia]], the [[music of Egypt]], and [[Muslim music]].

'''Greece'''{{Main|Music of Greece}}
Greek written history extends far back into [[Ancient Greece]], and was a major part of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons.  Instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked [[string instrument]], the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music was an important part of education in ancient Greece, and boys were taught music starting at age six.

===Biblical period===
{{main|History of music in the biblical period}}
[[Image:David-harp.jpg|thumb|<center>\"David with his harp\" [[Paris Psalter]],<br> c. 960, [[Constantinople]]</center>]]
According to [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was named by the Bible as the inventor of musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The [[Hebrews]] were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the first mention of music is in the account of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s interview with [[Jacob]] (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the [[Red Sea]], [[Moses]] and the [[children of Israel]] sang their song of [[Book of Exodus|deliverance]] (Ex. 15). But the period of [[Samuel]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]] was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]]. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the [[prophet]]s (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). [[Solomon's Temple]], however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1–6). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4–6; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).<ref>''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', \"Music\", 1897</ref>

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] with those of the later cultures of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a \"social phenomenon called [[litany]],\" a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, \"Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:\"<ref name=JRT>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html \"A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional\"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.</ref>

:While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the \"father of all such as handle the harp and pipe\", the [[Pentateuch]] is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of [[Israel]]. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. \"One finds in the biblical text\", writes Alfred Sendrey, \"a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.\" This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]].<ref name=JRT/>

===Early music===
{{Main|Early music}}
Early music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], in 476 AD, until the end of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] in the middle of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known.  What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.

===Medieval music===
{{Main|Medieval music}}
While musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early [[Medieval]] era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the [[plainsong]] liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death.  Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend.  Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and [[Charlemagne]].

During the 9th century several important developments took place.  First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy.  Second, the earliest [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as [[organum]].  Third, and of greatest significance for music history, [[music notation|notation]] was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.

Several schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100:  the [[St. Martial school]] of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, which included the composers [[Léonin]] and [[Pérotin]], and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the [[Codex Calixtinus]]; and the English school, the music of which survives in the [[Worcester Fragments]] and the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].  Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the [[troubadour]]s, [[trouvère]]s and [[minnesinger|Minnesänger]].  Much of the later secular music of the early [[Renaissance]] evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the early 13th century.

Forms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the [[motet]], [[conductus]], [[discant]], and [[Clausula (music)|clausulae]].  One unusual development was the ''[[Geisslerlieder]]'', the music of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the [[Black Death]], around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music.  Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the ''[[ars nova]]'', which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and [[aesthetics]].  Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the [[formes fixes]]:  the [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], the [[virelai]], the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], the [[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], which correspond to poetic forms of the same names.  Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment:  famous composers include [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Francesco Landini]].

===Renaissance music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->
{{Main|Renaissance music}}
[[Image:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]

The beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in [[Italy]], but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]].  The style of the [[Burgundian school|Burgundian]] composers, as the first generation of the [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century  ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and contained clear, singable melody and balanced [[polyphony]] in all voices.  The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], and [[Antoine Busnois]].

By the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the [[Low Countries]] and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the [[Medici]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[Sforza]] families).  They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate.  Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], and the [[laude]]; secular forms included the [[chanson]], the [[frottola]], and later the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].

The invention of [[printing]] had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included [[Johannes Ockeghem]], who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of [[canon (music)|canonical]] devices; [[Jacob Obrecht]], one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and [[Josquin des Prez]], probably the most famous composer in Europe before [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of [[counterpoint]]; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of [[Nicolas Gombert]], whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the [[canzona]] and the [[ricercar]], ultimately culminating in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[fugue|fugal]] forms.

By the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident:  a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the [[Counter-Reformation]] [[Council of Trent]], exemplified in the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]; a trend towards complexity and [[chromaticism]] in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the [[avant-garde]] style of the [[Ferrara School]] of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]] and the late century madrigalist [[Carlo Gesualdo]]; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]], which used the architecture of the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] to create [[polychoral|antiphonal]] contrasts.  The music of the Venetian school included the development of [[orchestration]], ornamented instrumental parts, and [[basso continuo|continuo]] bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600.  Famous composers in [[Venice]] included the Gabrielis, [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi]], one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.

Most parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century.  In England, composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]] wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes:  famous composers included [[Thomas Morley]], [[John Wilbye]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]]. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]] writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar.  Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant [[chorale]]s, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there).  In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of [[organ (music)|organ]] music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]].  France developed a unique style of musical diction known as [[musique mesurée]], used in secular chansons, with composers such as [[Guillaume Costeley]] and [[Claude Le Jeune]] prominent in the movement.

One of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]], who ironically had a reactionary intent:  dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks.  Chief among them were [[Vincenzo Galilei]], the father of the astronomer, and [[Giulio Caccini]].  The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as [[monody]], and a corresponding staged dramatic form:  a form known today as [[opera]].  The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.

Music prior to 1600 was [[musical mode|modal]] rather than [[Tonality|tonal]].  Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on [[mode (music)|modes]] by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], led directly to the development of common practice tonality.  The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old [[church modes]], a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive.  Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the [[common practice period]].

The Baroque era took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe and, during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}<!--But not in the Renaissance?

During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.<ref name=\"sdsu\">{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D. |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}</ref> The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented.

===Classical music era===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->
{{Main|Classical period (music)}}
The music of the Classical period is characterized by [[homophonic texture]], or an obvious [[melody]] with [[accompaniment]].  These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music.  Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced [[opera]] and other sung forms (such as [[oratorio]]) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition.  However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).

[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s compositions characterized music of the classical era.]]
Along with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].  In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, [[Alberti bass]] (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice.  The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], the [[symphony]], and the [[concerto]], though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in [[music theory]].  All three derive from [[sonata form]], which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.

The early Classical period was ushered in by the [[Mannheim School]], which included such composers as [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Franz Xaver Richter]], [[Carl Stamitz]], and [[Christian Cannabich]]. It exerted a profound influence on [[Joseph Haydn]] and, through him, on all subsequent European music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.

In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and in the role of concerts as part of [[urban culture|urban]] society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex&nbsp;– and often much longer&nbsp;– musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[César Franck|Franck]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].

India's classical music tradition is millennia long and remains important to the lives of Indians today as a source of religious inspiration, cultural expression, and entertainment.

Indian classical music (marga) is monophonic, and based on a single melody line or [[raga]] rhythmically organized through [[Tala (music)|talas]]. Carnatic music is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are a lot of songs emphasising love and other social issues. In contrast to Carnatic music, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, Vedic philosophy and native Indian sounds but also by the Persian performance practices of the Afghan Mughals. The origins of Indian classical music can be found from the oldest of scriptures, part of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas describes music at length.

This album also marks the first instance of Yelawolf as a record producer since his first independent 2005 album ''Creekwater'' and features [[Till It's Gone]], Yelawolf's most commercially successful song to date. The album debuted #3 on the American [[Billboard 200]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/yelawolf|title=Yelawolf Love Story Chart History|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> with 61,000 copies sold in its first week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/first-week-sales-for-yelawolfs-love-story-news.15138.html|title=First Week Sales For Yelawolf's \"Love Story\"|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> The album is considered Yelawolf's most celebrated release among his fan base, but was found to be polarizing with critics due to the mixture of country and hip hop.<ref>{{Citation|title=Love Story by Yelawolf|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/love-story/yelawolf|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> Two singles from the album, \"Till It's Gone\" and \"Best Friend\" featuring [[Eminem]] have amassed over 100 million views on [[YouTube]], and eventually received a [[Gold certification]]s from the RIAA.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|title=Gold & Platinum|website=RIAA|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> On June 8, 2018, ''Love Story'' also received a Gold certification for 500,000 units sold.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

=== 2016–2017: ''Trial by Fire'' and ''Hotel''===
{{main|Trial by Fire (Yelawolf album)}}
On August 25, 2015, Yelawolf was mired in controversy when he decided to defend the [[Confederate flag]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1826620/yelawolf-defends-the-confederate-flag/news/|title=Yelawolf Defends The Confederate Flag|date=August 25, 2015|website=Stereogum.com|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> before reconsidering his stance and entirely rejecting the flag with a non-album track titled \"To Whom It May Concern\" on October 30, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_kpJtu4gxc|title=YelaWolf \"To Whom It May Concern\"|last=YelaWolfMusic|date=October 30, 2015|accessdate=February 21, 2019|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The single addressed his upbringings and his disgust with the [[Charleston church shooting]], a racially motivated mass shooting. After the controversy was settled on September 22, 2015, Yelawolf announced his fourth studio album, ''Trial by Fire''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisishiphopmusic.com/yelawolf-announces-trial-by-fire-album/|title=Yelawolf Announces \"Trial By Fire\" Album|date=2015-09-23|website=Thisisihiphopmusic.com|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> He alluded to the record being much darker than its predecessor, and also being produced entirely by himself and constant collaborators [[DJ Klever]] and Bones Owens, which were also members of his tour band.

Towards the end of 2016, Yelawolf was seen working with South Florida-based producer and constant collaborator [[Jim Jonsin]], although what they worked on remained a secret. October 10, 2016, the surprise free [[Extended play|EP]], ''Hotel'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-hotel-new-mixtape.116570.html?song-117729|title=Yelawolf - Hotel - Download & Listen [New Mixtape]|website=Hotnewhiphop.com|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}</ref> Hotel is an acronym for \"House Of The Endless Life\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://emptylighthouse.com/ep-review-yelawolfs-hotel-ep-glimpse-his-past-present-and-future-111249|title=EP Review: Yelawolf's 'Hotel' EP Is A Glimpse Into His Past, Present and Future|first=Navi|last=Persaud|date=October 11, 2016|website=Empty Lighthouse Magazine|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> with the production being entirely handled by Jonsin and Yelawolf.

The first two singles from ''Trial by Fire'', \"Daylight\" and \"Shadows\" featuring country singer [[Joshua Hedley|Joshua Headley]] were released in late 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/music/yelawolf-daylight-new-video-the-magnificent-seven/|title=Yelawolf Is Surrounded By Whiskey And Steel Guitar In 'Daylight' Video|date=2016-09-23|website=Uproxx|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/watch-yelawolf-and-joshua-hedleys-haunting-shadows-video-115208/|title=Watch Yelawolf and Joshua Hedley's Haunting 'Shadows' Video|last=Freeman|first=Jon|date=2016-10-28|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> In order to support ''Trial By Fire'', a tour was announced on July 18, 2016 and was due to run from October 13 to December 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://shadyrecords.com/2016/07/22/yelawolf-trial-by-fire-tour-tickets-on-sale/|title=Yelawolf Trial By Fire Tour: Tickets On Sale|website=Shady Records|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> However, during the Oregon show, Yelawolf was seen [[Instrument destruction|destroying equipment]] belonging to Bones Owens, which subsequently caused Owens to fallout with Yelawolf and quit the band indefinitely (DJ Klever also left the band but would reunite with Yelawolf the following year). The incident was followed by an altercation with a fan at the Sacramento show resulting in Yelawolf leaving the stage and cancelling the remaining seven dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.41450/title.yelawolf-cancels-tour-following-fight-with-fan-stage-meltdowns|title=Yelawolf Cancels Tour Following Fight With Fan & Stage Meltdowns|first=HipHopDX-|last=http://hiphopdx.com|date=November 28, 2016|website=HipHopDX|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> After the cancellation of the tour, Yelawolf seemed to suffer an apparent mental breakdown and was admitted to a mental ward. After his release towards the end of December, Yelawolf announced via social media that he was dropping the \"Yelawolf\" stage name in favor of his birth name, the removed Instagram post announced \"I decided to sober up and rebrand my new music as Michael Wayne Atha MWA\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/yelawolf_changes_name_to_mwa_opens_up_about_psych_ward_stay_and_sobriety|title=Yelawolf Changes Name to MWA, Opens Up About Psych Ward Stay and Sobriety|website=Exclaim.ca|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> This came as a result of the death of long-time friend and collaborator Shawty Fatt and his break-up with fiancé [[Fefe Dobson]]. During this time, Yelawolf also drastically changed his country style to a contemporary hip hop image, before retreating from public life for over six months. During this period, the status of the unreleased ''Trial by Fire'' album and Yelawolf's involvement with [[Shady Records]] were left undetermined.

On June 6, 2018, Yelawolf announced a return to the music scene with the release of the third single for ''Trial by Fire'' titled \"Row Your Boat\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/video/2017/05/yelawolf-preview-new-song-video-row-your-boat/|title=Yelawolf Gives Preview of New Song and Video for 'Row Your Boat' - XXL|last=India|first=Lindsey|website=XXL Mag|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> with his \"Yelawolf\" moniker once again in use. Yelawolf launched another tour to support the album titled the \"51/50\" tour,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/yelawolf-gears-up-for-his-51-50-tour-120820|title=Yelawolf gears up for his 51/50 Tour|work=AXS|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> with the name alluding to the term police or doctors use towards patients that are an endangerment to themselves and others, referencing his mental breakdown from the previous year. During the tour, Yelawolf would re-visit all the venues that were cancelled during his previous tour, free of charge to those who had bought a ticket for the former. After multiple delays, ''Trial by Fire'' was finally released on October 27, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/10/yelawolf-trial-by-fire-album-release/|title=Yelawolf Releases 'Trial by Fire' Album - XXL|last=Berry|first=Peter A.|website=XXL Mag|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> During this time, he also reunited with long-time fiancé [[Fefe Dobson]].

=== 2018–present: ''Trunk Muzik III'' and ''Ghetto Cowboy'' ===
{{main|Trunk Muzik III|Ghetto Cowboy (Yelawolf album)}}

''[[Trunk Muzik III]]'', the third major project in the ''Trunk Muzik'' series, was first hinted at in mid-2017, following Yelawolf's return to the music scene after a prolonged break.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.46115/title.wlpwr-details-his-work-on-yelawolfs-trunk-muzik-3-big-krits-double-lp|title=WLPWR Details His Work On Yelawolf's \"Trunk Muzik 3\" & Big K.R.I.T.'s Double LP|first=HipHopDX-|last=http://hiphopdx.com|date=March 4, 2018|website=HipHopDX|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> Three months after the October release of ''Trial By Fire'', Yelawolf announced he had begun work on the project with long-time producer [[WLPWR]] , who also handled some of the production in 2010's ''[[Trunk Muzik]]'' and its re-release ''Trunk Muzik 0-60'', as well as producing the entirety of the second entry in the series, ''[[Trunk Muzik Returns]].'' The project also features production contributions from [[DJ Paul]] and [[Jim Jonsin]]. It was revealed that unlike the previous two ''Trunk Muzik'' projects, ''Trunk Muzik III'' would be his fifth studio album released under [[Shady Records]]. On July 27, Yelawolf began a 25-date tour to support the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tickethub.co/yelawolf-trunk-muzik-iii-tour-2018-dates-tickets/|title=Yelawolf Announces 'Trunk Muzik III' Tour 2018 Dates - Tickets on Sale|date=2018-06-08|website=Tickets at Ticket Hub|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> During the tour, he premiered the then-planned first single for the album titled \"Catfish Billy (Part 2)”,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmek4LJA5sR/|title=M.W.A YELAWOLF GHETTOCOWBOY on Instagram: \"Just out here flexin that LOWFASHION son !! ..

During one of the shows, he announced that ''Trunk Muzik III'' would be his final album under [[Eminem]]'s label [[Shady Records]], and after its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/08/yelawolf-trunk-muzik-3-last-album-with-shady-records/|title=Yelawolf's 'Trunk Muzik 3' Will Be Last Album With Shady Records - XXL|last=Mojica|first=Nick|website=XXL Mag|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref>

The album features a collaboration from [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] on the track titled \"Rowdy\", marking the end to a feud between Yelawolf and Machine Gun Kelly that began in 2011. A move many of his fans and fellow eminem associates considered treacherous and unloyal. However, the song gained attention when it was mentioned in another publicized feud between Kelly and Yelawolf's record label boss, Eminem. On the diss track \"[[Rap Devil]]\", Machine Gun Kelly states \"And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8473471/machine-gun-kelly-rap-devil-lyrics-decoded-eminem-diss-track-feud|title=Decoding Machine Gun Kelly's Scathing Eminem Diss Track 'Rap Devil'|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> In anticipation for the release of the album, Yelawolf began a weekly freestyle series similar to the one leading up to his 2015 release ''Love Story'', claiming he would \"release a freestyle every week until the album comes out\".<ref>{{Citation|last=YelaVision: Support for Yelawolf & Slumerican|title=Yelawolf's Live 01/31/2019 about release TM3 & New Freestyle's|date=2019-02-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGpUrH-mTzQ&t=1s|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> The album was supported by the singles \"TM3\" featuring [[DJ Klever]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-previews-first-trunk-muzik-3-single-tm3-news.74478.html?_amp|title=Yelawolf Previews First \"Trunk Muzik 3\" Single \"TM3\"|website=www.hotnewhiphop.com|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref> and \"Catfish Billy 2\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-drops-catfish-billy-2-from-upcoming-album-new-song.1982372.html?_amp|title=Yelawolf Drops \"Catfish Billy 2\" From Upcoming Album|website=www.hotnewhiphop.com|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref> a sequel to the song from ''[[Trunk Muzik Returns]]''. The album was released on March 29, 2019 and features [[Caskey (rapper)|Caskey]], Doobie, [[Rittz]], [[DJ Paul]], MopTop, and CookUpBoss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-announces-trunk-muzik-3-release-date-news.74639.html|title=Yelawolf Announces \"Trunk Muzik 3\" Release Date|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref>

Following the period between the completion of ''Trunk Muzik III'' and its release, Yelawolf hinted he was beginning work on his sixth studio album, titled ''[[Ghetto Cowboy (album)|Ghetto Cowboy]]''. This would mark his first album to not be released under the [[Shady Records]] label, but instead under his own independent label, Slumerican.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.southpawer.com/2018/03/17/yelawolf-ghetto-cowboy/|title=BREAKING: YelaWolf to drop \"Ghetto Cowboy\" shortly after release of \"Trunk Muzik 3\"|last=Gelenidze|first=Remy|date=2018-03-17|website=Southpawer|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> During this time, Yelawolf dyed his hair red, which he claims is homage to [[Opie Taylor]], a character from [[The Andy Griffith Show]]. The first single from the record, titled \"Unnatural Born Killer\" was released on August 9, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-reemerges-with-unnatural-born-killers-single-new-song.1984054.html?_amp|title=Yelawolf Reemerges With 'Unnatural Born Killer\" Single|website=www.hotnewhiphop.com|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref> In late 2019, Yelawolf launched his second tour of the year in support of the album, appropriately titled \"The Ghetto Cowboy Tour\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.facebook.com/events/sokol-auditorium-and-underground/yelawolf-ghetto-cowboy-tour/392218261638071/|title=Yelawolf Ghetto Cowboy Tour|website=m.facebook.com|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that \"In contrast to the gilded cage of privilege inhabited by Jay-Z and Kanye West, Yelawolf depicts everyday rural poverty with the evocative precision of a master storyteller\". He is noted for his distinct style that ranges from [[Southern Gothic|American gothic]] to gore, the \"richness and invention of his language\" and range of his vocal style \"from beer-swilling rowdiness to a crawling, contemptuous sibilance\". He has said that he feels he represents \"not the ideal American\" but those Americans that he calls the core: \"I love the grit of who we really are.\"<ref name=g01 />

==Influences==
Yelawolf's early childhood introduction to hip hop came as a result of his mother's boyfriend being a sound designer for [[Aerosmith]] around the time that the [[Run-DMC]] version of “[[Walk This Way]]” was released, and made friends with the hip hop group. Yelawolf recalls Run-DMC visiting his child home and giving him some [[Beastie Boys]]' [[Licensed to Ill]] cassette tapes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/yelawolf-talks-old-influences-and-new-projects-at-bonnaroo-242166/|title=Yelawolf Talks New Projects at Bonnaroo|date=2012-06-16|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> He has cited [[Outkast]] as his biggest influence when it comes to a \"blend of sounds\". He has stated on multiple occasions that the group's two seminal albums, ''[[ATLiens]]'' and [[Aquemini|''Aquemeni'']], are among his favorite hip-hop records of all time. He has also shared that the hip-hop and [[R&B]] collective [[Dungeon Family]] has had a major influence on his production style, as well as [[J Dilla]], [[Pete Rock]], [[CL Smooth]], [[Black Star (rap duo)|Black Star]], [[Hieroglyphics (group)|Hieroglyphics]], and the Brooklyn-based trio [[Digable Planets]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2016/11/07/yelawolf-is-taking-his-music-stardom-into-the-business-world/|title=Yelawolf Is Taking His Music Stardom Into The Business World|last=Baltin|first=Steve|website=Forbes|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref>

Some of Yelawolf's other musical influences include [[Johnny Cash]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[The Doors]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Metallica]], [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]], and [[N.W.A]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2011/11/yelawolfs-25-favorite-albums/25|title=Yelawolf's 25 Favorite Albums|last=|first=|date=|website=Complex|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> Yelawolf has also shown appreciation for Detroit-based recording artist [[Kid Rock]] and his mixing of [[country music]], [[rock music]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/detroit/index.ssf/2014/11/yelawolf.html|title=Yelawolf on Shady XV contribution, Eminem's loyalty: 'It's an honor ...

October 10, 2016, the surprise free [[Extended play|EP]], ''Hotel'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-hotel-new-mixtape.116570.html?song-117729|title=Yelawolf - Hotel - Download & Listen [New Mixtape]|website=Hotnewhiphop.com|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}</ref> Hotel is an acronym for \"House Of The Endless Life\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://emptylighthouse.com/ep-review-yelawolfs-hotel-ep-glimpse-his-past-present-and-future-111249|title=EP Review: Yelawolf's 'Hotel' EP Is A Glimpse Into His Past, Present and Future|first=Navi|last=Persaud|date=October 11, 2016|website=Empty Lighthouse Magazine|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> with the production being entirely handled by Jonsin and Yelawolf.

The first two singles from ''Trial by Fire'', \"Daylight\" and \"Shadows\" featuring country singer [[Joshua Hedley|Joshua Headley]] were released in late 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/music/yelawolf-daylight-new-video-the-magnificent-seven/|title=Yelawolf Is Surrounded By Whiskey And Steel Guitar In 'Daylight' Video|date=2016-09-23|website=Uproxx|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/watch-yelawolf-and-joshua-hedleys-haunting-shadows-video-115208/|title=Watch Yelawolf and Joshua Hedley's Haunting 'Shadows' Video|last=Freeman|first=Jon|date=2016-10-28|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> In order to support ''Trial By Fire'', a tour was announced on July 18, 2016 and was due to run from October 13 to December 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://shadyrecords.com/2016/07/22/yelawolf-trial-by-fire-tour-tickets-on-sale/|title=Yelawolf Trial By Fire Tour: Tickets On Sale|website=Shady Records|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> However, during the Oregon show, Yelawolf was seen [[Instrument destruction|destroying equipment]] belonging to Bones Owens, which subsequently caused Owens to fallout with Yelawolf and quit the band indefinitely (DJ Klever also left the band but would reunite with Yelawolf the following year). The incident was followed by an altercation with a fan at the Sacramento show resulting in Yelawolf leaving the stage and cancelling the remaining seven dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.41450/title.yelawolf-cancels-tour-following-fight-with-fan-stage-meltdowns|title=Yelawolf Cancels Tour Following Fight With Fan & Stage Meltdowns|first=HipHopDX-|last=http://hiphopdx.com|date=November 28, 2016|website=HipHopDX|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> After the cancellation of the tour, Yelawolf seemed to suffer an apparent mental breakdown and was admitted to a mental ward. After his release towards the end of December, Yelawolf announced via social media that he was dropping the \"Yelawolf\" stage name in favor of his birth name, the removed Instagram post announced \"I decided to sober up and rebrand my new music as Michael Wayne Atha MWA\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/yelawolf_changes_name_to_mwa_opens_up_about_psych_ward_stay_and_sobriety|title=Yelawolf Changes Name to MWA, Opens Up About Psych Ward Stay and Sobriety|website=Exclaim.ca|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> This came as a result of the death of long-time friend and collaborator Shawty Fatt and his break-up with fiancé [[Fefe Dobson]]. During this time, Yelawolf also drastically changed his country style to a contemporary hip hop image, before retreating from public life for over six months. During this period, the status of the unreleased ''Trial by Fire'' album and Yelawolf's involvement with [[Shady Records]] were left undetermined.

On June 6, 2018, Yelawolf announced a return to the music scene with the release of the third single for ''Trial by Fire'' titled \"Row Your Boat\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/video/2017/05/yelawolf-preview-new-song-video-row-your-boat/|title=Yelawolf Gives Preview of New Song and Video for 'Row Your Boat' - XXL|last=India|first=Lindsey|website=XXL Mag|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> with his \"Yelawolf\" moniker once again in use. Yelawolf launched another tour to support the album titled the \"51/50\" tour,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/yelawolf-gears-up-for-his-51-50-tour-120820|title=Yelawolf gears up for his 51/50 Tour|work=AXS|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> with the name alluding to the term police or doctors use towards patients that are an endangerment to themselves and others, referencing his mental breakdown from the previous year. During the tour, Yelawolf would re-visit all the venues that were cancelled during his previous tour, free of charge to those who had bought a ticket for the former. After multiple delays, ''Trial by Fire'' was finally released on October 27, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/10/yelawolf-trial-by-fire-album-release/|title=Yelawolf Releases 'Trial by Fire' Album - XXL|last=Berry|first=Peter A.|website=XXL Mag|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> During this time, he also reunited with long-time fiancé [[Fefe Dobson]].

=== 2018–present: ''Trunk Muzik III'' and ''Ghetto Cowboy'' ===
{{main|Trunk Muzik III|Ghetto Cowboy (Yelawolf album)}}

''[[Trunk Muzik III]]'', the third major project in the ''Trunk Muzik'' series, was first hinted at in mid-2017, following Yelawolf's return to the music scene after a prolonged break.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.46115/title.wlpwr-details-his-work-on-yelawolfs-trunk-muzik-3-big-krits-double-lp|title=WLPWR Details His Work On Yelawolf's \"Trunk Muzik 3\" & Big K.R.I.T.'s Double LP|first=HipHopDX-|last=http://hiphopdx.com|date=March 4, 2018|website=HipHopDX|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}</ref> Three months after the October release of ''Trial By Fire'', Yelawolf announced he had begun work on the project with long-time producer [[WLPWR]] , who also handled some of the production in 2010's ''[[Trunk Muzik]]'' and its re-release ''Trunk Muzik 0-60'', as well as producing the entirety of the second entry in the series, ''[[Trunk Muzik Returns]].'' The project also features production contributions from [[DJ Paul]] and [[Jim Jonsin]]. It was revealed that unlike the previous two ''Trunk Muzik'' projects, ''Trunk Muzik III'' would be his fifth studio album released under [[Shady Records]]. On July 27, Yelawolf began a 25-date tour to support the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tickethub.co/yelawolf-trunk-muzik-iii-tour-2018-dates-tickets/|title=Yelawolf Announces 'Trunk Muzik III' Tour 2018 Dates - Tickets on Sale|date=2018-06-08|website=Tickets at Ticket Hub|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> During the tour, he premiered the then-planned first single for the album titled \"Catfish Billy (Part 2)”,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmek4LJA5sR/|title=M.W.A YELAWOLF GHETTOCOWBOY on Instagram: \"Just out here flexin that LOWFASHION son !! ..

During one of the shows, he announced that ''Trunk Muzik III'' would be his final album under [[Eminem]]'s label [[Shady Records]], and after its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/08/yelawolf-trunk-muzik-3-last-album-with-shady-records/|title=Yelawolf's 'Trunk Muzik 3' Will Be Last Album With Shady Records - XXL|last=Mojica|first=Nick|website=XXL Mag|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref>

The album features a collaboration from [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] on the track titled \"Rowdy\", marking the end to a feud between Yelawolf and Machine Gun Kelly that began in 2011. A move many of his fans and fellow eminem associates considered treacherous and unloyal. However, the song gained attention when it was mentioned in another publicized feud between Kelly and Yelawolf's record label boss, Eminem. On the diss track \"[[Rap Devil]]\", Machine Gun Kelly states \"And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8473471/machine-gun-kelly-rap-devil-lyrics-decoded-eminem-diss-track-feud|title=Decoding Machine Gun Kelly's Scathing Eminem Diss Track 'Rap Devil'|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> In anticipation for the release of the album, Yelawolf began a weekly freestyle series similar to the one leading up to his 2015 release ''Love Story'', claiming he would \"release a freestyle every week until the album comes out\".<ref>{{Citation|last=YelaVision: Support for Yelawolf & Slumerican|title=Yelawolf's Live 01/31/2019 about release TM3 & New Freestyle's|date=2019-02-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGpUrH-mTzQ&t=1s|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> The album was supported by the singles \"TM3\" featuring [[DJ Klever]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-previews-first-trunk-muzik-3-single-tm3-news.74478.html?_amp|title=Yelawolf Previews First \"Trunk Muzik 3\" Single \"TM3\"|website=www.hotnewhiphop.com|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref> and \"Catfish Billy 2\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-drops-catfish-billy-2-from-upcoming-album-new-song.1982372.html?_amp|title=Yelawolf Drops \"Catfish Billy 2\" From Upcoming Album|website=www.hotnewhiphop.com|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref> a sequel to the song from ''[[Trunk Muzik Returns]]''. The album was released on March 29, 2019 and features [[Caskey (rapper)|Caskey]], Doobie, [[Rittz]], [[DJ Paul]], MopTop, and CookUpBoss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-announces-trunk-muzik-3-release-date-news.74639.html|title=Yelawolf Announces \"Trunk Muzik 3\" Release Date|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref>

Following the period between the completion of ''Trunk Muzik III'' and its release, Yelawolf hinted he was beginning work on his sixth studio album, titled ''[[Ghetto Cowboy (album)|Ghetto Cowboy]]''. This would mark his first album to not be released under the [[Shady Records]] label, but instead under his own independent label, Slumerican.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.southpawer.com/2018/03/17/yelawolf-ghetto-cowboy/|title=BREAKING: YelaWolf to drop \"Ghetto Cowboy\" shortly after release of \"Trunk Muzik 3\"|last=Gelenidze|first=Remy|date=2018-03-17|website=Southpawer|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> During this time, Yelawolf dyed his hair red, which he claims is homage to [[Opie Taylor]], a character from [[The Andy Griffith Show]]. The first single from the record, titled \"Unnatural Born Killer\" was released on August 9, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-reemerges-with-unnatural-born-killers-single-new-song.1984054.html?_amp|title=Yelawolf Reemerges With 'Unnatural Born Killer\" Single|website=www.hotnewhiphop.com|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref> In late 2019, Yelawolf launched his second tour of the year in support of the album, appropriately titled \"The Ghetto Cowboy Tour\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.facebook.com/events/sokol-auditorium-and-underground/yelawolf-ghetto-cowboy-tour/392218261638071/|title=Yelawolf Ghetto Cowboy Tour|website=m.facebook.com|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that \"In contrast to the gilded cage of privilege inhabited by Jay-Z and Kanye West, Yelawolf depicts everyday rural poverty with the evocative precision of a master storyteller\". He is noted for his distinct style that ranges from [[Southern Gothic|American gothic]] to gore, the \"richness and invention of his language\" and range of his vocal style \"from beer-swilling rowdiness to a crawling, contemptuous sibilance\". He has said that he feels he represents \"not the ideal American\" but those Americans that he calls the core: \"I love the grit of who we really are.\"<ref name=g01 />

==Influences==
Yelawolf's early childhood introduction to hip hop came as a result of his mother's boyfriend being a sound designer for [[Aerosmith]] around the time that the [[Run-DMC]] version of “[[Walk This Way]]” was released, and made friends with the hip hop group. Yelawolf recalls Run-DMC visiting his child home and giving him some [[Beastie Boys]]' [[Licensed to Ill]] cassette tapes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/yelawolf-talks-old-influences-and-new-projects-at-bonnaroo-242166/|title=Yelawolf Talks New Projects at Bonnaroo|date=2012-06-16|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> He has cited [[Outkast]] as his biggest influence when it comes to a \"blend of sounds\". He has stated on multiple occasions that the group's two seminal albums, ''[[ATLiens]]'' and [[Aquemini|''Aquemeni'']], are among his favorite hip-hop records of all time. He has also shared that the hip-hop and [[R&B]] collective [[Dungeon Family]] has had a major influence on his production style, as well as [[J Dilla]], [[Pete Rock]], [[CL Smooth]], [[Black Star (rap duo)|Black Star]], [[Hieroglyphics (group)|Hieroglyphics]], and the Brooklyn-based trio [[Digable Planets]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2016/11/07/yelawolf-is-taking-his-music-stardom-into-the-business-world/|title=Yelawolf Is Taking His Music Stardom Into The Business World|last=Baltin|first=Steve|website=Forbes|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref>

Some of Yelawolf's other musical influences include [[Johnny Cash]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[The Doors]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Metallica]], [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]], and [[N.W.A]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2011/11/yelawolfs-25-favorite-albums/25|title=Yelawolf's 25 Favorite Albums|last=|first=|date=|website=Complex|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> Yelawolf has also shown appreciation for Detroit-based recording artist [[Kid Rock]] and his mixing of [[country music]], [[rock music]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/detroit/index.ssf/2014/11/yelawolf.html|title=Yelawolf on Shady XV contribution, Eminem's loyalty: 'It's an honor ...

The '''United States Numbered Highway System''' (often called '''U.S. Routes''' or '''U.S. Highways''') is an integrated network of [[road]]s and [[highway]]s numbered within a nationwide grid in the [[contiguous United States]]. As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.

The route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north–south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east–west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.

Before the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.

Expansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.

==System details==
{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}

In general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>

Except for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s. AASHTO policy says that a toll road may only be included as a [[special route]], and that \"a toll-free routing between the same termini shall continue to be retained and marked as a part of the U.S. Numbered System.\"<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> [[U.S. Route 3]] (US&nbsp;3) meets this obligation; in [[U.S. Route 3 in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], it does not follow tolled portions of the [[Everett Turnpike]]. But US Routes in the system do use parts of five toll roads:<ref>{{cite map |author= [[Rand McNally]] |year= 2013 |title= The Road Atlas: United States, Canada & Mexico |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |at= p. 32, § A9; p. 83, §§ D15, D19; p. 92, § J8 |edition= 2013 Walmart |isbn= 0-528-00626-6}}</ref>

* [[U.S. Route 278 in South Carolina|US&nbsp;278]] uses the tolled [[Cross Island Parkway (Hilton Head Island)|Cross Island Parkway]] in [[South Carolina]]; the old road is [[U.S. Route 278 Business (Hilton Head Island, South Carolina)|US&nbsp;278 Business]].
* [[U.S. Route 301 in Delaware|US&nbsp;301]] is a toll road through [[Delaware]]; the former routing is a free road and uses several Delaware state routes.

* US&nbsp;412 also uses the [[Cherokee Turnpike]] in Oklahoma; the old road is [[Alternate U.S. Highway 412|Alternate US&nbsp;412]].

===Numbering===
U.S. Routes in the [[contiguous United States]] follow a grid pattern, in which odd-numbered routes run generally north to south and even-numbered routes run generally east to west, though spur routes can be either-or. Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.

In the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order to keep them from being confused with one another,<ref name=\"mcnichol71\"/> and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially conflict with [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] and [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Exceptions to this rule do occur.</ref>

In the US Highway system, three-digit numbers are assigned to spurs of one or two-digit routes. [[U.S. Route 201|US&nbsp;201]], for example, splits from [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] at [[Brunswick, Maine]], and runs north to Canada.<ref name=\"rm\">{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title=The Road Atlas and Travel Guide |year=2009 |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |isbn= 978-0-528-94209-9}}</ref>  Not all spurs travel in the same direction as their \"parents\"; some are connected to their parents only by other spurs, or not at all, instead only traveling near their parents, Also, a spur may travel in different cardinal directions than its parent, such as [[U.S. Route 522|US&nbsp;522]], which is a north-south route, unlike its parent [[U.S. Route 22|US&nbsp;22]], which is east-west. As originally assigned, the first digit of the spurs increased from north to south and east to west along the parent; for example, [[U.S. Route 60 (1925)|US&nbsp;60]] had spurs, running from east to west, designated as [[U.S. Route 160 (1925)|US&nbsp;160]] in [[Missouri]], [[U.S. Route 260 (1925)|US&nbsp;260]] in [[Oklahoma]], [[U.S. Route 360 (1925)|US&nbsp;360]] in [[Texas]], and [[U.S. Route 460|US&nbsp;460]] and [[U.S. Route 560 (1925)|US&nbsp;560]] in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"1925 list\"/>  As with the two-digit routes, three-digit routes have been added, removed, extended and shortened; the \"parent-child\" relationship is not always present.<ref name=\"rm\"/><ref name=\"esso\">{{cite map |author1=[[Esso]] |title=United States Featuring the Interstate Highway System |year=1966 |author2=[[General Drafting]] |last-author-amp= yes |scale= [c. 1:3,870,000] |location= Convent Station, NJ |publisher= General Drafting |oclc= 749860157}}</ref>

AASHTO guidelines specifically prohibit [[Interstate Highway]]s and U.S. Routes from sharing a number within the same state.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |format= PDF |title= Establishment of a Marking System of the Routes Comprising the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |author= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date= January 2000 |work= AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |accessdate= December 31, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140101011142/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |archivedate= January 1, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As with other guidelines, exceptions exist across the U.S.  <ref name=\"esso\"/>

Some two-digit numbers have never been applied to any U.S. Route, including 39, 47, 86 and 88.

===Signage===
Route numbers are displayed on a distinctively-shaped white shield with large black numerals in the center.  Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.

===Divided and special routes===
{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}

Since 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.  For instance, [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]] splits into [[U.S. Route 11E|US&nbsp;11E]] (east) and [[U.S. Route 11W|US&nbsp;11W]] (west) in [[Bristol, Virginia]], and the routes rejoin in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Occasionally only one of the two routes is suffixed; [[U.S. Route 6N|US&nbsp;6N]] in [[Pennsylvania]] does not rejoin US&nbsp;6 at its west end. AASHTO has been trying to eliminate these since 1934;<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\">{{cite web |first=Richard F. |last=Weingroff |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us11.cfm |title=US&nbsp;11 Rouses Point, New York, to New Orleans, Louisiana |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate= June 9, 2011}}</ref> its current policy is to deny approval of new split routes and to eliminate existing ones \"as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways can reach agreement with reference thereto\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/>

[[Special route]]s—those with a banner such as [[alternate route|alternate]] or [[bypass (road)|bypass]]—are also managed by AASHTO.<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/>  These are sometimes designated with lettered suffixes, like A for alternate or B for business.<ref>For example, compare the following for an alternate route in Ohio:

===Naming===
The official route log, last published by AASHTO in 1989, has been named ''United States Numbered Highways'' since its initial publication in 1926.  Within the route log, \"U.S. Route\" is used in the table of contents, while \"United States Highway\" appears as the heading for each route.  All reports of the Special Committee on Route Numbering since 1989 use \"U.S. Route\", and federal laws relating to highways use \"United States Route\" or \"U.S. Route\" more often than the \"Highway\" variants.<ref>[[Google]] searches on [[thomas.loc.gov]] for [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22united+states+route \"United States Route\"], [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22u.s.+route \"U.S. Route\"], [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22united+states+highway \"United States Highway\"] and [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22u.s.+highway \"U.S. Highway\"]</ref>  The use of U.S. Route or U.S. Highway on a local level depends on the state, with some states such as Delaware using \"route\" and others such as Colorado using \"highway\".<ref name=DelDOT>{{cite web |url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/pubs_forms/manuals/traffic_counts/2006/pdf/rpt_pgs1_38_rev.pdf |format=PDF |author=[[Delaware Department of Transportation]] |publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation |title=2006 Traffic Count and Mileage Report |year=2006 |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318163528/http://www.deldot.gov/information/pubs_forms/manuals/traffic_counts/2006/pdf/rpt_pgs1_38_rev.pdf |archivedate=March 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.coloradodot.info/dataaccess/Highways/index.cfm?fuseaction=Description&route=006&begRefPt=0&endRefPt=500&Printable=true |title=Segment Descriptions for Highway 006 |author=[[Colorado Department of Transportation]] |publisher=Colorado Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526142107/http://apps.coloradodot.info/dataaccess/Highways/index.cfm?fuseaction=Description&route=006&begRefPt=0&endRefPt=500&Printable=true |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==History==

===Early auto trails===
{{Main|Auto trail}}
In 1903, [[Horatio Nelson Jackson]] became the first documented person to drive an automobile from [[San Francisco]] to [[New York City|New York]] using only a connection of dirt roads, cow paths, and railroad beds. His journey, covered by the press, became a national sensation and called for a system of long distance roads.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Dayton |last2= Burns |first2= Ken |title= Horatio's Drive: America's First Road Trip |year= 2003 |publisher= Alfred A. Knopf |location= New  York |isbn= 0-375-41536-X |edition= 1st |page= ix |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/horatiosdriveame00dunc }}</ref>

In the early 1910s, [[auto trail]] organizations—most prominently the [[Lincoln Highway]]—began to spring up, marking and promoting routes for the new recreation of long-distance automobile travel.  While many of these organizations worked with towns and states along the route to improve the roadways, others simply chose a route based on towns that were willing to pay dues, put up signs, and did little else.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\">{{cite web |last=Weingroff |first=Richard F. |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/numbers.cfm |title=From Names to Numbers:  The Origins of the US Numbered Highway System |work= Highway History |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2011  }}</ref>

===Planning===
{{wikisource|1=Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways October 30, 1925}}
Wisconsin was the first state in the U.S. to number [[list of Wisconsin numbered highways|its highways]], erecting signs in May 1918.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  Other states soon followed. In 1922, the [[New England]] states got together to establish the six-state [[New England Interstate Routes]].<ref name=\"nyt April 16\">{{cite news |title=Motor Sign Uniformity |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=April 16, 1922}}</ref>

Behind the scenes, the [[federal aid]] program had begun with the passage of the [[Federal Aid Road Act of 1916]], providing 50% monetary support from the [[federal government (US)|federal government]] for improvement of major roads.  The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

Secretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.  Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details—May 15 for the [[West (US)|West]], May 27 for the [[Mississippi Valley]], June 3 for the [[Great Lakes]], June 8 for the [[South (US)|South]], June 15 for the [[Atlantic Northeast|North Atlantic]], and June 15<!--typo?--> for [[New England]].  Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;— maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east–west and ten major north–south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

After working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>

===Disagreement and refinement, 1925–26===
[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]

The new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14–15, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

In the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

Many local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as—for instance—US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north–south than west–east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object—Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.

With 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>

Much of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

===Expansion and adjustment, 1926–56===
[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]

When the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.

In 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>
<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>

For the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Many of the first high-speed roads were U.S. Highways: the [[Gulf Freeway (Houston)|Gulf Freeway]] carried [[U.S. Route 75|US&nbsp;75]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Feldstein |title=A rare quiet interlude for area's first freeway/ Next major upgrade:  Causeway in 2002 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=June 27, 1999 |accessdate=June 9, 2009 |url=http://www.texasfreeway.com/Houston/photos/45s/chron_27-june-99_gulf_freeway.shtml}}</ref> the [[Pasadena Freeway]] carried [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]],<ref>Correspondence between the [[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]] and [[American Association of State Highway Officials]], transcribed at {{cite web |url=http://cahighways.org/065-072.html#066 |publisher= California Highways |title=State Route 66 |accessdate= June 10, 2011}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date= August 2011}}</ref> and the [[Pulaski Skyway]] carried [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] and [[U.S. Route 9|US&nbsp;9]].<ref>{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title= Road Atlas |year=1946 |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/NewYorkCity/randmcnally_ra_1946_040.html |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |page= 42 |inset=New York and Vicinity}}</ref>

===Interstate era, 1956–present===
[[File:US 34 (1961).svg|thumb|100px|1961 version of the U.S. Route shield]]

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] appropriated funding for the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of [[freeway]]s across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]]. The 1985 removal of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] is often seen as the end of an era of US highways.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://archive.org/stream/californiahighwa196465calirich#page/n85/mode/2up |title= Route Renumbering: New Green Markers Will Replace Old Shields |journal= California Highways and Public Works |date= March–April 1964 |volume= 43 |issue= 3–4 |pages= 11–13 |issn= 0008-1159 |accessdate= June 10, 2011}}</ref>

A few major connections not served by Interstate Highways include US&nbsp;6 from Hartford, Connecticut, to Providence, Rhode Island and US&nbsp;93 from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada, though the latter is planned to be upgraded to [[Interstate 11]]. Three state capitals in the contiguous U.S. are served only by U.S. Routes: [[Dover, Delaware]]; [[Jefferson City, Missouri]]; and [[Pierre, South Dakota]].

In 1995 the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] was defined to include both the Interstate Highway System and other roads designated as important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

AASHTO is in the process of eliminating all [[List of Intrastate U.S. Highways|intrastate U.S. Highways]] less than {{convert|300|mi|km}} in length \"as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials can reach agreement with reference thereto\". New additions to the system must serve more than one state and \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> A version of this policy has been in place since 1937.<ref name=newsigning1937>{{cite journal |url= https://archive.org/stream/california193638highwacalirich#page/n521/mode/2up |title= New Signing Policy on U.S. Routes |journal= California Highways and Public Works |date= October 1937 |volume= 15 |issue= 10 |pages= 13, 28 |issn=  0008-1159 |access-date= July 24, 2015 |via= Archive.org}}</ref>

The '''United States Numbered Highway System''' (often called '''U.S. Routes''' or '''U.S. Highways''') is an integrated network of [[road]]s and [[highway]]s numbered within a nationwide grid in the [[contiguous United States]]. As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.

The route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north–south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east–west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.

Before the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.

Expansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.

==System details==
{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}

In general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>

Except for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s. AASHTO policy says that a toll road may only be included as a [[special route]], and that \"a toll-free routing between the same termini shall continue to be retained and marked as a part of the U.S. Numbered System.\"<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> [[U.S. Route 3]] (US&nbsp;3) meets this obligation; in [[U.S. Route 3 in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], it does not follow tolled portions of the [[Everett Turnpike]]. But US Routes in the system do use parts of five toll roads:<ref>{{cite map |author= [[Rand McNally]] |year= 2013 |title= The Road Atlas: United States, Canada & Mexico |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |at= p. 32, § A9; p. 83, §§ D15, D19; p. 92, § J8 |edition= 2013 Walmart |isbn= 0-528-00626-6}}</ref>

* [[U.S. Route 301 in Delaware|US&nbsp;301]] is a toll road through [[Delaware]]; the former routing is a free road and uses several Delaware state routes.

===Numbering===
U.S. Routes in the [[contiguous United States]] follow a grid pattern, in which odd-numbered routes run generally north to south and even-numbered routes run generally east to west, though spur routes can be either-or. Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.

In the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order to keep them from being confused with one another,<ref name=\"mcnichol71\"/> and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially conflict with [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] and [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Exceptions to this rule do occur.</ref>

In the US Highway system, three-digit numbers are assigned to spurs of one or two-digit routes.

Some two-digit numbers have never been applied to any U.S. Route, including 39, 47, 86 and 88.

===Signage===
Route numbers are displayed on a distinctively-shaped white shield with large black numerals in the center.  Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.

===Divided and special routes===
{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}

Since 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.  For instance, [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]] splits into [[U.S. Route 11E|US&nbsp;11E]] (east) and [[U.S. Route 11W|US&nbsp;11W]] (west) in [[Bristol, Virginia]], and the routes rejoin in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Occasionally only one of the two routes is suffixed; [[U.S. Route 6N|US&nbsp;6N]] in [[Pennsylvania]] does not rejoin US&nbsp;6 at its west end. AASHTO has been trying to eliminate these since 1934;<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\">{{cite web |first=Richard F. |last=Weingroff |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us11.cfm |title=US&nbsp;11 Rouses Point, New York, to New Orleans, Louisiana |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate= June 9, 2011}}</ref> its current policy is to deny approval of new split routes and to eliminate existing ones \"as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways can reach agreement with reference thereto\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/>

===Naming===
The official route log, last published by AASHTO in 1989, has been named ''United States Numbered Highways'' since its initial publication in 1926.  Within the route log, \"U.S. Route\" is used in the table of contents, while \"United States Highway\" appears as the heading for each route.  All reports of the Special Committee on Route Numbering since 1989 use \"U.S. Route\", and federal laws relating to highways use \"United States Route\" or \"U.S. Route\" more often than the \"Highway\" variants.<ref>[[Google]] searches on [[thomas.loc.gov]] for [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22united+states+route \"United States Route\"], [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22u.s.+route \"U.S. Route\"], [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22united+states+highway \"United States Highway\"] and [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22u.s.+highway \"U.S. Highway\"]</ref>  The use of U.S. Route or U.S. Highway on a local level depends on the state, with some states such as Delaware using \"route\" and others such as Colorado using \"highway\".<ref name=DelDOT>{{cite web |url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/pubs_forms/manuals/traffic_counts/2006/pdf/rpt_pgs1_38_rev.pdf |format=PDF |author=[[Delaware Department of Transportation]] |publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation |title=2006 Traffic Count and Mileage Report |year=2006 |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318163528/http://www.deldot.gov/information/pubs_forms/manuals/traffic_counts/2006/pdf/rpt_pgs1_38_rev.pdf |archivedate=March 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.coloradodot.info/dataaccess/Highways/index.cfm?fuseaction=Description&route=006&begRefPt=0&endRefPt=500&Printable=true |title=Segment Descriptions for Highway 006 |author=[[Colorado Department of Transportation]] |publisher=Colorado Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526142107/http://apps.coloradodot.info/dataaccess/Highways/index.cfm?fuseaction=Description&route=006&begRefPt=0&endRefPt=500&Printable=true |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==History==

===Early auto trails===
{{Main|Auto trail}}
In 1903, [[Horatio Nelson Jackson]] became the first documented person to drive an automobile from [[San Francisco]] to [[New York City|New York]] using only a connection of dirt roads, cow paths, and railroad beds. His journey, covered by the press, became a national sensation and called for a system of long distance roads.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Dayton |last2= Burns |first2= Ken |title= Horatio's Drive: America's First Road Trip |year= 2003 |publisher= Alfred A. Knopf |location= New  York |isbn= 0-375-41536-X |edition= 1st |page= ix |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/horatiosdriveame00dunc }}</ref>

In the early 1910s, [[auto trail]] organizations—most prominently the [[Lincoln Highway]]—began to spring up, marking and promoting routes for the new recreation of long-distance automobile travel.  While many of these organizations worked with towns and states along the route to improve the roadways, others simply chose a route based on towns that were willing to pay dues, put up signs, and did little else.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\">{{cite web |last=Weingroff |first=Richard F. |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/numbers.cfm |title=From Names to Numbers:  The Origins of the US Numbered Highway System |work= Highway History |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2011  }}</ref>

===Planning===
{{wikisource|1=Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways October 30, 1925}}
Wisconsin was the first state in the U.S. to number [[list of Wisconsin numbered highways|its highways]], erecting signs in May 1918.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  Other states soon followed. In 1922, the [[New England]] states got together to establish the six-state [[New England Interstate Routes]].<ref name=\"nyt April 16\">{{cite news |title=Motor Sign Uniformity |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=April 16, 1922}}</ref>

Behind the scenes, the [[federal aid]] program had begun with the passage of the [[Federal Aid Road Act of 1916]], providing 50% monetary support from the [[federal government (US)|federal government]] for improvement of major roads.  The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

Secretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.  Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details—May 15 for the [[West (US)|West]], May 27 for the [[Mississippi Valley]], June 3 for the [[Great Lakes]], June 8 for the [[South (US)|South]], June 15 for the [[Atlantic Northeast|North Atlantic]], and June 15<!--typo?--> for [[New England]].  Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;— maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east–west and ten major north–south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

After working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>

===Disagreement and refinement, 1925–26===
[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]

The new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14–15, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

In the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

Many local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as—for instance—US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north–south than west–east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object—Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.

With 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>

Much of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

===Expansion and adjustment, 1926–56===
[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]

When the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.

In 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>
<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>

For the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Many of the first high-speed roads were U.S. Highways: the [[Gulf Freeway (Houston)|Gulf Freeway]] carried [[U.S. Route 75|US&nbsp;75]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Feldstein |title=A rare quiet interlude for area's first freeway/ Next major upgrade:  Causeway in 2002 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=June 27, 1999 |accessdate=June 9, 2009 |url=http://www.texasfreeway.com/Houston/photos/45s/chron_27-june-99_gulf_freeway.shtml}}</ref> the [[Pasadena Freeway]] carried [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]],<ref>Correspondence between the [[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]] and [[American Association of State Highway Officials]], transcribed at {{cite web |url=http://cahighways.org/065-072.html#066 |publisher= California Highways |title=State Route 66 |accessdate= June 10, 2011}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date= August 2011}}</ref> and the [[Pulaski Skyway]] carried [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] and [[U.S. Route 9|US&nbsp;9]].<ref>{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title= Road Atlas |year=1946 |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/NewYorkCity/randmcnally_ra_1946_040.html |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |page= 42 |inset=New York and Vicinity}}</ref>

===Interstate era, 1956–present===
[[File:US 34 (1961).svg|thumb|100px|1961 version of the U.S. Route shield]]

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] appropriated funding for the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of [[freeway]]s across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid.

A few major connections not served by Interstate Highways include US&nbsp;6 from Hartford, Connecticut, to Providence, Rhode Island and US&nbsp;93 from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada, though the latter is planned to be upgraded to [[Interstate 11]].

The '''United States Numbered Highway System''' (often called '''U.S. Routes''' or '''U.S. Highways''') is an integrated network of [[road]]s and [[highway]]s numbered within a nationwide grid in the [[contiguous United States]]. As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.

The route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north–south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east–west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.

Before the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.

Expansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.

==System details==
{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}

In general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>

Except for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s. AASHTO policy says that a toll road may only be included as a [[special route]], and that \"a toll-free routing between the same termini shall continue to be retained and marked as a part of the U.S. Numbered System.\"<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> [[U.S. Route 3]] (US&nbsp;3) meets this obligation; in [[U.S. Route 3 in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], it does not follow tolled portions of the [[Everett Turnpike]]. But US Routes in the system do use parts of five toll roads:<ref>{{cite map |author= [[Rand McNally]] |year= 2013 |title= The Road Atlas: United States, Canada & Mexico |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |at= p. 32, § A9; p. 83, §§ D15, D19; p. 92, § J8 |edition= 2013 Walmart |isbn= 0-528-00626-6}}</ref>

* [[U.S. Route 301 in Delaware|US&nbsp;301]] is a toll road through [[Delaware]]; the former routing is a free road and uses several Delaware state routes.

===Numbering===
U.S. Routes in the [[contiguous United States]] follow a grid pattern, in which odd-numbered routes run generally north to south and even-numbered routes run generally east to west, though spur routes can be either-or. Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.

In the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order to keep them from being confused with one another,<ref name=\"mcnichol71\"/> and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially conflict with [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] and [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Exceptions to this rule do occur.</ref>

In the US Highway system, three-digit numbers are assigned to spurs of one or two-digit routes. [[U.S. Route 201|US&nbsp;201]], for example, splits from [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] at [[Brunswick, Maine]], and runs north to Canada.<ref name=\"rm\">{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title=The Road Atlas and Travel Guide |year=2009 |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |isbn= 978-0-528-94209-9}}</ref>  Not all spurs travel in the same direction as their \"parents\"; some are connected to their parents only by other spurs, or not at all, instead only traveling near their parents, Also, a spur may travel in different cardinal directions than its parent, such as [[U.S. Route 522|US&nbsp;522]], which is a north-south route, unlike its parent [[U.S. Route 22|US&nbsp;22]], which is east-west. As originally assigned, the first digit of the spurs increased from north to south and east to west along the parent; for example, [[U.S. Route 60 (1925)|US&nbsp;60]] had spurs, running from east to west, designated as [[U.S. Route 160 (1925)|US&nbsp;160]] in [[Missouri]], [[U.S. Route 260 (1925)|US&nbsp;260]] in [[Oklahoma]], [[U.S. Route 360 (1925)|US&nbsp;360]] in [[Texas]], and [[U.S. Route 460|US&nbsp;460]] and [[U.S. Route 560 (1925)|US&nbsp;560]] in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"1925 list\"/>  As with the two-digit routes, three-digit routes have been added, removed, extended and shortened; the \"parent-child\" relationship is not always present.<ref name=\"rm\"/><ref name=\"esso\">{{cite map |author1=[[Esso]] |title=United States Featuring the Interstate Highway System |year=1966 |author2=[[General Drafting]] |last-author-amp= yes |scale= [c. 1:3,870,000] |location= Convent Station, NJ |publisher= General Drafting |oclc= 749860157}}</ref>

AASHTO guidelines specifically prohibit [[Interstate Highway]]s and U.S. Routes from sharing a number within the same state.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |format= PDF |title= Establishment of a Marking System of the Routes Comprising the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |author= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date= January 2000 |work= AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |accessdate= December 31, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140101011142/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |archivedate= January 1, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As with other guidelines, exceptions exist across the U.S.  <ref name=\"esso\"/>

Some two-digit numbers have never been applied to any U.S. Route, including 39, 47, 86 and 88.

===Signage===
Route numbers are displayed on a distinctively-shaped white shield with large black numerals in the center.  Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.

===Divided and special routes===
{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}

Since 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.  For instance, [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]] splits into [[U.S. Route 11E|US&nbsp;11E]] (east) and [[U.S. Route 11W|US&nbsp;11W]] (west) in [[Bristol, Virginia]], and the routes rejoin in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Occasionally only one of the two routes is suffixed; [[U.S. Route 6N|US&nbsp;6N]] in [[Pennsylvania]] does not rejoin US&nbsp;6 at its west end. AASHTO has been trying to eliminate these since 1934;<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\">{{cite web |first=Richard F. |last=Weingroff |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us11.cfm |title=US&nbsp;11 Rouses Point, New York, to New Orleans, Louisiana |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate= June 9, 2011}}</ref> its current policy is to deny approval of new split routes and to eliminate existing ones \"as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways can reach agreement with reference thereto\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/>

[[Special route]]s—those with a banner such as [[alternate route|alternate]] or [[bypass (road)|bypass]]—are also managed by AASHTO.<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/>  These are sometimes designated with lettered suffixes, like A for alternate or B for business.<ref>For example, compare the following for an alternate route in Ohio:

===Naming===
The official route log, last published by AASHTO in 1989, has been named ''United States Numbered Highways'' since its initial publication in 1926.  Within the route log, \"U.S. Route\" is used in the table of contents, while \"United States Highway\" appears as the heading for each route.  All reports of the Special Committee on Route Numbering since 1989 use \"U.S. Route\", and federal laws relating to highways use \"United States Route\" or \"U.S. Route\" more often than the \"Highway\" variants.<ref>[[Google]] searches on [[thomas.loc.gov]] for [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22united+states+route \"United States Route\"], [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22u.s.+route \"U.S. Route\"], [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22united+states+highway \"United States Highway\"] and [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22u.s.+highway \"U.S. Highway\"]</ref>  The use of U.S. Route or U.S. Highway on a local level depends on the state, with some states such as Delaware using \"route\" and others such as Colorado using \"highway\".<ref name=DelDOT>{{cite web |url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/pubs_forms/manuals/traffic_counts/2006/pdf/rpt_pgs1_38_rev.pdf |format=PDF |author=[[Delaware Department of Transportation]] |publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation |title=2006 Traffic Count and Mileage Report |year=2006 |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318163528/http://www.deldot.gov/information/pubs_forms/manuals/traffic_counts/2006/pdf/rpt_pgs1_38_rev.pdf |archivedate=March 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.coloradodot.info/dataaccess/Highways/index.cfm?fuseaction=Description&route=006&begRefPt=0&endRefPt=500&Printable=true |title=Segment Descriptions for Highway 006 |author=[[Colorado Department of Transportation]] |publisher=Colorado Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526142107/http://apps.coloradodot.info/dataaccess/Highways/index.cfm?fuseaction=Description&route=006&begRefPt=0&endRefPt=500&Printable=true |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==History==

===Early auto trails===
{{Main|Auto trail}}
In 1903, [[Horatio Nelson Jackson]] became the first documented person to drive an automobile from [[San Francisco]] to [[New York City|New York]] using only a connection of dirt roads, cow paths, and railroad beds. His journey, covered by the press, became a national sensation and called for a system of long distance roads.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Dayton |last2= Burns |first2= Ken |title= Horatio's Drive: America's First Road Trip |year= 2003 |publisher= Alfred A. Knopf |location= New  York |isbn= 0-375-41536-X |edition= 1st |page= ix |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/horatiosdriveame00dunc }}</ref>

In the early 1910s, [[auto trail]] organizations—most prominently the [[Lincoln Highway]]—began to spring up, marking and promoting routes for the new recreation of long-distance automobile travel.  While many of these organizations worked with towns and states along the route to improve the roadways, others simply chose a route based on towns that were willing to pay dues, put up signs, and did little else.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\">{{cite web |last=Weingroff |first=Richard F. |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/numbers.cfm |title=From Names to Numbers:  The Origins of the US Numbered Highway System |work= Highway History |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2011  }}</ref>

===Planning===
{{wikisource|1=Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways October 30, 1925}}
Wisconsin was the first state in the U.S. to number [[list of Wisconsin numbered highways|its highways]], erecting signs in May 1918.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  Other states soon followed. In 1922, the [[New England]] states got together to establish the six-state [[New England Interstate Routes]].<ref name=\"nyt April 16\">{{cite news |title=Motor Sign Uniformity |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=April 16, 1922}}</ref>

Behind the scenes, the [[federal aid]] program had begun with the passage of the [[Federal Aid Road Act of 1916]], providing 50% monetary support from the [[federal government (US)|federal government]] for improvement of major roads.  The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

Secretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.  Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details—May 15 for the [[West (US)|West]], May 27 for the [[Mississippi Valley]], June 3 for the [[Great Lakes]], June 8 for the [[South (US)|South]], June 15 for the [[Atlantic Northeast|North Atlantic]], and June 15<!--typo?--> for [[New England]].  Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;— maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east–west and ten major north–south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

After working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>

===Disagreement and refinement, 1925–26===
[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]

The new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14–15, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

In the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

Many local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as—for instance—US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north–south than west–east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object—Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.

With 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>

Much of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

===Expansion and adjustment, 1926–56===
[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]

When the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.

In 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>
<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>

For the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Many of the first high-speed roads were U.S. Highways: the [[Gulf Freeway (Houston)|Gulf Freeway]] carried [[U.S. Route 75|US&nbsp;75]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Feldstein |title=A rare quiet interlude for area's first freeway/ Next major upgrade:  Causeway in 2002 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=June 27, 1999 |accessdate=June 9, 2009 |url=http://www.texasfreeway.com/Houston/photos/45s/chron_27-june-99_gulf_freeway.shtml}}</ref> the [[Pasadena Freeway]] carried [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]],<ref>Correspondence between the [[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]] and [[American Association of State Highway Officials]], transcribed at {{cite web |url=http://cahighways.org/065-072.html#066 |publisher= California Highways |title=State Route 66 |accessdate= June 10, 2011}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date= August 2011}}</ref> and the [[Pulaski Skyway]] carried [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] and [[U.S. Route 9|US&nbsp;9]].<ref>{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title= Road Atlas |year=1946 |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/NewYorkCity/randmcnally_ra_1946_040.html |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |page= 42 |inset=New York and Vicinity}}</ref>

===Interstate era, 1956–present===
[[File:US 34 (1961).svg|thumb|100px|1961 version of the U.S. Route shield]]

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] appropriated funding for the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of [[freeway]]s across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]]. The 1985 removal of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] is often seen as the end of an era of US highways.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://archive.org/stream/californiahighwa196465calirich#page/n85/mode/2up |title= Route Renumbering: New Green Markers Will Replace Old Shields |journal= California Highways and Public Works |date= March–April 1964 |volume= 43 |issue= 3–4 |pages= 11–13 |issn= 0008-1159 |accessdate= June 10, 2011}}</ref>

A few major connections not served by Interstate Highways include US&nbsp;6 from Hartford, Connecticut, to Providence, Rhode Island and US&nbsp;93 from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada, though the latter is planned to be upgraded to [[Interstate 11]]. Three state capitals in the contiguous U.S. are served only by U.S. Routes: [[Dover, Delaware]]; [[Jefferson City, Missouri]]; and [[Pierre, South Dakota]].

In 1995 the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] was defined to include both the Interstate Highway System and other roads designated as important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

AASHTO is in the process of eliminating all [[List of Intrastate U.S. Highways|intrastate U.S. Highways]] less than {{convert|300|mi|km}} in length \"as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials can reach agreement with reference thereto\". New additions to the system must serve more than one state and \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> A version of this policy has been in place since 1937.<ref name=newsigning1937>{{cite journal |url= https://archive.org/stream/california193638highwacalirich#page/n521/mode/2up |title= New Signing Policy on U.S. Routes |journal= California Highways and Public Works |date= October 1937 |volume= 15 |issue= 10 |pages= 13, 28 |issn=  0008-1159 |access-date= July 24, 2015 |via= Archive.org}}</ref>

The '''United States Numbered Highway System''' (often called '''U.S. Routes''' or '''U.S. Highways''') is an integrated network of [[road]]s and [[highway]]s numbered within a nationwide grid in the [[contiguous United States]]. As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.

The route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north–south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east–west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.

Before the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.

Expansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.

==System details==
{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}

In general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>

Except for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s. AASHTO policy says that a toll road may only be included as a [[special route]], and that \"a toll-free routing between the same termini shall continue to be retained and marked as a part of the U.S. Numbered System.\"<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> [[U.S. Route 3]] (US&nbsp;3) meets this obligation; in [[U.S. Route 3 in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], it does not follow tolled portions of the [[Everett Turnpike]]. But US Routes in the system do use parts of five toll roads:<ref>{{cite map |author= [[Rand McNally]] |year= 2013 |title= The Road Atlas: United States, Canada & Mexico |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |at= p. 32, § A9; p. 83, §§ D15, D19; p. 92, § J8 |edition= 2013 Walmart |isbn= 0-528-00626-6}}</ref>

* [[U.S. Route 278 in South Carolina|US&nbsp;278]] uses the tolled [[Cross Island Parkway (Hilton Head Island)|Cross Island Parkway]] in [[South Carolina]]; the old road is [[U.S. Route 278 Business (Hilton Head Island, South Carolina)|US&nbsp;278 Business]].
* [[U.S. Route 301 in Delaware|US&nbsp;301]] is a toll road through [[Delaware]]; the former routing is a free road and uses several Delaware state routes.

===Numbering===
U.S. Routes in the [[contiguous United States]] follow a grid pattern, in which odd-numbered routes run generally north to south and even-numbered routes run generally east to west, though spur routes can be either-or. Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.

In the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order to keep them from being confused with one another,<ref name=\"mcnichol71\"/> and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially conflict with [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] and [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Exceptions to this rule do occur.</ref>

In the US Highway system, three-digit numbers are assigned to spurs of one or two-digit routes. [[U.S. Route 201|US&nbsp;201]], for example, splits from [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] at [[Brunswick, Maine]], and runs north to Canada.<ref name=\"rm\">{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title=The Road Atlas and Travel Guide |year=2009 |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |isbn= 978-0-528-94209-9}}</ref>  Not all spurs travel in the same direction as their \"parents\"; some are connected to their parents only by other spurs, or not at all, instead only traveling near their parents, Also, a spur may travel in different cardinal directions than its parent, such as [[U.S. Route 522|US&nbsp;522]], which is a north-south route, unlike its parent [[U.S. Route 22|US&nbsp;22]], which is east-west. As originally assigned, the first digit of the spurs increased from north to south and east to west along the parent; for example, [[U.S. Route 60 (1925)|US&nbsp;60]] had spurs, running from east to west, designated as [[U.S. Route 160 (1925)|US&nbsp;160]] in [[Missouri]], [[U.S. Route 260 (1925)|US&nbsp;260]] in [[Oklahoma]], [[U.S. Route 360 (1925)|US&nbsp;360]] in [[Texas]], and [[U.S. Route 460|US&nbsp;460]] and [[U.S. Route 560 (1925)|US&nbsp;560]] in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"1925 list\"/>  As with the two-digit routes, three-digit routes have been added, removed, extended and shortened; the \"parent-child\" relationship is not always present.<ref name=\"rm\"/><ref name=\"esso\">{{cite map |author1=[[Esso]] |title=United States Featuring the Interstate Highway System |year=1966 |author2=[[General Drafting]] |last-author-amp= yes |scale= [c. 1:3,870,000] |location= Convent Station, NJ |publisher= General Drafting |oclc= 749860157}}</ref>

AASHTO guidelines specifically prohibit [[Interstate Highway]]s and U.S. Routes from sharing a number within the same state.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |format= PDF |title= Establishment of a Marking System of the Routes Comprising the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |author= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date= January 2000 |work= AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |accessdate= December 31, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140101011142/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |archivedate= January 1, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As with other guidelines, exceptions exist across the U.S.  <ref name=\"esso\"/>

Some two-digit numbers have never been applied to any U.S. Route, including 39, 47, 86 and 88.

===Signage===
Route numbers are displayed on a distinctively-shaped white shield with large black numerals in the center.  Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.

===Divided and special routes===
{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}

Since 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.  For instance, [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]] splits into [[U.S. Route 11E|US&nbsp;11E]] (east) and [[U.S. Route 11W|US&nbsp;11W]] (west) in [[Bristol, Virginia]], and the routes rejoin in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Occasionally only one of the two routes is suffixed; [[U.S. Route 6N|US&nbsp;6N]] in [[Pennsylvania]] does not rejoin US&nbsp;6 at its west end. AASHTO has been trying to eliminate these since 1934;<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\">{{cite web |first=Richard F. |last=Weingroff |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us11.cfm |title=US&nbsp;11 Rouses Point, New York, to New Orleans, Louisiana |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate= June 9, 2011}}</ref> its current policy is to deny approval of new split routes and to eliminate existing ones \"as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways can reach agreement with reference thereto\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/>

[[Special route]]s—those with a banner such as [[alternate route|alternate]] or [[bypass (road)|bypass]]—are also managed by AASHTO.<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/>  These are sometimes designated with lettered suffixes, like A for alternate or B for business.<ref>For example, compare the following for an alternate route in Ohio:

===Naming===
The official route log, last published by AASHTO in 1989, has been named ''United States Numbered Highways'' since its initial publication in 1926.  Within the route log, \"U.S. Route\" is used in the table of contents, while \"United States Highway\" appears as the heading for each route.  All reports of the Special Committee on Route Numbering since 1989 use \"U.S. Route\", and federal laws relating to highways use \"United States Route\" or \"U.S. Route\" more often than the \"Highway\" variants.<ref>[[Google]] searches on [[thomas.loc.gov]] for [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22united+states+route \"United States Route\"], [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22u.s.+route \"U.S. Route\"], [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22united+states+highway \"United States Highway\"] and [https://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Athomas.loc.gov+%22u.s.+highway \"U.S. Highway\"]</ref>  The use of U.S. Route or U.S. Highway on a local level depends on the state, with some states such as Delaware using \"route\" and others such as Colorado using \"highway\".<ref name=DelDOT>{{cite web |url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/pubs_forms/manuals/traffic_counts/2006/pdf/rpt_pgs1_38_rev.pdf |format=PDF |author=[[Delaware Department of Transportation]] |publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation |title=2006 Traffic Count and Mileage Report |year=2006 |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318163528/http://www.deldot.gov/information/pubs_forms/manuals/traffic_counts/2006/pdf/rpt_pgs1_38_rev.pdf |archivedate=March 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.coloradodot.info/dataaccess/Highways/index.cfm?fuseaction=Description&route=006&begRefPt=0&endRefPt=500&Printable=true |title=Segment Descriptions for Highway 006 |author=[[Colorado Department of Transportation]] |publisher=Colorado Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526142107/http://apps.coloradodot.info/dataaccess/Highways/index.cfm?fuseaction=Description&route=006&begRefPt=0&endRefPt=500&Printable=true |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==History==

===Early auto trails===
{{Main|Auto trail}}
In 1903, [[Horatio Nelson Jackson]] became the first documented person to drive an automobile from [[San Francisco]] to [[New York City|New York]] using only a connection of dirt roads, cow paths, and railroad beds. His journey, covered by the press, became a national sensation and called for a system of long distance roads.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Dayton |last2= Burns |first2= Ken |title= Horatio's Drive: America's First Road Trip |year= 2003 |publisher= Alfred A. Knopf |location= New  York |isbn= 0-375-41536-X |edition= 1st |page= ix |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/horatiosdriveame00dunc }}</ref>

In the early 1910s, [[auto trail]] organizations—most prominently the [[Lincoln Highway]]—began to spring up, marking and promoting routes for the new recreation of long-distance automobile travel.  While many of these organizations worked with towns and states along the route to improve the roadways, others simply chose a route based on towns that were willing to pay dues, put up signs, and did little else.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\">{{cite web |last=Weingroff |first=Richard F. |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/numbers.cfm |title=From Names to Numbers:  The Origins of the US Numbered Highway System |work= Highway History |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2011  }}</ref>

===Planning===
{{wikisource|1=Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways October 30, 1925}}
Wisconsin was the first state in the U.S. to number [[list of Wisconsin numbered highways|its highways]], erecting signs in May 1918.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  Other states soon followed. In 1922, the [[New England]] states got together to establish the six-state [[New England Interstate Routes]].<ref name=\"nyt April 16\">{{cite news |title=Motor Sign Uniformity |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=April 16, 1922}}</ref>

Behind the scenes, the [[federal aid]] program had begun with the passage of the [[Federal Aid Road Act of 1916]], providing 50% monetary support from the [[federal government (US)|federal government]] for improvement of major roads.  The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

Secretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.  Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details—May 15 for the [[West (US)|West]], May 27 for the [[Mississippi Valley]], June 3 for the [[Great Lakes]], June 8 for the [[South (US)|South]], June 15 for the [[Atlantic Northeast|North Atlantic]], and June 15<!--typo?--> for [[New England]].  Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;— maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east–west and ten major north–south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

After working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>

===Disagreement and refinement, 1925–26===
[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]

The new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14–15, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

In the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

Many local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as—for instance—US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

The most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north–south than west–east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object—Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.

With 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>

Much of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>

===Expansion and adjustment, 1926–56===
[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]

When the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.

In 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>
<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>

For the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Many of the first high-speed roads were U.S. Highways: the [[Gulf Freeway (Houston)|Gulf Freeway]] carried [[U.S. Route 75|US&nbsp;75]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Feldstein |title=A rare quiet interlude for area's first freeway/ Next major upgrade:  Causeway in 2002 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=June 27, 1999 |accessdate=June 9, 2009 |url=http://www.texasfreeway.com/Houston/photos/45s/chron_27-june-99_gulf_freeway.shtml}}</ref> the [[Pasadena Freeway]] carried [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]],<ref>Correspondence between the [[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]] and [[American Association of State Highway Officials]], transcribed at {{cite web |url=http://cahighways.org/065-072.html#066 |publisher= California Highways |title=State Route 66 |accessdate= June 10, 2011}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date= August 2011}}</ref> and the [[Pulaski Skyway]] carried [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] and [[U.S. Route 9|US&nbsp;9]].<ref>{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title= Road Atlas |year=1946 |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/NewYorkCity/randmcnally_ra_1946_040.html |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |page= 42 |inset=New York and Vicinity}}</ref>

===Interstate era, 1956–present===
[[File:US 34 (1961).svg|thumb|100px|1961 version of the U.S. Route shield]]

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] appropriated funding for the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of [[freeway]]s across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]]. The 1985 removal of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] is often seen as the end of an era of US highways.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://archive.org/stream/californiahighwa196465calirich#page/n85/mode/2up |title= Route Renumbering: New Green Markers Will Replace Old Shields |journal= California Highways and Public Works |date= March–April 1964 |volume= 43 |issue= 3–4 |pages= 11–13 |issn= 0008-1159 |accessdate= June 10, 2011}}</ref>

A few major connections not served by Interstate Highways include US&nbsp;6 from Hartford, Connecticut, to Providence, Rhode Island and US&nbsp;93 from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada, though the latter is planned to be upgraded to [[Interstate 11]]. Three state capitals in the contiguous U.S. are served only by U.S. Routes: [[Dover, Delaware]]; [[Jefferson City, Missouri]]; and [[Pierre, South Dakota]].

In 1995 the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] was defined to include both the Interstate Highway System and other roads designated as important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

AASHTO is in the process of eliminating all [[List of Intrastate U.S. Highways|intrastate U.S. Highways]] less than {{convert|300|mi|km}} in length \"as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials can reach agreement with reference thereto\". New additions to the system must serve more than one state and \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> A version of this policy has been in place since 1937.<ref name=newsigning1937>{{cite journal |url= https://archive.org/stream/california193638highwacalirich#page/n521/mode/2up |title= New Signing Policy on U.S. Routes |journal= California Highways and Public Works |date= October 1937 |volume= 15 |issue= 10 |pages= 13, 28 |issn=  0008-1159 |access-date= July 24, 2015 |via= Archive.org}}</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

== St. Joseph County Public Library ==

=== History ===
The St. Joseph County Public Library was founded in 1889. Originally known as the South Bend Public Library, it was founded by the South Bend School Corporation and managed by Evelyn Humphries out of a floor of the Oliver Opera House. Humphries soon secured funding for the building of the Main Library which opened to the public in 1896. It was known as \"The Castle\" due to its unique architecture.<ref name=\"Michiana Memory\">{{cite web| url=http://michianamemory.sjcpl.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16827coll16 |accessdate=2018-11-25 |title=Library History |publisher=[[Michiana Memory]]}}</ref>
In 1902, Virginia Tutt became the second library director. She opened the first library branch in Washington High School in 1918, which often served as a community center for Polish and Hungarian immigrants. The Betty Ruth Spiro Memorial Library replaced \"The Castle\" in 1959 as the new main library building in downtown South Bend. This building served the community until its renovation in 1992 led to a fire and subsequent damage from smoke and fire sprinklers. The renovation continued and the library was able to open 7 days later thanks to help from the community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://sjcpl.lib.in.us/our-history |publisher=Saint Joseph County Public Library |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>
In 2016 Main Library began looking at the need for an expanded space in downtown South Bend to meet the needs of the growing community. After working with consultants and architects, it was decided in October 2018 that Main Library will expand to include a community learning center, renovated exterior, and inner courtyard.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parrott |first1=Jeff |title=Downtown South Bend library proposes dramatic, $38-million overhaul |url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/downtown-south-bend-library-proposes-dramatic--million-overhaul/article_2232a556-8427-5b6a-88b2-df1b984a5956.html |publisher=South Bend Tribune |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> St. Joseph County is considering cutting the library's funding by almost $500,000 a year. As a result, on September 5, 2019, hundreds of residents protested in the streets, and all library branches closed early. Overflow crowds backed the county council meeting to show their support for the library.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://wsbt.com/news/local/st-joseph-county-libraries-closing-early-in-protest-of-funding-plan |accessdate=10 September 2019 |publisher=WSBT News |date=09/05/2019}}</ref>

== St. Joseph County Public Library ==

=== History ===
The St. Joseph County Public Library was founded in 1889. Originally known as the South Bend Public Library, it was founded by the South Bend School Corporation and managed by Evelyn Humphries out of a floor of the Oliver Opera House. Humphries soon secured funding for the building of the Main Library which opened to the public in 1896. It was known as \"The Castle\" due to its unique architecture.<ref name=\"Michiana Memory\">{{cite web| url=http://michianamemory.sjcpl.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16827coll16 |accessdate=2018-11-25 |title=Library History |publisher=[[Michiana Memory]]}}</ref>
In 1902, Virginia Tutt became the second library director. She opened the first library branch in Washington High School in 1918, which often served as a community center for Polish and Hungarian immigrants. The Betty Ruth Spiro Memorial Library replaced \"The Castle\" in 1959 as the new main library building in downtown South Bend. This building served the community until its renovation in 1992 led to a fire and subsequent damage from smoke and fire sprinklers. The renovation continued and the library was able to open 7 days later thanks to help from the community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://sjcpl.lib.in.us/our-history |publisher=Saint Joseph County Public Library |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>
In 2016 Main Library began looking at the need for an expanded space in downtown South Bend to meet the needs of the growing community. After working with consultants and architects, it was decided in October 2018 that Main Library will expand to include a community learning center, renovated exterior, and inner courtyard.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parrott |first1=Jeff |title=Downtown South Bend library proposes dramatic, $38-million overhaul |url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/downtown-south-bend-library-proposes-dramatic--million-overhaul/article_2232a556-8427-5b6a-88b2-df1b984a5956.html |publisher=South Bend Tribune |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> St. Joseph County is considering cutting the library's funding by almost $500,000 a year. As a result, on September 5, 2019, hundreds of residents protested in the streets, and all library branches closed early. Overflow crowds backed the county council meeting to show their support for the library.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://wsbt.com/news/local/st-joseph-county-libraries-closing-early-in-protest-of-funding-plan |accessdate=10 September 2019 |publisher=WSBT News |date=09/05/2019}}</ref>

'''Serbian comics''' are [[comics]] produced in [[Serbia]].

Comics are called ''stripovi'' in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (singular ''strip'') and come in all shapes and sizes, merging influences from [[American comic book|American comics]] to [[Franco-Belgian comics|bandes dessinées]].

Comics started developing in Serbia in the late 19th century, mostly in [[Humor magazine|humor]] and [[Children's literature|children’s magazines]]. From the 1920s to the end of the 1980s, Serbian comics were part of the larger [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] comics scene; a large number of titles was published from 1932 to 1991, mainly in [[Serbo-Croatian language]]. After [[Yugoslav Wars|the breakup of Yugoslavia]] and the crisis in the 1990s, Serbian comics have experienced a revival.

== History ==
=== \"The Golden Age\" (1932-1941) ===
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=When we started out, nobody thought how it’d all turn out, or what it’d become. How far we’d come!

[[File:Zigomarcomics.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Zigomar (comics)|Zigomar]]'', created by artist Nikola Navojev and writer Branko Vidić and heavily influenced by foreign [[masked hero]] comics, is considered one of the most notable titles of the \"Golden Age of Serbian Comics\".]]

In 1932 ''Veseli četvrtak'' (''Merry Thursday''), an illustrated magazine for children, appeared in [[Belgrade]]; an unusually large amount of space was allotted to [[cartoon]]s. The magazine featured foreign works such as ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]'' and ''[[Felix the Cat]]'', but also ''Doživljaji Mike Miša'' (''The Adventures of Mika the Mouse''), a [[Mickey Mouse]] [[pastiche]] by Serbian authors. Other [[Weekly newspaper|weeklies]] and dailies such as ''Vreme'' and ''Pravda'' followed suit.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/kultura/vesti/tri-generacije-srpskih-strip-autora-u-francuskom-institutu-od-djorda-lobaceva-do/c0f9mfd|title=Tri generacije srpskih strip autora u Francuskom institutu, od Đorđa Lobačeva do Alekse Gajića|date=2015-11-27|language=sr-SP|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> In 1934, one whole page of ''[[Politika]]'' newspaper was devoted to ''[[Secret Agent X-9]]''. In addition to adventure comics, [[Walt Disney]]'s [[funny animal]]s were also popular at the time, especially Mickey Mouse, whose name would be used in the titles of a number of Yugoslav comic publications: ''Mika Miš'', ''Mikijeve novine'' (''Mickey's Newspapers''), ''Mikijevo carstvo'' (''Mickey's Empire''). An editor named Dušan Timotijević named the new art form \"strip\", after English \"[[comic strip]]\".

In 1934, the first two specialized [[comic magazine]]s appeared - ''Strip'' and ''Crtani film'' (''Cartoon''). Their appearance and content were influenced by the Italian magazines ''[[Topolino]]'', ''[[L'Audace]]'' and ''[[L'Avventuroso]]'', as well as French magazines ''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]'' and ''[[Hop-là!]]''. [[White émigré|Russian immigrant]] [[Nikola Navojev]] debuted in the pages of ''Strip'' with his works. Although he died at the age of 27,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/n/navojev_nikola.htm|title=Nikola Navojev|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> Navojev was a prolific author who created a number of characters for Strip, of which [[Jungle girl (stock character)|jungle girl]] Tarcaneta (''Tarzanette'') is best-known today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=475877|title=Srpska ''pin-up'' divljakuša|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> In 1935, inspired by the adventures of [[Alex Raymond]]'s X-9, Vlastimir Belkić created the first original character in Serbian comics named Hari Vils.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/belkic_vlastimir.htm|title=Vlastimir Belkic|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> Similarly, other two Russian immigrants, artist [[Đorđe Lobačev]] and writer Vadim Kurganski, began working on their first comic, called ''Krvavo nasledstvo'' (''Bloody Heritage''), serialized in the illustrated periodical ''Panorama''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lobacev_djordje.htm|title=Djordje Lobacev|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> Not only was it the first successful modern comic produced in Serbia, but also the first title set in Yugoslavia.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tragom narodne mašte|last=Lobačev|first=Đorđe|publisher=Dečje novine|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

[[File:Gospodar smrti.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Master Death]]'', drawn by Đorđe Lobačev and published in ''Mikijevo carstvo'', is one of the most notable titles of the \"Golden Age of Serbian comics\". Published on the eve of World War II, ''Master Death'' carried a strong anti-war message.]]

Most of the Golden Age artists were Russian immigrants, collectively known as the Belgrade Circle and gathered at first around the ''Mika Miš'' magazine. Soon enough it was transformed into a real comic magazine, reprinting foreign classics like ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', [[Phantom (comics)|''Phantom'']] and ''[[Flash Gordon]]'', but also publishing comics by the local authors. ''Mika Miš'' lasted from 1936 to 1941, when it ended with issue 505.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wolfstad.com/dcw/serbia-and-montenegro/mika-mis-1936-1941/|title=Mika Mis (1936 - 1941) by Aleksandar J.

The key figures behind all three publications were editors Aleksandar J. Ivković and Milutin Ignjačević.<ref name=\":0\" /> From 1935 to 1941 about twenty comic magazines were launched in Serbia, published weekly and bi-weekly, mostly in black-and-white. They were sold throughout Yugoslavia. In order to boost sales in the western parts of Yugoslavia (today's [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]), some publications were printed not only in the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]] but also [[Latin alphabet]]. Comics were distributed through [[convenience store]]s, [[Newsagent's shop|newsstands]] and [[Newspaper hawker|newsboys]], with an average print run of 10,000 - 30,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/zzupan-golden_age.html|title=[Projekat Rastko] Zdravko Zupan: The Golden Age of Serbian Comics|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref>

The notable works were inspired by cultural classics and [[Serbian folklore]]. The shortlist includes [[Ivan Šenšin]]'s ''Hrabri vojnik Švejk'' (an adaptation of [[Jaroslav Hašek]]'s novel ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk]]'') and ''Zvonar Bogorodičine crkve'' (and adaptation of [[Victor Hugo]]'s novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]''), [[Sergej Solovjev]]'s ''Carev štitonoša'' (''Emperor's Squire''), ''Robin Hud'' (''[[Robin Hood]]'') and ''Ajvanho'' (an adaptation of [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''), Lobačev's ''[[Master Death]]'', ''Baron Minhauzen'' (an adaptation of [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]]'s ''[[Baron Munchausen|The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'') and ''Biberče'' (''Pepper-Boy'', based on the Serbian folk [[fairytale]] of the same name), [[Konstantin Kuznjecov]]'s ''Grofica Margo'' (''Countess Margo'') and ''Bajka o caru Saltanu'' (an adaptation of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s [[poem]] ''[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan]]''). Unlike most of his contemporaries, [[Sebastijan Lechner]] also wrote his own scripts, such as ''Džarto''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lehner_sebastijan.htm|title=Sebastijan Lechner|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> Similarly, Navojev teamed up with [[Script (comics)|comics writer]] [[Branko Vidić]] to create [[Zigomar (comics)|''Zigomar'']]. Some of the titles were reprinted in [[France|French]] and [[Turkey|Turkish]] magazines,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kayaozkaracalar.blogspot.com/2008/12/yugoslavian-comics-in-turkey-part-1.html|title=The MysterIous Flame of Queen Loana: YUGOSLAVIAN COMICS IN TURKEY - PART 1: COUNTESS MARGO|last=Özkaracalar|first=Kaya|date=2008-12-23|website=The MysterIous Flame of Queen Loana|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref> while ''Zigomar'' was also published in [[Bulgaria]], [[Italy]] and [[Argentina]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phantomwiki.org/Zigomar_vs._The_Phantom#Reprints|title=Zigomar vs. The Phantom - PhantomWiki|website=www.phantomwiki.org|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> 

Other creators of \"the first generation\" included Vsevold Guljevič, Aleksije Ranhner, Đorđe Janković, Moma Marković, Marijan Ebner, Vojin Đorđević, Nikola Tiščenko, Dragan Savić and Đorđe Mali. Lobačev's brother-in-law Valerian Apuhtin became the first professional [[letterer]] in Serbia. Another young artist at the time, [[Živorad Mitrović]] would revisit this period in his 1982 film ''Savamala''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mitrovic|first=Zivorad 'Zika'|title=Savamala|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173169/|accessdate=2016-07-20}}</ref>

The Golden Age of Serbian comics ended with the Nazi [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941. After [[World War II]] some authors were executed as [[Collaborationism|collaborators]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kockar_vljko.htm|title=Veljko Kockar|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sensin_ivan.htm|title=Ivan Sensin|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> by [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|the new communist regime]] or forced to [[Emigration|emigrate]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kuznjecov_k.htm|title=Konstantin Kuznjecov|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/solovjev_sergej.htm|title=Sergej Solovjev|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref>

=== 1945–1990 ===
After World War II, the communist government considered comics a decadent product of the [[Western world#Cold War context|West]], therefore worthless and even harmful for children. In 1946 [[State-controlled media|state-owned]] daily newspaper ''[[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]]'' criticized comics as \"[[black market]] [[ersatz good]]s\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stripvesti.com/spec/knjiga/borba1.htm|title=index|website=www.stripvesti.com|access-date=2016-07-19}}</ref> For years to come, comics would be discouraged or outright banned. New magazines like ''Tri ugursuza'' (''Three Rowdies'', the Yugoslav title of ''[[Les Pieds Nickelés]]'') and ''Vrabac'' (''The Sparrow'') were short-lived, although comic strips and cartoons survived in the humor magazines ''Jež'' (''Hedgehog'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=392855|title=Oslobođenje i cenzura|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> and ''Mali Jež'' (''Little Hedgehog''), where [[Milorad Dobrić]] and Dejan Nastić published in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/dobric_milorad.htm|title=Milorad Dobric|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref>

The outlook changed after the [[Tito–Stalin Split|Tito-Stalin Split]] in 1948. In 1951 Walt Disney’s comics returned to Serbia’s newspapers. In 1952 ''Politikin Zabavnik'' was revived, boasting a circulation of 450,000 in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=369528|title=Formula udrobljenog sadržaja|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> (The magazine is still published, having reached its 3000th issue in 2009.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://politikin-zabavnik.co.rs/pz/tekstovi/na-rodjendan-pitinog-deteta|title=Broj 3000 {{!}} Politikin Zabavnik|website=politikin-zabavnik.co.rs|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> Lobačev was welcomed back to the pages of ''Zabavnik'' in 1965. However, it would publish few local comics until [[Lazo Sredanović]]’s ''[[Dikan]]'' in 1969.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1129271|title=Buzdovan i meko srce|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> 

[[File:Dikan strip junak.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Dikan]]'' by Lazo Sredanović was commissioned by ''[[Politikin Zabavnik]]'' and modeled after ''[[Asterix]]''.]]

Nevertheless, back in the 1950s comic magazines like ''Robinzon'' (''[[Robinson Crusoe|Robinson]]'') and ''Veseli zabavnik'' were still censored, but even the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] started publishing some.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/1/strip-u-srbiji-1955-1972/index_l.html|title=[Projekat Rastko] Zdravko Zupan: Strip u Srbiji 1955-1972.|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> Zdravko Sulić began his career in such a publication, most of his works later published in the magazine [[Kekec (magazine)|''Kekec'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sulic_zdravko.htm|title=Zdravko Sulic|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref> It was launched by [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]] in 1957, featuring French comics such as ''[[Lucky Luke]]'', [[The Smurfs|''Smurfs'']] and ''[[Chlorophylle]]'', but also domestic titles, including the works of \"the second generation\" of creators, like Aleksandar Hecl of ''Vinetu'' (''[[Winnetou]]'') fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/hecl_aleksandar.htm|title=Aleksandar Hecl|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> The first [[CMYK color model|four-color]] ''Kekec'' publication reached the print run of 300,000 copies.<ref name=\":2\" /> ''Kekec'' lasted for 1532 issues and ended in 1990. 



1957 also saw teachers from the small town of [[Gornji Milanovac]] launch [[student newspaper]] ''[[Dečje novine]]'', which grew into a major publisher. Their most successful characters were [[Mirko and Slavko]], heroes of the [[eponym]]ous [[comic book]]. In the 1960s the adventures of the two [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] peaked at 200,000 copies per issue. To date, it is the only Yugoslav comic adapted into a [[live action]] movie.<ref>Marković, Đorđe (2012). SFRJ za početnike. Delta Video.</ref> The title was serialized in the ''Nikad robom'' comic book series, which also printed works by Petar Radičević (''Mystery Knight''), Radivoj Bogičević (''Akant''), Božidar Veselinović (''Dabiša'') and Živorad Atanacković (''Hajduk Veljko''), all inspired by the history of the [[South Slavs]]. The same publisher launched a number of other magazines, including ''Zenit'' and ''Biblioteka Lale'' (which first reprinted [[Marvel Comics|Marvel comics]] in Yugoslavia) and ''Eks almanah'' (which introduced [[DC Comics|DC]] [[superhero]]es, among others).

[[File:Cover to YU strip issue 31, featuring Kobra, art by Branislav Kerac.jpg|left|thumb|''[[YU strip]]'' magazine cover, featuring ''[[Kobra (comic book)|Kobra]]'' by [[Branislav Kerac]], a comic which merged influences from [[Action film|action movies]] to [[Franco-Belgian comics|bandes dessinées]].]]
Starting as an ''Eks'' [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] in 1977, the ''[[YU strip]]'' magazine turned to be the seminal publication for Serbian authors. Teamed up with writer [[Svetozar Obradović]], [[Branislav Kerac]] had already debuted with ''Lieutenant Tara'' in the ''Zlatni kliker'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bkerac.tripod.com/artist.htm|title=Comix Drawer|website=bkerac.tripod.com|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> The duo went on to create [[Kobra (comic book)|''Kobra'']], the most popular Yugoslav comic of the 1980s. Kerac’s super-heroine [[Cat Claw]] reached even greater success abroad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kerac_bane.htm|title=Bane Kerac|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> A number of local creators ([[Zoran Janjetov]], [[R. M. Guéra|R.M. Guera]], [[Darko Perović]], [[Zoran Tucić]], [[Vujadin Radovanović]], [[Željko Pahek]], [[Dejan Nenadov]], [[Vladimir Krstić - Laci|Vladimir Krstić]] and many others) published their early stories in ''YU strip'' before they went on to work for foreign publishers. The magazine lasted for 85 issues and ended in 1987.

By the late 1970s, the scene rebounded after the blow it had suffered from the 1972 tax law<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=429075|title=Mirko, Slavko i Kekec|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref> which targeted not only the [[Yellow journalism|yellow press]] but also comics. From 1971 to 1981, 11,611 issues of comics and [[Pulp magazine|pulp novels]] were printed in Yugoslavia, a total of 717 million copies in the country of 22 million people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2015/01/fenomen-popularnosti-stripa-u.html|title=Yugopapir: Fenomen popularnosti stripa: U Jugoslaviji je od 1971 - 81. prodato 716 miliona primeraka|website=www.yugopapir.com|access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the student press welcomed [[comics studies]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stripvesti.com/arhiva/sv-194.htm#djukanovic|title=SVesti|website=www.stripvesti.com|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> and [[alternative comics]] of \"the third generation\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kljakić|first=Ljubomir|date=1979|title=Quo vadis treća generacijo?|url=|journal=\"Vidici\" br. 2|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}</ref> inspired by ''[[Métal hurlant]]''. The ''Pegaz'' magazine was another publication that nurtured comics theory; it was also where the award-winning  ''Svemironi'' strip by Lazar Stanojević premiered in 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/lstanojevic/lstanojevic-svemironi.html|title=[Projekat Rastko] Lazar Stanojevic: svemironi|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref>

In addition, comic groups like Belgrade Circle 2 and Bauhaus 7 appeared, comic album was introduced as a new format, and the first [[Animated cartoon|animated short]] based on a comic was filmed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ljubac.rs/|title=LJUBOMIR MILOJEVIĆ LJUBAC - HOME|website=ljubac.rs|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref> The mass media embraced comics insomuch that the [[Radio Television of Serbia|national television]] produced an educational series on the medium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/tv/sr/story/255/rts-3/1526747/stripomanija-1-6.html|title=Stripomanija, 1-6|last=Serbia|first=RTS, Radio televizija Srbije, Radio Television of|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>

Another new trend in the 1960s was the emergence of more comic magazines outside of Belgrade. Published by Forum in [[Novi Sad]], ''Panorama'' was eventually transformed into ''[[Stripoteka]]'', which reached issue 1000 in 2004<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://happynovisad.com/strip/stripoteka-broj-1000.270.html|title=STRIPOTEKA broj 1000!|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref> and still comes out today. [[Dnevnik (Serbia)|Dnevnik]] launched ''Zlatna serija'' and ''Lunov magnus strip'', featuring [[Italian comics|Italian comic books]] like [[Tex Willer|''Tex'']] and ''[[Zagor]]''. In the 1980s Kerac spearheaded teams of writers and artists working on [[Licensed production|licensed]] [[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan]] and [[Il Grande Blek|Blek]] comics for these two publishers. The list included artists [[Branko Plavšić]], [[Goran Đukić Gorski (artist)|Goran Đukić]], [[Miodrag Ivanović Mikica|Miodrag Ivanović]], [[Pavel Koza]], [[Marinko Lebović]], [[Petar Meseldžija]], Milan Miletić, [[Sibin Slavković]] and [[Dragan Stokić Rajački]]. The [[Ninja (comic book)|Ninja]] and [[Mitar Milošević|Lun kralj ponoći]] comics were similarly manufactured, but were based on the Yugoslav pulp novels of the same names.

Until 1991 Serbian comics were part of Yugoslav comics. Distributed via newsstands, most comics were sold throughout Yugoslavia, written by and large in the common [[Shtokavian]] dialect and often printed in the Latin alphabet. 

Publications from other republics, especially Croatia, from Plavi Vjesnik to ''[[Alan Ford (comics)|Alan Ford]]'', had a great influence on creators and readers in Serbia. A [[Play (theatre)|play]] titled ''Alan Ford'' written by Mirjana Lazić and directed by Kokan Mladenović was staged at Teatar T in Belgrade in 1994. [[Radio Belgrade]] produced a [[radio drama]] based on the play in 2002. 

Also, authors worked for publishers outside Serbia, e.g. artists Dušan Reljić, Bojan Đukić, Ratomir Petrović, [[Zdravko Zupan]], [[Nikola Maslovara]] and Zoran Kovačević, as well as writer Lazar Odanović collaborated on the licensed [[Tom and Jerry]] comics for ''[[Vjesnik]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/60godina/60gstripa_10.html|title=Slobodan Ivkov: 60 godina stripa u Srbiji|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-24}}</ref> Finally, artists exhibited at the joint Yugoslav Comics Festival in [[Vinkovci]] (Salon jugoslovenskog stripa).

The local comic book industry collapsed with the breakup of Yugoslavia.

'''Serbian comics''' are [[comics]] produced in [[Serbia]].

Comics are called ''stripovi'' in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (singular ''strip'') and come in all shapes and sizes, merging influences from [[American comic book|American comics]] to [[Franco-Belgian comics|bandes dessinées]].

Comics started developing in Serbia in the late 19th century, mostly in [[Humor magazine|humor]] and [[Children's literature|children’s magazines]]. From the 1920s to the end of the 1980s, Serbian comics were part of the larger [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] comics scene; a large number of titles was published from 1932 to 1991, mainly in [[Serbo-Croatian language]]. After [[Yugoslav Wars|the breakup of Yugoslavia]] and the crisis in the 1990s, Serbian comics have experienced a revival.

[[File:Zigomarcomics.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Zigomar (comics)|Zigomar]]'', created by artist Nikola Navojev and writer Branko Vidić and heavily influenced by foreign [[masked hero]] comics, is considered one of the most notable titles of the \"Golden Age of Serbian Comics\".]]

In 1932 ''Veseli četvrtak'' (''Merry Thursday''), an illustrated magazine for children, appeared in [[Belgrade]]; an unusually large amount of space was allotted to [[cartoon]]s. The magazine featured foreign works such as ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]'' and ''[[Felix the Cat]]'', but also ''Doživljaji Mike Miša'' (''The Adventures of Mika the Mouse''), a [[Mickey Mouse]] [[pastiche]] by Serbian authors. Other [[Weekly newspaper|weeklies]] and dailies such as ''Vreme'' and ''Pravda'' followed suit.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/kultura/vesti/tri-generacije-srpskih-strip-autora-u-francuskom-institutu-od-djorda-lobaceva-do/c0f9mfd|title=Tri generacije srpskih strip autora u Francuskom institutu, od Đorđa Lobačeva do Alekse Gajića|date=2015-11-27|language=sr-SP|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> In 1934, one whole page of ''[[Politika]]'' newspaper was devoted to ''[[Secret Agent X-9]]''. In addition to adventure comics, [[Walt Disney]]'s [[funny animal]]s were also popular at the time, especially Mickey Mouse, whose name would be used in the titles of a number of Yugoslav comic publications: ''Mika Miš'', ''Mikijeve novine'' (''Mickey's Newspapers''), ''Mikijevo carstvo'' (''Mickey's Empire''). An editor named Dušan Timotijević named the new art form \"strip\", after English \"[[comic strip]]\".

In 1934, the first two specialized [[comic magazine]]s appeared - ''Strip'' and ''Crtani film'' (''Cartoon''). Their appearance and content were influenced by the Italian magazines ''[[Topolino]]'', ''[[L'Audace]]'' and ''[[L'Avventuroso]]'', as well as French magazines ''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]'' and ''[[Hop-là!]]''. [[White émigré|Russian immigrant]] [[Nikola Navojev]] debuted in the pages of ''Strip'' with his works. Although he died at the age of 27,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/n/navojev_nikola.htm|title=Nikola Navojev|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> Navojev was a prolific author who created a number of characters for Strip, of which [[Jungle girl (stock character)|jungle girl]] Tarcaneta (''Tarzanette'') is best-known today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=475877|title=Srpska ''pin-up'' divljakuša|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> In 1935, inspired by the adventures of [[Alex Raymond]]'s X-9, Vlastimir Belkić created the first original character in Serbian comics named Hari Vils.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/belkic_vlastimir.htm|title=Vlastimir Belkic|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> Similarly, other two Russian immigrants, artist [[Đorđe Lobačev]] and writer Vadim Kurganski, began working on their first comic, called ''Krvavo nasledstvo'' (''Bloody Heritage''), serialized in the illustrated periodical ''Panorama''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lobacev_djordje.htm|title=Djordje Lobacev|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> Not only was it the first successful modern comic produced in Serbia, but also the first title set in Yugoslavia.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tragom narodne mašte|last=Lobačev|first=Đorđe|publisher=Dečje novine|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

[[File:Gospodar smrti.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Master Death]]'', drawn by Đorđe Lobačev and published in ''Mikijevo carstvo'', is one of the most notable titles of the \"Golden Age of Serbian comics\". Published on the eve of World War II, ''Master Death'' carried a strong anti-war message.]]

Most of the Golden Age artists were Russian immigrants, collectively known as the Belgrade Circle and gathered at first around the ''Mika Miš'' magazine. Soon enough it was transformed into a real comic magazine, reprinting foreign classics like ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', [[Phantom (comics)|''Phantom'']] and ''[[Flash Gordon]]'', but also publishing comics by the local authors. ''Mika Miš'' lasted from 1936 to 1941, when it ended with issue 505.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wolfstad.com/dcw/serbia-and-montenegro/mika-mis-1936-1941/|title=Mika Mis (1936 - 1941) by Aleksandar J. Ivkovic < Serbia and Montenegro @ Disney Comics Worldwide|website=www.wolfstad.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref> Its domination would not be questioned until 1939 and the emergence of ''Mikijevo carstvo'' and ''[[Politikin Zabavnik]]''. The key figures behind all three publications were editors Aleksandar J. Ivković and Milutin Ignjačević.<ref name=\":0\" /> From 1935 to 1941 about twenty comic magazines were launched in Serbia, published weekly and bi-weekly, mostly in black-and-white. They were sold throughout Yugoslavia. In order to boost sales in the western parts of Yugoslavia (today's [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]), some publications were printed not only in the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]] but also [[Latin alphabet]]. Comics were distributed through [[convenience store]]s, [[Newsagent's shop|newsstands]] and [[Newspaper hawker|newsboys]], with an average print run of 10,000 - 30,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/zzupan-golden_age.html|title=[Projekat Rastko] Zdravko Zupan: The Golden Age of Serbian Comics|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref>

The notable works were inspired by cultural classics and [[Serbian folklore]]. The shortlist includes [[Ivan Šenšin]]'s ''Hrabri vojnik Švejk'' (an adaptation of [[Jaroslav Hašek]]'s novel ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk]]'') and ''Zvonar Bogorodičine crkve'' (and adaptation of [[Victor Hugo]]'s novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]''), [[Sergej Solovjev]]'s ''Carev štitonoša'' (''Emperor's Squire''), ''Robin Hud'' (''[[Robin Hood]]'') and ''Ajvanho'' (an adaptation of [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''), Lobačev's ''[[Master Death]]'', ''Baron Minhauzen'' (an adaptation of [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]]'s ''[[Baron Munchausen|The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'') and ''Biberče'' (''Pepper-Boy'', based on the Serbian folk [[fairytale]] of the same name), [[Konstantin Kuznjecov]]'s ''Grofica Margo'' (''Countess Margo'') and ''Bajka o caru Saltanu'' (an adaptation of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s [[poem]] ''[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan]]''). Unlike most of his contemporaries, [[Sebastijan Lechner]] also wrote his own scripts, such as ''Džarto''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lehner_sebastijan.htm|title=Sebastijan Lechner|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> Similarly, Navojev teamed up with [[Script (comics)|comics writer]] [[Branko Vidić]] to create [[Zigomar (comics)|''Zigomar'']]. Some of the titles were reprinted in [[France|French]] and [[Turkey|Turkish]] magazines,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kayaozkaracalar.blogspot.com/2008/12/yugoslavian-comics-in-turkey-part-1.html|title=The MysterIous Flame of Queen Loana: YUGOSLAVIAN COMICS IN TURKEY - PART 1: COUNTESS MARGO|last=Özkaracalar|first=Kaya|date=2008-12-23|website=The MysterIous Flame of Queen Loana|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref> while ''Zigomar'' was also published in [[Bulgaria]], [[Italy]] and [[Argentina]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phantomwiki.org/Zigomar_vs._The_Phantom#Reprints|title=Zigomar vs. The Phantom - PhantomWiki|website=www.phantomwiki.org|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> 

Other creators of \"the first generation\" included Vsevold Guljevič, Aleksije Ranhner, Đorđe Janković, Moma Marković, Marijan Ebner, Vojin Đorđević, Nikola Tiščenko, Dragan Savić and Đorđe Mali. Lobačev's brother-in-law Valerian Apuhtin became the first professional [[letterer]] in Serbia. Another young artist at the time, [[Živorad Mitrović]] would revisit this period in his 1982 film ''Savamala''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mitrovic|first=Zivorad 'Zika'|title=Savamala|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173169/|accessdate=2016-07-20}}</ref>

The Golden Age of Serbian comics ended with the Nazi [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941. After [[World War II]] some authors were executed as [[Collaborationism|collaborators]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kockar_vljko.htm|title=Veljko Kockar|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sensin_ivan.htm|title=Ivan Sensin|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> by [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|the new communist regime]] or forced to [[Emigration|emigrate]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kuznjecov_k.htm|title=Konstantin Kuznjecov|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/solovjev_sergej.htm|title=Sergej Solovjev|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref>

=== 1945–1990 ===
After World War II, the communist government considered comics a decadent product of the [[Western world#Cold War context|West]], therefore worthless and even harmful for children. In 1946 [[State-controlled media|state-owned]] daily newspaper ''[[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]]'' criticized comics as \"[[black market]] [[ersatz good]]s\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stripvesti.com/spec/knjiga/borba1.htm|title=index|website=www.stripvesti.com|access-date=2016-07-19}}</ref> For years to come, comics would be discouraged or outright banned. New magazines like ''Tri ugursuza'' (''Three Rowdies'', the Yugoslav title of ''[[Les Pieds Nickelés]]'') and ''Vrabac'' (''The Sparrow'') were short-lived, although comic strips and cartoons survived in the humor magazines ''Jež'' (''Hedgehog'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=392855|title=Oslobođenje i cenzura|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> and ''Mali Jež'' (''Little Hedgehog''), where [[Milorad Dobrić]] and Dejan Nastić published in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/dobric_milorad.htm|title=Milorad Dobric|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref>

The outlook changed after the [[Tito–Stalin Split|Tito-Stalin Split]] in 1948. In 1951 Walt Disney’s comics returned to Serbia’s newspapers. In 1952 ''Politikin Zabavnik'' was revived, boasting a circulation of 450,000 in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=369528|title=Formula udrobljenog sadržaja|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> (The magazine is still published, having reached its 3000th issue in 2009.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://politikin-zabavnik.co.rs/pz/tekstovi/na-rodjendan-pitinog-deteta|title=Broj 3000 {{!}} Politikin Zabavnik|website=politikin-zabavnik.co.rs|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> Lobačev was welcomed back to the pages of ''Zabavnik'' in 1965. However, it would publish few local comics until [[Lazo Sredanović]]’s ''[[Dikan]]'' in 1969.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1129271|title=Buzdovan i meko srce|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> 

[[File:Dikan strip junak.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Dikan]]'' by Lazo Sredanović was commissioned by ''[[Politikin Zabavnik]]'' and modeled after ''[[Asterix]]''.]]

Nevertheless, back in the 1950s comic magazines like ''Robinzon'' (''[[Robinson Crusoe|Robinson]]'') and ''Veseli zabavnik'' were still censored, but even the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] started publishing some.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/1/strip-u-srbiji-1955-1972/index_l.html|title=[Projekat Rastko] Zdravko Zupan: Strip u Srbiji 1955-1972.|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> Zdravko Sulić began his career in such a publication, most of his works later published in the magazine [[Kekec (magazine)|''Kekec'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sulic_zdravko.htm|title=Zdravko Sulic|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref> It was launched by [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]] in 1957, featuring French comics such as ''[[Lucky Luke]]'', [[The Smurfs|''Smurfs'']] and ''[[Chlorophylle]]'', but also domestic titles, including the works of \"the second generation\" of creators, like Aleksandar Hecl of ''Vinetu'' (''[[Winnetou]]'') fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/hecl_aleksandar.htm|title=Aleksandar Hecl|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> The first [[CMYK color model|four-color]] ''Kekec'' publication reached the print run of 300,000 copies.<ref name=\":2\" /> ''Kekec'' lasted for 1532 issues and ended in 1990. 



1957 also saw teachers from the small town of [[Gornji Milanovac]] launch [[student newspaper]] ''[[Dečje novine]]'', which grew into a major publisher. Their most successful characters were [[Mirko and Slavko]], heroes of the [[eponym]]ous [[comic book]]. In the 1960s the adventures of the two [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] peaked at 200,000 copies per issue. To date, it is the only Yugoslav comic adapted into a [[live action]] movie.<ref>Marković, Đorđe (2012). SFRJ za početnike. Delta Video.</ref> The title was serialized in the ''Nikad robom'' comic book series, which also printed works by Petar Radičević (''Mystery Knight''), Radivoj Bogičević (''Akant''), Božidar Veselinović (''Dabiša'') and Živorad Atanacković (''Hajduk Veljko''), all inspired by the history of the [[South Slavs]]. The same publisher launched a number of other magazines, including ''Zenit'' and ''Biblioteka Lale'' (which first reprinted [[Marvel Comics|Marvel comics]] in Yugoslavia) and ''Eks almanah'' (which introduced [[DC Comics|DC]] [[superhero]]es, among others).

[[File:Cover to YU strip issue 31, featuring Kobra, art by Branislav Kerac.jpg|left|thumb|''[[YU strip]]'' magazine cover, featuring ''[[Kobra (comic book)|Kobra]]'' by [[Branislav Kerac]], a comic which merged influences from [[Action film|action movies]] to [[Franco-Belgian comics|bandes dessinées]].]]
Starting as an ''Eks'' [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] in 1977, the ''[[YU strip]]'' magazine turned to be the seminal publication for Serbian authors. Teamed up with writer [[Svetozar Obradović]], [[Branislav Kerac]] had already debuted with ''Lieutenant Tara'' in the ''Zlatni kliker'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bkerac.tripod.com/artist.htm|title=Comix Drawer|website=bkerac.tripod.com|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> The duo went on to create [[Kobra (comic book)|''Kobra'']], the most popular Yugoslav comic of the 1980s. Kerac’s super-heroine [[Cat Claw]] reached even greater success abroad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kerac_bane.htm|title=Bane Kerac|website=lambiek.net|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> A number of local creators ([[Zoran Janjetov]], [[R. M. Guéra|R.M. Guera]], [[Darko Perović]], [[Zoran Tucić]], [[Vujadin Radovanović]], [[Željko Pahek]], [[Dejan Nenadov]], [[Vladimir Krstić - Laci|Vladimir Krstić]] and many others) published their early stories in ''YU strip'' before they went on to work for foreign publishers. The magazine lasted for 85 issues and ended in 1987.

By the late 1970s, the scene rebounded after the blow it had suffered from the 1972 tax law<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=429075|title=Mirko, Slavko i Kekec|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref> which targeted not only the [[Yellow journalism|yellow press]] but also comics. From 1971 to 1981, 11,611 issues of comics and [[Pulp magazine|pulp novels]] were printed in Yugoslavia, a total of 717 million copies in the country of 22 million people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2015/01/fenomen-popularnosti-stripa-u.html|title=Yugopapir: Fenomen popularnosti stripa: U Jugoslaviji je od 1971 - 81. prodato 716 miliona primeraka|website=www.yugopapir.com|access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the student press welcomed [[comics studies]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stripvesti.com/arhiva/sv-194.htm#djukanovic|title=SVesti|website=www.stripvesti.com|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> and [[alternative comics]] of \"the third generation\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kljakić|first=Ljubomir|date=1979|title=Quo vadis treća generacijo?|url=|journal=\"Vidici\" br. 2|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}</ref> inspired by ''[[Métal hurlant]]''. The ''Pegaz'' magazine was another publication that nurtured comics theory; it was also where the award-winning  ''Svemironi'' strip by Lazar Stanojević premiered in 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/lstanojevic/lstanojevic-svemironi.html|title=[Projekat Rastko] Lazar Stanojevic: svemironi|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref>

In addition, comic groups like Belgrade Circle 2 and Bauhaus 7 appeared, comic album was introduced as a new format, and the first [[Animated cartoon|animated short]] based on a comic was filmed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ljubac.rs/|title=LJUBOMIR MILOJEVIĆ LJUBAC - HOME|website=ljubac.rs|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref> The mass media embraced comics insomuch that the [[Radio Television of Serbia|national television]] produced an educational series on the medium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/tv/sr/story/255/rts-3/1526747/stripomanija-1-6.html|title=Stripomanija, 1-6|last=Serbia|first=RTS, Radio televizija Srbije, Radio Television of|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>

Another new trend in the 1960s was the emergence of more comic magazines outside of Belgrade. Published by Forum in [[Novi Sad]], ''Panorama'' was eventually transformed into ''[[Stripoteka]]'', which reached issue 1000 in 2004<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://happynovisad.com/strip/stripoteka-broj-1000.270.html|title=STRIPOTEKA broj 1000!|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref> and still comes out today. [[Dnevnik (Serbia)|Dnevnik]] launched ''Zlatna serija'' and ''Lunov magnus strip'', featuring [[Italian comics|Italian comic books]] like [[Tex Willer|''Tex'']] and ''[[Zagor]]''. In the 1980s Kerac spearheaded teams of writers and artists working on [[Licensed production|licensed]] [[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan]] and [[Il Grande Blek|Blek]] comics for these two publishers. The list included artists [[Branko Plavšić]], [[Goran Đukić Gorski (artist)|Goran Đukić]], [[Miodrag Ivanović Mikica|Miodrag Ivanović]], [[Pavel Koza]], [[Marinko Lebović]], [[Petar Meseldžija]], Milan Miletić, [[Sibin Slavković]] and [[Dragan Stokić Rajački]]. The [[Ninja (comic book)|Ninja]] and [[Mitar Milošević|Lun kralj ponoći]] comics were similarly manufactured, but were based on the Yugoslav pulp novels of the same names.

Until 1991 Serbian comics were part of Yugoslav comics. Distributed via newsstands, most comics were sold throughout Yugoslavia, written by and large in the common [[Shtokavian]] dialect and often printed in the Latin alphabet. 

Publications from other republics, especially Croatia, from Plavi Vjesnik to ''[[Alan Ford (comics)|Alan Ford]]'', had a great influence on creators and readers in Serbia. A [[Play (theatre)|play]] titled ''Alan Ford'' written by Mirjana Lazić and directed by Kokan Mladenović was staged at Teatar T in Belgrade in 1994. [[Radio Belgrade]] produced a [[radio drama]] based on the play in 2002. 

Also, authors worked for publishers outside Serbia, e.g. artists Dušan Reljić, Bojan Đukić, Ratomir Petrović, [[Zdravko Zupan]], [[Nikola Maslovara]] and Zoran Kovačević, as well as writer Lazar Odanović collaborated on the licensed [[Tom and Jerry]] comics for ''[[Vjesnik]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/strip/60godina/60gstripa_10.html|title=Slobodan Ivkov: 60 godina stripa u Srbiji|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2016-07-24}}</ref> Finally, artists exhibited at the joint Yugoslav Comics Festival in [[Vinkovci]] (Salon jugoslovenskog stripa).

The local comic book industry collapsed with the breakup of Yugoslavia.

[[File:Treci_argument_cover.jpg|thumb|left|Graphic novel ''Treći argument'' (''[[The Third Argument]]''), drawn by Zoran Tucić and written by [[Zoran Stefanović]], was based on the works of writer [[Milorad Pavić]].]]In the 1990s dozens of Serbian artists turned to foreign publishers.

[[Front side bus]] (FSB) frequency (external clock) has been increased from 133&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] to 148&nbsp;MHz, and the CPU [[clock multiplier]] factor has been changed from 13.5 to 16.5. This corresponds to an overclocking of the FSB by 11.3% and of the CPU by 36%.]]

In [[computing]], '''overclocking''' is the practice of increasing the [[clock rate]] of a computer to exceed that certified by the manufacturer. Commonly operating voltage is also increased to maintain a component's operational stability at accelerated speeds. [[Semiconductor device]]s operated at higher frequencies and voltages increase power consumption and heat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/02/19/why-has-cpu-frequency-ceased-to-grow|author= Victoria Zhislina|date=2014-02-19|title=Why has CPU frequency ceased to grow?|publisher=Intel}}</ref> An overclocked device may be unreliable or fail completely if the additional heat load is not removed or power delivery components cannot meet increased power demands. Many device warranties state that overclocking and/or over-specification voids any warranty, however there are an increasing number of manufacturers that will allow overclocking as long as performed [relatively] safely.

== Overview ==

The purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component. Normally, on modern systems, the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem, such as the main processor or graphics controller, but other components, such as system memory ([[Random-access memory|RAM]]) or [[Bus (computing)|system buses]] (generally on the [[motherboard]]), are commonly involved. The trade-offs are an increase in power consumption (heat), fan noise (cooling), and shortened lifespan for the targeted components. Most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of a manufacturer's control; examples are ambient temperature and fluctuations in operating voltage. Overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin, with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user. Examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling, as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds. Also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals, as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds.

While most modern devices are fairly tolerant of overclocking, all devices have finite limits. Generally for any given voltage most parts will have a maximum \"stable\" speed where they still operate correctly. Past this speed the device starts giving incorrect results, which can cause malfunctions and sporadic behavior in any system depending on it. While in a PC context the usual result is a system crash, more subtle errors can go undetected, which over a long enough time can give unpleasant surprises such as [[data corruption]] (incorrectly calculated results, or worse ''writing to storage'' incorrectly) or the system failing only during certain specific tasks (general usage such as internet browsing and [[word processing]] appear fine, but any application wanting advanced graphics crashes the system).

At this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed, but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output, as well as shorten the lifespan further. At some point there will be a limit imposed by the ability to supply the device with sufficient power, the user's ability to cool the part, and the device's own maximum voltage tolerance before it achieves [[Failure of electronic components|destructive failure]]. Overzealous use of voltage and/or inadequate cooling can rapidly degrade a device's performance to the point of failure, or in extreme cases outright [[Thermal runaway|destroy it]].

The speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system, and what components are being overclocked by the user; [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s for different purposes are published.

===Underclocking===
{{Main|Underclocking}}
Conversely, the primary goal of [[underclocking]] is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device, with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance. Reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allow [[Quiet PC|quieter operation]], and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge. Some manufacturers underclock components of battery-powered equipment to improve battery life, or implement systems that detect when a device is operating under battery power and reduce clock frequency accordingly.

Underclocking is almost always involved in the latter stages of [[Undervolting]], which seeks to find the highest clock speed that a processor will stably operate at a given voltage. That is, while overclocking seeks to maximize clock speed with temperature and power as constraints, underclocking seeks to find the highest clock speed that a device can reliably operate at a fixed, arbitrary power limit. A given device may operate correctly at its stock speed even when undervolted, in which case underclocking would only be employed after further reductions in voltage finally destabilizes the part. At that point the user would need to determine if the last working voltage and speed have satisfactorily lowered power consumption for their needs – if not then performance must be sacrificed, a lower clock is chosen (the underclock) and testing at progressively lower voltages would continue from that point. A lower bound is where the device itself fails to function and/or the supporting circuitry cannot reliably communicate with the part.

Underclocking and undervolting would be attempted on a desktop system to have it operate silently (such as for a home entertainment center) while potentially offering higher performance than currently offered by low-voltage processor offerings. This would use a \"standard-voltage\" part and attempt to run with lower voltages (while attempting to keep the desktop speeds) to meet an acceptable performance/noise target for the build. This was also attractive as using a \"standard voltage\" processor in a \"low voltage\" application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version. However again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success, and the builder's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered. The usefulness of underclocking (again like overclocking) is determined by what processor offerings, prices, and availability are at the specific time of the build. Underclocking is also sometimes used when [[troubleshooting]].

===Enthusiast culture===

Overclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines. However, the practice is embraced more by [[enthusiast computing|enthusiasts]] than professional users, as overclocking carries a risk of reduced reliability, accuracy and damage to data and equipment. Additionally, most manufacturer warranties and service agreements do not cover overclocked components nor any incidental damages caused by their use. While overclocking can still be an option for increasing personal computing capacity, and thus workflow productivity for professional users, the importance of stability testing components thoroughly ''before'' employing them into a production environment cannot be overstated.

Overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts. Overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer, or at speeds only officially offered on specialized, higher-priced versions of the product. A general trend in the computing industry is that new technologies tend to debut in the high-end market first, then later trickle down to the performance and mainstream market. If the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed, an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering. This can give insight on how over-the-horizon technologies will perform before they are officially available on the mainstream market, which can be especially helpful for other users considering if they should plan ahead to purchase or upgrade to the new feature when it is officially released.

Some hobbyists enjoy building, tuning, and \"Hot-Rodding\" their systems in competitive benchmarking competitions, competing with other like-minded users for high scores in standardized computer benchmark suites. Others will purchase a low-cost model of a component in a given product line, and attempt to overclock that part to match a more expensive model's stock performance. Another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing [[system requirements]] and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons. Another rationale for overclocking older equipment is even if overclocking stresses equipment to the point of failure earlier, little is lost as it is already [[Depreciation|depreciated]], and would have needed to be replaced in any case.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | pages = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/1 1–2] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/1 }}</ref>

===Components===

Technically any component that uses a timer (or clock) to synchronize its internal operations can be overclocked. Most efforts for computer components however focus on specific components, such as, [[Central processing unit|processors]] (a.k.a. CPU), [[video card]]s, [[motherboard]] [[chipset]]s, and [[random-access memory|RAM]]. Most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock (processor bus speed) by an internal multiplier within the processor (the [[CPU multiplier]]) to attain their final speed.

Computer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the [[CPU multiplier]] if that option is available, but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the [[front-side bus|bus clock]]. Some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks (such as a [[Clock rate|system clock]]) that influence the bus clock speed that, again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed.

Most [[OEM systems|OEM]] systems do not expose to the user the adjustments needed to change processor clock speed or voltage in the BIOS of the OEM's motherboard, which precludes overclocking (for warranty and support reasons). The same processor installed on a different motherboard offering adjustments will allow the user to change them.

Any given component will ultimately stop operating reliably past a certain clock speed. Components will generally show some sort of malfunctioning behavior or other indication of compromised stability that alerts the user that a given speed is not stable, but there is always a possibility that a component will permanently fail without warning, even if voltages are kept within some pre-determined safe values. The maximum speed is determined by overclocking to the point of first instability, then accepting the last stable slower setting. Components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential. The end-point of a given overclock is determined by parameters such as available CPU multipliers, bus dividers, [[voltage]]s; the user's ability to manage thermal loads, cooling techniques; and several other factors of the individual devices themselves such as semiconductor clock and thermal tolerances, interaction with other components and the rest of the system.

==Considerations==
There are several things to be considered when overclocking. First is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new [[clock rate]]. Supplying the power with improper settings or applying excessive [[voltage]] can permanently damage a component.

In a professional production environment, overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required, the possibly reduced reliability, the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties, and the higher power consumption. If faster speed is required it is often cheaper when all costs are considered to buy faster hardware.

=== Cooling ===
{{Main|Computer cooling}}
[[Image:Copper heat sink with pipes.jpg|thumb|High quality [[heat sink]]s are often made of [[copper]].]]

All [[Electrical network|electronic circuits]] produce heat generated by the movement of electric current. As clock frequencies in [[digital circuit]]s and voltage applied increase, the heat generated by components running at the higher performance levels also increases. The relationship between clock frequencies and [[thermal design power]] (TDP) are linear. However, there is a limit to the maximum frequency which is called a \"wall\". To overcome this issue, overclockers raise the chip voltage to increase the overclocking potential. Voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly (proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit, for example); this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating. In addition, some digital circuits slow down at high temperatures due to changes in [[MOSFET]] device characteristics. Conversely, the overclocker may decide to ''decrease'' the chip voltage while overclocking (a process known as undervolting), to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal.

Stock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use; overclocked circuits can require more cooling, such as by powerful [[fan (mechanical)|fans]], larger [[heat sink]]s, [[heat pipe]]s and [[water cooling]]. Mass, shape, and material all influence the ability of a heatsink to dissipate heat. Efficient heatsinks are often made entirely of [[copper]], which has high [[thermal conductivity]], but is expensive.<ref name=Wainner38>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/38 38] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/38 }}</ref> [[Aluminium]] is more widely used; it has good thermal characteristics, though not as good as copper, and is significantly cheaper. Cheaper materials such as steel do not have good thermal characteristics. [[Heat pipe]]s can be used to improve conductivity. Many heatsinks combine two or more materials to achieve a balance between performance and cost.<ref name=Wainner38/>

[[File:DIY PC watercooling T-Line.JPG|Interior of a water-cooled computer, showing CPU [[water block]], tubing, and pump|left|thumb]]

Water cooling carries [[waste heat]] to a [[radiator]]. [[Thermoelectric cooling]] devices which actually refrigerate using the [[Peltier effect]] can help with high [[thermal design power]] (TDP) processors made by Intel and AMD in the early twenty-first century. Thermoelectric cooling devices create temperature differences between two plates by running an [[electric current]] through the plates. This method of cooling is highly effective, but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away, often by a convection-based heatsink or a [[water cooling#Computer usage|water cooling]] system.

[[Image:2007TaipeiITMonth IntelOCLiveTest Overclocking-6.jpg|right|thumb|[[Liquid nitrogen]] may be used for cooling an overclocked system, when an extreme measure of cooling is needed.]]

Other cooling methods are [[forced convection]] and [[phase transition]] cooling which is used in [[refrigerator]]s and can be adapted for computer use.

Submersion cooling, used by the [[Cray-2]] [[supercomputer]], involves sinking a part of computer system directly into a chilled liquid that is thermally conductive but has low [[electrical conductivity]]. The advantage of this technique is that no condensation can form on components.<ref name=Wainner48/> A good submersion liquid is [[Fluorinert]] made by [[3M]], which is expensive. Another option is [[mineral oil]], but impurities such as those in water might cause it to conduct electricity.<ref name=Wainner48>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/48 48] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/48 }}</ref>

Amateur overclocking enthusiasts have used a mixture of [[dry ice]] and [[acetone]] (or some other liquid with low freezing point, such as [[isopropyl alcohol]]).<ref>[https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/overclocking-with-dry-ice.101545/]</ref>  This [[cooling bath]], often used in laboratries, achieves a temperature of −78 °C.<ref>[http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/VV_Lab_Techniques/Cooling_baths Cooling baths – ChemWiki]. Chemwiki.ucdavis.edu. Retrieved on 2013-06-17.</ref>  However, this practice is discouraged since acetone is extremely flammable and volatile.

=== Stability and functional correctness ===

{{See also| Stress testing#Hardware }}

As an overclocked component operates outside of the manufacturer's recommended operating conditions, it may function incorrectly, leading to system instability. Another risk is [[Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware)|silent data corruption]] by undetected errors.  Such failures might never be correctly diagnosed and may instead be incorrectly attributed to software bugs in applications, [[device drivers]], or the operating system. Overclocked use may permanently damage components enough to cause them to misbehave (even under normal operating conditions) without becoming totally unusable.

A large-scale 2011 field study of hardware faults causing a system crash for consumer PCs and laptops showed a four to 20 times increase (depending on CPU manufacturer) in system crashes due to CPU failure for overclocked computers over an eight-month period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/144888/eurosys84-nightingale.pdf|title=Cycles, cells and platters: an empirical analysis of hardware failures on a million consumer PCs. Proceedings of the sixth conference on Computer systems (EuroSys '11). pp 343-356|year=2011}}</ref>

In general, overclockers claim that testing can ensure that an overclocked system is stable and functioning correctly. Although software tools are available for testing hardware stability, it is generally impossible for any private individual to thoroughly test the functionality of a processor.<ref>{{cite web | citeseerx = 10.1.1.62.9086 | title = Coverage Metrics for Functional Validation of Hardware Designs | publisher = IEEE Design & Test of Computers | year = 2001 | first = Charles M. | last = Kurt Keutzer }}</ref> Achieving good [[fault coverage]] requires immense engineering effort; even with all of the resources dedicated to validation by manufacturers, faulty components and even design faults are not always detected.

A particular \"stress test\" can verify only the functionality of the specific instruction sequence used in combination with the data and may not detect faults in those operations. For example, an arithmetic operation may produce the correct result but incorrect [[status register|flags]]; if the flags are not checked, the error will go undetected.

To further complicate matters, in process technologies such as [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI), devices display [[hysteresis]]&mdash;a circuit's performance is affected by the events of the past, so without carefully targeted tests it is possible for a particular sequence of state changes to work at overclocked rates in one situation but not another even if the voltage and temperature are the same.  Often, an overclocked system which passes stress tests experiences instabilities in other programs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/12/407562.aspx | first = Raymond | last = Chen | title = The Old New Thing: There's an awful lot of overclocking out there | date = April 12, 2005 | accessdate = 2007-03-17 }}</ref>

In overclocking circles, \"stress tests\" or \"torture tests\" are used to check for correct operation of a component.  These workloads are selected as they put a very high load on the component of interest (e.g. a graphically intensive application for testing video cards, or different math-intensive applications for testing general CPUs).  Popular stress tests include [[Prime95]], [[Lavalys|Everest]], [[Superpi]], OCCT, AIDA64, [[Linpack]] (via the LinX and IntelBurnTest [[GUI]]s), [[Sisoft Sandra|SiSoftware Sandra]], [[BOINC]], Intel Thermal Analysis Tool and [[Memtest86]].  The hope is that any functional-correctness issues with the overclocked component will show up during these tests, and if no errors are detected during the test, the component is then deemed \"stable\". Since fault coverage is important in [[Software testing|stability testing]], the tests are often run for long periods of time, hours or even days. An overclocked computer is sometimes described using the number of hours and the stability program used, such as \"prime 12 hours stable\".

===Factors allowing overclocking===
Overclockability arises in part due to the economics of the manufacturing processes of CPUs and other components. In many cases components are manufactured by the same process, and tested after manufacture to determine their actual maximum ratings. Components are then marked with a rating chosen by the market needs of the semiconductor manufacturer.  If [[Semiconductor device fabrication#Device test|manufacturing yield]] is high, more higher-rated components than required may be produced, and the manufacturer may mark and sell higher-performing components as lower-rated for marketing reasons.  In some cases, the true maximum rating of the component may exceed even the highest rated component sold.  Many devices sold with a lower rating may behave in all ways as higher-rated ones, while in the worst case operation at the higher rating may be more problematical.

Notably, higher clocks must always mean greater waste heat generation, as semiconductors set to high must dump to ground more often.  In some cases, this means that the chief drawback of the overclocked part is far more heat dissipated than the maximums published by the manufacturer.  Pentium architect [[Bob Colwell]] calls overclocking an \"uncontrolled experiment in better-than-worst-case system operation\".<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Bob|last1=Colwell|title=The Zen of Overclocking|journal=[[Computer (magazine)|Computer]]|volume=37|issue=3|date=March 2004|pages=9–12|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]|doi=10.1109/MC.2004.1273994}}</ref>

=== Measuring effects of overclocking ===

[[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmarks]] are used to evaluate performance, and they can become a kind of \"sport\" in which users compete for the highest scores.  As discussed above, stability and functional correctness may be compromised when overclocking, and meaningful benchmark results depend on the correct execution of the benchmark.  Because of this, benchmark scores may be qualified with stability and correctness notes (e.g. an overclocker may report a score, noting that the benchmark only runs to completion 1 in 5 times, or that signs of incorrect execution such as display corruption are visible while running the benchmark). A widely used test of stability is Prime95, which has built-in error checking that fails if the computer is unstable.

Using only the benchmark scores, it may be difficult to judge the difference overclocking makes to the overall performance of a computer. For example, some benchmarks test only one aspect of the system, such as memory [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], without taking into consideration how higher [[clock rate]]s in this aspect will improve the system performance as a whole. Apart from demanding applications such as video encoding, high-demand [[database]]s and [[scientific computing]], [[memory bandwidth]] is typically not a [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]], so a great increase in memory bandwidth may be unnoticeable to a user depending on the applications used. Other benchmarks, such as [[3D Mark|3DMark]], attempt to replicate game conditions.

== Manufacturer and vendor overclocking ==

Commercial system builders or component resellers sometimes overclock to sell items at higher profit margins. The seller makes more money by overclocking lower-priced components which are found to operate correctly and selling equipment at prices appropriate for higher-rated components. While the equipment will normally operate correctly, this practice may be considered [[fraud]]ulent if the buyer is unaware of it.

Overclocking is sometimes offered as a legitimate service or feature for consumers, in which a manufacturer or retailer tests the overclocking capability of processors, memory, video cards, and other hardware products. Several video card manufactures now offer factory-overclocked versions of their graphics accelerators, complete with a warranty, usually at a price intermediate between that of the standard product and a non-overclocked product of higher performance.

It is speculated that manufacturers implement overclocking prevention mechanisms such as [[CPU locking|CPU multiplier locking]] to prevent users from buying lower-priced items and overclocking them. These measures are sometimes marketed as a [[consumer protection]] benefit, but are often criticized by buyers.

Many motherboards are sold, and advertised, with extensive facilities for overclocking implemented in hardware and controlled by [[BIOS]] settings.<ref>[http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM3Plus/M5A78LUSB3/ Web page for a typical motherboard claiming overclocking support]</ref>

== CPU multiplier locking ==

'''CPU multiplier locking''' is the process of permanently setting a [[Central processing unit|CPU]]'s [[clock multiplier]].  [[AMD]] CPUs are unlocked in early editions of a model and locked in later editions, but nearly all [[Intel]] CPUs are locked and recent models are very resistant to unlocking to prevent overclocking by users. AMD ships unlocked CPUs with their Opteron, FX, Ryzen and Black Series line-up, while Intel uses the monikers of \"Extreme Edition\" and \"K-Series.\" Intel usually has one or two Extreme Edition CPUs on the market as well as X series and K series CPUs analogous to AMD's Black Edition. AMD has the majority of their desktop range in a Black Edition.

Users usually unlock CPUs to allow overclocking, but sometimes to allow for [[underclocking]] in order to maintain the [[front side bus]] speed (on older CPUs) compatibility with certain motherboards. Unlocking generally invalidates the manufacturer's warranty, and mistakes can cripple or destroy a CPU. Locking a chip's clock multiplier does not necessarily prevent users from overclocking, as the speed of the front-side bus or PCI multiplier (on newer CPUs) may still be changed to provide a performance increase. AMD Athlon and Athlon XP CPUs are generally unlocked by connecting bridges ([[jumper (computing)|jumper]]-like points) on the top of the CPU with [[electrical conduction|conductive]] paint or [[Graphite|pencil lead]].  Other CPU models may require different procedures.

Increasing front-side bus and/or northbridge/PCI clocks can overclock locked CPUs, but this throws many system frequencies out of sync, since the RAM and PCI frequencies are modified as well.

One of the easiest ways to unlock older AMD Athlon XP CPUs was called the ''pin mod'' method, because it was possible to unlock the CPU without permanently modifying bridges. A user could simply put one wire (or some more for a new multiplier/Vcore) into the socket to unlock the CPU. More recently however, notably with Intel's Skylake architecture, Intel had a bug with the Skylake (6th gen Core) processors where the base clock could be increased past 102.7 MHz, however functionality of certain features would not work. Intel intended to block base clock (BCLK) overclocking of locked processors when designing the Skylake architecture to prevent consumers from purchasing cheaper components and overclocking to previously-unseen heights (since the CPU's BCLK was no longer tied to the PCI buses), however for LGA1151, the 6th generation \"Skylake\" processors were able to be overclocked past 102.7 MHz (which was the intended limit by Intel, and was later mandated through later BIOS updates). All other unlocked processors from LGA1151 and v2 (including 7th, 8th, and 9th generation) and BGA1440 allow for BCLK overclocking (as long as the OEM allows it), while all other locked processors from 7th, 8th, and 9th gen were not able to go past 102.7 MHz on the BCLK.

== Advantages ==

{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}
* Higher '''performance''' in games, en-/decoding, video editing and system tasks at no additional direct monetary expense, but with increased electrical consumption and thermal output.
* System '''optimization''': Some systems have \"[[Bottleneck (software)|bottlenecks]]\", where small overclocking of one component can help realize the full potential of another component to a greater percentage than when just the limiting hardware itself is overclocked. For instance: many [[motherboard]]s with [[Athlon 64|AMD Athlon 64]] processors limit the clock rate of four units of RAM to 333 [[Hertz|MHz]]. However, the memory performance is computed by dividing the processor clock rate (which is a base number times a [[CPU multiplier]], for instance 1.8&nbsp;GHz is most likely 9×200&nbsp;MHz) by a fixed [[integer]] such that, at a stock clock rate, the RAM would run at a clock rate near 333&nbsp;MHz. Manipulating elements of how the processor clock rate is set (usually adjusting the multiplier), it is often possible to overclock the processor a small amount, around 5-10%, and gain a small increase in RAM clock rate and/or reduction in RAM latency timings.
* It can be '''cheaper''' to purchase a lower performance component and overclock it to the clock rate of a more expensive component.
* Extending life on older equipment (through underclocking/undervolting).

==Disadvantages==

=== General ===

{{Original       research|section|date=December 2011}}
* Higher [[clock rate]]s and voltages increase '''power consumption''', also increasing '''electricity cost''' and '''heat production'''. The additional heat increases the ambient air temperature within the system case, which may affect other components. The hot air blown out of the case heats the room it's in.
* Fan '''noise''': High-performance fans running at maximum speed used for the required degree of cooling of an overclocked machine can be noisy, some producing 50&nbsp;[[Decibel#Acoustics|dB]] or more of noise. When maximum cooling is not required, in any equipment, fan speeds can be reduced below the maximum: fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed; halving speed reduces noise by about 15&nbsp;dB.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/top10noise.pdf UK Health and Safety Executive: Top 10 noise control techniques]</ref> Fan noise can be reduced by design improvements, e.g. with aerodynamically optimized blades for smoother airflow, reducing noise to around 20&nbsp;dB at approximately 1 metre{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} or larger fans rotating more slowly, which produce less noise than smaller, faster fans with the same airflow. Acoustical insulation inside the case e.g. acoustic foam can reduce noise. Additional cooling methods which do not use fans can be used, such as liquid and phase-change cooling.
* An overclocked computer may become '''unreliable'''. For example: [[Microsoft Windows]] may appear to work with no problems, but when it is re-installed or upgraded, error messages may be received such as a \"file copy error\" during Windows Setup.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310064/en-us Article ID: 310064 – Last Review: May 7, 2007 – Revision: 6.2 How to troubleshoot problems during installation when you upgrade from Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition to Windows XP]</ref> Microsoft says this of errors in upgrading to Windows XP: \"Your computer [may be] over-clocked.\" Because installing Windows is very memory-intensive, decoding errors may occur when files are extracted from the Windows XP CD-ROM.
* The '''lifespan''' of semiconductor components may be reduced by increased voltages and heat.
* Warranties may be voided by overclocking.

=== Risks of overclocking ===

* Increasing the operation frequency of a component will usually increase its thermal output in a linear fashion, while an increase in voltage usually causes heat to increase exponentially. Excessive voltages or improper cooling may cause chip temperatures to rise to dangerous levels, causing the chip to be damaged or destroyed.
* Exotic cooling methods used to facilitate overclocking such as water cooling are more likely to cause damage if they malfunction. Sub-ambient cooling methods such as [[Computer cooling#Phase-change cooling|phase-change cooling]] or [[liquid nitrogen]] will cause water [[condensation]], which will cause electrical damage unless controlled; some methods include using kneaded erasers or shop towels to catch the condensation.

=== Limitations ===

Overclocking components can only be of noticeable benefit if the component is on the [[Critical path method|critical path]] for a process, if it is a bottleneck. If disk access or the speed of an [[Internet]] connection limit the speed of a process, a 20% increase in processor speed is unlikely to be noticed, however there are some scenarios where increasing the clock speed of a processor actually allows an SSD to be read and written to faster.. Overclocking a CPU will not noticeably benefit a game when a graphics card's performance is the \"botleneck\" of the game.

== Graphics cards ==

[[File:Bfg geforce 6800 gs oc.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The BFG GeForce 6800GSOC ships with higher memory and [[clock rate]]s than the standard 6800GS.]]
Graphics cards can also be overclocked. There are [[utility software|utilities]] to achieve this, such as [[EVGA Corporation|EVGA]]'s Precision, [[RivaTuner]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] Overdrive (on [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] cards only), [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] Afterburner, Zotac Firestorm, and the [[PEG Link Mode]] on [[Asus]] [[motherboard]]s. Overclocking a GPU will often yield a marked increase in performance in synthetic benchmarks, usually reflected in game performance<ref>[http://www.altesc.net/2013/06/15/gtx-780-overclocking/ Alt+Esc | GTX 780 Overclocking Guide<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. It is sometimes possible to see that a graphics card is being pushed beyond its limits before any permanent damage is done by observing on-screen artifacts or unexpected system crashes. It is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat, [[clock rate]], and/or voltage limits, however if seen when not overclocked, they indicate a faulty card. After a reboot, video settings are reset to standard values stored in the graphics card firmware, and the maximum [[clock rate]] of that specific card is now deducted.

Some overclockers apply a [[potentiometer]] to the graphics card to manually adjust the voltage (which usually invalidates the warranty). This allows for finer adjustments, as overclocking software for graphics cards can only go so far. Excessive voltage increases may damage or destroy components on the graphics card or the entire graphics card itself (practically speaking).

=== Alternatives ===

Flashing and unlocking can be used to improve the performance of a [[Graphics card|video card]], without technically overclocking (but is much riskier than overclocking just through software).

'''''Flashing''''' refers to using the [[firmware]] of a different card with the same (or sometimes similar) core and compatible firmware, effectively making it a higher model card; it can be difficult, and may be irreversible. Sometimes [[Computer software|standalone software]] to modify the firmware files can be found, e.g. [[NiBiTor]] (GeForce 6/7 series are well regarded in this aspect), without using firmware for a better model video card. For example, video cards with 3D accelerators (most, {{As of|2011|lc=on}}) have two voltage and [[clock rate]] settings, one for 2D and one for 3D, but were designed to operate with ''three'' voltage stages, the third being somewhere between the aforementioned two, serving as a fallback when the card overheats or as a middle-stage when going from 2D to 3D operation mode. Therefore, it could be wise to set this middle-stage prior to \"serious\" overclocking, specifically because of this fallback ability; the card can drop down to this [[clock rate]], reducing by a few (or sometimes a few dozen, depending on the setting) percent of its efficiency and cool down, without dropping out of 3D mode (and afterwards return to the desired high performance clock and voltage settings).

Some cards have abilities not directly connected with overclocking. For example, Nvidia's [[GeForce|GeForce 6600GT]] (AGP flavor) has a temperature monitor used internally by the card, invisible to the user if standard firmware is used. Modifying the firmware can display a 'Temperature' tab.

'''''Unlocking''''' refers to enabling extra [[Graphics pipeline|pipelines]] or [[pixel shader]]s.  The [[GeForce 6 Series|6800LE]], the [[GeForce 6 Series|6800GS]] and [[GeForce 6 Series|6800]] ([[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] models only) were some of the first cards to benefit from unlocking.  While these  models have either 8 or 12 pipes enabled, they share the same 16x6 [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] core as a [[GeForce 6 Series|6800GT]] or Ultra, but  pipelines and shaders beyond those specified are disabled; the GPU may be fully functional, or may have been found to have faults which do not affect operation at the lower specification. GPUs found to be fully functional can be unlocked successfully, although it is not possible to be sure that there are undiscovered faults; in the worst case the card may become [[Brick (electronics)|permanently unusable]].

== History ==

Overclocked processors first became commercially available in 1983, when AMD sold an overclocked version of the [[Intel 8088]] CPU. In 1984, some consumers were overclocking IBM's version of the [[Intel 80286]] CPU by replacing the clock crystal.

This corresponds to an overclocking of the FSB by 11.3% and of the CPU by 36%.]]

In [[computing]], '''overclocking''' is the practice of increasing the [[clock rate]] of a computer to exceed that certified by the manufacturer. Commonly operating voltage is also increased to maintain a component's operational stability at accelerated speeds. [[Semiconductor device]]s operated at higher frequencies and voltages increase power consumption and heat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/02/19/why-has-cpu-frequency-ceased-to-grow|author= Victoria Zhislina|date=2014-02-19|title=Why has CPU frequency ceased to grow?|publisher=Intel}}</ref> An overclocked device may be unreliable or fail completely if the additional heat load is not removed or power delivery components cannot meet increased power demands. Many device warranties state that overclocking and/or over-specification voids any warranty, however there are an increasing number of manufacturers that will allow overclocking as long as performed [relatively] safely.

== Overview ==

The purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component. Normally, on modern systems, the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem, such as the main processor or graphics controller, but other components, such as system memory ([[Random-access memory|RAM]]) or [[Bus (computing)|system buses]] (generally on the [[motherboard]]), are commonly involved. The trade-offs are an increase in power consumption (heat), fan noise (cooling), and shortened lifespan for the targeted components. Most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of a manufacturer's control; examples are ambient temperature and fluctuations in operating voltage. Overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin, with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user. Examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling, as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds. Also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals, as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds.

While most modern devices are fairly tolerant of overclocking, all devices have finite limits. Generally for any given voltage most parts will have a maximum \"stable\" speed where they still operate correctly. Past this speed the device starts giving incorrect results, which can cause malfunctions and sporadic behavior in any system depending on it. While in a PC context the usual result is a system crash, more subtle errors can go undetected, which over a long enough time can give unpleasant surprises such as [[data corruption]] (incorrectly calculated results, or worse ''writing to storage'' incorrectly) or the system failing only during certain specific tasks (general usage such as internet browsing and [[word processing]] appear fine, but any application wanting advanced graphics crashes the system).

At this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed, but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output, as well as shorten the lifespan further. At some point there will be a limit imposed by the ability to supply the device with sufficient power, the user's ability to cool the part, and the device's own maximum voltage tolerance before it achieves [[Failure of electronic components|destructive failure]]. Overzealous use of voltage and/or inadequate cooling can rapidly degrade a device's performance to the point of failure, or in extreme cases outright [[Thermal runaway|destroy it]].

The speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system, and what components are being overclocked by the user; [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s for different purposes are published.

===Underclocking===
{{Main|Underclocking}}
Conversely, the primary goal of [[underclocking]] is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device, with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance. Reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allow [[Quiet PC|quieter operation]], and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge. Some manufacturers underclock components of battery-powered equipment to improve battery life, or implement systems that detect when a device is operating under battery power and reduce clock frequency accordingly.

Underclocking is almost always involved in the latter stages of [[Undervolting]], which seeks to find the highest clock speed that a processor will stably operate at a given voltage. That is, while overclocking seeks to maximize clock speed with temperature and power as constraints, underclocking seeks to find the highest clock speed that a device can reliably operate at a fixed, arbitrary power limit. A given device may operate correctly at its stock speed even when undervolted, in which case underclocking would only be employed after further reductions in voltage finally destabilizes the part. At that point the user would need to determine if the last working voltage and speed have satisfactorily lowered power consumption for their needs – if not then performance must be sacrificed, a lower clock is chosen (the underclock) and testing at progressively lower voltages would continue from that point. A lower bound is where the device itself fails to function and/or the supporting circuitry cannot reliably communicate with the part.

Underclocking and undervolting would be attempted on a desktop system to have it operate silently (such as for a home entertainment center) while potentially offering higher performance than currently offered by low-voltage processor offerings. This would use a \"standard-voltage\" part and attempt to run with lower voltages (while attempting to keep the desktop speeds) to meet an acceptable performance/noise target for the build. This was also attractive as using a \"standard voltage\" processor in a \"low voltage\" application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version. However again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success, and the builder's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered. The usefulness of underclocking (again like overclocking) is determined by what processor offerings, prices, and availability are at the specific time of the build. Underclocking is also sometimes used when [[troubleshooting]].

===Enthusiast culture===

Overclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines. However, the practice is embraced more by [[enthusiast computing|enthusiasts]] than professional users, as overclocking carries a risk of reduced reliability, accuracy and damage to data and equipment. Additionally, most manufacturer warranties and service agreements do not cover overclocked components nor any incidental damages caused by their use. While overclocking can still be an option for increasing personal computing capacity, and thus workflow productivity for professional users, the importance of stability testing components thoroughly ''before'' employing them into a production environment cannot be overstated.

Overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts. Overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer, or at speeds only officially offered on specialized, higher-priced versions of the product. A general trend in the computing industry is that new technologies tend to debut in the high-end market first, then later trickle down to the performance and mainstream market. If the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed, an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering. This can give insight on how over-the-horizon technologies will perform before they are officially available on the mainstream market, which can be especially helpful for other users considering if they should plan ahead to purchase or upgrade to the new feature when it is officially released.

Some hobbyists enjoy building, tuning, and \"Hot-Rodding\" their systems in competitive benchmarking competitions, competing with other like-minded users for high scores in standardized computer benchmark suites. Others will purchase a low-cost model of a component in a given product line, and attempt to overclock that part to match a more expensive model's stock performance. Another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing [[system requirements]] and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons. Another rationale for overclocking older equipment is even if overclocking stresses equipment to the point of failure earlier, little is lost as it is already [[Depreciation|depreciated]], and would have needed to be replaced in any case.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | pages = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/1 1–2] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/1 }}</ref>

===Components===

Technically any component that uses a timer (or clock) to synchronize its internal operations can be overclocked. Most efforts for computer components however focus on specific components, such as, [[Central processing unit|processors]] (a.k.a. CPU), [[video card]]s, [[motherboard]] [[chipset]]s, and [[random-access memory|RAM]]. Most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock (processor bus speed) by an internal multiplier within the processor (the [[CPU multiplier]]) to attain their final speed.

Computer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the [[CPU multiplier]] if that option is available, but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the [[front-side bus|bus clock]]. Some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks (such as a [[Clock rate|system clock]]) that influence the bus clock speed that, again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed.

Most [[OEM systems|OEM]] systems do not expose to the user the adjustments needed to change processor clock speed or voltage in the BIOS of the OEM's motherboard, which precludes overclocking (for warranty and support reasons). The same processor installed on a different motherboard offering adjustments will allow the user to change them.

Any given component will ultimately stop operating reliably past a certain clock speed. Components will generally show some sort of malfunctioning behavior or other indication of compromised stability that alerts the user that a given speed is not stable, but there is always a possibility that a component will permanently fail without warning, even if voltages are kept within some pre-determined safe values. The maximum speed is determined by overclocking to the point of first instability, then accepting the last stable slower setting. Components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential. The end-point of a given overclock is determined by parameters such as available CPU multipliers, bus dividers, [[voltage]]s; the user's ability to manage thermal loads, cooling techniques; and several other factors of the individual devices themselves such as semiconductor clock and thermal tolerances, interaction with other components and the rest of the system.

==Considerations==
There are several things to be considered when overclocking. First is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new [[clock rate]]. Supplying the power with improper settings or applying excessive [[voltage]] can permanently damage a component.

In a professional production environment, overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required, the possibly reduced reliability, the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties, and the higher power consumption. If faster speed is required it is often cheaper when all costs are considered to buy faster hardware.

=== Cooling ===
{{Main|Computer cooling}}
[[Image:Copper heat sink with pipes.jpg|thumb|High quality [[heat sink]]s are often made of [[copper]].]]

All [[Electrical network|electronic circuits]] produce heat generated by the movement of electric current. As clock frequencies in [[digital circuit]]s and voltage applied increase, the heat generated by components running at the higher performance levels also increases. The relationship between clock frequencies and [[thermal design power]] (TDP) are linear. However, there is a limit to the maximum frequency which is called a \"wall\". To overcome this issue, overclockers raise the chip voltage to increase the overclocking potential. Voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly (proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit, for example); this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating. In addition, some digital circuits slow down at high temperatures due to changes in [[MOSFET]] device characteristics. Conversely, the overclocker may decide to ''decrease'' the chip voltage while overclocking (a process known as undervolting), to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal.

Stock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use; overclocked circuits can require more cooling, such as by powerful [[fan (mechanical)|fans]], larger [[heat sink]]s, [[heat pipe]]s and [[water cooling]]. Mass, shape, and material all influence the ability of a heatsink to dissipate heat. Efficient heatsinks are often made entirely of [[copper]], which has high [[thermal conductivity]], but is expensive.<ref name=Wainner38>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/38 38] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/38 }}</ref> [[Aluminium]] is more widely used; it has good thermal characteristics, though not as good as copper, and is significantly cheaper. Cheaper materials such as steel do not have good thermal characteristics. [[Heat pipe]]s can be used to improve conductivity. Many heatsinks combine two or more materials to achieve a balance between performance and cost.<ref name=Wainner38/>

[[File:DIY PC watercooling T-Line.JPG|Interior of a water-cooled computer, showing CPU [[water block]], tubing, and pump|left|thumb]]

Water cooling carries [[waste heat]] to a [[radiator]]. [[Thermoelectric cooling]] devices which actually refrigerate using the [[Peltier effect]] can help with high [[thermal design power]] (TDP) processors made by Intel and AMD in the early twenty-first century. Thermoelectric cooling devices create temperature differences between two plates by running an [[electric current]] through the plates. This method of cooling is highly effective, but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away, often by a convection-based heatsink or a [[water cooling#Computer usage|water cooling]] system.

[[Image:2007TaipeiITMonth IntelOCLiveTest Overclocking-6.jpg|right|thumb|[[Liquid nitrogen]] may be used for cooling an overclocked system, when an extreme measure of cooling is needed.]]

Other cooling methods are [[forced convection]] and [[phase transition]] cooling which is used in [[refrigerator]]s and can be adapted for computer use. [[Liquid nitrogen]], [[liquid helium]], and [[dry ice]] are used as coolants in extreme cases,<ref name=Wainner44>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/44 44] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/44 }}</ref> such as record-setting attempts or one-off experiments rather than cooling an everyday system. In June 2006, [[IBM]] and [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] jointly announced a new record in silicon-based chip [[clock rate]] (the rate a transistor can be switched at, not the CPU clock rate<ref>{{cite web|last=Stokes|first=Jon|title=IBM's 500GHz processor?

Submersion cooling, used by the [[Cray-2]] [[supercomputer]], involves sinking a part of computer system directly into a chilled liquid that is thermally conductive but has low [[electrical conductivity]]. The advantage of this technique is that no condensation can form on components.<ref name=Wainner48/> A good submersion liquid is [[Fluorinert]] made by [[3M]], which is expensive. Another option is [[mineral oil]], but impurities such as those in water might cause it to conduct electricity.<ref name=Wainner48>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/48 48] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/48 }}</ref>

Amateur overclocking enthusiasts have used a mixture of [[dry ice]] and [[acetone]] (or some other liquid with low freezing point, such as [[isopropyl alcohol]]).<ref>[https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/overclocking-with-dry-ice.101545/]</ref>  This [[cooling bath]], often used in laboratries, achieves a temperature of −78 °C.<ref>[http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/VV_Lab_Techniques/Cooling_baths Cooling baths – ChemWiki]. Chemwiki.ucdavis.edu. Retrieved on 2013-06-17.</ref>  However, this practice is discouraged since acetone is extremely flammable and volatile.

=== Stability and functional correctness ===

{{See also| Stress testing#Hardware }}

As an overclocked component operates outside of the manufacturer's recommended operating conditions, it may function incorrectly, leading to system instability. Another risk is [[Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware)|silent data corruption]] by undetected errors.  Such failures might never be correctly diagnosed and may instead be incorrectly attributed to software bugs in applications, [[device drivers]], or the operating system. Overclocked use may permanently damage components enough to cause them to misbehave (even under normal operating conditions) without becoming totally unusable.

A large-scale 2011 field study of hardware faults causing a system crash for consumer PCs and laptops showed a four to 20 times increase (depending on CPU manufacturer) in system crashes due to CPU failure for overclocked computers over an eight-month period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/144888/eurosys84-nightingale.pdf|title=Cycles, cells and platters: an empirical analysis of hardware failures on a million consumer PCs. Proceedings of the sixth conference on Computer systems (EuroSys '11). pp 343-356|year=2011}}</ref>

In general, overclockers claim that testing can ensure that an overclocked system is stable and functioning correctly. Although software tools are available for testing hardware stability, it is generally impossible for any private individual to thoroughly test the functionality of a processor.<ref>{{cite web | citeseerx = 10.1.1.62.9086 | title = Coverage Metrics for Functional Validation of Hardware Designs | publisher = IEEE Design & Test of Computers | year = 2001 | first = Charles M. | last = Kurt Keutzer }}</ref> Achieving good [[fault coverage]] requires immense engineering effort; even with all of the resources dedicated to validation by manufacturers, faulty components and even design faults are not always detected.

A particular \"stress test\" can verify only the functionality of the specific instruction sequence used in combination with the data and may not detect faults in those operations. For example, an arithmetic operation may produce the correct result but incorrect [[status register|flags]]; if the flags are not checked, the error will go undetected.

To further complicate matters, in process technologies such as [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI), devices display [[hysteresis]]&mdash;a circuit's performance is affected by the events of the past, so without carefully targeted tests it is possible for a particular sequence of state changes to work at overclocked rates in one situation but not another even if the voltage and temperature are the same.  Often, an overclocked system which passes stress tests experiences instabilities in other programs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/12/407562.aspx | first = Raymond | last = Chen | title = The Old New Thing: There's an awful lot of overclocking out there | date = April 12, 2005 | accessdate = 2007-03-17 }}</ref>

In overclocking circles, \"stress tests\" or \"torture tests\" are used to check for correct operation of a component.  These workloads are selected as they put a very high load on the component of interest (e.g. a graphically intensive application for testing video cards, or different math-intensive applications for testing general CPUs).  Popular stress tests include [[Prime95]], [[Lavalys|Everest]], [[Superpi]], OCCT, AIDA64, [[Linpack]] (via the LinX and IntelBurnTest [[GUI]]s), [[Sisoft Sandra|SiSoftware Sandra]], [[BOINC]], Intel Thermal Analysis Tool and [[Memtest86]].  The hope is that any functional-correctness issues with the overclocked component will show up during these tests, and if no errors are detected during the test, the component is then deemed \"stable\". Since fault coverage is important in [[Software testing|stability testing]], the tests are often run for long periods of time, hours or even days. An overclocked computer is sometimes described using the number of hours and the stability program used, such as \"prime 12 hours stable\".

===Factors allowing overclocking===
Overclockability arises in part due to the economics of the manufacturing processes of CPUs and other components. In many cases components are manufactured by the same process, and tested after manufacture to determine their actual maximum ratings. Components are then marked with a rating chosen by the market needs of the semiconductor manufacturer.  If [[Semiconductor device fabrication#Device test|manufacturing yield]] is high, more higher-rated components than required may be produced, and the manufacturer may mark and sell higher-performing components as lower-rated for marketing reasons.  In some cases, the true maximum rating of the component may exceed even the highest rated component sold.  Many devices sold with a lower rating may behave in all ways as higher-rated ones, while in the worst case operation at the higher rating may be more problematical.

Notably, higher clocks must always mean greater waste heat generation, as semiconductors set to high must dump to ground more often.  In some cases, this means that the chief drawback of the overclocked part is far more heat dissipated than the maximums published by the manufacturer.  Pentium architect [[Bob Colwell]] calls overclocking an \"uncontrolled experiment in better-than-worst-case system operation\".<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Bob|last1=Colwell|title=The Zen of Overclocking|journal=[[Computer (magazine)|Computer]]|volume=37|issue=3|date=March 2004|pages=9–12|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]|doi=10.1109/MC.2004.1273994}}</ref>

=== Measuring effects of overclocking ===

[[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmarks]] are used to evaluate performance, and they can become a kind of \"sport\" in which users compete for the highest scores.  As discussed above, stability and functional correctness may be compromised when overclocking, and meaningful benchmark results depend on the correct execution of the benchmark.  Because of this, benchmark scores may be qualified with stability and correctness notes (e.g. an overclocker may report a score, noting that the benchmark only runs to completion 1 in 5 times, or that signs of incorrect execution such as display corruption are visible while running the benchmark). A widely used test of stability is Prime95, which has built-in error checking that fails if the computer is unstable.

Using only the benchmark scores, it may be difficult to judge the difference overclocking makes to the overall performance of a computer. For example, some benchmarks test only one aspect of the system, such as memory [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], without taking into consideration how higher [[clock rate]]s in this aspect will improve the system performance as a whole. Apart from demanding applications such as video encoding, high-demand [[database]]s and [[scientific computing]], [[memory bandwidth]] is typically not a [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]], so a great increase in memory bandwidth may be unnoticeable to a user depending on the applications used. Other benchmarks, such as [[3D Mark|3DMark]], attempt to replicate game conditions.

== Manufacturer and vendor overclocking ==

Commercial system builders or component resellers sometimes overclock to sell items at higher profit margins. The seller makes more money by overclocking lower-priced components which are found to operate correctly and selling equipment at prices appropriate for higher-rated components. While the equipment will normally operate correctly, this practice may be considered [[fraud]]ulent if the buyer is unaware of it.

Overclocking is sometimes offered as a legitimate service or feature for consumers, in which a manufacturer or retailer tests the overclocking capability of processors, memory, video cards, and other hardware products. Several video card manufactures now offer factory-overclocked versions of their graphics accelerators, complete with a warranty, usually at a price intermediate between that of the standard product and a non-overclocked product of higher performance.

It is speculated that manufacturers implement overclocking prevention mechanisms such as [[CPU locking|CPU multiplier locking]] to prevent users from buying lower-priced items and overclocking them. These measures are sometimes marketed as a [[consumer protection]] benefit, but are often criticized by buyers.

Many motherboards are sold, and advertised, with extensive facilities for overclocking implemented in hardware and controlled by [[BIOS]] settings.<ref>[http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM3Plus/M5A78LUSB3/ Web page for a typical motherboard claiming overclocking support]</ref>

== CPU multiplier locking ==

'''CPU multiplier locking''' is the process of permanently setting a [[Central processing unit|CPU]]'s [[clock multiplier]].  [[AMD]] CPUs are unlocked in early editions of a model and locked in later editions, but nearly all [[Intel]] CPUs are locked and recent models are very resistant to unlocking to prevent overclocking by users. AMD ships unlocked CPUs with their Opteron, FX, Ryzen and Black Series line-up, while Intel uses the monikers of \"Extreme Edition\" and \"K-Series.\" Intel usually has one or two Extreme Edition CPUs on the market as well as X series and K series CPUs analogous to AMD's Black Edition. AMD has the majority of their desktop range in a Black Edition.

Users usually unlock CPUs to allow overclocking, but sometimes to allow for [[underclocking]] in order to maintain the [[front side bus]] speed (on older CPUs) compatibility with certain motherboards. Unlocking generally invalidates the manufacturer's warranty, and mistakes can cripple or destroy a CPU. Locking a chip's clock multiplier does not necessarily prevent users from overclocking, as the speed of the front-side bus or PCI multiplier (on newer CPUs) may still be changed to provide a performance increase. AMD Athlon and Athlon XP CPUs are generally unlocked by connecting bridges ([[jumper (computing)|jumper]]-like points) on the top of the CPU with [[electrical conduction|conductive]] paint or [[Graphite|pencil lead]].  Other CPU models may require different procedures.

Increasing front-side bus and/or northbridge/PCI clocks can overclock locked CPUs, but this throws many system frequencies out of sync, since the RAM and PCI frequencies are modified as well.

One of the easiest ways to unlock older AMD Athlon XP CPUs was called the ''pin mod'' method, because it was possible to unlock the CPU without permanently modifying bridges. A user could simply put one wire (or some more for a new multiplier/Vcore) into the socket to unlock the CPU. More recently however, notably with Intel's Skylake architecture, Intel had a bug with the Skylake (6th gen Core) processors where the base clock could be increased past 102.7 MHz, however functionality of certain features would not work. Intel intended to block base clock (BCLK) overclocking of locked processors when designing the Skylake architecture to prevent consumers from purchasing cheaper components and overclocking to previously-unseen heights (since the CPU's BCLK was no longer tied to the PCI buses), however for LGA1151, the 6th generation \"Skylake\" processors were able to be overclocked past 102.7 MHz (which was the intended limit by Intel, and was later mandated through later BIOS updates). All other unlocked processors from LGA1151 and v2 (including 7th, 8th, and 9th generation) and BGA1440 allow for BCLK overclocking (as long as the OEM allows it), while all other locked processors from 7th, 8th, and 9th gen were not able to go past 102.7 MHz on the BCLK.

== Advantages ==

{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}
* Higher '''performance''' in games, en-/decoding, video editing and system tasks at no additional direct monetary expense, but with increased electrical consumption and thermal output.
* System '''optimization''': Some systems have \"[[Bottleneck (software)|bottlenecks]]\", where small overclocking of one component can help realize the full potential of another component to a greater percentage than when just the limiting hardware itself is overclocked. For instance: many [[motherboard]]s with [[Athlon 64|AMD Athlon 64]] processors limit the clock rate of four units of RAM to 333 [[Hertz|MHz]]. However, the memory performance is computed by dividing the processor clock rate (which is a base number times a [[CPU multiplier]], for instance 1.8&nbsp;GHz is most likely 9×200&nbsp;MHz) by a fixed [[integer]] such that, at a stock clock rate, the RAM would run at a clock rate near 333&nbsp;MHz. Manipulating elements of how the processor clock rate is set (usually adjusting the multiplier), it is often possible to overclock the processor a small amount, around 5-10%, and gain a small increase in RAM clock rate and/or reduction in RAM latency timings.
* It can be '''cheaper''' to purchase a lower performance component and overclock it to the clock rate of a more expensive component.
* Extending life on older equipment (through underclocking/undervolting).

==Disadvantages==

=== General ===

{{Original       research|section|date=December 2011}}
* Higher [[clock rate]]s and voltages increase '''power consumption''', also increasing '''electricity cost''' and '''heat production'''. The additional heat increases the ambient air temperature within the system case, which may affect other components. The hot air blown out of the case heats the room it's in.
* Fan '''noise''': High-performance fans running at maximum speed used for the required degree of cooling of an overclocked machine can be noisy, some producing 50&nbsp;[[Decibel#Acoustics|dB]] or more of noise. When maximum cooling is not required, in any equipment, fan speeds can be reduced below the maximum: fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed; halving speed reduces noise by about 15&nbsp;dB.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/top10noise.pdf UK Health and Safety Executive: Top 10 noise control techniques]</ref> Fan noise can be reduced by design improvements, e.g. with aerodynamically optimized blades for smoother airflow, reducing noise to around 20&nbsp;dB at approximately 1 metre{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} or larger fans rotating more slowly, which produce less noise than smaller, faster fans with the same airflow. Acoustical insulation inside the case e.g. acoustic foam can reduce noise. Additional cooling methods which do not use fans can be used, such as liquid and phase-change cooling.
* An overclocked computer may become '''unreliable'''. For example: [[Microsoft Windows]] may appear to work with no problems, but when it is re-installed or upgraded, error messages may be received such as a \"file copy error\" during Windows Setup.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310064/en-us Article ID: 310064 – Last Review: May 7, 2007 – Revision: 6.2 How to troubleshoot problems during installation when you upgrade from Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition to Windows XP]</ref> Microsoft says this of errors in upgrading to Windows XP: \"Your computer [may be] over-clocked.\" Because installing Windows is very memory-intensive, decoding errors may occur when files are extracted from the Windows XP CD-ROM.
* The '''lifespan''' of semiconductor components may be reduced by increased voltages and heat.
* Warranties may be voided by overclocking.

=== Risks of overclocking ===

* Increasing the operation frequency of a component will usually increase its thermal output in a linear fashion, while an increase in voltage usually causes heat to increase exponentially. Excessive voltages or improper cooling may cause chip temperatures to rise to dangerous levels, causing the chip to be damaged or destroyed.
* Exotic cooling methods used to facilitate overclocking such as water cooling are more likely to cause damage if they malfunction. Sub-ambient cooling methods such as [[Computer cooling#Phase-change cooling|phase-change cooling]] or [[liquid nitrogen]] will cause water [[condensation]], which will cause electrical damage unless controlled; some methods include using kneaded erasers or shop towels to catch the condensation.

=== Limitations ===

Overclocking components can only be of noticeable benefit if the component is on the [[Critical path method|critical path]] for a process, if it is a bottleneck. If disk access or the speed of an [[Internet]] connection limit the speed of a process, a 20% increase in processor speed is unlikely to be noticed, however there are some scenarios where increasing the clock speed of a processor actually allows an SSD to be read and written to faster.. Overclocking a CPU will not noticeably benefit a game when a graphics card's performance is the \"botleneck\" of the game.

== Graphics cards ==

[[File:Bfg geforce 6800 gs oc.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The BFG GeForce 6800GSOC ships with higher memory and [[clock rate]]s than the standard 6800GS.]]
Graphics cards can also be overclocked. There are [[utility software|utilities]] to achieve this, such as [[EVGA Corporation|EVGA]]'s Precision, [[RivaTuner]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] Overdrive (on [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] cards only), [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] Afterburner, Zotac Firestorm, and the [[PEG Link Mode]] on [[Asus]] [[motherboard]]s. Overclocking a GPU will often yield a marked increase in performance in synthetic benchmarks, usually reflected in game performance<ref>[http://www.altesc.net/2013/06/15/gtx-780-overclocking/ Alt+Esc | GTX 780 Overclocking Guide<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. It is sometimes possible to see that a graphics card is being pushed beyond its limits before any permanent damage is done by observing on-screen artifacts or unexpected system crashes. It is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat, [[clock rate]], and/or voltage limits, however if seen when not overclocked, they indicate a faulty card. After a reboot, video settings are reset to standard values stored in the graphics card firmware, and the maximum [[clock rate]] of that specific card is now deducted.

Some overclockers apply a [[potentiometer]] to the graphics card to manually adjust the voltage (which usually invalidates the warranty). This allows for finer adjustments, as overclocking software for graphics cards can only go so far. Excessive voltage increases may damage or destroy components on the graphics card or the entire graphics card itself (practically speaking).

=== Alternatives ===

Flashing and unlocking can be used to improve the performance of a [[Graphics card|video card]], without technically overclocking (but is much riskier than overclocking just through software).

'''''Flashing''''' refers to using the [[firmware]] of a different card with the same (or sometimes similar) core and compatible firmware, effectively making it a higher model card; it can be difficult, and may be irreversible. Sometimes [[Computer software|standalone software]] to modify the firmware files can be found, e.g. [[NiBiTor]] (GeForce 6/7 series are well regarded in this aspect), without using firmware for a better model video card. For example, video cards with 3D accelerators (most, {{As of|2011|lc=on}}) have two voltage and [[clock rate]] settings, one for 2D and one for 3D, but were designed to operate with ''three'' voltage stages, the third being somewhere between the aforementioned two, serving as a fallback when the card overheats or as a middle-stage when going from 2D to 3D operation mode. Therefore, it could be wise to set this middle-stage prior to \"serious\" overclocking, specifically because of this fallback ability; the card can drop down to this [[clock rate]], reducing by a few (or sometimes a few dozen, depending on the setting) percent of its efficiency and cool down, without dropping out of 3D mode (and afterwards return to the desired high performance clock and voltage settings).

Some cards have abilities not directly connected with overclocking. For example, Nvidia's [[GeForce|GeForce 6600GT]] (AGP flavor) has a temperature monitor used internally by the card, invisible to the user if standard firmware is used. Modifying the firmware can display a 'Temperature' tab.

'''''Unlocking''''' refers to enabling extra [[Graphics pipeline|pipelines]] or [[pixel shader]]s.  The [[GeForce 6 Series|6800LE]], the [[GeForce 6 Series|6800GS]] and [[GeForce 6 Series|6800]] ([[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] models only) were some of the first cards to benefit from unlocking.  While these  models have either 8 or 12 pipes enabled, they share the same 16x6 [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] core as a [[GeForce 6 Series|6800GT]] or Ultra, but  pipelines and shaders beyond those specified are disabled; the GPU may be fully functional, or may have been found to have faults which do not affect operation at the lower specification. GPUs found to be fully functional can be unlocked successfully, although it is not possible to be sure that there are undiscovered faults; in the worst case the card may become [[Brick (electronics)|permanently unusable]].

== History ==

Overclocked processors first became commercially available in 1983, when AMD sold an overclocked version of the [[Intel 8088]] CPU. In 1984, some consumers were overclocking IBM's version of the [[Intel 80286]] CPU by replacing the clock crystal.

'''Mulberry harbours''' were temporary portable [[harbour]]s developed by the United Kingdom during the [[Second World War]] to facilitate the rapid offloading of cargo onto beaches during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944. After the Allies successfully held beachheads following [[D-Day]], two prefabricated harbours were taken in sections across the [[English Channel]] from UK with the invading army and assembled off [[Omaha Beach]] (Mulberry \"A\") and [[Gold Beach]] (Mulberry \"B\").

The Mulberry harbours were to be used until major French ports could be captured and brought back into use after repair of the inevitable sabotage by German defenders. The Mulberry B harbour at [[Gold Beach]] was used for 10 months after D-Day, and over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies were landed before it was fully decommissioned. The still only partially-completed Mulberry A harbour at [[Omaha Beach]] was damaged on 19 June by a violent storm that suddenly arrived from the north-east. After three days the storm finally abated and damage was found to be so severe that the harbour had to be abandoned.

==Background==
The [[Dieppe Raid]] of 1942 had shown that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] could not rely on being able to penetrate the [[Atlantic Wall]] to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed [[Draft (hull)|sufficient depth of water]] under their [[keel]]s, together with [[Crane (machine)|dockside cranes]], to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain [[Operation Overlord]]. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], [[pier]]s and roadways.

==Preparation==
[[File:Construction of Mulberry Harbours, Southampton, April 1944 A25792.jpg|thumb|[[Phoenix breakwater|Phoenix caissons]] under construction, Southampton 1944]]
With the planning of [[Operation Overlord]] at an advanced stage by the summer of 1943, it was accepted that the proposed artificial harbours would need to be prefabricated in the UK and then towed across the English Channel.

The need for two separate artificial harbours – one American and one British/Canadian – was agreed at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. An Artificial Harbours Sub-Committee was set up under the Chairmanship of the civil engineer Colin R White (Sir Bruce White's brother) to advise on the location of the harbour and the form of the breakwater; the Sub-Committee's first meeting was held at the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE) on 4 August 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf|title=War Office: Artificial Harbours|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> The minutes of the Sub-Committee's meetings show that initially it was envisaged that bubble breakwaters would be used, then block ships were proposed and finally, due to an insufficient number of block ships being available, a mix of block ships and purpose made concrete caisson units.

On 2 September 1943 the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] estimated that the artificial ports (Mulberries) would need to handle 12,000 tons per day, exclusive of motor transport and in all weathers. On 4 September the go ahead was given to start work immediately on the harbours. However, infighting between the [[War Office]] and the [[Admiralty]] over responsibility was only resolved on 15 December 1943 by the intervention of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff. The decision was that the Admiralty managed the blockships, Bombardons and assembly of all constituent parts on the south coast of England. Further the Admiralty would undertake all necessary work to survey, site, tow and mark navigation.

The War Office was given the task of constructing the concrete caissons (Phoenixes), the roadways (Whales) and protection via anti-aircraft installations. Once at the site, the army was responsible for sinking the caissons and assembling all the various other units of the harbours.

For the Mulberry A at Omaha Beach, the naval Corps of Civil Engineers would construct the harbour from the prefabricated parts.

The proposed harbours called for many huge [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] of various sorts to build breakwaters and piers and connecting structures to provide the roadways. The caissons were built at a number of locations, mainly existing ship building facilities or large beaches, like Conwy Morfa, around the British coast. The works were let out to commercial construction firms including [[Wates Group|Wates Construction]] [[Balfour Beatty]], [[Henry Boot PLC|Henry Boot]], [[Lend Lease Project Management & Construction|Bovis & Co]], [[Cochrane Shipbuilders|Cochrane & Sons]], [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[Holland, Hannen & Cubitts|Cubitts]], [[W. & C. French|French]], [[Holloway Brothers (London)|Holloway Brothers]], [[John Laing Group|John Laing & Son]], [[Peter Lind & Company]], [[Sir Robert McAlpine]], [[Melville Dundas|Melville Dundas & Whitson]], [[Mowlem]], [[BAM Nuttall|Nuttall]], [[Sir Lindsay Parkinson|Parkinson]], [[Halcrow Group]], [[Pauling & Co.]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]].{{sfn|Hartcup|2011|p=94}} On completion they were towed across the English Channel by [[Tugboat|tugs]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Thames Tugs |url=http://www.thamestugs.co.uk/BRITISH-TUGS.php |title=Mulberry Harbour: British, French and Dutch tugs' |access-date=20 April 2009}}</ref> to the Normandy coast at only {{convert|4.3|kn|km/h|order=flip}}, assembled, operated and maintained by the [[Royal Engineers|Corps of Royal Engineers]], under the guidance of Reginald D. Gwyther, who was appointed CBE for his efforts. Various elements of the \"Whale\" piers were designed and constructed by a group of companies led by Braithwaite & Co, West Bromwich and Newport.

===Beach surveys===
Both locations for the temporary harbours required detailed information concerning [[geology]], [[hydrography]] and sea conditions. To collect this data a special team of hydrographers was created in October 1943. The 712th Survey Flotilla, operated from [[Stone frigate|naval base]] [[List of Royal Navy shore establishments#S to Z|HMS ''Tormentor'']] in [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]], were detailed to collect soundings off the enemy coast. Between November 1943 and January 1944 this team used a [[LCPL|Landing Craft Personnel (Large)]], or LCP(L), to survey the Normandy coast.

The special LCP(L) was manned by a Royal Navy crew and a small group of hydrographers. The first sortie, Operation KJF, occurred on the night of 26/27 November 1943 when three LCP(L)s took measurements off the port of Arromanches, the location for Mulberry B. A follow up mission, Operation KJG, to the proposed location for Mulberry A happened on 1/2 December but a navigation failure meant the team sounded an area 2,250 yards west of the correct area.

Two attempts had to be made to take soundings off the [[Ver-sur-Mer|Point de Ver]]. The first sortie, Operation Bellpush Able, on 25/26 December had issues with their equipment and returned on 28/29 December to complete the task.

On New Year's Eve 1943, a [[Combined Operations Headquarters#Operations|Combined Operations Pilotage Party]] (COPP), left Gosport for the Gold Beach area at [[Luc-sur-Mer]]. Two soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]], Major Scott-Bowden and [[Sergeant#Royal Marines and British Army|Sergeant]] Ogden-Smith, were landed on the beach at night in [[Operation Postage Able]] and took samples of the sand. These were crucial in determining whether the armoured vehicles would be able to operate on the beach or become bogged down. The final survey, Operation Bellpush Charlie, occurred on the night of 30–31 January but limited information was gathered due to fog and because German lookouts heard the craft. Further sorties were abandoned.{{sfn|Falconer|2013|pp=69–71}}

==Design and development==
[[File:MulberryB - Piers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Aerial view of Mulberry harbour \"B\" at [[Arromanches]] (October 27, 1944)]]
An early idea for temporary harbours was sketched by [[Winston Churchill]] in a 1915 memo to [[Lloyd George]]. This memo was for artificial harbours to be created off the German islands of [[Borkum]] and [[Sylt]]. No further investigation was made and the memo was filed away.

In 1940 the civil engineer [[Guy Maunsell]] wrote to the [[War Office]] with a proposal for an artificial harbour, but the idea was not at first adopted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Maunsell_G/maunsellGuy5.asp |title=Engineering Timelines - Guy Maunsell - WWII : sea forts + harbours |website=www.engineering-timelines.com |access-date=16 March 2020 }}</ref>
Churchill issued his memo \"Piers for use on beaches\" on 30 May 1942, apparently in some frustration at the lack of progress being made on finding a solution to the temporary harbour problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2015/02/user-requirement-document-piers-use-beaches/|title=A User Requirement Document - Piers for Use on Beaches |publisher=Think Defence|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref> Between 17 June and 6 August 1942, [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] submitted a design concept for artificial harbours to the War Office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historicaldocuments.weebly.com/hughes-war-plans.html|title=Hughes War Plans - Mulberry Harbours|work=Kaller Historical Documents|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref>

At a meeting following the [[Dieppe Raid]] of 19 August 1942, [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[John Hughes-Hallett]] (the naval commander for the Dieppe Raid) declared that if a port could not be captured, then one should be taken across the [[English Channel|Channel]]. Hughes-Hallett had the support of Churchill. The concept of Mulberry harbours began to take shape when Hughes-Hallett moved to be Naval Chief of Staff to the [[Operation Overlord|Overlord]] planners.

In the autumn of 1942, the [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Chief of Combined Operations]] Vice-Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], outlined the requirement for piers at least a mile long at which a continuous stream of supplies could be handled, including a pier head capable of handling 2,000-ton ships.

In July 1943 a committee of eminent civil engineers consisting of Colin R White (Chairman), J D C Couper, J A Cochrane, R D Gwyther and Lt. Col. Ivor Bell was established to advise on how a number of selected sites on the French coastline could be converted into sheltered harbours. The committee initially investigated the use of compressed air breakwaters before eventually deciding on blockships and caissons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf |title=Artificioal Habours |publisher=War Office |access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref>

===Trials===
In August and September 1943 a trial of three competing designs for the cargo-handling jetties was set up together with a test of a compressed air breakwater. The pier designs were by:
* [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] (a civil engineer) who developed his \"Hippo\" piers and \"Crocodile\" bridge spans;
* Ronald Hamilton (working at the [[Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]]) who devised the \"Swiss Roll\" which consisted of a floating roadway made of waterproofed canvas stiffened with slats and tensioned by cables;
* Lieutenant Colonel William T Everall and [[Allan Beckett|Major Allan Beckett]] (of the War Office's 'Transportation 5 Department' (Tn5)) who designed a floating bridge linked to a pier head (the latter had integral 'spud' legs that were raised and lowered with the tide).

Prototypes of each of the designs were built and tested at Rigg Bay on the [[Solway Firth]]. The tests revealed various problems (the \"Swiss Roll\" would only take a maximum of a 7-ton truck in the Atlantic swell). However the final choice of design was determined by a storm during which the \"Hippos\" were undermined causing the \"Crocodile\" bridge spans to fail and the Swiss Roll was washed away. Tn5's design proved the most successful and Beckett's floating roadway (subsequently codenamed 'Whale') survived undamaged; the design was adopted and {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of Whale roadway were manufactured under the management of [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]] and [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Bruce White]], the Director of Ports and Inland Water Transport at the War Office.

==Harbour elements and code names==

Below are listed brief details of the major elements of the harbours together with their associated [[Code name|military code names]].

===Mulberry===
[[File:Arromanches Mulberry-Harbour Phoenix-Elements 1 90.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of the harbour off Arromanches in 1990]]
Mulberry was the codename for all the various different structures that would create the artificial harbours. These were the \"Gooseberries\" which metamorphosed into fully fledged harbours. There were two harbours, Mulberry \"A\" and Mulberry \"B\". The \"Mulberry\" harbours consisted of a floating outer breakwater called \"[[Bombardon breakwater|Bombardons]]\", a static breakwater consisting of \"Corncobs\" and reinforced concrete caissons called \"Phoenix\", floating piers or roadways codenamed \"Whales\" and \"Beetles\" and pier heads codenamed \"Spuds\". These harbours were both of a similar size to [[Dover#History|Dover harbour]]. In the planning of [[Operation Neptune]] the term Mulberry \"B\" was defined as, \"An artificial harbour to be built in England and towed to the British beaches at Arromanches.\"{{sfn|Crawford|1944|p=1}}

====Mulberry \"A\"====
The Mulberry harbour assembled on [[Omaha Beach]] at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]] was for use by the American invasion forces.  Mulberry \"A\" (American) was not securely anchored to the sea bed as Mulberry \"B\" had been by the British, resulting in such severe damage during the Channel storms of late June 1944 that it was considered to be irreparable and its further assembly ceased.<ref>{{cite web|title=Omaha Beach Mulberry Harbor|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/project/d-day-1944/results-discussion/omaha-beach-mulberry-harbor|publisher=Centre for Coastal and Ocean Mapping|access-date=17 December 2015|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> It was commanded by [[Augustus Dayton Clark]].

====Mulberry \"B\"====
Mulberry \"B\" (British) was the harbour assembled on [[Gold Beach]] at Arromanches for use by the British and Canadian invasion forces. The harbour was unofficially named \"Port Winston\"<ref>{{cite web|title='Port Winston' Mulberry harbour built off Normandy after D-Day is uncovered on the seabed 69 years later|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2297365/Port-Winston-harbour-built-Normandy-D-Day-uncovered-seabed-69-years-on.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=17 December 2015|first=Martin|last=Robinson|date=22 March 2013}}</ref> and was decommissioned six months after D-Day as allied forces were able to use the recently captured [[port of Antwerp]] to offload troops and supplies. Mulberry 'B' was operated by 20 Port Group, Royal Engineers under the command of Lt. Col. G C B Shaddick.

===Breakwaters===
====Corncobs and Gooseberries (breakwater ships)====
''Corncobs'' were ships that crossed the [[English Channel]] (either under their own steam or towed) and were then [[scuttling|scuttled]] to act as breakwaters and create sheltered water at the five landing beaches. Once in position the ''Corncobs'' created the sheltered waters known as ''Gooseberries''.

The ships used for each beach were:

[[File:The Phoenix breakwaters (1).jpg|thumb|A pair of [[Phoenix breakwaters|Phoenixes]], and the remains of a third, at [[Arromanches]], 2010 ]]{{main|Phoenix breakwaters}}
''Phoenixes'' were reinforced concrete caissons constructed by civil engineering contractors around the coast of Britain, collected and sunk at [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] and [[Pagham]] prior to D-Day. There were six different sizes of caisson (with [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]]s of approximately 2,000 tons to 6,000 tons each<ref>{{cite web|title=Caisson (Phoenix) Breakwater|url=http://worldwar2headquarters.com/HTML/normandy/mulberries/phoenix-breakwater.html|publisher=worldwar2heritage.com|accessdate=28 July 2018|author=|date=}}</ref>) and each unit was towed to Normandy by two [[Type V ship|tugs]] at around three knots. The caissons were initially sunk awaiting D-Day and then engineers refloated (\"resurrected\", hence the name) the Phoenixes and US Navy Captain (later Rear Admiral) [[Edward Ellsberg]], already well known for quickly refloating [[Scuttling|scuttled]] ships at [[Massawa]] and [[Oran]], was brought in to accomplish the task, though not without obtaining Churchill's intervention in taking the task away from the Royal Engineers and giving it to the Royal Navy. The Phoenixes, once refloated, were towed across the channel to form the \"Mulberry\" harbour breakwaters together with the \"Gooseberry\" block ships. Ellsberg rode one of the concrete caissons to Normandy; once there he helped unsnarl wrecked landing craft and vehicles on the beach.

====Bombardons====
{{main|Bombardon breakwater}}
The ''Bombardons'' were large {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} cross-shaped floating breakwaters fabricated in steel that were anchored outside the main breakwaters that consisted of Gooseberries (scuttled ships) and Phoenixes (concrete caissons). 24 bombardon units, attached to one another with hemp ropes, would create a {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} breakwater. During the storms at the end of June 1944 some Bombardons broke up and sank while others parted their anchors and drifted down onto the harbours, possibly causing more damage to the harbours than the storm itself. The design of the Bombardons was the responsibility of the Royal Navy while the Royal Engineers were responsible for the design of the rest of the Mulberry harbour equipment.

===Roadways===
====Whales====
[[Image:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A Whale floating roadway leading to a Spud pier at Mulberry A off [[Omaha Beach]] ]]
The dock piers were code named ''Whales''. These piers were the floating roadways that connected the \"Spud\" pier heads to the land. Designed by [[Allan Beckett]] the roadways were made from innovative torsionally flexible bridging units that had a span of 80&nbsp;ft., mounted on pontoon units of either steel or concrete called \"Beetles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|title=Some Aspects of the Design of Flexible Bridging Including 'Whale' Floating Roadways - A H Beckett|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707221355/http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-07}}</ref> After the war many of the \"Whale\" bridge spans from Arromanches were used to repair bombed bridges in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Such units are still visible as a bridge over the [http://www.normandythenandnow.com/a-rare-piece-of-d-day-history-in-this-sleepy-normandy-valley/ Noireau river in Normandy], [[Meuse River]] in [[Vacherauville]] ([[Meuse (department)|Meuse]]), as a bridge over the [[Moselle River]] on road D56 between [[Cattenom]] and [[Kœnigsmacker]] ([[Moselle]]) and in [[Vierville-sur-Mer]] ([[Calvados (department)|Calvados]]) along road D517. In 1954, some whales were also used to build for two bridges (still visible) in Cameroon along the Edea to Kribi road. In the 1960s, three Whale spans from Arromanches were used at [[Ford Dagenham]] to allow cars to be driven from the assembly line directly onto car-carrying ships. A Whale span from Mulberry B that was reused after the war at [[Pont-Farcy]] was saved from destruction in 2008 by ''Les Amis du Pont Bailey'', a group of English and French volunteers. Seeking a permanent home for the Whale span the group gifted it to the Imperial War Museum and it was returned to England in July 2015. After conservation work the span now features as part of the Land Warfare exhibition at [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]].

====Beetles====
''Beetles'' were pontoons that supported the ''Whale'' piers. They were moored in position using wires attached to \"Kite\" anchors which were also designed by [[Allan Beckett]]. These anchors had such high holding power that very few could be recovered at the end of the War. The Navy was dismissive of Beckett's claims for his anchor's holding ability so Kite anchors were not used for mooring the bombardons. An original Kite anchor is displayed in a private museum at Vierville-sur-Mer while a full size replica forms part of a memorial to Beckett in Arromanches. In October 2018 five Kite anchors were recovered from the bed of the Solent off Woodside Beach, which had been an assembly area for Whale tows prior to D Day. The anchors were taken to Mary Rose Archaeological Services in Portsmouth for conservation treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beckettrankine.com/world-war-2-kite-anchors-found-and-recovered/|title=World war 2 Kite anchors found and recovered|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>

===Spud Piers===
The pier heads or landing wharves at which ships were unloaded. Each of these consisted of a pontoon with four legs that rested on the sea bed to anchor the pontoon, yet allowed it to float up and down freely with the tide.

==Deployment==
[[Image:MulberryA - wrecked pontoon causeway after storm.jpg|thumb|Wrecked pontoon causeway of one of the \"Mulberry\" artificial harbours, following the storm of 19–22 June 1944.]]

On the afternoon of 6 June 1944 (D-Day) over 400 towed component parts (weighing approximately 1.5 million tons) set sail to create the two Mulberry harbours. It included all the blockships (codenamed Corncobs) to create the outer breakwater (Gooseberries) and 146 concrete caissons (Phoenixes).

===Arromanches Mulberry===
At [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]], the first Phoenix was sunk at dawn on 9 June 1944. By 15 June a further 115 had been sunk to create a five-mile-long arc between [[Tracy-sur-Mer]] in the west to [[Asnelles]] in the east. To protect the new anchorage, the superstructures of the blockships (which remained above sea-level) and the concrete caissons were festooned with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and [[barrage balloon]]s.

===Omaha Mulberry===
Arriving first on D-Day itself were the Bombardons followed a day later by the first blockship. The first Phoenix was sunk on 9 June and the Gooseberry was finished by 11 June. By 18 June two piers and four pier heads were working. Though this harbour was abandoned in late June (see below), the beach continued to be used for landing vehicles and stores using [[Landing Ship Tank]]s (LSTs). Using this method, the Americans were able to unload a higher tonnage of supplies than at Arromanches. Salvageable parts of the artificial port were sent to Arromanches to repair the Mulberry there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mulberry Harbours |url=http://www.normandiememoire.com/en/content/view/id-68-mulberry-harbours |website=normandiememoire.com |access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref>

===Storm of 19 June 1944===
Both harbours were almost fully functional when on 19 June a large north-east storm at Force 6 to 8 blew into Normandy and devastated the Mulberry harbour at Omaha Beach. The harbours had been designed with summer weather conditions in mind but this was the worst storm to hit the Normandy coast in 40 years.

The destruction at Omaha was so bad that the entire harbour was deemed irreparable. 21 of the 28 Phoenix caissons were completely destroyed, the Bombardons were cast adrift, and the roadways and piers smashed.

The Mulberry harbour at Arromanches was more protected, and although damaged by the storm it remained intact. It came to be known as '''Port Winston'''. While the harbour at Omaha was destroyed sooner than expected, Port Winston saw heavy use for eight months, despite being designed to last only three months. In the 10 months after D-Day, it was used to land over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies providing much needed reinforcements in France.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mulberry Harbour|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/mulberry_harbour.htm |website=historylearningsite.co.uk |access-date=17 December 2015}}</ref> In response to this longer than planned use the Phoenix breakwater was reinforced with the addition of specially strengthened caissons.{{sfn|Hughes|Momber|2000|pp=127–128}} The [[Royal Engineers]] had built a complete Mulberry Harbour out of 600,000 tons of concrete between 33 jetties, and had {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} of floating roadways to land men and vehicles on the beach. Port Winston is commonly upheld as one of the best examples of [[military engineer]]ing. Its remains are still visible today from the beaches at Arromanches.

== Post-war analysis ==
Post-war (particularly American) historians say that although it was a success, the vast resources used on the Mulberry may have been wasted, as the American forces were supplied mostly over the beaches without the use of a Mulberry right through to September 1944. By the end of 6 June, 20,000 troops and 1,700 vehicles had landed on Utah beach (the shortest beach). At Omaha and Utah, 6,614 tons of cargo was discharged in the first 3 days. A month after D-Day, Omaha and Utah were handling 9,200 tons, and after a further month, they were landing 16,000 tons per day. This increased until 56,200 tons of supplies, 20,000 vehicles, and 180,000 troops were discharged each day at those beaches. The Mulberry harbours provided less than half the total (on good weather days) to begin with.{{sfn|Godfrey|2003|p=44}} The Normandy Beaches supplied the following average daily tonnage of supplies:
 
{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"
|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | Average Daily Tonnage of Supplies Landed, Normandy 1944 {{sfn|Osmanski|1950|p=57}}
|-

|-
| Utah  || 8,000  || 6,000 
|-
|total beaches || 9,200 || 16,000
|}
By the end of June, over 289,827 tons of supplies had been offloaded onto the Normandy beaches.  Up to September, U.S. forces were supported largely across the beaches, primarily without the use of the Mulberry.\"However, in the critical early stage of the operation, had the Allied assault ships been caught in the open without the benefit of any protection, the damage in the American sector especially could have been catastrophic to the lines of supply and communication.\"{{sfn|Antill|Bradford Case|Moore|2011|p=63}}

\"Mulberry B was substantially reinforced with units salvaged from the American harbor and that the Phoenixes were pumped full of sand to give them greater stability, measures that undoubtedly explain the extended service which the British port was able to render. Furthermore, the planners obviously underrated the capacities of open beaches.  The tremendous tonnage capacities subsequently developed at both Utah and Omaha were without doubt one of the most significant and gratifying features of the entire Overlord operation.\"{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=415}}

==German equivalent of Mulberry==
In the period between postponement and cancellation of [[Operation Sea Lion]], the invasion of the UK, Germany developed some prototype prefabricated jetties with a similar purpose in mind. These could be seen in [[Alderney]], until they were demolished in 1978.{{sfn|Bonnard|1993|pp=106–108}}

==''Daily Telegraph'' crosswords==
{{Main|D-Day Daily Telegraph crossword security alarm}}
\"Mulberry\" and the names of all the beaches were words appearing in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' crossword puzzle in the month prior to the invasion.

== Deception ==
Some troops from the American [[The Ghost Army|Ghost Army]] went to Normandy two weeks after D-Day to simulate a fake Mulberry harbour. The deception was created in such a way that at night its lights drew German gunfire away from the real Mulberries.

'''Mulberry harbours''' were temporary portable [[harbour]]s developed by the United Kingdom during the [[Second World War]] to facilitate the rapid offloading of cargo onto beaches during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944. After the Allies successfully held beachheads following [[D-Day]], two prefabricated harbours were taken in sections across the [[English Channel]] from UK with the invading army and assembled off [[Omaha Beach]] (Mulberry \"A\") and [[Gold Beach]] (Mulberry \"B\").

The Mulberry harbours were to be used until major French ports could be captured and brought back into use after repair of the inevitable sabotage by German defenders. The Mulberry B harbour at [[Gold Beach]] was used for 10 months after D-Day, and over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies were landed before it was fully decommissioned. The still only partially-completed Mulberry A harbour at [[Omaha Beach]] was damaged on 19 June by a violent storm that suddenly arrived from the north-east. After three days the storm finally abated and damage was found to be so severe that the harbour had to be abandoned.

==Background==
The [[Dieppe Raid]] of 1942 had shown that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] could not rely on being able to penetrate the [[Atlantic Wall]] to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed [[Draft (hull)|sufficient depth of water]] under their [[keel]]s, together with [[Crane (machine)|dockside cranes]], to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain [[Operation Overlord]]. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], [[pier]]s and roadways.

==Preparation==
[[File:Construction of Mulberry Harbours, Southampton, April 1944 A25792.jpg|thumb|[[Phoenix breakwater|Phoenix caissons]] under construction, Southampton 1944]]
With the planning of [[Operation Overlord]] at an advanced stage by the summer of 1943, it was accepted that the proposed artificial harbours would need to be prefabricated in the UK and then towed across the English Channel.

The need for two separate artificial harbours – one American and one British/Canadian – was agreed at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. An Artificial Harbours Sub-Committee was set up under the Chairmanship of the civil engineer Colin R White (Sir Bruce White's brother) to advise on the location of the harbour and the form of the breakwater; the Sub-Committee's first meeting was held at the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE) on 4 August 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf|title=War Office: Artificial Harbours|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> The minutes of the Sub-Committee's meetings show that initially it was envisaged that bubble breakwaters would be used, then block ships were proposed and finally, due to an insufficient number of block ships being available, a mix of block ships and purpose made concrete caisson units.

On 2 September 1943 the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] estimated that the artificial ports (Mulberries) would need to handle 12,000 tons per day, exclusive of motor transport and in all weathers. On 4 September the go ahead was given to start work immediately on the harbours. However, infighting between the [[War Office]] and the [[Admiralty]] over responsibility was only resolved on 15 December 1943 by the intervention of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff. The decision was that the Admiralty managed the blockships, Bombardons and assembly of all constituent parts on the south coast of England. Further the Admiralty would undertake all necessary work to survey, site, tow and mark navigation.

The War Office was given the task of constructing the concrete caissons (Phoenixes), the roadways (Whales) and protection via anti-aircraft installations. Once at the site, the army was responsible for sinking the caissons and assembling all the various other units of the harbours.

For the Mulberry A at Omaha Beach, the naval Corps of Civil Engineers would construct the harbour from the prefabricated parts.

The proposed harbours called for many huge [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] of various sorts to build breakwaters and piers and connecting structures to provide the roadways. The caissons were built at a number of locations, mainly existing ship building facilities or large beaches, like Conwy Morfa, around the British coast. The works were let out to commercial construction firms including [[Wates Group|Wates Construction]] [[Balfour Beatty]], [[Henry Boot PLC|Henry Boot]], [[Lend Lease Project Management & Construction|Bovis & Co]], [[Cochrane Shipbuilders|Cochrane & Sons]], [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[Holland, Hannen & Cubitts|Cubitts]], [[W. & C. French|French]], [[Holloway Brothers (London)|Holloway Brothers]], [[John Laing Group|John Laing & Son]], [[Peter Lind & Company]], [[Sir Robert McAlpine]], [[Melville Dundas|Melville Dundas & Whitson]], [[Mowlem]], [[BAM Nuttall|Nuttall]], [[Sir Lindsay Parkinson|Parkinson]], [[Halcrow Group]], [[Pauling & Co.]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]].{{sfn|Hartcup|2011|p=94}} On completion they were towed across the English Channel by [[Tugboat|tugs]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Thames Tugs |url=http://www.thamestugs.co.uk/BRITISH-TUGS.php |title=Mulberry Harbour: British, French and Dutch tugs' |access-date=20 April 2009}}</ref> to the Normandy coast at only {{convert|4.3|kn|km/h|order=flip}}, assembled, operated and maintained by the [[Royal Engineers|Corps of Royal Engineers]], under the guidance of Reginald D. Gwyther, who was appointed CBE for his efforts. Various elements of the \"Whale\" piers were designed and constructed by a group of companies led by Braithwaite & Co, West Bromwich and Newport.

===Beach surveys===
Both locations for the temporary harbours required detailed information concerning [[geology]], [[hydrography]] and sea conditions. To collect this data a special team of hydrographers was created in October 1943. The 712th Survey Flotilla, operated from [[Stone frigate|naval base]] [[List of Royal Navy shore establishments#S to Z|HMS ''Tormentor'']] in [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]], were detailed to collect soundings off the enemy coast. Between November 1943 and January 1944 this team used a [[LCPL|Landing Craft Personnel (Large)]], or LCP(L), to survey the Normandy coast.

The special LCP(L) was manned by a Royal Navy crew and a small group of hydrographers. The first sortie, Operation KJF, occurred on the night of 26/27 November 1943 when three LCP(L)s took measurements off the port of Arromanches, the location for Mulberry B. A follow up mission, Operation KJG, to the proposed location for Mulberry A happened on 1/2 December but a navigation failure meant the team sounded an area 2,250 yards west of the correct area.

Two attempts had to be made to take soundings off the [[Ver-sur-Mer|Point de Ver]]. The first sortie, Operation Bellpush Able, on 25/26 December had issues with their equipment and returned on 28/29 December to complete the task.

On New Year's Eve 1943, a [[Combined Operations Headquarters#Operations|Combined Operations Pilotage Party]] (COPP), left Gosport for the Gold Beach area at [[Luc-sur-Mer]]. Two soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]], Major Scott-Bowden and [[Sergeant#Royal Marines and British Army|Sergeant]] Ogden-Smith, were landed on the beach at night in [[Operation Postage Able]] and took samples of the sand. These were crucial in determining whether the armoured vehicles would be able to operate on the beach or become bogged down. The final survey, Operation Bellpush Charlie, occurred on the night of 30–31 January but limited information was gathered due to fog and because German lookouts heard the craft. Further sorties were abandoned.{{sfn|Falconer|2013|pp=69–71}}

==Design and development==
[[File:MulberryB - Piers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Aerial view of Mulberry harbour \"B\" at [[Arromanches]] (October 27, 1944)]]
An early idea for temporary harbours was sketched by [[Winston Churchill]] in a 1915 memo to [[Lloyd George]]. This memo was for artificial harbours to be created off the German islands of [[Borkum]] and [[Sylt]]. No further investigation was made and the memo was filed away.

In 1940 the civil engineer [[Guy Maunsell]] wrote to the [[War Office]] with a proposal for an artificial harbour, but the idea was not at first adopted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Maunsell_G/maunsellGuy5.asp |title=Engineering Timelines - Guy Maunsell - WWII : sea forts + harbours |website=www.engineering-timelines.com |access-date=16 March 2020 }}</ref>
Churchill issued his memo \"Piers for use on beaches\" on 30 May 1942, apparently in some frustration at the lack of progress being made on finding a solution to the temporary harbour problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2015/02/user-requirement-document-piers-use-beaches/|title=A User Requirement Document - Piers for Use on Beaches |publisher=Think Defence|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref> Between 17 June and 6 August 1942, [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] submitted a design concept for artificial harbours to the War Office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historicaldocuments.weebly.com/hughes-war-plans.html|title=Hughes War Plans - Mulberry Harbours|work=Kaller Historical Documents|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref>

At a meeting following the [[Dieppe Raid]] of 19 August 1942, [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[John Hughes-Hallett]] (the naval commander for the Dieppe Raid) declared that if a port could not be captured, then one should be taken across the [[English Channel|Channel]]. Hughes-Hallett had the support of Churchill. The concept of Mulberry harbours began to take shape when Hughes-Hallett moved to be Naval Chief of Staff to the [[Operation Overlord|Overlord]] planners.

In the autumn of 1942, the [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Chief of Combined Operations]] Vice-Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], outlined the requirement for piers at least a mile long at which a continuous stream of supplies could be handled, including a pier head capable of handling 2,000-ton ships.

In July 1943 a committee of eminent civil engineers consisting of Colin R White (Chairman), J D C Couper, J A Cochrane, R D Gwyther and Lt. Col. Ivor Bell was established to advise on how a number of selected sites on the French coastline could be converted into sheltered harbours. The committee initially investigated the use of compressed air breakwaters before eventually deciding on blockships and caissons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf |title=Artificioal Habours |publisher=War Office |access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref>

===Trials===
In August and September 1943 a trial of three competing designs for the cargo-handling jetties was set up together with a test of a compressed air breakwater. The pier designs were by:
* [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] (a civil engineer) who developed his \"Hippo\" piers and \"Crocodile\" bridge spans;
* Ronald Hamilton (working at the [[Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]]) who devised the \"Swiss Roll\" which consisted of a floating roadway made of waterproofed canvas stiffened with slats and tensioned by cables;
* Lieutenant Colonel William T Everall and [[Allan Beckett|Major Allan Beckett]] (of the War Office's 'Transportation 5 Department' (Tn5)) who designed a floating bridge linked to a pier head (the latter had integral 'spud' legs that were raised and lowered with the tide).

Prototypes of each of the designs were built and tested at Rigg Bay on the [[Solway Firth]]. The tests revealed various problems (the \"Swiss Roll\" would only take a maximum of a 7-ton truck in the Atlantic swell). However the final choice of design was determined by a storm during which the \"Hippos\" were undermined causing the \"Crocodile\" bridge spans to fail and the Swiss Roll was washed away. Tn5's design proved the most successful and Beckett's floating roadway (subsequently codenamed 'Whale') survived undamaged; the design was adopted and {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of Whale roadway were manufactured under the management of [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]] and [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Bruce White]], the Director of Ports and Inland Water Transport at the War Office.

==Harbour elements and code names==

Below are listed brief details of the major elements of the harbours together with their associated [[Code name|military code names]].

===Mulberry===
[[File:Arromanches Mulberry-Harbour Phoenix-Elements 1 90.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of the harbour off Arromanches in 1990]]
Mulberry was the codename for all the various different structures that would create the artificial harbours. These were the \"Gooseberries\" which metamorphosed into fully fledged harbours. There were two harbours, Mulberry \"A\" and Mulberry \"B\". The \"Mulberry\" harbours consisted of a floating outer breakwater called \"[[Bombardon breakwater|Bombardons]]\", a static breakwater consisting of \"Corncobs\" and reinforced concrete caissons called \"Phoenix\", floating piers or roadways codenamed \"Whales\" and \"Beetles\" and pier heads codenamed \"Spuds\". These harbours were both of a similar size to [[Dover#History|Dover harbour]]. In the planning of [[Operation Neptune]] the term Mulberry \"B\" was defined as, \"An artificial harbour to be built in England and towed to the British beaches at Arromanches.\"{{sfn|Crawford|1944|p=1}}

====Mulberry \"A\"====
The Mulberry harbour assembled on [[Omaha Beach]] at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]] was for use by the American invasion forces.  Mulberry \"A\" (American) was not securely anchored to the sea bed as Mulberry \"B\" had been by the British, resulting in such severe damage during the Channel storms of late June 1944 that it was considered to be irreparable and its further assembly ceased.<ref>{{cite web|title=Omaha Beach Mulberry Harbor|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/project/d-day-1944/results-discussion/omaha-beach-mulberry-harbor|publisher=Centre for Coastal and Ocean Mapping|access-date=17 December 2015|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> It was commanded by [[Augustus Dayton Clark]].

====Mulberry \"B\"====
Mulberry \"B\" (British) was the harbour assembled on [[Gold Beach]] at Arromanches for use by the British and Canadian invasion forces. The harbour was unofficially named \"Port Winston\"<ref>{{cite web|title='Port Winston' Mulberry harbour built off Normandy after D-Day is uncovered on the seabed 69 years later|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2297365/Port-Winston-harbour-built-Normandy-D-Day-uncovered-seabed-69-years-on.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=17 December 2015|first=Martin|last=Robinson|date=22 March 2013}}</ref> and was decommissioned six months after D-Day as allied forces were able to use the recently captured [[port of Antwerp]] to offload troops and supplies. Mulberry 'B' was operated by 20 Port Group, Royal Engineers under the command of Lt. Col. G C B Shaddick.

===Breakwaters===
====Corncobs and Gooseberries (breakwater ships)====
''Corncobs'' were ships that crossed the [[English Channel]] (either under their own steam or towed) and were then [[scuttling|scuttled]] to act as breakwaters and create sheltered water at the five landing beaches. Once in position the ''Corncobs'' created the sheltered waters known as ''Gooseberries''.

The ships used for each beach were:
* [[Utah Beach]] (Gooseberry 1): ''Benjamin Contee'', ''David O. Saylor'', ''George S. Wasson'', ''Matt W. Ransom'',{{sfn|Morton|Jones|2005|p=111}} {{SS|West Cheswald||2}}, {{SS|West Honaker||2}}, {{SS|West Nohno||2}}, ''Willis A. Slater'', ''Victory Sword'' and ''Vitruvius''.
* [[Omaha Beach]] (Gooseberry 2): ''Artemas Ward'',{{sfn|Morton|Jones|2005|p=111}} {{SS|Audacious|1913|2}}, ''Baialoide'', {{HMS|Centurion|1911|6}}, ''Courageous'', ''Flight-Command'', ''Galveston'', ''George W.

* [[Gold Beach]] (Gooseberry 3):  ''Alynbank'', ''Alghios Spyridon'', ''Elswick Park'', ''Flowergate'', ''Giorgios P.'', ''Ingman'', ''Innerton'', ''Lynghaug'', ''[[ORP Wilia|Modlin]]'', ''Njegos'', ''Parkhaven'', ''Parklaan'', ''Saltersgate'', ''Sirehei'', ''Vinlake'' and ''Winha''.
* [[Juno Beach]] (Gooseberry 4): ''Belgique'', ''Bendoran'', {{SS|Empire Bunting||2}}, ''Empire Flamingo'', ''Empire Moorhen'', ''Empire Waterhen'', ''Formigny'', ''Manchester Spinner'', ''Mariposa'', ''Panos'' and ''Vera Radcliffe''.

====Phoenix caissons====
[[File:A line of Phoenix caisson units, part of the 'Mulberry' artificial harbour at Arromanches, 12 June 1944. B5726.jpg|thumb|right|A line of Phoenix caissons in place at Arromanches, with anti-aircraft guns installed. 12 June 1944]]
[[File:The Phoenix breakwaters (1).jpg|thumb|A pair of [[Phoenix breakwaters|Phoenixes]], and the remains of a third, at [[Arromanches]], 2010 ]]{{main|Phoenix breakwaters}}
''Phoenixes'' were reinforced concrete caissons constructed by civil engineering contractors around the coast of Britain, collected and sunk at [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] and [[Pagham]] prior to D-Day. There were six different sizes of caisson (with [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]]s of approximately 2,000 tons to 6,000 tons each<ref>{{cite web|title=Caisson (Phoenix) Breakwater|url=http://worldwar2headquarters.com/HTML/normandy/mulberries/phoenix-breakwater.html|publisher=worldwar2heritage.com|accessdate=28 July 2018|author=|date=}}</ref>) and each unit was towed to Normandy by two [[Type V ship|tugs]] at around three knots. The caissons were initially sunk awaiting D-Day and then engineers refloated (\"resurrected\", hence the name) the Phoenixes and US Navy Captain (later Rear Admiral) [[Edward Ellsberg]], already well known for quickly refloating [[Scuttling|scuttled]] ships at [[Massawa]] and [[Oran]], was brought in to accomplish the task, though not without obtaining Churchill's intervention in taking the task away from the Royal Engineers and giving it to the Royal Navy. The Phoenixes, once refloated, were towed across the channel to form the \"Mulberry\" harbour breakwaters together with the \"Gooseberry\" block ships. Ellsberg rode one of the concrete caissons to Normandy; once there he helped unsnarl wrecked landing craft and vehicles on the beach.

====Bombardons====
{{main|Bombardon breakwater}}
The ''Bombardons'' were large {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} cross-shaped floating breakwaters fabricated in steel that were anchored outside the main breakwaters that consisted of Gooseberries (scuttled ships) and Phoenixes (concrete caissons). 24 bombardon units, attached to one another with hemp ropes, would create a {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} breakwater. During the storms at the end of June 1944 some Bombardons broke up and sank while others parted their anchors and drifted down onto the harbours, possibly causing more damage to the harbours than the storm itself. The design of the Bombardons was the responsibility of the Royal Navy while the Royal Engineers were responsible for the design of the rest of the Mulberry harbour equipment.

===Roadways===
====Whales====
[[Image:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A Whale floating roadway leading to a Spud pier at Mulberry A off [[Omaha Beach]] ]]
The dock piers were code named ''Whales''. These piers were the floating roadways that connected the \"Spud\" pier heads to the land. Designed by [[Allan Beckett]] the roadways were made from innovative torsionally flexible bridging units that had a span of 80&nbsp;ft., mounted on pontoon units of either steel or concrete called \"Beetles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|title=Some Aspects of the Design of Flexible Bridging Including 'Whale' Floating Roadways - A H Beckett|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707221355/http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-07}}</ref> After the war many of the \"Whale\" bridge spans from Arromanches were used to repair bombed bridges in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Such units are still visible as a bridge over the [http://www.normandythenandnow.com/a-rare-piece-of-d-day-history-in-this-sleepy-normandy-valley/ Noireau river in Normandy], [[Meuse River]] in [[Vacherauville]] ([[Meuse (department)|Meuse]]), as a bridge over the [[Moselle River]] on road D56 between [[Cattenom]] and [[Kœnigsmacker]] ([[Moselle]]) and in [[Vierville-sur-Mer]] ([[Calvados (department)|Calvados]]) along road D517. In 1954, some whales were also used to build for two bridges (still visible) in Cameroon along the Edea to Kribi road. In the 1960s, three Whale spans from Arromanches were used at [[Ford Dagenham]] to allow cars to be driven from the assembly line directly onto car-carrying ships. A Whale span from Mulberry B that was reused after the war at [[Pont-Farcy]] was saved from destruction in 2008 by ''Les Amis du Pont Bailey'', a group of English and French volunteers. Seeking a permanent home for the Whale span the group gifted it to the Imperial War Museum and it was returned to England in July 2015. After conservation work the span now features as part of the Land Warfare exhibition at [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]].

====Beetles====
''Beetles'' were pontoons that supported the ''Whale'' piers. They were moored in position using wires attached to \"Kite\" anchors which were also designed by [[Allan Beckett]]. These anchors had such high holding power that very few could be recovered at the end of the War. The Navy was dismissive of Beckett's claims for his anchor's holding ability so Kite anchors were not used for mooring the bombardons. An original Kite anchor is displayed in a private museum at Vierville-sur-Mer while a full size replica forms part of a memorial to Beckett in Arromanches. In October 2018 five Kite anchors were recovered from the bed of the Solent off Woodside Beach, which had been an assembly area for Whale tows prior to D Day. The anchors were taken to Mary Rose Archaeological Services in Portsmouth for conservation treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beckettrankine.com/world-war-2-kite-anchors-found-and-recovered/|title=World war 2 Kite anchors found and recovered|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>

===Spud Piers===
The pier heads or landing wharves at which ships were unloaded. Each of these consisted of a pontoon with four legs that rested on the sea bed to anchor the pontoon, yet allowed it to float up and down freely with the tide.

==Deployment==
[[Image:MulberryA - wrecked pontoon causeway after storm.jpg|thumb|Wrecked pontoon causeway of one of the \"Mulberry\" artificial harbours, following the storm of 19–22 June 1944.]]

On the afternoon of 6 June 1944 (D-Day) over 400 towed component parts (weighing approximately 1.5 million tons) set sail to create the two Mulberry harbours. It included all the blockships (codenamed Corncobs) to create the outer breakwater (Gooseberries) and 146 concrete caissons (Phoenixes).

===Arromanches Mulberry===
At [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]], the first Phoenix was sunk at dawn on 9 June 1944. By 15 June a further 115 had been sunk to create a five-mile-long arc between [[Tracy-sur-Mer]] in the west to [[Asnelles]] in the east. To protect the new anchorage, the superstructures of the blockships (which remained above sea-level) and the concrete caissons were festooned with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and [[barrage balloon]]s.

===Omaha Mulberry===
Arriving first on D-Day itself were the Bombardons followed a day later by the first blockship. The first Phoenix was sunk on 9 June and the Gooseberry was finished by 11 June. By 18 June two piers and four pier heads were working. Though this harbour was abandoned in late June (see below), the beach continued to be used for landing vehicles and stores using [[Landing Ship Tank]]s (LSTs). Using this method, the Americans were able to unload a higher tonnage of supplies than at Arromanches. Salvageable parts of the artificial port were sent to Arromanches to repair the Mulberry there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mulberry Harbours |url=http://www.normandiememoire.com/en/content/view/id-68-mulberry-harbours |website=normandiememoire.com |access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref>

===Storm of 19 June 1944===
Both harbours were almost fully functional when on 19 June a large north-east storm at Force 6 to 8 blew into Normandy and devastated the Mulberry harbour at Omaha Beach. The harbours had been designed with summer weather conditions in mind but this was the worst storm to hit the Normandy coast in 40 years.

The destruction at Omaha was so bad that the entire harbour was deemed irreparable. 21 of the 28 Phoenix caissons were completely destroyed, the Bombardons were cast adrift, and the roadways and piers smashed.

The Mulberry harbour at Arromanches was more protected, and although damaged by the storm it remained intact. It came to be known as '''Port Winston'''. While the harbour at Omaha was destroyed sooner than expected, Port Winston saw heavy use for eight months, despite being designed to last only three months. In the 10 months after D-Day, it was used to land over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies providing much needed reinforcements in France.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mulberry Harbour|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/mulberry_harbour.htm |website=historylearningsite.co.uk |access-date=17 December 2015}}</ref> In response to this longer than planned use the Phoenix breakwater was reinforced with the addition of specially strengthened caissons.{{sfn|Hughes|Momber|2000|pp=127–128}} The [[Royal Engineers]] had built a complete Mulberry Harbour out of 600,000 tons of concrete between 33 jetties, and had {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} of floating roadways to land men and vehicles on the beach. Port Winston is commonly upheld as one of the best examples of [[military engineer]]ing. Its remains are still visible today from the beaches at Arromanches.

== Post-war analysis ==
Post-war (particularly American) historians say that although it was a success, the vast resources used on the Mulberry may have been wasted, as the American forces were supplied mostly over the beaches without the use of a Mulberry right through to September 1944. By the end of 6 June, 20,000 troops and 1,700 vehicles had landed on Utah beach (the shortest beach). At Omaha and Utah, 6,614 tons of cargo was discharged in the first 3 days. A month after D-Day, Omaha and Utah were handling 9,200 tons, and after a further month, they were landing 16,000 tons per day. This increased until 56,200 tons of supplies, 20,000 vehicles, and 180,000 troops were discharged each day at those beaches. The Mulberry harbours provided less than half the total (on good weather days) to begin with.{{sfn|Godfrey|2003|p=44}} The Normandy Beaches supplied the following average daily tonnage of supplies:

By the end of June, over 289,827 tons of supplies had been offloaded onto the Normandy beaches.  Up to September, U.S. forces were supported largely across the beaches, primarily without the use of the Mulberry.\"However, in the critical early stage of the operation, had the Allied assault ships been caught in the open without the benefit of any protection, the damage in the American sector especially could have been catastrophic to the lines of supply and communication.\"{{sfn|Antill|Bradford Case|Moore|2011|p=63}}

\"Mulberry B was substantially reinforced with units salvaged from the American harbor and that the Phoenixes were pumped full of sand to give them greater stability, measures that undoubtedly explain the extended service which the British port was able to render. Furthermore, the planners obviously underrated the capacities of open beaches.  The tremendous tonnage capacities subsequently developed at both Utah and Omaha were without doubt one of the most significant and gratifying features of the entire Overlord operation.\"{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=415}}

==German equivalent of Mulberry==
In the period between postponement and cancellation of [[Operation Sea Lion]], the invasion of the UK, Germany developed some prototype prefabricated jetties with a similar purpose in mind. These could be seen in [[Alderney]], until they were demolished in 1978.{{sfn|Bonnard|1993|pp=106–108}}

== Deception ==
Some troops from the American [[The Ghost Army|Ghost Army]] went to Normandy two weeks after D-Day to simulate a fake Mulberry harbour. The deception was created in such a way that at night its lights drew German gunfire away from the real Mulberries.

'''Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León''', ({{IPA-es|eɾˈnesto seˈðiʝo}}; born 27 December 1951) is a Mexican economist and politician. He was [[President of Mexico]] from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 2000, as the last of the uninterrupted 71-year line of Mexican presidents from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI).

During his presidency, he faced the [[Mexican peso crisis|worst economic crisis in Mexico's history]], which started only weeks after he took office.<ref name=\"The Economist 2004\">{{Cite news | title = The peso crisis, ten years on: Tequila slammer | date = 2004-12-29 | work = [[The Economist]] | url = https://www.economist.com/node/3524948 | accessdate = 2014-07-08}}</ref><ref name=\"Molen 2013\">{{Cite news | title = The Tequila crisis in 1994 | date = 2013-09-19 | publisher = [[Rabobank]] | url = http://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2013/september/the-tequila-crisis-in-1994 | accessdate = 2014-07-27 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410090503/https://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2013/september/the-tequila-crisis-in-1994/ | archivedate = 2015-04-10 }}</ref> He distanced himself from his predecessor [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]], blaming his policies for the crisis (although President Zedillo himself did not deviate from the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies of his two predecessors),<ref name=\"The Economist 2004\"/><ref>{{Cite news | title = Salinas vs. Zedillo | publisher = La Jornada | url = http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/10/11/index.php?section=politica&article=020a1pol | accessdate = 2018-03-09 |language = Spanish}}</ref> and oversaw the arrest of his brother [[Raúl Salinas de Gortari]].<ref>Salinas' Brother Charged in Mexican Assassination ''New York Times'' March 1, 1995 [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/world/salinas-s-brother-charged-in-mexican-assassination.html]</ref> His administration was also marked, among other things, by renewed clashes with the [[EZLN]] and the [[Popular Revolutionary Army]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017111100/http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 October 2013|title=Wayback Machine|date=17 October 2013|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref> the controversial implementation of [[Fobaproa]] to rescue the national banking system;<ref>Solís, L.

Although Zedillo's policies allowed Mexico to get out of the economic crisis and regain growth, popular discontent with seven decades of PRI rule led to the party losing, for the first time, its legislative majority [[1997 Mexican legislative election|in the 1997 elections]],<ref name=DN>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p453 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref> and in the [[2000 Mexican general election|2000 elections]] the right-wing opposition [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]]'s candidate [[Vicente Fox]] won the Presidency of the Republic, putting an end to 71 years of uninterrupted PRI rule.<ref>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p475 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref> Zedillo's admission of the PRI's defeat and his peaceful handing of power to his successor improved his image in the final months of his administration, and he left office with an approval rating of 60%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Aznarez |first1=Juan Jesus |title=Zedillo abandona la presidencia con una popularidad del 60% |url=https://elpais.com/diario/2000/12/01/internacional/975625205_850215.html |accessdate=9 August 2019 |publisher=El Pais |date=1 December 2000}}</ref>

Since the ending of his term as president in 2000, Zedillo has been a leading voice on globalization, especially its impact on relations between developed and developing nations.

He is currently Director of the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization|Center for the Study of Globalization]] at [[Yale University]], is the Latin American co-chair of the [[Inter-American Dialogue]], and is on the board of directors of [[Citigroup]].

==Early life and education==
Ernesto Zedillo was born on 27 December 1951 in [[Mexico City]]. His parents were Rodolfo Zedillo Castillo, a mechanic, and Martha Alicia Ponce de León. Seeking better job and education opportunities for their children, his parents moved to [[Mexicali]], [[Baja California]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In 1965, at the age of 14, he returned to Mexico City. In 1969 he entered the [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional|National Polytechnic Institute]], financing his studies by working in the National Army and Navy Bank (later known as ''Banjército''). He graduated as an economist in 1972 and began lecturing. It was among his first group of students that he met his wife, [[First Lady of Mexico|Nilda Patricia Velasco]], with whom he has five children: Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos (formerly married to conductor [[Alondra de la Parra]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/332332 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403181822/http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/332332 |archive-date=3 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), Nilda Patricia and Rodrigo.

In 1974, he pursued his master's and PhD studies at [[Yale University]]. His doctoral thesis was titled ''Mexico's Public External Debt: Recent History and Future Growth Related to Oil''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Political career===
Zedillo began working in the [[Bank of Mexico]] (Mexico's central bank) as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, where he supported the adoption of macroeconomic policies for the country's improvement.
By 1987, he was named deputy-secretary of Planning and Budget Control in the Secretariat of Budget and Planning. In 1988, at the age of 36, he headed that secretariat. During his term as Secretary, Zedillo launched a Science and Technology reform.

In 1992, he was appointed [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Education]] by president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]].  During his tenure in this post, he was in charge of the revision the Mexican public school textbooks.  The changes, which took a softer line on foreign investment and the Porfiriato, among other topics, were highly controversial and the textbooks were withdrawn.<ref>Gilbert, Dennis. “Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.” Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 271–297. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1052017 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> A year later he resigned to run the electoral campaign of [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]'s presidential candidate.

==1994 presidential campaign==
{{main|1994 Mexican general election}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin at the Millennium Summit 6-8 September 2000-12.jpg|left|thumb|230px|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Ernesto Zedillo, at the Millennium Summit, 2000]]

In 1994, after [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]]'s assassination, Zedillo became one of the few [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] members eligible under Mexican law to take his place, since he had not occupied public office for some time.

The opposition blamed Colosio's murder on Salinas. Although the PRI's presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president, and thus [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] had originally been [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Salinas]]' candidate, their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which Colosio said that [[Mexico]] had many problems. It is also notable that the assassination took place after Colosio visited the members of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] in Chiapas and promised to open dialogue, something the PRI opposed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

After Colosio's murder, this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the president.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The choice of Zedillo was interpreted as Salinas' way of bypassing the strong Mexican political tradition of non-reelection and retaining real power, since Zedillo was not really a politician, but an economist (like Salinas), who clearly lacked the president's political talent and influence. It is unclear if Salinas had attempted to control Colosio, who was generally considered at that time to be a far better candidate.

Zedillo ran against [[Diego Fernández de Cevallos]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] and second-timer [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]] of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. He won with 48.69% of popular vote, and became the last president to distinguish the 70-year PRI dynasty in México during the 20th century.

==Presidency (1994–2000)==
[[File:Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009.jpg|right|thumb|230px| Zedillo at the World Economic Forum 2009]]
[[File:Edmund S Phelps Ernesto Zedillo.jpg|right|thumb|230 px|Ernesto Zedillo with [[Edmund Phelps]], winner of the 2006 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], at the [[World Economic Forum]]'s Summit on the Global Agenda 2008]]
At age 43, Zedillo assumed the presidency on 1 December 1994 at the [[Legislative Palace of San Lázaro]], taking oath before the [[Congress of the Union]] presided by the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|deputy president]] Carlota Vargas Garza. Zedillo's electoral victory was perceived as clean, but he came to office as an accidental candidate with no political base of his own and no experience. During the first part of his presidency, he took inconsistent policy positions and there were rumors that he would resign or that there would be a coup d'état against him, which caused turmoil in financial markets.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\">Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p.1641</ref>

===Cabinet===
Zedillo's [[Cabinet of Ernesto Zedillo|cabinet]] needed to have members who could deal with crises. Over the course of his presidency, he had four as [[Minister of the Interior]], [[Esteban Moctezuma]], who dealt with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]; [[Emilio Chuayffet]], who resigned following the [[Acteal massacre]]; [[Francisco Labastida]], who won the primary to determine the 2000 PRI presidential candidate; and [[Diódoro Carrasco Altamirano]], who dealt with the strike at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].

===Financial Crisis of December 1994===
{{Main|Mexican peso crisis}}
A few days after taking office, one of the biggest economic crises in Mexican history hit the country. Although it was outgoing President Salinas who was mainly blamed for the crisis, Salinas claimed that President Zedillo made a mistake by changing the economic policies held by his administration. Zedillo devalued the peso by 15%, which prompted the near-collapse of the financial system.<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\", p. 1641.</ref> [[Mexican peso crisis|The crisis]] ended after a series of reforms and actions led by Zedillo. US president [[Bill Clinton]] granted a US$20&nbsp;billion loan to Mexico, which helped in one of Zedillo's initiatives to rescue the banking system.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | title = Clinton authorizes loan to Mexico | publisher = [[History (U.S. TV channel)]] | date = 31 January 1995 | accessdate = 27 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180324010125/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | archive-date = 24 March 2018 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===Break with Salinas===
Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who was vaulted to prominence with the assassination of Colosio. The conflict between Zedillo and Salinas marked the early part of Zedillo's presidency.<ref>Fuentes, Carlos. “Coalticue's Skirt: Hidden Aspects of Mexico's Political Rivalry in 1995.” The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 2, no. 2, 1995, pp. 175–180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24590093 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> As with De la Madrid and Salinas, Zedillo had never been elected to office and had no experience in politics. His performance as a candidate was lackluster, but the outbreak of violence in Chiapas and the shock of the Colosio assassination swayed voters to support the PRI candidate in the 1994 election. In office, Zedillo was perceived as a puppet-president with Salinas following the model of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obregón]]. In order to consolidate his own power in the presidency, Zedillo had to assert his independence from Salinas. On 28 February 1995 Zedillo ordered the arrest of the ex-president's older brother [[Raúl Salinas]] for the September 1994 murder of PRI General Secretary [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]]. This action marked a decisive break between Zedillo and Salinas.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\"/>

===Zapatista Crisis===
{{Main|1995 Zapatista Crisis}}
Mexico had been in turmoil since January 1994, with the initial Zapatista rebellion and two political assassinations. The presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] was assassinated in March 1994, and his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo replaced him candidate a few days later. The other high-profile assassination, that of PRI Secretary General [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], brother-in-law of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in September 1994, laid bare political rivalries within the PRI. In order to give credibility to the investigations of those political crimes and grant \"a healthy distance\", president Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia a member of the opposition Political Party [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] as [[Attorney General of Mexico]].  Zedillo inherited the rebellion in Chiapas, but it was up to his administration to handle it.

On 5 January 1995, the Secretary of Interior [[Esteban Moctezuma]] started a secret meeting process with [[Subcomandante Marcos|Marcos]] called \"Steps Toward Peace\" [[Chiapas]]. Talks seemed promising for an agreement, but Zedillo backed away, apparently because the military was not in accord with the government's apparent \"acceptance of the Zapatistas' control over much of Chiapas territory.\"<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', p. 242.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=330331|title=Zedillo rompió acuerdo de paz con el EZLN: Esteban Moctezuma - Proceso|date=11 January 2013|website=Proceso.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|title=El Universal - Opinion - Renuncia en Gobernación|website=Eluniversalmas.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802123734/http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In February 1995, the Mexican government identified the masked Subcomandante Marcos as Rafael Sebastián Guillén, a former professor at the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] in Mexico City.

The army was prepared to move against Zapatista strongholds and capture Marcos.<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', pp. 244-45</ref> The government decided to reopen negotiations with the Zapatistas. On 10 March 1995 President Zedillo and Secretary of the Interior Moctezuma signed the Presidential Decree for the Dialog, the Reconciliation and a peace with dignity in Chiapas law, which was discussed and approved by the Mexican Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx/pages/chiapas/docs/ley-dialogo.html|title=Client Validation|website=Zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102231548/http://zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx/pages/chiapas/docs/ley-dialogo.html|archive-date=2 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In April 1995, the government and the Zapatistas began secret talks to find an end to the conflict.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/ezln/cronologia.htm|title=Cronologia del Conflicto EZLN|website=Latinamericanstudies.org|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>  In February 1996, the [[San Andrés Accords]] were signed by the government and the Zapatistas.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070206140008/http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/americas/mexico/SanAndres.html accessed 23 March 2019</ref> In May 1996, Zapatistas imprisoned for terrorism were released.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/1996/06/07/croni.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105203601/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/1996/06/07/croni.html |archive-date=5 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In December 1997, indigenous peasants were murdered in an incident known as the [[Acteal massacre]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/25/opinion/death-in-chiapas.html accessed 23 March 2019</ref> Survivors of the massacre sued Zedillo in U.S., but the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the suit on the basis of his immunity as a head of state.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20141015142416/http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

===Church-state relations===
[[File:Oscar_Vega_y_Ernesto_Zedillo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Oscar Vega and the President Ernesto Zedillo in 1998.]]
Salinas had gained support of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1988 elections and had pushed through a series of constitutional changes that significantly changed church-state relations.  However, on February 11, 1995, Zedillo ignited a crisis with the Roman Catholic Church, hurting, recently restored [[Mexican government|Mexico]]–[[Holy See]] diplomatic relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/10/03/index.php?section=opinion&article=024a1pol|title=A 15 años de relaciones entre México y el Vaticano |website=Jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> Relations had already been damaged because of the May 24, 1993 political assassination of the Guadalajara Cardinal [[Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo]] and lack of government progress on solving the murder by the [[Attorney General of Mexico]].

===Poverty alleviation===
Zedillo's presidential motto was ''Bienestar para tu familia'' (\"Well-being for your family\"). He created the poverty alleviation program ''Progresa'', which subsidized the poorest families in Mexico, provided that their children went to school. It replaced the Salinas administration's PRONASOL, deemed too politicized.<ref>Rocha Menocal, A. (2001). \"Do Old Habits Die Hard? A Statistical Exploration of the Politicisation of Progresa, Mexico's Latest Federal Poverty-Alleviation Programme, under the Zedillo Administration.\" Journal of Latin American Studies, 33(3), 513-538. doi:10.1017/S0022216X01006113 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> It was later renamed ''[[Oportunidades]]'' (''Opportunities'') by president [[Vicente Fox]]. The parastatal organization [[:es:Compañía Nacional de Subsistencias Populares|CONASUPO]], which was designed to supply food and provide food security to the poor was phased out in 1999, resulting in higher food prices.<ref>Yunez–Naude, Antonio. \"The dismantling of CONASUPO, a Mexican state trader in agriculture.\" World Economy 26.1 (2003): 97-122.</ref>

===NAFTA and other economic measures===
{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement|Effects of NAFTA on Mexico}}
Carlos Salinas had negotiated Mexico's place in NAFTA, which took effect in January 1994, so Zedillo was the first president to oversee it for his entire term. The Mexican economy suffered following the December 1994 peso crisis, when currency was devalued by 15% and the U.S. intervened to prop up the economy with a multi-billion dollar loan, so that NAFTA under the Zedillo administration got off to a rocky start.  The Mexican GDP was -7% and there were hopes that NAFTA would lift that miserable performance statistic.<ref>Luz María de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1026.</ref>

In the run-up to implementation of NAFTA, Salinas had privatized hundreds of companies. During the Zedillo administration, he privatized [[Rail transport in Mexico#Privatization|the state railway company]], [[:es:Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México|Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México]]. This led to the suspension of passenger service in 1997.

===Electoral reform===
{{see|1997 Mexican legislative election}}
Zedillo saw electoral reform as a key issue for his administration.<ref>Zedillo, Ernesto. “The Right Track: Political and Economic Reform in Mexico.” Harvard International Review, vol. 19, no. 1, 1996, pp. 38–67. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/42762264 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> In January 1995, Zedillo initiated multiparty talks about electoral reform, which resulted in an agreement on how to frame political reform. In July 1996, those talks resulted in the agreement of Mexico's four major parties on a reform package, which was ratified unanimously in legislature.  It created autonomous organizations to oversee elections, made the post of [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|Head of Government of Mexico City]], previously an appointed position, into an elective one, as of July 1997, and created closer oversight of campaign spending. \"Perhaps most crucially, it represents a first step toward consensus among the parties on a set of mutually accepted democratic rules of the game.\"<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1641-42.</ref> The reforms lowered the influence of the PRI and opened opportunities for other parties.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The resurrection of the Mexican left in the 1997 elections: implications for the party system.\" Toward Mexico’s Democratizations: Parties, Campaigns, Elections, and Public Opinion, New York, Routledge (1999).</ref> In the 1997 elections, for the first time the PRI did not win the majority in Congress.  Zedillo was also a strong advocate of federalism as a counterbalance to a centralized system.<ref>Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De León. “Address by Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De León.” Publius, vol. 29, no. 4, 1999, pp. 15–22. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3330905 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

===Foreign relations===
Zedillo sought to forge new ties overseas, including ones with China.<ref>Cornejo, Romer Alejandro. “México y China. Entre La Buena Voluntad y La Competencia.” Foro Internacional, vol. 41, no. 4 (166), 2001, pp. 878–890. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27739097 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>  He made a rhetorical gesture to Africa, but without real effect.<ref>Varela, Hilda. “Crónica De Una Política Inexistente: Las Relaciones Entre México y África, 1994-2000.” Foro Internacional, vol. 41, no. 4 (166), 2001, pp. 912–930. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27739100 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

==2000 Election==
{{See|Mexican general election, 2000}}
The presidential election of 2 July 2000 was a watershed in Mexican history for several reasons. The PRI presidential candidate, [[Francisco Labastida]] was not designated by the sitting president (as all former Presidential nominees from the PRI had been until that point), but by an open internal primary of the party.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The making of the Mexican president, 2000: parties, candidates, and campaign strategy.\" Jorge Domínguez and Lawson (2004): 123-56.</ref> Changes in the electoral rules meant that the government did not control voting as it had previously in the Ministry of the Interior. Elections were now  the jurisdiction of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), with Mexicans having faith that elections would be free and fair.<ref>Wallis, Darren. \"The Mexican Presidential and Congressional Elections of 2000 and Democratic Transition.\" Bulletin of Latin American Research 20.3 (2001): 304-323.</ref> IFE implemented new  procedures regarding campaigns and balloting, with rules for finance, guarantee of the secret ballot, and unbiased counting of votes. Also important were some 10,000 Mexican poll watchers and over 850 foreign observers, including ex-president of the U.S., [[Jimmy Carter]]. [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] leader [[Subcomandante Marcos]] declared that the election was a \"dignified and respectable battleground.\"<ref>Fröhling, Oliver, Carolyn Gallaher, and John Paul Jones, III. \"Imagining the Mexican election.\" Antipode 33.1 (2001): 2</ref> The results of the election were even more historic. For the first time since the founding of Zedillo's party in 1929, an opposition candidate won, a peaceful change from an authoritarian government.<ref>Klesner, Joseph L. \"The end of Mexico's one-party regime.\" PS: Political Science & Politics 34.1 (2001): 107-114.</ref> Zedillo went on national television when the polls closed, declaring that [[Vicente Fox]] had won. In Fox's autobiography he writes, \"There are still those old-guard ''priistas'' who consider Ernesto Zedillo a traitor to his class for his actions on the night of July 2, 2000, as the party boss who betrayed the machine.  But in that moment President Zedillo became a true democrat ... In minutes he preempted any possibility of violent resistance from hard-line ''priistas''. It was an act of electoral integrity that will forever mark the mild-mannered economist as a historic figure of Mexico's peaceful transition to democracy.\"<ref>Vicente Fox and Rob Allyn, ''Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith, and Dreams of a Mexican President''. New York: Viking 2007, pp. 192-93.</ref>

==Post-presidency==

Since leaving office, Zedillo has held many jobs as an economic consultant in many international companies and organizations. He currently is on the faculty at [[Yale University]], where he teaches economics and heads the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization]]. In 2008, a conference on global climate change was convened at Yale, resulting in a published volume edited by Zedillo.<ref>Ernesto Zedillo, ed., ''Global Warming. Looking Beyond Kyoto''.

In 2016, Zedillo co-signed a letter calling for an end to the [[War on Drugs]], along with people like [[Mary J.

===Lawsuit in the U.S. by Indigenous Mexican Plaintiffs===
According to a 2012 ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' article, a group of ten anonymous [[Tzotzil people]] claiming to be survivors of the [[Acteal massacre]] have taken an opportunity to sue former President Zedillo in a civil court in [[Connecticut]], \"seeking about $50 million and a declaration of guilt against Mr Zedillo.\" The victims of the massacre were members of an indigenous-rights group known as [[Las Abejas]]; however, the current president of that organization, Porfirio Arias, claims that the alleged victims were in fact not residents of Acteal at all. This has led commentators to allege the trial to be politically motivated, perhaps by a member of his own political party, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], angry about Zedillo's reforms that led to the party losing power in the [[2000 Mexican presidential election]], after 71 years of continuous political rule.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.economist.com/node/21561904 |title=Mexico and Justice: The trials of Ernesto Zedillo |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date = 1 September 2012|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

The [[United States Department of State]] recommended that President Zedillo be granted [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] due to the actions occurring as part of his official capacity as head of state. This motion is not binding in the US court system, but judges \"generally side with the State Department.\"<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/world/americas/us-moves-to-grant-former-mexican-president-immunity-in-suit.html?ref=ernestozedillo&_r=0|title=U.S. Moves to Grant Former Mexican President Immunity in Suit|author=Randal C. Archibold|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date = 8 September 2012|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

The plaintiffs, who are being represented by Rafferty, Kobert, Tenenholtz, Bounds & Hess may appeal the ruling of U.S. District Judge Michael Shea to sidestep the immunity Zedillo has been granted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/07/22/former-mexican-president-evades-charges-of-massacre-through-immunity/|title=Former Mexican President Evades Charges of Massacre Through Immunity |website=Jdjournal.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2014, the US Supreme Court refused to hear a case against Zedillo on grounds of \"sovereign immunity\" as a former head of state by survivors of the Acteal massacre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015142416/http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 October 2014|title=Supreme Court won't hear suit over Indian massacre in Mexico|date=15 October 2014|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

==Public opinion and legacy==
In a national survey conducted in 2012 by BGC-Excélsior regarding former Presidents, 39% of the respondents considered that the Zedillo administration was \"very good\" or \"good\", 27% responded that it was an \"average\" administration, and 31% responded that it was a \"very bad\" or \"bad\" administration.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beltran |first1=Ulises |title=Zedillo y Fox los ex presidentes de México más reconocidos |url=https://www.imagenradio.com.mx/zedillo-y-fox-los-ex-presidentes-de-mexico-mas-reconocidos |publisher=Imagen Radio |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref>

'''Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León''', ({{IPA-es|eɾˈnesto seˈðiʝo}}; born 27 December 1951) is a Mexican economist and politician. He was [[President of Mexico]] from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 2000, as the last of the uninterrupted 71-year line of Mexican presidents from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI).

During his presidency, he faced the [[Mexican peso crisis|worst economic crisis in Mexico's history]], which started only weeks after he took office.<ref name=\"The Economist 2004\">{{Cite news | title = The peso crisis, ten years on: Tequila slammer | date = 2004-12-29 | work = [[The Economist]] | url = https://www.economist.com/node/3524948 | accessdate = 2014-07-08}}</ref><ref name=\"Molen 2013\">{{Cite news | title = The Tequila crisis in 1994 | date = 2013-09-19 | publisher = [[Rabobank]] | url = http://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2013/september/the-tequila-crisis-in-1994 | accessdate = 2014-07-27 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410090503/https://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2013/september/the-tequila-crisis-in-1994/ | archivedate = 2015-04-10 }}</ref> He distanced himself from his predecessor [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]], blaming his policies for the crisis (although President Zedillo himself did not deviate from the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies of his two predecessors),<ref name=\"The Economist 2004\"/><ref>{{Cite news | title = Salinas vs. Zedillo | publisher = La Jornada | url = http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/10/11/index.php?section=politica&article=020a1pol | accessdate = 2018-03-09 |language = Spanish}}</ref> and oversaw the arrest of his brother [[Raúl Salinas de Gortari]].<ref>Salinas' Brother Charged in Mexican Assassination ''New York Times'' March 1, 1995 [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/world/salinas-s-brother-charged-in-mexican-assassination.html]</ref> His administration was also marked, among other things, by renewed clashes with the [[EZLN]] and the [[Popular Revolutionary Army]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017111100/http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 October 2013|title=Wayback Machine|date=17 October 2013|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref> the controversial implementation of [[Fobaproa]] to rescue the national banking system;<ref>Solís, L.

Although Zedillo's policies allowed Mexico to get out of the economic crisis and regain growth, popular discontent with seven decades of PRI rule led to the party losing, for the first time, its legislative majority [[1997 Mexican legislative election|in the 1997 elections]],<ref name=DN>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p453 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref> and in the [[2000 Mexican general election|2000 elections]] the right-wing opposition [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]]'s candidate [[Vicente Fox]] won the Presidency of the Republic, putting an end to 71 years of uninterrupted PRI rule.<ref>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p475 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref> Zedillo's admission of the PRI's defeat and his peaceful handing of power to his successor improved his image in the final months of his administration, and he left office with an approval rating of 60%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Aznarez |first1=Juan Jesus |title=Zedillo abandona la presidencia con una popularidad del 60% |url=https://elpais.com/diario/2000/12/01/internacional/975625205_850215.html |accessdate=9 August 2019 |publisher=El Pais |date=1 December 2000}}</ref>

Since the ending of his term as president in 2000, Zedillo has been a leading voice on globalization, especially its impact on relations between developed and developing nations.

He is currently Director of the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization|Center for the Study of Globalization]] at [[Yale University]], is the Latin American co-chair of the [[Inter-American Dialogue]], and is on the board of directors of [[Citigroup]].

==Early life and education==
Ernesto Zedillo was born on 27 December 1951 in [[Mexico City]]. His parents were Rodolfo Zedillo Castillo, a mechanic, and Martha Alicia Ponce de León. Seeking better job and education opportunities for their children, his parents moved to [[Mexicali]], [[Baja California]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In 1965, at the age of 14, he returned to Mexico City. In 1969 he entered the [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional|National Polytechnic Institute]], financing his studies by working in the National Army and Navy Bank (later known as ''Banjército''). He graduated as an economist in 1972 and began lecturing. It was among his first group of students that he met his wife, [[First Lady of Mexico|Nilda Patricia Velasco]], with whom he has five children: Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos (formerly married to conductor [[Alondra de la Parra]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/332332 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403181822/http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/332332 |archive-date=3 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), Nilda Patricia and Rodrigo.

In 1974, he pursued his master's and PhD studies at [[Yale University]]. His doctoral thesis was titled ''Mexico's Public External Debt: Recent History and Future Growth Related to Oil''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Political career===
Zedillo began working in the [[Bank of Mexico]] (Mexico's central bank) as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, where he supported the adoption of macroeconomic policies for the country's improvement.
By 1987, he was named deputy-secretary of Planning and Budget Control in the Secretariat of Budget and Planning. In 1988, at the age of 36, he headed that secretariat. During his term as Secretary, Zedillo launched a Science and Technology reform.

In 1992, he was appointed [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Education]] by president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]].  During his tenure in this post, he was in charge of the revision the Mexican public school textbooks.  The changes, which took a softer line on foreign investment and the Porfiriato, among other topics, were highly controversial and the textbooks were withdrawn.<ref>Gilbert, Dennis. “Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.” Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 271–297. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1052017 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> A year later he resigned to run the electoral campaign of [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]'s presidential candidate.

==1994 presidential campaign==
{{main|1994 Mexican general election}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin at the Millennium Summit 6-8 September 2000-12.jpg|left|thumb|230px|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Ernesto Zedillo, at the Millennium Summit, 2000]]

In 1994, after [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]]'s assassination, Zedillo became one of the few [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] members eligible under Mexican law to take his place, since he had not occupied public office for some time.

The opposition blamed Colosio's murder on Salinas. Although the PRI's presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president, and thus [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] had originally been [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Salinas]]' candidate, their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which Colosio said that [[Mexico]] had many problems. It is also notable that the assassination took place after Colosio visited the members of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] in Chiapas and promised to open dialogue, something the PRI opposed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

After Colosio's murder, this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the president.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The choice of Zedillo was interpreted as Salinas' way of bypassing the strong Mexican political tradition of non-reelection and retaining real power, since Zedillo was not really a politician, but an economist (like Salinas), who clearly lacked the president's political talent and influence. It is unclear if Salinas had attempted to control Colosio, who was generally considered at that time to be a far better candidate.

Zedillo ran against [[Diego Fernández de Cevallos]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] and second-timer [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]] of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. He won with 48.69% of popular vote, and became the last president to distinguish the 70-year PRI dynasty in México during the 20th century.

==Presidency (1994–2000)==

At age 43, Zedillo assumed the presidency on 1 December 1994 at the [[Legislative Palace of San Lázaro]], taking oath before the [[Congress of the Union]] presided by the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|deputy president]] Carlota Vargas Garza. Zedillo's electoral victory was perceived as clean, but he came to office as an accidental candidate with no political base of his own and no experience. During the first part of his presidency, he took inconsistent policy positions and there were rumors that he would resign or that there would be a coup d'état against him, which caused turmoil in financial markets.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\">Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p.1641</ref>

===Cabinet===
Zedillo's [[Cabinet of Ernesto Zedillo|cabinet]] needed to have members who could deal with crises. Over the course of his presidency, he had four as [[Minister of the Interior]], [[Esteban Moctezuma]], who dealt with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]; [[Emilio Chuayffet]], who resigned following the [[Acteal massacre]]; [[Francisco Labastida]], who won the primary to determine the 2000 PRI presidential candidate; and [[Diódoro Carrasco Altamirano]], who dealt with the strike at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].

===Financial Crisis of December 1994===
{{Main|Mexican peso crisis}}
A few days after taking office, one of the biggest economic crisis in Mexican history hit the country. Although it was outgoing President Salinas who was mainly blamed for the crisis, Salinas claimed that President Zedillo made a mistake by changing the economic policies held by his administration. Zedillo devalued the peso by 15%, which prompted the near-collapse of the financial system.<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\", p. 1641.</ref> [[Mexican peso crisis|The crisis]] ended after a series of reforms and actions led by Zedillo. US president [[Bill Clinton]] granted a US$20&nbsp;billion loan to Mexico, which helped in one of Zedillo's initiatives to rescue the banking system.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | title = Clinton authorizes loan to Mexico | publisher = [[History (U.S. TV channel)]] | date = 31 January 1995 | accessdate = 27 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180324010125/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | archive-date = 24 March 2018 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===Break with Salinas===
Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who was vaulted to prominence with the assassination of Colosio. The conflict between Zedillo and Salinas marked the early part of Zedillo's presidency.<ref>Fuentes, Carlos. “Coalticue's Skirt: Hidden Aspects of Mexico's Political Rivalry in 1995.” The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 2, no. 2, 1995, pp. 175–180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24590093 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> As with De la Madrid and Salinas, Zedillo had never been elected to office and had no experience in politics. His performance as a candidate was lackluster, but the outbreak of violence in Chiapas and the shock of the Colosio assassination swayed voters to support the PRI candidate in the 1994 election. In office, Zedillo was perceived as a puppet-president with Salinas following the model of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obregón]]. In order to consolidate his own power in the presidency, Zedillo had to assert his independence from Salinas. On 28 February 1995 Zedillo ordered the arrest of the ex-president's older brother [[Raúl Salinas]] for the September 1994 murder of PRI General Secretary [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]]  marked a decisive break between Zedillo and Salinas.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\"/>

===Zapatista Crisis===
{{Main|1995 Zapatista Crisis}}
Mexico had been in turmoil since January 1994, with the initial Zapatista rebellion and two political assassinations. The presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] was assassinated in March 1994, and his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo replaced him candidate a few days later. The other high-profile assassination, that of PRI Secretary General [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], brother-in-law of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in September 1994, laid bare political rivalries within the PRI. In order to give credibility to the investigations of those political crimes and grant \"a healthy distance\", president Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia a member of the opposition Political Party [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] as [[Attorney General of Mexico]].  Zedillo inherited the rebellion in Chiapas, but it was up to his administration to handle it.

On 5 January 1995, the Secretary of Interior [[Esteban Moctezuma]] started a secret meeting process with [[Subcomandante Marcos|Marcos]] called \"Steps Toward Peace\" [[Chiapas]]. Talks seemed promising for an agreement, but Zedillo backed away, apparently because the military was not in accord with the government's apparent \"acceptance of the Zapatistas' control over much of Chiapas territory.\"<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', p. 242.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=330331|title=Zedillo rompió acuerdo de paz con el EZLN: Esteban Moctezuma - Proceso|date=11 January 2013|website=Proceso.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|title=El Universal - Opinion - Renuncia en Gobernación|website=Eluniversalmas.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802123734/http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In February 1995, the Mexican government identified the masked Subcomandante Marcos as Rafael Sebastián Guillén, a former professor at the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] in Mexico City. Metaphorically unmasking Marcos and identifying him as a non-indigenous  urban intellectual turned-terrorist of  was the government's attempt to demystify and delegitimize the Zapatistas in public opinion. The army was prepared to move against Zapatista strongholds and capture Marcos.<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', pp. 244-45</ref> The government decided to reopen negotiations with the Zapatistas. On 10 March 1995 President Zedillo and Secretary of the Interior Moctezuma signed the Presidential Decree for the Dialog, the Reconciliation and a peace with dignity in Chiapas law, which was discussed and approved by the Mexican Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx/pages/chiapas/docs/ley-dialogo.html|title=Client Validation|website=Zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102231548/http://zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx/pages/chiapas/docs/ley-dialogo.html|archive-date=2 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In April 1995, the government and the Zapatistas began secret talks to find an end to the conflict.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/ezln/cronologia.htm|title=Cronologia del Conflicto EZLN|website=Latinamericanstudies.org|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>  In February 1996, the [[San Andrés Accords]] were signed by the government and the Zapatistas.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070206140008/http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/americas/mexico/SanAndres.html accessed 23 March 2019</ref> In May 1996, Zapatistas imprisoned for terrorism were released.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/1996/06/07/croni.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105203601/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/1996/06/07/croni.html |archive-date=5 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In December 1997, indigenous peasants were murdered in an incident known as the [[Acteal massacre]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/25/opinion/death-in-chiapas.html accessed 23 March 2019</ref> Survivors of the massacre sued Zedillo in U.S., but the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the suit on the basis of his immunity as a head of state.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20141015142416/http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

===Church-state relations===

Salinas had gained support of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1988 elections and had pushed through a series of constitutional changes that significantly changed church-state relations.  However, on February 11, 1995, Zedillo ignited a crisis with the Roman Catholic Church, hurting, recently restored [[Mexican government|Mexico]]–[[Holy See]] diplomatic relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/10/03/index.php?section=opinion&article=024a1pol|title=A 15 años de relaciones entre México y el Vaticano |website=Jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> Relations had already been damaged because of the May 24, 1993 political assassination of the Guadalajara Cardinal [[Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo]] and lack of government progress on solving the murder by the [[Attorney General of Mexico]].

===Poverty alleviation===
Zedillo's presidential motto was ''Bienestar para tu familia'' (\"Well-being for your family\"). He created the poverty alleviation program ''Progresa'', which subsidized the poorest families in Mexico, provided that their children went to school. It replaced the Salinas administration's PRONASOL, deemed too politicized.<ref>Rocha Menocal, A. (2001). \"Do Old Habits Die Hard? A Statistical Exploration of the Politicisation of Progresa, Mexico's Latest Federal Poverty-Alleviation Programme, under the Zedillo Administration.\" Journal of Latin American Studies, 33(3), 513-538. doi:10.1017/S0022216X01006113 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> It was later renamed ''[[Oportunidades]]'' (''Opportunities'') by president [[Vicente Fox]]. The parastatal organization [[:es:Compañía Nacional de Subsistencias Populares|CONASUPO]], which was designed to supply food and provide food security to the poor was phased out in 1999, resulting in higher food prices.<ref>Yunez–Naude, Antonio. \"The dismantling of CONASUPO, a Mexican state trader in agriculture.\" World Economy 26.1 (2003): 97-122.</ref>

===NAFTA and other economic measures===
{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement|Effects of NAFTA on Mexico}}
Carlos Salinas had negotiated Mexico's place in NAFTA, which took effect in January 1994, so Zedillo was the first president to oversee it for his entire term. The Mexican economy suffered following the December 1994 peso crisis, when currency was devalued by 15% and the U.S. intervened to prop up the economy with a multi-billion dollar loan, so that NAFTA under the Zedillo administration got off to a rocky start.  The Mexican GDP was -7% and there were hopes that NAFTA would lift that miserable performance statistic.<ref>Luz María de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1026.</ref>

In the run-up to implementation of NAFTA, Salinas had privatized hundreds of companies. During the Zedillo administration, he privatized [[Rail transport in Mexico#Privatization|the state railway company]], [[:es:Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México|Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México]]. This led to the suspension of passenger service in 1997.

===Electoral reform===
{{see|1997 Mexican legislative election}}
Zedillo saw electoral reform as a key issue for his administration.<ref>Zedillo, Ernesto. “The Right Track: Political and Economic Reform in Mexico.” Harvard International Review, vol. 19, no. 1, 1996, pp. 38–67. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/42762264 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> In January 1995, Zedillo initiated multiparty talks about electoral reform, which resulted in an agreement on how to frame political reform. In July 1996, those talks resulted in the agreement of Mexico's four major parties on a reform package, which was ratified unanimously in legislature.  It created autonomous organizations to oversee elections, made the post of [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|Head of Government of Mexico City]], previously an appointed position, into an elective one, as of July 1997, and created closer oversight of campaign spending. \"Perhaps most crucially, it represents a first step toward consensus among the parties on a set of mutually accepted democratic rules of the game.\"<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1641-42.</ref> The reforms lowered the influence of the PRI and opened opportunities for other parties.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The resurrection of the Mexican left in the 1997 elections: implications for the party system.\" Toward Mexico’s Democratizations: Parties, Campaigns, Elections, and Public Opinion, New York, Routledge (1999).</ref> In the 1997 elections, for the first time the PRI did not win the majority in Congress.  Zedillo was also a strong advocate of federalism as a counterbalance to a centralized system.<ref>Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De León. “Address by Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De León.” Publius, vol. 29, no. 4, 1999, pp. 15–22. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3330905 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

===Foreign relations===
Zedillo sought to forge new ties overseas, including ones with China.<ref>Cornejo, Romer Alejandro. “México y China. Entre La Buena Voluntad y La Competencia.” Foro Internacional, vol. 41, no. 4 (166), 2001, pp. 878–890. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27739097 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>  He made a rhetorical gesture to Africa, but without real effect.<ref>Varela, Hilda. “Crónica De Una Política Inexistente: Las Relaciones Entre México y África, 1994-2000.” Foro Internacional, vol. 41, no. 4 (166), 2001, pp. 912–930. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27739100 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

==2000 Election==
{{See|Mexican general election, 2000}}
The presidential election of 2 July 2000 was a watershed in Mexican history for several reasons. The PRI presidential candidate, [[Francisco Labastida]] was not designated by the sitting president (as all former Presidential nominees from the PRI had been until that point), but by an open internal primary of the party.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The making of the Mexican president, 2000: parties, candidates, and campaign strategy.\" Jorge Domínguez and Lawson (2004): 123-56.</ref> Changes in the electoral rules meant that the government did not control voting as it had previously in the Ministry of the Interior. Elections were now  the jurisdiction of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), with Mexicans having faith that elections would be free and fair.<ref>Wallis, Darren. \"The Mexican Presidential and Congressional Elections of 2000 and Democratic Transition.\" Bulletin of Latin American Research 20.3 (2001): 304-323.</ref> IFE implemented new  procedures regarding campaigns and balloting, with rules for finance, guarantee of the secret ballot, and unbiased counting of votes. Also important were some 10,000 Mexican poll watchers and over 850 foreign observers, including ex-president of the U.S., [[Jimmy Carter]]. [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] leader [[Subcomandante Marcos]] declared that the election was a \"dignified and respectable battleground.\"<ref>Fröhling, Oliver, Carolyn Gallaher, and John Paul Jones, III. \"Imagining the Mexican election.\" Antipode 33.1 (2001): 2</ref> The results of the election were even more historic. For the first time since the founding of Zedillo's party in 1929, an opposition candidate won, a peaceful change from an authoritarian government.<ref>Klesner, Joseph L. \"The end of Mexico's one-party regime.\" PS: Political Science & Politics 34.1 (2001): 107-114.</ref> Zedillo went on national television when the polls closed, declaring that [[Vicente Fox]] had won. In Fox's autobiography he writes, \"There are still those old-guard ''priistas'' who consider Ernesto Zedillo a traitor to his class for his actions on the night of July 2, 2000, as the party boss who betrayed the machine.  But in that moment President Zedillo became a true democrat ... In minutes he preempted any possibility of violent resistance from hard-line ''priistas''. It was an act of electoral integrity that will forever mark the mild-mannered economist as a historic figure of Mexico's peaceful transition to democracy.\"<ref>Vicente Fox and Rob Allyn, ''Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith, and Dreams of a Mexican President''. New York: Viking 2007, pp. 192-93.</ref>

==Post-presidency==
[[File:Ernesto Zedillo World Economic Forum (2008).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Zedillo at the [[World Economic Forum]] Summit on the Global Agenda 2008 in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]].]]
Since leaving office, Zedillo has held many jobs as an economic consultant in many international companies and organizations. He currently is on the faculty at [[Yale University]], where he teaches economics and heads the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization]]. In 2008, a conference on global climate change was convened at Yale, resulting in a published volume edited by Zedillo.<ref>Ernesto Zedillo, ed., ''Global Warming. Looking Beyond Kyoto''.

In 2009, Zedillo headed an external review of the [[World Bank Group]]'s governance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22360012~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html|title=Outside Review Supports World Bank Group Reform| date=21 October 2009|website=Web.worldbank.org|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2016, Zedillo co-signed a letter calling for an end to the [[War on Drugs]], along with people like [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[George Soros]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2016/04/over-1000-leaders-worldwide-call-end-disastrous-drug-war-ahead-un-special-session|title=Over 1,000 Leaders Worldwide Slam Failed Prohibitionist Drug Policies, Call for Systemic Reform|website=Drug Policy Alliance}}</ref>

===Lawsuit in the U.S. by Indigenous Mexican Plaintiffs===
According to a 2012 ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' article, a group of ten anonymous [[Tzotzil people]] claiming to be survivors of the [[Acteal massacre]] have taken an opportunity to sue former President Zedillo in a civil court in [[Connecticut]], \"seeking about $50 million and a declaration of guilt against Mr Zedillo.\" The victims of the massacre were members of an indigenous-rights group known as [[Las Abejas]]; however, the current president of that organization, Porfirio Arias, claims that the alleged victims were in fact not residents of Acteal at all. This has led commentators to allege the trial to be politically motivated, perhaps by a member of his own political party, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], angry about Zedillo's reforms that led to the party losing power in the [[2000 Mexican presidential election]], after 71 years of continuous political rule.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.economist.com/node/21561904 |title=Mexico and Justice: The trials of Ernesto Zedillo |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date = 1 September 2012|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

The [[United States Department of State]] recommended that President Zedillo be granted [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] due to the actions occurring as part of his official capacity as head of state. This motion is not binding in the US court system, but judges \"generally side with the State Department.\"<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/world/americas/us-moves-to-grant-former-mexican-president-immunity-in-suit.html?ref=ernestozedillo&_r=0|title=U.S. Moves to Grant Former Mexican President Immunity in Suit|author=Randal C. Archibold|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date = 8 September 2012|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

The plaintiffs, who are being represented by Rafferty, Kobert, Tenenholtz, Bounds & Hess may appeal the ruling of U.S. District Judge Michael Shea to sidestep the immunity Zedillo has been granted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/07/22/former-mexican-president-evades-charges-of-massacre-through-immunity/|title=Former Mexican President Evades Charges of Massacre Through Immunity |website=Jdjournal.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2014, the US Supreme Court refused to hear a case against Zedillo on grounds of \"sovereign immunity\" as a former head of state by survivors of the Acteal massacre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015142416/http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 October 2014|title=Supreme Court won't hear suit over Indian massacre in Mexico|date=15 October 2014|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

==Public opinion and legacy==
In a national survey conducted in 2012 by BGC-Excélsior regarding former Presidents, 39% of the respondents considered that the Zedillo administration was \"very good\" or \"good\", 27% responded that it was an \"average\" administration, and 31% responded that it was a \"very bad\" or \"bad\" administration.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beltran |first1=Ulises |title=Zedillo y Fox los ex presidentes de México más reconocidos |url=https://www.imagenradio.com.mx/zedillo-y-fox-los-ex-presidentes-de-mexico-mas-reconocidos |publisher=Imagen Radio |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref>

'''Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León''', ({{IPA-es|eɾˈnesto seˈðiʝo}}; born 27 December 1951) is a Mexican economist and politician. He was [[President of Mexico]] from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 2000, as the last of the uninterrupted 71-year line of Mexican presidents from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI).

During his presidency, he faced the [[Mexican peso crisis|worst economic crisis in Mexico's history]], which started only weeks after he took office.<ref name=\"The Economist 2004\">{{Cite news | title = The peso crisis, ten years on: Tequila slammer | date = 2004-12-29 | work = [[The Economist]] | url = https://www.economist.com/node/3524948 | accessdate = 2014-07-08}}</ref><ref name=\"Molen 2013\">{{Cite news | title = The Tequila crisis in 1994 | date = 2013-09-19 | publisher = [[Rabobank]] | url = http://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2013/september/the-tequila-crisis-in-1994 | accessdate = 2014-07-27 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410090503/https://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2013/september/the-tequila-crisis-in-1994/ | archivedate = 2015-04-10 }}</ref> He distanced himself from his predecessor [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]], blaming his policies for the crisis (although President Zedillo himself did not deviate from the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies of his two predecessors),<ref name=\"The Economist 2004\"/><ref>{{Cite news | title = Salinas vs. Zedillo | publisher = La Jornada | url = http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/10/11/index.php?section=politica&article=020a1pol | accessdate = 2018-03-09 |language = Spanish}}</ref> and oversaw the arrest of his brother [[Raúl Salinas de Gortari]].<ref>Salinas' Brother Charged in Mexican Assassination ''New York Times'' March 1, 1995 [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/world/salinas-s-brother-charged-in-mexican-assassination.html]</ref> His administration was also marked, among other things, by renewed clashes with the [[EZLN]] and the [[Popular Revolutionary Army]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017111100/http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 October 2013|title=Wayback Machine|date=17 October 2013|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref> the controversial implementation of [[Fobaproa]] to rescue the national banking system;<ref>Solís, L.

Although Zedillo's policies allowed Mexico to get out of the economic crisis and regain growth, popular discontent with seven decades of PRI rule led to the party losing, for the first time, its legislative majority [[1997 Mexican legislative election|in the 1997 elections]],<ref name=DN>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p453 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref> and in the [[2000 Mexican general election|2000 elections]] the right-wing opposition [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]]'s candidate [[Vicente Fox]] won the Presidency of the Republic, putting an end to 71 years of uninterrupted PRI rule.<ref>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p475 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref> Zedillo's admission of the PRI's defeat and his peaceful handing of power to his successor improved his image in the final months of his administration, and he left office with an approval rating of 60%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Aznarez |first1=Juan Jesus |title=Zedillo abandona la presidencia con una popularidad del 60% |url=https://elpais.com/diario/2000/12/01/internacional/975625205_850215.html |accessdate=9 August 2019 |publisher=El Pais |date=1 December 2000}}</ref>

Since the ending of his term as president in 2000, Zedillo has been a leading voice on globalization, especially its impact on relations between developed and developing nations.

He is currently Director of the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization|Center for the Study of Globalization]] at [[Yale University]], is the Latin American co-chair of the [[Inter-American Dialogue]], and is on the board of directors of [[Citigroup]].

==Early life and education==
Ernesto Zedillo was born on 27 December 1951 in [[Mexico City]]. His parents were Rodolfo Zedillo Castillo, a mechanic, and Martha Alicia Ponce de León. Seeking better job and education opportunities for their children, his parents moved to [[Mexicali]], [[Baja California]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In 1965, at the age of 14, he returned to Mexico City. In 1969 he entered the [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional|National Polytechnic Institute]], financing his studies by working in the National Army and Navy Bank (later known as ''Banjército''). He graduated as an economist in 1972 and began lecturing. It was among his first group of students that he met his wife, [[First Lady of Mexico|Nilda Patricia Velasco]], with whom he has five children: Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos (formerly married to conductor [[Alondra de la Parra]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/332332 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403181822/http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/332332 |archive-date=3 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), Nilda Patricia and Rodrigo.

In 1974, he pursued his master's and PhD studies at [[Yale University]]. His doctoral thesis was titled ''Mexico's Public External Debt: Recent History and Future Growth Related to Oil''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Political career===
Zedillo began working in the [[Bank of Mexico]] (Mexico's central bank) as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, where he supported the adoption of macroeconomic policies for the country's improvement.
By 1987, he was named deputy-secretary of Planning and Budget Control in the Secretariat of Budget and Planning. In 1988, at the age of 36, he headed that secretariat. During his term as Secretary, Zedillo launched a Science and Technology reform.

In 1992, he was appointed [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Education]] by president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]].  During his tenure in this post, he was in charge of the revision the Mexican public school textbooks.  The changes, which took a softer line on foreign investment and the Porfiriato, among other topics, were highly controversial and the textbooks were withdrawn.<ref>Gilbert, Dennis. “Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.” Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 271–297. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1052017 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> A year later he resigned to run the electoral campaign of [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]'s presidential candidate.

==1994 presidential campaign==
{{main|1994 Mexican general election}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin at the Millennium Summit 6-8 September 2000-12.jpg|left|thumb|230px|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Ernesto Zedillo, at the Millennium Summit, 2000]]

In 1994, after [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]]'s assassination, Zedillo became one of the few [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] members eligible under Mexican law to take his place, since he had not occupied public office for some time.

The opposition blamed Colosio's murder on Salinas. Although the PRI's presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president, and thus [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] had originally been [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Salinas]]' candidate, their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which Colosio said that [[Mexico]] had many problems. It is also notable that the assassination took place after Colosio visited the members of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] in Chiapas and promised to open dialogue, something the PRI opposed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

After Colosio's murder, this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the president.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The choice of Zedillo was interpreted as Salinas' way of bypassing the strong Mexican political tradition of non-reelection and retaining real power, since Zedillo was not really a politician, but an economist (like Salinas), who clearly lacked the president's political talent and influence. It is unclear if Salinas had attempted to control Colosio, who was generally considered at that time to be a far better candidate.

Zedillo ran against [[Diego Fernández de Cevallos]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] and second-timer [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]] of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. He won with 48.69% of popular vote, and became the last president to distinguish the 70-year PRI dynasty in México during the 20th century.

==Presidency (1994–2000)==

At age 43, Zedillo assumed the presidency on 1 December 1994 at the [[Legislative Palace of San Lázaro]], taking oath before the [[Congress of the Union]] presided by the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|deputy president]] Carlota Vargas Garza. Zedillo's electoral victory was perceived as clean, but he came to office as an accidental candidate with no political base of his own and no experience. During the first part of his presidency, he took inconsistent policy positions and there were rumors that he would resign or that there would be a coup d'état against him, which caused turmoil in financial markets.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\">Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p.1641</ref>

===Cabinet===
Zedillo's [[Cabinet of Ernesto Zedillo|cabinet]] needed to have members who could deal with crises. Over the course of his presidency, he had four as [[Minister of the Interior]], [[Esteban Moctezuma]], who dealt with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]; [[Emilio Chuayffet]], who resigned following the [[Acteal massacre]]; [[Francisco Labastida]], who won the primary to determine the 2000 PRI presidential candidate; and [[Diódoro Carrasco Altamirano]], who dealt with the strike at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].

===Financial Crisis of December 1994===
{{Main|Mexican peso crisis}}
A few days after taking office, one of the biggest economic crisis in Mexican history hit the country. Although it was outgoing President Salinas who was mainly blamed for the crisis, Salinas claimed that President Zedillo made a mistake by changing the economic policies held by his administration. Zedillo devalued the peso by 15%, which prompted the near-collapse of the financial system.<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\", p. 1641.</ref> [[Mexican peso crisis|The crisis]] ended after a series of reforms and actions led by Zedillo. US president [[Bill Clinton]] granted a US$20&nbsp;billion loan to Mexico, which helped in one of Zedillo's initiatives to rescue the banking system.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | title = Clinton authorizes loan to Mexico | publisher = [[History (U.S. TV channel)]] | date = 31 January 1995 | accessdate = 27 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180324010125/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | archive-date = 24 March 2018 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===Break with Salinas===
Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who was vaulted to prominence with the assassination of Colosio. The conflict between Zedillo and Salinas marked the early part of Zedillo's presidency.<ref>Fuentes, Carlos. “Coalticue's Skirt: Hidden Aspects of Mexico's Political Rivalry in 1995.” The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 2, no. 2, 1995, pp. 175–180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24590093 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> As with De la Madrid and Salinas, Zedillo had never been elected to office and had no experience in politics. His performance as a candidate was lackluster, but the outbreak of violence in Chiapas and the shock of the Colosio assassination swayed voters to support the PRI candidate in the 1994 election. In office, Zedillo was perceived as a puppet-president with Salinas following the model of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obregón]]. In order to consolidate his own power in the presidency, Zedillo had to assert his independence from Salinas. On 28 February 1995 Zedillo ordered the arrest of the ex-president's older brother [[Raúl Salinas]] for the September 1994 murder of PRI General Secretary [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]]  marked a decisive break between Zedillo and Salinas.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\"/>

===Zapatista Crisis===
{{Main|1995 Zapatista Crisis}}
Mexico had been in turmoil since January 1994, with the initial Zapatista rebellion and two political assassinations. The presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] was assassinated in March 1994, and his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo replaced him candidate a few days later. The other high-profile assassination, that of PRI Secretary General [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], brother-in-law of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in September 1994, laid bare political rivalries within the PRI. In order to give credibility to the investigations of those political crimes and grant \"a healthy distance\", president Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia a member of the opposition Political Party [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] as [[Attorney General of Mexico]].  Zedillo inherited the rebellion in Chiapas, but it was up to his administration to handle it.

On 5 January 1995, the Secretary of Interior [[Esteban Moctezuma]] started a secret meeting process with [[Subcomandante Marcos|Marcos]] called \"Steps Toward Peace\" [[Chiapas]]. Talks seemed promising for an agreement, but Zedillo backed away, apparently because the military was not in accord with the government's apparent \"acceptance of the Zapatistas' control over much of Chiapas territory.\"<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', p. 242.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=330331|title=Zedillo rompió acuerdo de paz con el EZLN: Esteban Moctezuma - Proceso|date=11 January 2013|website=Proceso.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|title=El Universal - Opinion - Renuncia en Gobernación|website=Eluniversalmas.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802123734/http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In February 1995, the Mexican government identified the masked Subcomandante Marcos as Rafael Sebastián Guillén, a former professor at the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] in Mexico City.

The army was prepared to move against Zapatista strongholds and capture Marcos.<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', pp. 244-45</ref> The government decided to reopen negotiations with the Zapatistas.

===Church-state relations===
[[File:Oscar_Vega_y_Ernesto_Zedillo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Oscar Vega and the President Ernesto Zedillo in 1998.]]
Salinas had gained support of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1988 elections and had pushed through a series of constitutional changes that significantly changed church-state relations.  However, on February 11, 1995, Zedillo ignited a crisis with the Roman Catholic Church, hurting, recently restored [[Mexican government|Mexico]]–[[Holy See]] diplomatic relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/10/03/index.php?section=opinion&article=024a1pol|title=A 15 años de relaciones entre México y el Vaticano |website=Jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> Relations had already been damaged because of the May 24, 1993 political assassination of the Guadalajara Cardinal [[Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo]] and lack of government progress on solving the murder by the [[Attorney General of Mexico]].

===Poverty alleviation===
Zedillo's presidential motto was ''Bienestar para tu familia'' (\"Well-being for your family\"). He created the poverty alleviation program ''Progresa'', which subsidized the poorest families in Mexico, provided that their children went to school. It replaced the Salinas administration's PRONASOL, deemed too politicized.<ref>Rocha Menocal, A. (2001). \"Do Old Habits Die Hard? A Statistical Exploration of the Politicisation of Progresa, Mexico's Latest Federal Poverty-Alleviation Programme, under the Zedillo Administration.\" Journal of Latin American Studies, 33(3), 513-538. doi:10.1017/S0022216X01006113 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> It was later renamed ''[[Oportunidades]]'' (''Opportunities'') by president [[Vicente Fox]]. The parastatal organization [[:es:Compañía Nacional de Subsistencias Populares|CONASUPO]], which was designed to supply food and provide food security to the poor was phased out in 1999, resulting in higher food prices.<ref>Yunez–Naude, Antonio. \"The dismantling of CONASUPO, a Mexican state trader in agriculture.\" World Economy 26.1 (2003): 97-122.</ref>

===NAFTA and other economic measures===
{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement|Effects of NAFTA on Mexico}}
Carlos Salinas had negotiated Mexico's place in NAFTA, which took effect in January 1994, so Zedillo was the first president to oversee it for his entire term. The Mexican economy suffered following the December 1994 peso crisis, when currency was devalued by 15% and the U.S. intervened to prop up the economy with a multi-billion dollar loan, so that NAFTA under the Zedillo administration got off to a rocky start.  The Mexican GDP was -7% and there were hopes that NAFTA would lift that miserable performance statistic.<ref>Luz María de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1026.</ref>

In the run-up to implementation of NAFTA, Salinas had privatized hundreds of companies. During the Zedillo administration, he privatized [[Rail transport in Mexico#Privatization|the state railway company]], [[:es:Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México|Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México]]. This led to the suspension of passenger service in 1997.

===Electoral reform===
{{see|1997 Mexican legislative election}}
Zedillo saw electoral reform as a key issue for his administration.<ref>Zedillo, Ernesto. “The Right Track: Political and Economic Reform in Mexico.” Harvard International Review, vol. 19, no. 1, 1996, pp. 38–67. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/42762264 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> In January 1995, Zedillo initiated multiparty talks about electoral reform, which resulted in an agreement on how to frame political reform. In July 1996, those talks resulted in the agreement of Mexico's four major parties on a reform package, which was ratified unanimously in legislature.  It created autonomous organizations to oversee elections, made the post of [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|Head of Government of Mexico City]], previously an appointed position, into an elective one, as of July 1997, and created closer oversight of campaign spending. \"Perhaps most crucially, it represents a first step toward consensus among the parties on a set of mutually accepted democratic rules of the game.\"<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1641-42.</ref> The reforms lowered the influence of the PRI and opened opportunities for other parties.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The resurrection of the Mexican left in the 1997 elections: implications for the party system.\" Toward Mexico’s Democratizations: Parties, Campaigns, Elections, and Public Opinion, New York, Routledge (1999).</ref> In the 1997 elections, for the first time the PRI did not win the majority in Congress.  Zedillo was also a strong advocate of federalism as a counterbalance to a centralized system.<ref>Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De León. “Address by Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De León.” Publius, vol. 29, no. 4, 1999, pp. 15–22. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3330905 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

===Foreign relations===
Zedillo sought to forge new ties overseas, including ones with China.<ref>Cornejo, Romer Alejandro. “México y China. Entre La Buena Voluntad y La Competencia.” Foro Internacional, vol. 41, no. 4 (166), 2001, pp. 878–890. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27739097 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>  He made a rhetorical gesture to Africa, but without real effect.<ref>Varela, Hilda. “Crónica De Una Política Inexistente: Las Relaciones Entre México y África, 1994-2000.” Foro Internacional, vol. 41, no. 4 (166), 2001, pp. 912–930. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27739100 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

==2000 Election==
{{See|Mexican general election, 2000}}
The presidential election of 2 July 2000 was a watershed in Mexican history for several reasons. The PRI presidential candidate, [[Francisco Labastida]] was not designated by the sitting president (as all former Presidential nominees from the PRI had been until that point), but by an open internal primary of the party.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The making of the Mexican president, 2000: parties, candidates, and campaign strategy.\" Jorge Domínguez and Lawson (2004): 123-56.</ref> Changes in the electoral rules meant that the government did not control voting as it had previously in the Ministry of the Interior. Elections were now  the jurisdiction of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), with Mexicans having faith that elections would be free and fair.<ref>Wallis, Darren. \"The Mexican Presidential and Congressional Elections of 2000 and Democratic Transition.\" Bulletin of Latin American Research 20.3 (2001): 304-323.</ref> IFE implemented new  procedures regarding campaigns and balloting, with rules for finance, guarantee of the secret ballot, and unbiased counting of votes. Also important were some 10,000 Mexican poll watchers and over 850 foreign observers, including ex-president of the U.S., [[Jimmy Carter]].

Since leaving office, Zedillo has held many jobs as an economic consultant in many international companies and organizations. He currently is on the faculty at [[Yale University]], where he teaches economics and heads the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization]]. In 2008, a conference on global climate change was convened at Yale, resulting in a published volume edited by Zedillo.<ref>Ernesto Zedillo, ed., ''Global Warming. Looking Beyond Kyoto''.

In 2009, Zedillo headed an external review of the [[World Bank Group]]'s governance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22360012~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html|title=Outside Review Supports World Bank Group Reform| date=21 October 2009|website=Web.worldbank.org|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2016, Zedillo co-signed a letter calling for an end to the [[War on Drugs]], along with people like [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[George Soros]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2016/04/over-1000-leaders-worldwide-call-end-disastrous-drug-war-ahead-un-special-session|title=Over 1,000 Leaders Worldwide Slam Failed Prohibitionist Drug Policies, Call for Systemic Reform|website=Drug Policy Alliance}}</ref>

===Lawsuit in the U.S. by Indigenous Mexican Plaintiffs===
According to a 2012 ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' article, a group of ten anonymous [[Tzotzil people]] claiming to be survivors of the [[Acteal massacre]] have taken an opportunity to sue former President Zedillo in a civil court in [[Connecticut]], \"seeking about $50 million and a declaration of guilt against Mr Zedillo.\" The victims of the massacre were members of an indigenous-rights group known as [[Las Abejas]]; however, the current president of that organization, Porfirio Arias, claims that the alleged victims were in fact not residents of Acteal at all. This has led commentators to allege the trial to be politically motivated, perhaps by a member of his own political party, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], angry about Zedillo's reforms that led to the party losing power in the [[2000 Mexican presidential election]], after 71 years of continuous political rule.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.economist.com/node/21561904 |title=Mexico and Justice: The trials of Ernesto Zedillo |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date = 1 September 2012|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

The [[United States Department of State]] recommended that President Zedillo be granted [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] due to the actions occurring as part of his official capacity as head of state. This motion is not binding in the US court system, but judges \"generally side with the State Department.\"<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/world/americas/us-moves-to-grant-former-mexican-president-immunity-in-suit.html?ref=ernestozedillo&_r=0|title=U.S. Moves to Grant Former Mexican President Immunity in Suit|author=Randal C. Archibold|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date = 8 September 2012|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

The plaintiffs, who are being represented by Rafferty, Kobert, Tenenholtz, Bounds & Hess may appeal the ruling of U.S. District Judge Michael Shea to sidestep the immunity Zedillo has been granted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/07/22/former-mexican-president-evades-charges-of-massacre-through-immunity/|title=Former Mexican President Evades Charges of Massacre Through Immunity |website=Jdjournal.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2014, the US Supreme Court refused to hear a case against Zedillo on grounds of \"sovereign immunity\" as a former head of state by survivors of the Acteal massacre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015142416/http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 October 2014|title=Supreme Court won't hear suit over Indian massacre in Mexico|date=15 October 2014|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

==Public opinion and legacy==
In a national survey conducted in 2012 by BGC-Excélsior regarding former Presidents, 39% of the respondents considered that the Zedillo administration was \"very good\" or \"good\", 27% responded that it was an \"average\" administration, and 31% responded that it was a \"very bad\" or \"bad\" administration.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beltran |first1=Ulises |title=Zedillo y Fox los ex presidentes de México más reconocidos |url=https://www.imagenradio.com.mx/zedillo-y-fox-los-ex-presidentes-de-mexico-mas-reconocidos |publisher=Imagen Radio |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref>

'''Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León''', ({{IPA-es|eɾˈnesto seˈðiʝo}}; born 27 December 1951) is a Mexican economist and politician. He was [[President of Mexico]] from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 2000, as the last of the uninterrupted 71-year line of Mexican presidents from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI).

During his presidency, he faced the [[Mexican peso crisis|worst economic crisis in Mexico's history]], which started only weeks after he took office.<ref name=\"The Economist 2004\">{{Cite news | title = The peso crisis, ten years on: Tequila slammer | date = 2004-12-29 | work = [[The Economist]] | url = https://www.economist.com/node/3524948 | accessdate = 2014-07-08}}</ref><ref name=\"Molen 2013\">{{Cite news | title = The Tequila crisis in 1994 | date = 2013-09-19 | publisher = [[Rabobank]] | url = http://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2013/september/the-tequila-crisis-in-1994 | accessdate = 2014-07-27 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410090503/https://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2013/september/the-tequila-crisis-in-1994/ | archivedate = 2015-04-10 }}</ref> He distanced himself from his predecessor [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]], blaming his policies for the crisis (although President Zedillo himself did not deviate from the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies of his two predecessors),<ref name=\"The Economist 2004\"/><ref>{{Cite news | title = Salinas vs. Zedillo | publisher = La Jornada | url = http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/10/11/index.php?section=politica&article=020a1pol | accessdate = 2018-03-09 |language = Spanish}}</ref> and oversaw the arrest of his brother [[Raúl Salinas de Gortari]].<ref>Salinas' Brother Charged in Mexican Assassination ''New York Times'' March 1, 1995 [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/world/salinas-s-brother-charged-in-mexican-assassination.html]</ref> His administration was also marked, among other things, by renewed clashes with the [[EZLN]] and the [[Popular Revolutionary Army]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017111100/http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 October 2013|title=Wayback Machine|date=17 October 2013|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref> the controversial implementation of [[Fobaproa]] to rescue the national banking system;<ref>Solís, L.

Although Zedillo's policies allowed Mexico to get out of the economic crisis and regain growth, popular discontent with seven decades of PRI rule led to the party losing, for the first time, its legislative majority [[1997 Mexican legislative election|in the 1997 elections]],<ref name=DN>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p453 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref> and in the [[2000 Mexican general election|2000 elections]] the right-wing opposition [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]]'s candidate [[Vicente Fox]] won the Presidency of the Republic, putting an end to 71 years of uninterrupted PRI rule.<ref>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p475 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref> Zedillo's admission of the PRI's defeat and his peaceful handing of power to his successor improved his image in the final months of his administration, and he left office with an approval rating of 60%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Aznarez |first1=Juan Jesus |title=Zedillo abandona la presidencia con una popularidad del 60% |url=https://elpais.com/diario/2000/12/01/internacional/975625205_850215.html |accessdate=9 August 2019 |publisher=El Pais |date=1 December 2000}}</ref>

Since the ending of his term as president in 2000, Zedillo has been a leading voice on globalization, especially its impact on relations between developed and developing nations.

He is currently Director of the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization|Center for the Study of Globalization]] at [[Yale University]], is the Latin American co-chair of the [[Inter-American Dialogue]], and is on the board of directors of [[Citigroup]].

==Early life and education==
Ernesto Zedillo was born on 27 December 1951 in [[Mexico City]]. His parents were Rodolfo Zedillo Castillo, a mechanic, and Martha Alicia Ponce de León. Seeking better job and education opportunities for their children, his parents moved to [[Mexicali]], [[Baja California]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In 1965, at the age of 14, he returned to Mexico City. In 1969 he entered the [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional|National Polytechnic Institute]], financing his studies by working in the National Army and Navy Bank (later known as ''Banjército''). He graduated as an economist in 1972 and began lecturing. It was among his first group of students that he met his wife, [[First Lady of Mexico|Nilda Patricia Velasco]], with whom he has five children: Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos (formerly married to conductor [[Alondra de la Parra]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/332332 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403181822/http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/332332 |archive-date=3 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), Nilda Patricia and Rodrigo.

In 1974, he pursued his master's and PhD studies at [[Yale University]]. His doctoral thesis was titled ''Mexico's Public External Debt: Recent History and Future Growth Related to Oil''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Political career===
Zedillo began working in the [[Bank of Mexico]] (Mexico's central bank) as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, where he supported the adoption of macroeconomic policies for the country's improvement.
By 1987, he was named deputy-secretary of Planning and Budget Control in the Secretariat of Budget and Planning. In 1988, at the age of 36, he headed that secretariat. During his term as Secretary, Zedillo launched a Science and Technology reform.

In 1992, he was appointed [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Education]] by president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]].  During his tenure in this post, he was in charge of the revision the Mexican public school textbooks.  The changes, which took a softer line on foreign investment and the Porfiriato, among other topics, were highly controversial and the textbooks were withdrawn.<ref>Gilbert, Dennis. “Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.” Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 271–297. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1052017 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> A year later he resigned to run the electoral campaign of [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]'s presidential candidate.

==1994 presidential campaign==
{{main|1994 Mexican general election}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin at the Millennium Summit 6-8 September 2000-12.jpg|left|thumb|230px|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Ernesto Zedillo, at the Millennium Summit, 2000]]

In 1994, after [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]]'s assassination, Zedillo became one of the few [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] members eligible under Mexican law to take his place, since he had not occupied public office for some time.

The opposition blamed Colosio's murder on Salinas. Although the PRI's presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president, and thus [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] had originally been [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Salinas]]' candidate, their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which Colosio said that [[Mexico]] had many problems. It is also notable that the assassination took place after Colosio visited the members of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] in Chiapas and promised to open dialogue, something the PRI opposed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

After Colosio's murder, this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the president.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The choice of Zedillo was interpreted as Salinas' way of bypassing the strong Mexican political tradition of non-reelection and retaining real power, since Zedillo was not really a politician, but an economist (like Salinas), who clearly lacked the president's political talent and influence. It is unclear if Salinas had attempted to control Colosio, who was generally considered at that time to be a far better candidate.

Zedillo ran against [[Diego Fernández de Cevallos]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] and second-timer [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]] of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. He won with 48.69% of popular vote, and became the last president to distinguish the 70-year PRI dynasty in México during the 20th century.

At age 43, Zedillo assumed the presidency on 1 December 1994 at the [[Legislative Palace of San Lázaro]], taking oath before the [[Congress of the Union]] presided by the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|deputy president]] Carlota Vargas Garza. Zedillo's electoral victory was perceived as clean, but he came to office as an accidental candidate with no political base of his own and no experience. During the first part of his presidency, he took inconsistent, zigzagging policy positions and there were rumors that he would resign or that there would be a coup d'état against him, which caused turmoil in financial markets.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\">Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p.1641</ref>

===Cabinet===
Zedillo's [[Cabinet of Ernesto Zedillo|cabinet]] needed to have members who could deal with crises. Over the course of his presidency, he had four as [[Minister of the Interior]], [[Esteban Moctezuma]], who dealt with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]; [[Emilio Chuayffet]], who resigned following the [[Acteal massacre]]; [[Francisco Labastida]], who won the primary to determine the 2000 PRI presidential candidate; and [[Diódoro Carrasco Altamirano]], who dealt with the strike at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].

===Financial Crisis of December 1994===
{{Main|Mexican peso crisis}}
A few days after taking office, one of the biggest economic crisis in Mexican history hit the country. Although it was outgoing President Salinas who was mainly blamed for the crisis, Salinas claimed that President Zedillo made a mistake by changing the economic policies held by his administration. Zedillo devalued the peso by 15%, which prompted the near-collapse of the financial system.<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\", p. 1641.</ref> [[Mexican peso crisis|The crisis]] ended after a series of reforms and actions led by Zedillo. US president [[Bill Clinton]] granted a US$20&nbsp;billion loan to Mexico, which helped in one of Zedillo's initiatives to rescue the banking system.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | title = Clinton authorizes loan to Mexico | publisher = [[History (U.S. TV channel)]] | date = 31 January 1995 | accessdate = 27 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180324010125/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | archive-date = 24 March 2018 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===Break with Salinas===
Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who was vaulted to prominence with the assassination of Colosio. The conflict between Zedillo and Salinas marked the early part of Zedillo's presidency.<ref>Fuentes, Carlos. “Coalticue's Skirt: Hidden Aspects of Mexico's Political Rivalry in 1995.” The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 2, no. 2, 1995, pp. 175–180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24590093 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> As with De la Madrid and Salinas, Zedillo had never been elected to office and had no experience in politics. His performance as a candidate was lackluster, but the outbreak of violence in Chiapas and the shock of the Colosio assassination swayed voters to support the PRI candidate in the 1994 election. In office, Zedillo was perceived as a puppet-president with Salinas following the model of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obregón]]. In order to consolidate his own power in the presidency, Zedillo had to assert his independence from Salinas. On 28 February 1995 Zedillo ordered the arrest of the ex-president's older brother [[Raúl Salinas]] for the September 1994 murder of PRI General Secretary [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]]  marked a decisive break between Zedillo and Salinas.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\"/>

===Zapatista Crisis===
{{Main|1995 Zapatista Crisis}}
Mexico had been in turmoil since January 1994, with the initial Zapatista rebellion and two political assassinations. The presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] was assassinated in March 1994, and his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo replaced him candidate a few days later. The other high-profile assassination, that of PRI Secretary General [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], brother-in-law of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in September 1994, laid bare political rivalries within the PRI. In order to give credibility to the investigations of those political crimes and grant \"a healthy distance\", president Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia a member of the opposition Political Party [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] as [[Attorney General of Mexico]].  Zedillo inherited the rebellion in Chiapas, but it was up to his administration to handle it.

On 5 January 1995, the Secretary of Interior [[Esteban Moctezuma]] started a secret meeting process with [[Subcomandante Marcos|Marcos]] called \"Steps Toward Peace\" [[Chiapas]]. Talks seemed promising for an agreement, but Zedillo backed away, apparently because the military was not in accord with the government's apparent \"acceptance of the Zapatistas' control over much of Chiapas territory.\"<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', p. 242.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=330331|title=Zedillo rompió acuerdo de paz con el EZLN: Esteban Moctezuma - Proceso|date=11 January 2013|website=Proceso.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|title=El Universal - Opinion - Renuncia en Gobernación|website=Eluniversalmas.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802123734/http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In February 1995, the Mexican government identified the masked Subcomandante Marcos as Rafael Sebastián Guillén, a former professor at the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] in Mexico City.

The army was prepared to move against Zapatista strongholds and capture Marcos.<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', pp. 244-45</ref> The government decided to reopen negotiations with the Zapatistas. On 10 March 1995 President Zedillo and Secretary of the Interior Moctezuma signed the Presidential Decree for the Dialog, the Reconciliation and a peace with dignity in Chiapas law, which was discussed and approved by the Mexican Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx/pages/chiapas/docs/ley-dialogo.html|title=Client Validation|website=Zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102231548/http://zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx/pages/chiapas/docs/ley-dialogo.html|archive-date=2 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In April 1995, the government and the Zapatistas began secret talks to find an end to the conflict.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/ezln/cronologia.htm|title=Cronologia del Conflicto EZLN|website=Latinamericanstudies.org|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>  In February 1996, the [[San Andrés Accords]] were signed by the government and the Zapatistas.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070206140008/http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/americas/mexico/SanAndres.html accessed 23 March 2019</ref> In May 1996, Zapatistas imprisoned for terrorism were released.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/1996/06/07/croni.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105203601/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/1996/06/07/croni.html |archive-date=5 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In December 1997, indigenous peasants were murdered in an incident known as the [[Acteal massacre]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/25/opinion/death-in-chiapas.html accessed 23 March 2019</ref> Survivors of the massacre sued Zedillo in U.S., but the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the suit on the basis of his immunity as a head of state.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20141015142416/http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

===Church-state relations===
[[File:Oscar_Vega_y_Ernesto_Zedillo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Oscar Vega and the President Ernesto Zedillo in 1998.]]
Salinas had gained support of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1988 elections and had pushed through a series of constitutional changes that significantly changed church-state relations.  However, on February 11, 1995, Zedillo ignited a crisis with the Roman Catholic Church, hurting, recently restored [[Mexican government|Mexico]]–[[Holy See]] diplomatic relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/10/03/index.php?section=opinion&article=024a1pol|title=A 15 años de relaciones entre México y el Vaticano |website=Jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> Relations had already been damaged because of the May 24, 1993 political assassination of the Guadalajara Cardinal [[Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo]] and lack of government progress on solving the murder by the [[Attorney General of Mexico]].

===Poverty alleviation===
Zedillo's presidential motto was ''Bienestar para tu familia'' (\"Well-being for your family\"). He created the poverty alleviation program ''Progresa'', which subsidized the poorest families in Mexico, provided that their children went to school. It replaced the Salinas administration's PRONASOL, deemed too politicized.<ref>Rocha Menocal, A. (2001). \"Do Old Habits Die Hard? A Statistical Exploration of the Politicisation of Progresa, Mexico's Latest Federal Poverty-Alleviation Programme, under the Zedillo Administration.\" Journal of Latin American Studies, 33(3), 513-538. doi:10.1017/S0022216X01006113 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> It was later renamed ''[[Oportunidades]]'' (''Opportunities'') by president [[Vicente Fox]]. The parastatal organization [[:es:Compañía Nacional de Subsistencias Populares|CONASUPO]], which was designed to supply food and provide food security to the poor was phased out in 1999, resulting in higher food prices.<ref>Yunez–Naude, Antonio. \"The dismantling of CONASUPO, a Mexican state trader in agriculture.\" World Economy 26.1 (2003): 97-122.</ref>

===NAFTA and other economic measures===
{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement|Effects of NAFTA on Mexico}}
Carlos Salinas had negotiated Mexico's place in NAFTA, which took effect in January 1994, so Zedillo was the first president to oversee it for his entire term. The Mexican economy suffered following the December 1994 peso crisis, when currency was devalued by 15% and the U.S. intervened to prop up the economy with a multi-billion dollar loan, so that NAFTA under the Zedillo administration got off to a rocky start.  The Mexican GDP was -7% and there were hopes that NAFTA would lift that miserable performance statistic.<ref>Luz María de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1026.</ref>

In the run-up to implementation of NAFTA, Salinas had privatized hundreds of companies. During the Zedillo administration, he privatized [[Rail transport in Mexico#Privatization|the state railway company]], [[:es:Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México|Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México]]. This led to the suspension of passenger service in 1997.

===Electoral reform===
{{see|1997 Mexican legislative election}}
Zedillo saw electoral reform as a key issue for his administration.<ref>Zedillo, Ernesto. “The Right Track: Political and Economic Reform in Mexico.” Harvard International Review, vol. 19, no. 1, 1996, pp. 38–67. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/42762264 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> In January 1995, Zedillo initiated multiparty talks about electoral reform, which resulted in an agreement on how to frame political reform. In July 1996, those talks resulted in the agreement of Mexico's four major parties on a reform package, which was ratified unanimously in legislature.  It created autonomous organizations to oversee elections, made the post of [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|Head of Government of Mexico City]], previously an appointed position, into an elective one, as of July 1997, and created closer oversight of campaign spending. \"Perhaps most crucially, it represents a first step toward consensus among the parties on a set of mutually accepted democratic rules of the game.\"<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1641-42.</ref> The reforms lowered the influence of the PRI and opened opportunities for other parties.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The resurrection of the Mexican left in the 1997 elections: implications for the party system.\" Toward Mexico’s Democratizations: Parties, Campaigns, Elections, and Public Opinion, New York, Routledge (1999).</ref> In the 1997 elections, for the first time the PRI did not win the majority in Congress.  Zedillo was also a strong advocate of federalism as a counterbalance to a centralized system.<ref>Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De León. “Address by Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De León.” Publius, vol. 29, no. 4, 1999, pp. 15–22. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3330905 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

===Foreign relations===
Zedillo sought to forge new ties overseas, including ones with China.<ref>Cornejo, Romer Alejandro. “México y China. Entre La Buena Voluntad y La Competencia.” Foro Internacional, vol. 41, no. 4 (166), 2001, pp. 878–890. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27739097 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>  He made a rhetorical gesture to Africa, but without real effect.<ref>Varela, Hilda. “Crónica De Una Política Inexistente: Las Relaciones Entre México y África, 1994-2000.” Foro Internacional, vol. 41, no. 4 (166), 2001, pp. 912–930. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27739100 accessed 23 March 2019</ref>

==2000 Election==
{{See|Mexican general election, 2000}}
The presidential election of 2 July 2000 was a watershed in Mexican history for several reasons. The PRI presidential candidate, [[Francisco Labastida]] was not designated by the sitting president (as all former Presidential nominees from the PRI had been until that point), but by an open internal primary of the party.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The making of the Mexican president, 2000: parties, candidates, and campaign strategy.\" Jorge Domínguez and Lawson (2004): 123-56.</ref> Changes in the electoral rules meant that the government did not control voting as it had previously in the Ministry of the Interior. Elections were now  the jurisdiction of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), with Mexicans having faith that elections would be free and fair.<ref>Wallis, Darren. \"The Mexican Presidential and Congressional Elections of 2000 and Democratic Transition.\" Bulletin of Latin American Research 20.3 (2001): 304-323.</ref> IFE implemented new  procedures regarding campaigns and balloting, with rules for finance, guarantee of the secret ballot, and unbiased counting of votes. Also important were some 10,000 Mexican poll watchers and over 850 foreign observers, including ex-president of the U.S., [[Jimmy Carter]]. [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] leader [[Subcomandante Marcos]] declared that the election was a \"dignified and respectable battleground.\"<ref>Fröhling, Oliver, Carolyn Gallaher, and John Paul Jones, III. \"Imagining the Mexican election.\" Antipode 33.1 (2001): 2</ref> The results of the election were even more historic. For the first time since the founding of Zedillo's party in 1929, an opposition candidate won, a peaceful change from an authoritarian government.<ref>Klesner, Joseph L. \"The end of Mexico's one-party regime.\" PS: Political Science & Politics 34.1 (2001): 107-114.</ref> Zedillo went on national television when the polls closed, declaring that [[Vicente Fox]] had won. In Fox's autobiography he writes, \"There are still those old-guard ''priistas'' who consider Ernesto Zedillo a traitor to his class for his actions on the night of July 2, 2000, as the party boss who betrayed the machine.  But in that moment President Zedillo became a true democrat ... In minutes he preempted any possibility of violent resistance from hard-line ''priistas''. It was an act of electoral integrity that will forever mark the mild-mannered economist as a historic figure of Mexico's peaceful transition to democracy.\"<ref>Vicente Fox and Rob Allyn, ''Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith, and Dreams of a Mexican President''. New York: Viking 2007, pp. 192-93.</ref>

Since leaving office, Zedillo has held many jobs as an economic consultant in many international companies and organizations. He currently is on the faculty at [[Yale University]], where he teaches economics and heads the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization]]. In 2008, a conference on global climate change was convened at Yale, resulting in a published volume edited by Zedillo.<ref>Ernesto Zedillo, ed., ''Global Warming. Looking Beyond Kyoto''.

In 2016, Zedillo co-signed a letter calling for an end to the [[War on Drugs]], along with people like [[Mary J.

===Lawsuit in the U.S. by Indigenous Mexican Plaintiffs===
According to a 2012 ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' article, a group of ten anonymous [[Tzotzil people]] claiming to be survivors of the [[Acteal massacre]] have taken an opportunity to sue former President Zedillo in a civil court in [[Connecticut]], \"seeking about $50 million and a declaration of guilt against Mr Zedillo.\" The victims of the massacre were members of an indigenous-rights group known as [[Las Abejas]]; however, the current president of that organization, Porfirio Arias, claims that the alleged victims were in fact not residents of Acteal at all. This has led commentators to allege the trial to be politically motivated, perhaps by a member of his own political party, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], angry about Zedillo's reforms that led to the party losing power in the [[2000 Mexican presidential election]], after 71 years of continuous political rule.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.economist.com/node/21561904 |title=Mexico and Justice: The trials of Ernesto Zedillo |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date = 1 September 2012|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

The [[United States Department of State]] recommended that President Zedillo be granted [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] due to the actions occurring as part of his official capacity as head of state. This motion is not binding in the US court system, but judges \"generally side with the State Department.\"<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/world/americas/us-moves-to-grant-former-mexican-president-immunity-in-suit.html?ref=ernestozedillo&_r=0|title=U.S. Moves to Grant Former Mexican President Immunity in Suit|author=Randal C. Archibold|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date = 8 September 2012|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

The plaintiffs, who are being represented by Rafferty, Kobert, Tenenholtz, Bounds & Hess may appeal the ruling of U.S. District Judge Michael Shea to sidestep the immunity Zedillo has been granted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/07/22/former-mexican-president-evades-charges-of-massacre-through-immunity/|title=Former Mexican President Evades Charges of Massacre Through Immunity |website=Jdjournal.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2014, the US Supreme Court refused to hear a case against Zedillo on grounds of \"sovereign immunity\" as a former head of state by survivors of the Acteal massacre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015142416/http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 October 2014|title=Supreme Court won't hear suit over Indian massacre in Mexico|date=15 October 2014|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

==Public opinion and legacy==
In a national survey conducted in 2012 by BGC-Excélsior regarding former Presidents, 39% of the respondents considered that the Zedillo administration was \"very good\" or \"good\", 27% responded that it was an \"average\" administration, and 31% responded that it was a \"very bad\" or \"bad\" administration.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beltran |first1=Ulises |title=Zedillo y Fox los ex presidentes de México más reconocidos |url=https://www.imagenradio.com.mx/zedillo-y-fox-los-ex-presidentes-de-mexico-mas-reconocidos |publisher=Imagen Radio |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref>

Quill was elected to [[Dáil Éireann]] as a Labour Party [[Teachta Dála]] (TD) for the [[Cork North (Dáil constituency)|Cork North]] constituency at the [[June 1927 Irish general election|June 1927 general election]], receiving 18% of first preference votes.<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Timothy-Quill.D.1927-06-23/|title=Timothy Quill|work=Oireachtas Members Database|access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1nCdDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT700&lpg=PT700&dq=timothy+quill+irish+politician#v=onepage&q=timothy%20quill%20irish%20politician&f=false|title=Irish Elections 1948-77: Results and Analysis: Sources for the Study of Irish Politics 2|last=Gallagher|first=Michael|date=2019-06-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-99772-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GUsmAQAAIAAJ&q=timothy+quill+cork+north&dq=timothy+quill+cork+north|title=Díospóireachtaí Párlaiminte: Tuairisc Oifigiúil|last=Dáil|first=Ireland Oireachtas|date=1927|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xnANAQAAMAAJ&q=timothy+quill+cork+north&dq=timothy+quill+cork+north|title=Parliamentary election results in Ireland, 1918-92|last=Walker|first=Brian Mercer|last2=Academy|first2=Royal Irish|last3=Studies|first3=Queen's University of Belfast Institute of Irish|date=1992|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|isbn=978-0-901714-96-1|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref> Slogans, such as 'Be Labour This Time' and 'Away With Slums & Mud Cabins' were featured on his election posters.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000516078|title=Away with slums and mud cabins.

He was an outspoken opponent of the 1927 Public Safety Act.<ref name=\"debates19270803-16\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1927-08-03/16|title=ORDUITHE AN LAE—ORDERS OF THE DAY. - PUBLIC SAFETY BILL, 1927—THIRD STAGE (RESUMED). – Dáil Éireann (5th Dáil) – Wednesday, 3 Aug 1927 – Houses of the Oireachtas|last=Oireachtas|first=Houses of the|date=3 August 1927|website=www.oireachtas.ie|language=en-ie|access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref> During a debate on the bill on 3 August 1927, he said;

Coincidentally, the Public Safety Act resulted in the conviction of Herbert Mitchell from Kerry Pike, the father of one of his future daughters-in-law, whom was sentenced to 12 months of [[Penal labour|hard labour]] in 1929 for being a member of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|IRA]].<ref >{{Cite web|url=http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000013771|title=The Man with the Long Hair|last=Mitchell|first=Maud}}</ref> The IRA at this time had fewer than 2,000 members, and remained as a perceived threat to the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] by [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] in the late 1920s, which largely encouraged the introduction of the Act.

==== September 1927 general election ====
Quill lost his seat at the [[September 1927 Irish general election|September 1927 general election]]. Daniel Corkery topped the poll under the Fianna Fáil banner with a 30% share of first preference votes, followed closely by new [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] candidate and rival [[Daniel O'Leary (Fine Gael politician)|Daniel O'Leary]], taking a 27.4% share of first preferences. Quill received 4,123 first preference votes. Despite receiving only 42 less votes than he did in June of that year, his percentage share dropped to 16%. As a result of this, he only served 3 months as a TD. The number of Labour candidates was almost halved, down from 44 to 28. This has been described as an election that Labour was ill prepared for and Quill, like others, suffered from this.<ref name=\":4\" /> Mr. T. D. Keating of the IT&GWU said that it was regrettable that Quill was not re-elected. He went on to say that;

''\"On all sides it was admitted that he was one of the noblest and most honest representatives sent to Dail Eireann\"'' and that ''\"it was only by a margin he was beaten on this occasion, chiefly because stronger parties were supplied with money and cars, and he had to depend on the common people who had not the wealth''. ''In spite of misrepresentation of the worst and meanest type, in spite of the fact that all the political \"big guns\" in North Cork were directed against him, it was very evident that were it not for the fact that an Independent Labour man who was already defeated in June and defeated heavily now, was a candidate, thus dividing tho Labour vote, Mr. Quill would have been elected. This Independent Labour man, who could not get elected himself, had succeeded in depriving Labour in North Cork of a representative in Dail Eireann. It was a bad day for workers and for all classes in the North Cork Constituency that Mr. Quill was defeated, and already many were regretting\".''

Quill thanked those who stood by him and the Labour cause. He believed from the spirit manifested that there was no fear of the future, for truth would win out despite all misrepresentation.<ref name=\":5\" />

Speaking on the heavy defeat for Labour in the September 1927 election, T. J. Murphy regretted that the party had lost men like [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Tom Johnson]], who, ''\"because of bis industry and ability, would receive a place of honour in any Parliament in tho world, and young men of tho ability and honesty of Mr. Quill, who had been defeated in North Cork by a mere handful of votes, after making a marvellous fight against a combination of influences\".''<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=http://archive.irishnewsarchive.com/Olive/APA/INA/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=EEC%2F1927%2F10%2F06&id=Ar00929&sk=27DF6453|title=Mr. T.

==== Campaigning ====
In 1927 he stated that working people must organise and while we had political freedom, he argued that that not enough was being done with this freedom. He stated that nothing had been done in regards to unemployment, setting up local industries and supporting agriculture. He stated on a number of occasions that \"''a change of flag or uniform'' ''has no material effect on the condition of working people\"''.<ref name=\":4\" /> Quill described himself as a ''\"temperate man\".''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.irishnewsarchive.com/Olive/APA/INA/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=SST/1927/02/26&id=Ar00607&sk=397C2D9B|title=ForLADlE* HOSIERY JQHN AJKlm LJD Try JAMES O'BRIEN . .... * dunmanway|website=archive.irishnewsarchive.com|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

At a meeting in Kiskeam, Quill outlined what he believed the Labour Party stood for. With 50,000-60,000 people unemployed, they and their dependents were destitute but the government did not see a role for the state in regards to job creation. He said that the government needed to raise large national loan for jobs schemes such as afforestation, roads, drainage, to support the School Attendance Act but also, the need to see to the physical well-being of students and a system of scholarships so that children had the opportunity to have access to more than primary education.<ref name=\":4\" />

==== Refusal to stand (1932, 1933) ====
Quill did not contest the [[1932 Irish general election|1932 general election]], declining at a Convention in [[Millstreet|Millstreet, Cork]] to stand. According to ''The Southern Star'', it was thought Quill would be the chosen candidate, but, according to the newspaper, had lost touch with the electors in this area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.irishnewsarchive.com/Olive/APA/INA/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=SST/1932/01/09&id=Ar00311&sk=1C2E5354|title=Shared Article|website=archive.irishnewsarchive.com|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> According to the ''Cork Examiner'', having been proposed and seconded, indicated the reasons which precluded him from going forward, and having thanked the proposer and seconder, said he would not delay their proceedings further than to ask that some other candidate be proposed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.irishnewsarchive.com/Olive/APA/INA/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=IEX/1932/01/04&id=Ar00902&sk=E1FD8F70|title=Shared Article|website=archive.irishnewsarchive.com|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> He declined once again in [[1933 Irish general election|1933]].<ref name=\":4\" />

=== 1937 and 1938 general elections ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Quill Election Address 1938.jpeg|thumb|Election Address from 1938]] -->
As a city councillor on the Cork Corporation, Quill contested the [[1937 Irish general election|1937 general election]] as one of 23 Labour candidates, receiving 14.9% of first preference votes, but was not elected. He ran again in the [[1938 Irish general election|1938 general election]],<ref name=\"elecs_irl\">{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1507|title=Timothy Quill|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=11 November 2008}}</ref> this time as one of 30 Labour candidates, receiving 4,950 first preference votes (12.6%), but was once again not elected.

=== County Councillor ===
According to ''A Biographical Dictionary of Cork'', by Tim Cadogan and Jeremiah Falvey, Quill served as a councillor on [[Cork County Council]] for two periods. The first being 1925–1934 (initially predating his time as a TD) and again in 1942–1945. As a Transport member, he was nominated and won a seat in 1925, retaining his seat in 1928 (being described as a [[Chief executive officer|Superintendent of Insurance]]) and lost the seat in 1934, before winning a seat again in 1942 and serving until 1945.<ref name=\":4\" />

=== Communism & Cork Labour ===
{{Importance section|date=March 2020}}
The Party in Cork from its earliest days saw its brand as Irish and Christian with no interaction with socialist movements in Europe. Examples of 'good' Labour movements were listed by public representatives such as T.J Murphy were the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. In the years after the [[Russian Revolution]], national figures such as Thomas Johnson, Cathal O'Shannon and William O'Brien were supportive of the Irish Socialist Party and the Bolshevik Revolution, but such support was rarely evident in Cork. Criticism on communist doctrine came largely from the Roman Catholic Church and prominent Catholic lay people such as Alfred O'Rahilly. The two main political parties (Fianna Fail in particular) were also constantly labelling the Labour Party as communist. The local media in particular such as The Southern Star and The Cork Examiner were equally vehement of their criticism of communist influences. However, Labour politicians, both in city and county, were critical of the Soviet Union in terms of its lack of democracy, its anti religious sentiment and that no trade union structures existed as they understood it.

The Labour Party in Cork was constantly on the defensive electorally to deny any connection with communism, which was linked with being anti-Catholic. Labour were seen as pro-communist as they were seen to attack the rights to property, they accepted the principle of class conflict and regularly criticised the capitalist system. They called for land distribution from 'ranchers' to farm labourers and the compulsory acquisition of land for house building if local farmers would not sell land. Labour meetings and public representatives regularly called for certain industries to be given state aid or be taken into public ownership while national policy also called for nationalisation of certain industries such as railways. They also recognised that there was class conflict in society which was contrary to Church social teaching and the views of other political parties. Labour figures constantly criticised the capitalist system which ''<nowiki/>'has taken control of the hearts and minds of men and has made them selfish. It has set man against man, leaving most in poverty'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Southern Star|date=18/10/1925|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>

Labour argued for the State to have more control of the money system, the need to establish municipal banks and they criticised the amount of money held in banks with so much poverty in both the city and the countryside. In the city, there was some initial support for the Russian Revolution, as evidenced in the use of the Soviet flag in the Cork Soviet in 1921. However, this was short lived as the preoccupation with Labour leaders in Cork focussed on trade union issues, such as employment creation, poverty, housing, education and a philosophy based on Christian social teaching. The tradition that the Labour leadership in the county came from either a trade union background (particularly the IT&GWU) and the land agitation movements such as the Land and Labour Association, which was socially Christian in nature. Some unions were also quite socially Christian in nature and influential, such as the INTO. Many of the INTO branches were affiliated to the Party in Cork and individual members also took up officerships in a number of branches. This was at a time when the Church exerted enormous amounts of influence in primary schools. INTO members were strenuously opposed to communist influence. An example of this was at the 1931 [[Cork West (Dáil constituency)|Cork West]] selection convention. A motion from Sean O'Sullivan NT Drimoleague and John O'Sullivan NT Bantry proposed ''<nowiki/>'that the Labour Party and unions at this conference... utter detestation of any form of communism or other doctrines to our Catholic faith.'<nowiki/>'' <ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=26/10/1931|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The motion was adopted. Speaking on the motion, TJ Murphy expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'Communism was subversive to the Catholic Faith and morals and interfered with our national ideals. Labour would not exclude anti-Catholics but would not exclude accept communist or Bolshevik doctrines'<nowiki/>''. 14 Cork branches and unions including INTO branches from Dunmanway, Bantry, Skibbereen, Macroom, IT&GWU branches from Dunmanway and Bandon, NUR Dunmanway and Bandon Carpenters Union reflected the widespread support for the motion. Similar sentiments were expressed at branch meetings and at political meetings in the mid 1930s, such as Quill in Leap, Murphy in Aghada and the Kilmichael and Buttevant branches. Murphy argued ''<nowiki/>'European countries are blighted by fascism or communism, forces that are filled with hatred threatening civilisation.'''<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=24/11/1936|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>

Unions affiliated to the Labour Party expressed similar sentiments. In 1936, the Buttevant Branch wrote to the new Bishop of Cloyne stating ''<nowiki/>'we the members of the Buttevant Branch of the Labour Party do hereby solemly affirm our beliefs in the Commandants of God and are prepared to oppose with all legitimate means at our disposal any party who may constitute themselves as propagandists for the teaching of communism in our island.'<nowiki/>'' <ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Kerryman|date=12/12/1936|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1937, T. Moylan, NUR Mallow stated that there was no affiliation between Labour and communists and that changing the conditions of the poor did not constitute communism. The INTO Branch meeting in Kanturk passed a motion that union funding to the Labour Party should not be used to enable the Party to affiliate with Continental movements of communistic tendencies. The 1940s saw little changes in the attacks on Labour and their trenchant details on communist lines. Eileen Crowley, a candidate in the city elections in 1943 expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'we need to put in practise the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church'''. James Hickey, at a meeting in Bandon at the same time, echoed similar sentiments. When Sean McEntee of Fianna Fail attacked Labour communist tendencies at an election meeting, TJ Murphy repudiated his attacks stating that the Party supports the papal encyclicals and the laws of Catholicism to deal with the problems of the time. 

In 1943, the North-West Branch met in the Butter Exchange Band room. Members felt there were misconceptions in the use of the term in the Party constitution 'Irish Workers Republic'. The Branch approved the use of the title of ''<nowiki/>'An Irish Workers Republic as laid down in the 1916 Proclamation and stated that as workers we do not need inspiration form Russia, Spain or Mexico'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=04/03/1943|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The Irish Labour Party would recognise the right to private ownership, freedom of the press and religious liberty, the resolution concluded. The term 'Workers Republic' in the constitution was said to be problematic. It was seen by members of society and the Labour Party to be pro-Soviet. The INTO in particular were influential, both nationally and in Cork, in opposing the use of the term. They believe it went beyond Catholic social teaching and when the term was referred to the Bishops for their view, it signalled the triumph of Catholicism. The onslaught of the Church, Catholic lay speakers, the press and other political parties was too much and the Catholic ethos in the party was very strong. The right to private property and the belief that Labour was a party of public ownership had also been opposed and cost the Party support that went to Fianna Fail.

The civil and political antagonism to Labour and the threat of socialism/communism was expressed at a lecture of Corporate State by Professor Hogan of UCC I May 1934. Attended by William T. Cosgrave and many in CnaG/ FG party, the lecture was entitled 'Corporate State - An Alternative to Capitalism and Socialism'.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=03/05/1934|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Hogan deemed socialism to be a threat and the state needed an alternative which the corporate state provides, based on Christian social teaching and the removal of the issue of class politics. Socialists, he argued, sought class conflict and Irish trade unionists deny that they are Marxists, yet subscribe to the class war idea. However, Christian trade unions in Holland and Belgium were working the principles contained in the encyclical 'Rerum Novarum', where capital and labour come together and co-operate successfully, he concluded.

The press offered little support, with a Cork Examiner editorial in 1947 dismissing the Labour view that capitalism was not working and that free enterprise was being replaced by monopolies. The editorial argued that communism would not deliver utopia, that the right to property was sacrosanct and that free enterprise and not state controls or monopolies was the way forward. The Labour Party fear as being seen as supporting communism or indeed being infiltrated by communists is seen in how Labour reacted to a new branch of the Party in the City.<ref name=\":4\" />

==== The Liam Mellow Branch ====
{{Importance section|date=March 2020}}
From 1935, the Party organisation had endeavoured to establish a number of branches around the city. Blarney Street was one of the areas identified by the Organisation Committee but it was not until 1943 on the initiative of Michael O'Riordan that a branch was formed there in February. A number of men involved in the Connolly Group in the Curragh joined him. The branch was named in honour of [[Liam Mellows]]. Naming a branch after someone such as Mellows was unusual for the party and the suspicion of communist influence may have been a factor in the branch being viewed with mistrust. The new branch set up meeting rooms in 16 North Main Street and in November 1943 held their inaugural meeting with then Lord Mayor, [[James Hickey (Irish politician)|James Hickey]], opening the meeting. Quill was elected as Chair, Bill Nagle as Vice-Chair, Michael O'Riordan as secretary, Minutes Secretary Jim Savage (whom was also a delegate to the Constituency Council) and Marie Keohane as Treasurer. A committee comprising Mrs J Hurley, Ellen Crowley B.A, Derry Kelleher, Jim Savage, Vincent Crotty, Tommy Murray (father of Labour Lord Mayor John Murray) and D.Sheehan elected.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=20/11/1943|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The initial report seems to show that Seamus Ronayne was elected as Treasurer but Keohane appears to have acted as branch Treasurer. The Press Release issued after the first meeting stated that 40 members enrolled, that an Organising Committee set out proposed activities and its attitude to the Irish language. The title 'Craobh' rather than 'Branch' was used. Such use of the language was unusual for a Labour Party branch.

The Branch took out short advertisements for a series of public lectures, describing themselves in those as Craobh Mhaoillosa (Labour Party). The branch became active locally organising public lectures engaged with the trade unions not affiliated with the party and would send delegations to meetings of the Corporation raising issues such as housing. Many of these activities were standard for other Labour branches at the time but the Blarney Street branch appears to have been more energetic and organised in its activities. Branch established a reputation as a dynamic branch and its rapid development appears to all much to all religions organised organisational skills. The branch set up premises in 75 North Main Street premises on the site of the old Boiler Makers' Trade Union and organised a series of public lectures held in the North Main Street premises. Some of the lectures included branch members presenting talks on Liam Mellows, 'The Indian Question', 'Science and Socialism', the Irish language, 'England and the Irish Question', social security and 'The Jewish Question'.<ref name=\":4\" />

===== Allegations of Anti-Semitism =====
O'Riordan asserts that Quill was imposed on the Liam Mellows Branch as Chair to ensure that Labour in Cork City could control the new branch. O'Riordan also argued that the talk on the Jewish question arose following comments made by Timothy Quill on ''<nowiki/>'Jew Boys'''. [[Gerald Goldberg]] was present at the talk and was so impressed by O'Riordan that he subsequently donated £5 to the branch. Quill, perhaps irritated by the talk demanded that the money be returned. 

====== 2001 Labour Party Conference ======
O'Riordan, in a speech to the 2001 Labour Party Conference, stated that ''\"I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the party' with Jewish money. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled by the party.\"''<ref>Irish Labour Party Conference (Cork, 2001)</ref>
{{Quote|text=Following my release from the Curragh Camp and my return to Cork in 1943, I was among those who founded the Liam Mellows Branch of the Labour Party in the hope that it might become the political voice of Irish anti-fascism in this city. I was named secretary of that branch but unfortunately the chairman we were given by the Party leadership was a Cork City Councillor who would debase the name of Labour in 1944 by a vitriolic attack on what he called \"the Jew boys\" of Cork. It was in opposition to such anti-Semitism that I insisted on giving a public lecture under the auspices of the Liam Mellows Branch on the subject of the Jewish question. A number of prominent members of Cork's Jewish community attended that public meeting and the future Lord Mayor of Cork, Gerald Goldberg, said from the floor: \"I came here to defend my people, but when I heard the lecturer I saw there was no need\".

But the anti-Semitic Labour Councillor did not give up. When Gerald Goldberg subsequently made a donation to branch funds I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the Party with Jewish money'. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled from a Party that was not prepared to support my continuing anti-fascist stand in 1944.|author=Michael O'Riordan|title=|source=Labour Party Annual Conference, 2001}}
While there is merit to this claim, it does appear to be more complex than this account. Antisemitism did exist in the city at this time and Quill was a devout Catholic. Barry Desmond in his book 'No Workers Republic' testifies to the antisemitic feeling in the city at the time. There was a strong anti-communist sentiment within Labour and the party had been constantly assailed in the city by professor Alfred O'Rahilly and many figures within the Roman Church, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. The Communist Party in Eire had been disbanded but the NI party still existed. O'Riordan and Nagle attended the NI Communist Party conference in Belfast in October 1943 with four Labour members (including John De Courcey Ireland).

A report in [[The Irish Press|''The'' ''Irish Press'']] suggests that the Administrative Council ''<nowiki/>'had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and accordingly they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Irish Press|date=20/04/1944|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> This was headed up by Vice-Chair, TJ Murphy. They heard the complaint against O'Riordan and Nagle being present at the (NI) Communist Party conference. O'Riordan maintained that he had only attended to meet former comrades socially. Following an investigation, the committee recommended the expulsion of both and the decision was approved of by the Parliamentary Party. The two Cork members were expelled on 5 February 1944 and the 4 Dublin members in April. Both decisions were ratified by the annual conference that year. But there are no reports or minutes of O'Riordan being expelled by the party locally on the Jewish episode but it is likely that it played a role in the expulsions. Likewise, it is clear that Timothy Quill, as a theologian and Christian Socialist held strong anti-Soviet views as possibly anti-Semitic views. The perceived threat of Soviet communism was perhaps the reason that Timothy Quill was nominated as Chair of the Liam Mellows Branch. It was around this time that the IT&GWU disaffiliated from Labour and the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]] and separate Trade Union Congress on the basis that Soviets were infiltrating the Labour Party.

====== Labour vs National Labour ======
One incident involving the branch illustrates the divisions within the party in the city. ''The Cork Examiner'' reported in August 1944 that a deputation of three members of the Leah Mills Branch spoke at a meeting Cork Corporation on the issue of juvenile offenders in the city. They requested a commission to review the issue and that a system of 'constructive reformation' rather than prison punishment take place. After the deputation left the meeting, PJ O'Brien of the National Labour Party launched an attack on the delegation stating that these were members of the Labour Party who sought to introduce 'neo communism' into Cork. Quill, Leader of the Labour Party group in the Corporation angrily objected stating that it was false. The meeting agreed to defer the report to the next meeting. At that meeting on 12 September 1944, the report was adopted.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=23/08/1944|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>

====== Dissolution of the Liam Mellow Branch ======
Following the expulsion of O'Riordan, the Branch was dissolved and the members of the branch transferred to the Central Branch. The Branch voted for the party to reinstate both members, however, this was refused nationally.

====== Retirement from electoral politics ======
Quill did not contest the 1950 Cork Corporation election and seemingly never stood for election again. He remained involved in the co-operative movement until 1954.<ref name=\":4\" />

== Co-operative movement ==
During the 1920s, Quill established the City of Cork Co-operative Society with Con Desmond (father of [[Barry Desmond]]).<ref name=\":4\" /> Quill was the secretary of the City of Cork Co-operative Society and manager and secretary of the Cork Co-operative Bakery Society. This included social enterprises such as Cooperative Tea, Cooperative Bread, Cooperative Baking Powder and Cooperative Cream. He was also a member of the Cork Co-operators' Guild.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Advertisements|date=June 1939|work=The Cork Co-Operator|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> He was also the editor of ''The Cork Co-Operator'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Letters to the Editor|last=|first=|date=January 1940|work=The Cork Co-Operator|access-date=}}</ref> a monthly publication of the [[co-operative movement]] in Cork. The paper attracted the attention of Steve Denny, the director of the London Co-operative Society (England's largest co-op society at the time). In a letter to the editor, published on the cover of the June 1939 issue, Denny described the publication as a 'bright little paper'.<ref>Cork Co-Operator, June 1939, Page 1, Letter from Director of England's biggest Co-operative Society</ref> Quill frequently attended the [[Co-operative Congress|Co-Operative Congress]] in the UK throughout the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Co-Operative Congress 1939 Edition|publisher=|year=1939|isbn=|location=UK|pages=Delegates To Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Co-Operative Congress 1942 Edition|publisher=|year=1942|isbn=|location=UK|pages=Delegates To Congress}}</ref> An article from 1951 states that, inspired by [[Robert Owen]], he built cottages for the workers on his land.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=A Day with 'The Cork Co-Operator' Timothy Quill|last=|first=|date=1951|work=The Evening Echo|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Quill regarded himself as a Christian Socialist.<ref name=\":3\" /> He resigned his position in the co-operative movement in 1954.<ref name=\":1\" />

== Personal life ==
He also used an Irish language version of his name, Taig Ui Cuill, (using various spellings of his first name, including 'Taig', and 'Tadgh'), with his last name spelled as 'Ui Cuill'. Annual reports from 1924 and 1925 show him using the names 'Tadhg O'Quill', 'Tadhg Quill' and 'Tadgh Quill'. Issues of 'The Cork Co-Operator' from 1939 show his name styled as 'T. Quill'.<ref name=ITUC_Annual_report_1924/><ref name=ITUC_Annual_report_1925/><ref name=ITUC_Annual_report_1923/>

In the 1940s, Quill lived at Ferney House in [[Blackrock, Cork]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/places/streetandtradedirectories/guyscorkdirectory1945_25feb/files/assets/basic-html/page20.html|title=Page 38-39 - Guys Cork Almanac 1945_OCR|website=www.corkpastandpresent.ie|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> where he grew vegetables and kept livestock. His first trial of [[Holstein Friesian cattle]] took place here. He served as the honorary secretary of the Irish Friesian Society.<ref name=\":0\" /> His interest in farming manifested itself in a number of different ways. As well as being an active member of the Munster Agricultural Society and he wrote a farming column in The Cork Examiner. By the 1950s he had settled at a property near [[Blarney]], left public life and was Chair of the Blarney National Farmer's Association at the time of his death.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xjEiAQAAIAAJ&q=timothy+quill+cork+county+council&dq=timothy+quill+cork+county+council|title=Annual Report|last=Agriculture|first=Ireland Dept of|date=1959|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=11/06/1960|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Political career==

=== Branch Secretary & District Executive ===
Quill began his Labour career as Secretary of the Macroom Labour Branch and District Executive. He was district also a union activist from an early age, almost certainly involved in the IT&GWU, which had organised in Macroom.<ref name=\":4\" />

=== 1927 elections ===

==== June 1927 general election ====
[[File:Timothy Quill TD Portrait July 1927.png|thumb|Official portrait of Quill as it appeared in [[The Southern Star (County Cork)|''The Southern Star'']] in July 1927]] 

After the 1923 general election, the sitting TDs in the then recently created [[Cork North (Dáil constituency)|Cork North]] constituency were [[Daniel Corkery (Irish republican)|Daniel Corkery]] [[Republican (Ireland, 1923)|(Republican]]), [[Daniel Vaughan]] ([[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers’ Party]]) and [[Thomas Nagle]] (Labour). 

Quill was a councillor on Cork County Council at the time, having been elected in 1925. It has been said that he was recruited into the party by Labour politician and fellow Clondrohid native [[Timothy J. Murphy|T.J Murphy]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/politicalparties0000gall|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/politicalparties0000gall/page/77 77]|quote=T.J Murphy Irish labour.|title=Political Parties in the Republic of Ireland|last=Gallagher|first=Michael|date=1985|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-1797-1|language=en}}</ref>

Quill was 26 years old going into his first general election on 9 June 1927 and was one of 44 Labour candidates in total. Quill was elected to [[Dáil Éireann]] as a Labour Party [[Teachta Dála]] (TD) for the [[Cork North (Dáil constituency)|Cork North]] constituency at the [[June 1927 Irish general election|June 1927 general election]], receiving 18% of first preference votes.<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Timothy-Quill.D.1927-06-23/|title=Timothy Quill|work=Oireachtas Members Database|access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1nCdDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT700&lpg=PT700&dq=timothy+quill+irish+politician#v=onepage&q=timothy%20quill%20irish%20politician&f=false|title=Irish Elections 1948-77: Results and Analysis: Sources for the Study of Irish Politics 2|last=Gallagher|first=Michael|date=2019-06-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-99772-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GUsmAQAAIAAJ&q=timothy+quill+cork+north&dq=timothy+quill+cork+north|title=Díospóireachtaí Párlaiminte: Tuairisc Oifigiúil|last=Dáil|first=Ireland Oireachtas|date=1927|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xnANAQAAMAAJ&q=timothy+quill+cork+north&dq=timothy+quill+cork+north|title=Parliamentary election results in Ireland, 1918-92|last=Walker|first=Brian Mercer|last2=Academy|first2=Royal Irish|last3=Studies|first3=Queen's University of Belfast Institute of Irish|date=1992|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|isbn=978-0-901714-96-1|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref> Slogans, such as 'Be Labour This Time' and 'Away With Slums & Mud Cabins' were featured on his election posters.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000516078|title=Away with slums and mud cabins.

He was an outspoken opponent of the 1927 Public Safety Act.<ref name=\"debates19270803-16\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1927-08-03/16|title=ORDUITHE AN LAE—ORDERS OF THE DAY. - PUBLIC SAFETY BILL, 1927—THIRD STAGE (RESUMED). – Dáil Éireann (5th Dáil) – Wednesday, 3 Aug 1927 – Houses of the Oireachtas|last=Oireachtas|first=Houses of the|date=3 August 1927|website=www.oireachtas.ie|language=en-ie|access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref> During a debate on the bill on 3 August 1927, he said; 

{{Quote|text=\"I believe the power given to the Executive Council is a power of dictatorship for the time being.

Coincidentally, the Public Safety Act resulted in the conviction of Herbert Mitchell from Kerry Pike, the father of one of his future daughters-in-law, whom was sentenced to 12 months of [[Penal labour|hard labour]] in 1929 for being a member of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|IRA]].<ref >{{Cite web|url=http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000013771|title=The Man with the Long Hair|last=Mitchell|first=Maud}}</ref> The IRA at this time had fewer than 2,000 members, and remained as a perceived threat to the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] by [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] in the late 1920s, which largely encouraged the introduction of the Act.  

On 5 July 1927, in the committee on finance regarding old age pensions, he opposed the methods and harsh manner of pensions officers.<ref name=\"debates19270705-9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1927-07-05/9|title=IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - VOTE 7—OLD AGE PENSIONS. – Dáil Éireann (5th Dáil)|last=Oireachtas|first=Houses of the|date=5 July 1927|website=www.oireachtas.ie|language=en-ie|access-date=3 June 2019}}</ref>

==== September 1927 general election ====
Quill lost his seat at the [[September 1927 Irish general election|September 1927 general election]]. Daniel Corkery topped the poll under the Fianna Fáil banner with a 30% share of first preference votes, followed closely by new [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] candidate and rival [[Daniel O'Leary (Fine Gael politician)|Daniel O'Leary]], taking a 27.4% share of first preferences. Quill received 4,123 first preference votes. Despite receiving only 42 less votes than he did in June of that year, his percentage share dropped to 16%. As a result of this, he only served 3 months as a TD. The number of Labour candidates was almost halved, down from 44 to 28. This has been described as an election that Labour was ill prepared for and Quill, like others, suffered from this.<ref name=\":4\" />

==== Campaigning ====
In 1927 he stated that working people must organise and while we had political freedom, he argued that that not enough was being done with this freedom. He stated that nothing had been done in regards to unemployment, setting up local industries and supporting agriculture. He stated on a number of occasions that \"a change of flag or uniform\" has no material effect on the condition of working people.<ref name=\":4\" />

At a meeting in Kiskeam, Quill outlined what he believed the Labour Party stood for. With 50,000 unemployed, they and their dependents were destitute but the government did not see a role for the state in regards to job creation. He said that the government needed to raise large national loan for jobs schemes such as afforestation, roads, drainage, to support the School Attendance Act but also, the need to see to the physical well-being of students and a system of scholarships so that children had the opportunity to have access to more than primary education.<ref name=\":4\" />

==== Refusal to stand (1932, 1933) ====
Quill did not contest the [[1932 Irish general election|1932 general election]], declining at a Convention in [[Millstreet|Millstreet, Cork]] to stand and did the same again in [[1933 Irish general election|1933]].<ref name=\":4\" />

=== 1937 and 1938 general elections ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Quill Election Address 1938.jpeg|thumb|Election Address from 1938]] -->
As a city councillor on the Cork Corporation, Quill contested the [[1937 Irish general election|1937 general election]] as one of 23 Labour candidates, receiving 14.9% of first preference votes, but was not elected. He ran again in the [[1938 Irish general election|1938 general election]],<ref name=\"elecs_irl\">{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1507|title=Timothy Quill|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=11 November 2008}}</ref> this time as one of 30 Labour candidates, receiving 4,950 first preference votes (12.6%), but was once again not elected.

=== County Councillor ===
According to ''A Biographical Dictionary of Cork'', by Tim Cadogan and Jeremiah Falvey, Quill served as a councillor on [[Cork County Council]] for two periods. The first being 1925–1934 (initially predating his time as a TD) and again in 1942–1945. As a Transport member, he was nominated and won a seat in 1925, retaining his seat in 1928 (being described as a [[Chief executive officer|Superintendent of Insurance]]) and lost the seat in 1934, before winning a seat again in 1942 and serving until 1945.<ref name=\":4\" />

=== Communism & Cork Labour ===
{{Importance section|date=March 2020}}
The Party in Cork from its earliest days saw its brand as Irish and Christian with no interaction with socialist movements in Europe. Examples of 'good' Labour movements were listed by public representatives such as T.J Murphy were the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. In the years after the [[Russian Revolution]], national figures such as Thomas Johnson, Cathal O'Shannon and William O'Brien were supportive of the Irish Socialist Party and the Bolshevik Revolution, but such support was rarely evident in Cork. Criticism on communist doctrine came largely from the Roman Catholic Church and prominent Catholic lay people such as Alfred O'Rahilly. The two main political parties (Fianna Fail in particular) were also constantly labelling the Labour Party as communist. The local media in particular such as The Southern Star and The Cork Examiner were equally vehement of their criticism of communist influences. However, Labour politicians, both in city and county, were critical of the Soviet Union in terms of its lack of democracy, its anti religious sentiment and that no trade union structures existed as they understood it.

The Labour Party in Cork was constantly on the defensive electorally to deny any connection with communism, which was linked with being anti-Catholic. Labour were seen as pro-communist as they were seen to attack the rights to property, they accepted the principle of class conflict and regularly criticised the capitalist system. They called for land distribution from 'ranchers' to farm labourers and the compulsory acquisition of land for house building if local farmers would not sell land. Labour meetings and public representatives regularly called for certain industries to be given state aid or be taken into public ownership while national policy also called for nationalisation of certain industries such as railways. They also recognised that there was class conflict in society which was contrary to Church social teaching and the views of other political parties. Labour figures constantly criticised the capitalist system which ''<nowiki/>'has taken control of the hearts and minds of men and has made them selfish. It has set man against man, leaving most in poverty'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Southern Star|date=18/10/1925|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>

Labour argued for the State to have more control of the money system, the need to establish municipal banks and they criticised the amount of money held in banks with so much poverty in both the city and the countryside. In the city, there was some initial support for the Russian Revolution, as evidenced in the use of the Soviet flag in the Cork Soviet in 1921. However, this was short lived as the preoccupation with Labour leaders in Cork focussed on trade union issues, such as employment creation, poverty, housing, education and a philosophy based on Christian social teaching. The tradition that the Labour leadership in the county came from either a trade union background (particularly the IT&GWU) and the land agitation movements such as the Land and Labour Association, which was socially Christian in nature. Some unions were also quite socially Christian in nature and influential, such as the INTO. Many of the INTO branches were affiliated to the Party in Cork and individual members also took up officerships in a number of branches. This was at a time when the Church exerted enormous amounts of influence in primary schools. INTO members were strenuously opposed to communist influence. An example of this was at the 1931 [[Cork West (Dáil constituency)|Cork West]] selection convention. A motion from Sean O'Sullivan NT Drimoleague and John O'Sullivan NT Bantry proposed ''<nowiki/>'that the Labour Party and unions at this conference... utter detestation of any form of communism or other doctrines to our Catholic faith.'<nowiki/>'' <ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=26/10/1931|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The motion was adopted. Speaking on the motion, TJ Murphy expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'Communism was subversive to the Catholic Faith and morals and interfered with our national ideals. Labour would not exclude anti-Catholics but would not exclude accept communist or Bolshevik doctrines'<nowiki/>''. 14 Cork branches and unions including INTO branches from Dunmanway, Bantry, Skibbereen, Macroom, IT&GWU branches from Dunmanway and Bandon, NUR Dunmanway and Bandon Carpenters Union reflected the widespread support for the motion. Similar sentiments were expressed at branch meetings and at political meetings in the mid 1930s, such as Quill in Leap, Murphy in Aghada and the Kilmichael and Buttevant branches. Murphy argued ''<nowiki/>'European countries are blighted by fascism or communism, forces that are filled with hatred threatening civilisation.'''<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=24/11/1936|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>

Unions affiliated to the Labour Party expressed similar sentiments. In 1936, the Buttevant Branch wrote to the new Bishop of Cloyne stating ''<nowiki/>'we the members of the Buttevant Branch of the Labour Party do hereby solemly affirm our beliefs in the Commandants of God and are prepared to oppose with all legitimate means at our disposal any party who may constitute themselves as propagandists for the teaching of communism in our island.'<nowiki/>'' <ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Kerryman|date=12/12/1936|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1937, T. Moylan, NUR Mallow stated that there was no affiliation between Labour and communists and that changing the conditions of the poor did not constitute communism. The INTO Branch meeting in Kanturk passed a motion that union funding to the Labour Party should not be used to enable the Party to affiliate with Continental movements of communistic tendencies. The 1940s saw little changes in the attacks on Labour and their trenchant details on communist lines. Eileen Crowley, a candidate in the city elections in 1943 expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'we need to put in practise the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church'''. James Hickey, at a meeting in Bandon at the same time, echoed similar sentiments. When Sean McEntee of Fianna Fail attacked Labour communist tendencies at an election meeting, TJ Murphy repudiated his attacks stating that the Party supports the papal encyclicals and the laws of Catholicism to deal with the problems of the time. 

In 1943, the North-West Branch met in the Butter Exchange Band room. Members felt there were misconceptions in the use of the term in the Party constitution 'Irish Workers Republic'. The Branch approved the use of the title of ''<nowiki/>'An Irish Workers Republic as laid down in the 1916 Proclamation and stated that as workers we do not need inspiration form Russia, Spain or Mexico'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=04/03/1943|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The Irish Labour Party would recognise the right to private ownership, freedom of the press and religious liberty, the resolution concluded. The term 'Workers Republic' in the constitution was said to be problematic. It was seen by members of society and the Labour Party to be pro-Soviet. The INTO in particular were influential, both nationally and in Cork, in opposing the use of the term. They believe it went beyond Catholic social teaching and when the term was referred to the Bishops for their view, it signalled the triumph of Catholicism. The onslaught of the Church, Catholic lay speakers, the press and other political parties was too much and the Catholic ethos in the party was very strong. The right to private property and the belief that Labour was a party of public ownership had also been opposed and cost the Party support that went to Fianna Fail.

The civil and political antagonism to Labour and the threat of socialism/communism was expressed at a lecture of Corporate State by Professor Hogan of UCC I May 1934. Attended by William T. Cosgrave and many in CnaG/ FG party, the lecture was entitled 'Corporate State - An Alternative to Capitalism and Socialism'.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=03/05/1934|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Hogan deemed socialism to be a threat and the state needed an alternative which the corporate state provides, based on Christian social teaching and the removal of the issue of class politics. Socialists, he argued, sought class conflict and Irish trade unionists deny that they are Marxists, yet subscribe to the class war idea. However, Christian trade unions in Holland and Belgium were working the principles contained in the encyclical 'Rerum Novarum', where capital and labour come together and co-operate successfully, he concluded.

The press offered little support, with a Cork Examiner editorial in 1947 dismissing the Labour view that capitalism was not working and that free enterprise was being replaced by monopolies. The editorial argued that communism would not deliver utopia, that the right to property was sacrosanct and that free enterprise and not state controls or monopolies was the way forward. The Labour Party fear as being seen as supporting communism or indeed being infiltrated by communists is seen in how Labour reacted to a new branch of the Party in the City.<ref name=\":4\" />

==== The Liam Mellow Branch ====
{{Importance section|date=March 2020}}
From 1935, the Party organisation had endeavoured to establish a number of branches around the city. Blarney Street was one of the areas identified by the Organisation Committee but it was not until 1943 on the initiative of Michael O'Riordan that a branch was formed there in February. A number of men involved in the Connolly Group in the Curragh joined him. The branch was named in honour of [[Liam Mellows]]. Naming a branch after someone such as Mellows was unusual for the party and the suspicion of communist influence may have been a factor in the branch being viewed with mistrust. The new branch set up meeting rooms in 16 North Main Street and in November 1943 held their inaugural meeting with then Lord Mayor, [[James Hickey (Irish politician)|James Hickey]], opening the meeting. Quill was elected as Chair, Bill Nagle as Vice-Chair, Michael O'Riordan as secretary, Minutes Secretary Jim Savage (whom was also a delegate to the Constituency Council) and Marie Keohane as Treasurer. A committee comprising Mrs J Hurley, Ellen Crowley B.A, Derry Kelleher, Jim Savage, Vincent Crotty, Tommy Murray (father of Labour Lord Mayor John Murray) and D.Sheehan elected.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=20/11/1943|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The initial report seems to show that Seamus Ronayne was elected as Treasurer but Keohane appears to have acted as branch Treasurer. The Press Release issued after the first meeting stated that 40 members enrolled, that an Organising Committee set out proposed activities and its attitude to the Irish language. The title 'Craobh' rather than 'Branch' was used. Such use of the language was unusual for a Labour Party branch.

The Branch took out short advertisements for a series of public lectures, describing themselves in those as Craobh Mhaoillosa (Labour Party). The branch became active locally organising public lectures engaged with the trade unions not affiliated with the party and would send delegations to meetings of the Corporation raising issues such as housing. Many of these activities were standard for other Labour branches at the time but the Blarney Street branch appears to have been more energetic and organised in its activities. Branch established a reputation as a dynamic branch and its rapid development appears to all much to all religions organised organisational skills. The branch set up premises in 75 North Main Street premises on the site of the old Boiler Makers' Trade Union and organised a series of public lectures held in the North Main Street premises. Some of the lectures included branch members presenting talks on Liam Mellows, 'The Indian Question', 'Science and Socialism', the Irish language, 'England and the Irish Question', social security and 'The Jewish Question'.<ref name=\":4\" />

===== Allegations of Anti-Semitism =====
O'Riordan asserts that Quill was imposed on the Liam Mellows Branch as Chair to ensure that Labour in Cork City could control the new branch. O'Riordan also argued that the talk on the Jewish question arose following comments made by Timothy Quill on ''<nowiki/>'Jew Boys'''. [[Gerald Goldberg]] was present at the talk and was so impressed by O'Riordan that he subsequently donated £5 to the branch. Quill, perhaps irritated by the talk demanded that the money be returned. 

====== 2001 Labour Party Conference ======
O'Riordan, in a speech to the 2001 Labour Party Conference, stated that ''\"I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the party' with Jewish money. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled by the party.\"''<ref>Irish Labour Party Conference (Cork, 2001)</ref>
{{Quote|text=Following my release from the Curragh Camp and my return to Cork in 1943, I was among those who founded the Liam Mellows Branch of the Labour Party in the hope that it might become the political voice of Irish anti-fascism in this city. I was named secretary of that branch but unfortunately the chairman we were given by the Party leadership was a Cork City Councillor who would debase the name of Labour in 1944 by a vitriolic attack on what he called \"the Jew boys\" of Cork. It was in opposition to such anti-Semitism that I insisted on giving a public lecture under the auspices of the Liam Mellows Branch on the subject of the Jewish question. A number of prominent members of Cork's Jewish community attended that public meeting and the future Lord Mayor of Cork, Gerald Goldberg, said from the floor: \"I came here to defend my people, but when I heard the lecturer I saw there was no need\".

But the anti-Semitic Labour Councillor did not give up. When Gerald Goldberg subsequently made a donation to branch funds I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the Party with Jewish money'. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled from a Party that was not prepared to support my continuing anti-fascist stand in 1944.|author=Michael O'Riordan|title=|source=Labour Party Annual Conference, 2001}}
While there is merit to this claim, it does appear to be more complex than this account. Antisemitism did exist in the city at this time and Quill was a devout Catholic. Barry Desmond in his book 'No Workers Republic' testifies to the antisemitic feeling in the city at the time. There was a strong anti-communist sentiment within Labour and the party had been constantly assailed in the city by professor Alfred O'Rahilly and many figures within the Roman Church, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. The Communist Party in Eire had been disbanded but the NI party still existed. O'Riordan and Nagle attended the NI Communist Party conference in Belfast in October 1943 with four Labour members (including John De Courcey Ireland).

A report in [[The Irish Press|''The'' ''Irish Press'']] suggests that the Administrative Council ''<nowiki/>'had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and accordingly they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Irish Press|date=20/04/1944|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> This was headed up by Vice-Chair, TJ Murphy. They heard the complaint against O'Riordan and Nagle being present at the (NI) Communist Party conference. O'Riordan maintained that he had only attended to meet former comrades socially. Following an investigation, the committee recommended the expulsion of both and the decision was approved of by the Parliamentary Party. The two Cork members were expelled on 5 February 1944 and the 4 Dublin members in April. Both decisions were ratified by the annual conference that year. But there are no reports or minutes of O'Riordan being expelled by the party locally on the Jewish episode but it is likely that it played a role in the expulsions. Likewise, it is clear that Timothy Quill, as a theologian and Christian Socialist held strong anti-Soviet views as possibly anti-Semitic views. The perceived threat of Soviet communism was perhaps the reason that Timothy Quill was nominated as Chair of the Liam Mellows Branch. It was around this time that the IT&GWU disaffiliated from Labour and the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]] and separate Trade Union Congress on the basis that Soviets were infiltrating the Labour Party.

====== Labour vs National Labour ======
One incident involving the branch illustrates the divisions within the party in the city. ''The Cork Examiner'' reported in August 1944 that a deputation of three members of the Leah Mills Branch spoke at a meeting Cork Corporation on the issue of juvenile offenders in the city. They requested a commission to review the issue and that a system of 'constructive reformation' rather than prison punishment take place. After the deputation left the meeting, PJ O'Brien of the National Labour Party launched an attack on the delegation stating that these were members of the Labour Party who sought to introduce 'neo communism' into Cork. Quill, Leader of the Labour Party group in the Corporation angrily objected stating that it was false. The meeting agreed to defer the report to the next meeting. At that meeting on 12 September 1944, the report was adopted.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=23/08/1944|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>

====== Dissolution of the Liam Mellow Branch ======
Following the expulsion of O'Riordan, the Branch was dissolved and the members of the branch transferred to the Central Branch. The Branch voted for the party to reinstate both members, however, this was refused nationally.

====== Retirement from electoral politics ======
Quill did not contest the 1950 Cork Corporation election and seemingly never stood for election again. He remained involved in the co-operative movement until 1954.<ref name=\":4\" />

== Co-operative movement ==
During the 1920s, Quill established the City of Cork Co-operative Society with Con Desmond (father of [[Barry Desmond]]).<ref name=\":4\" /> Quill was the secretary of the City of Cork Co-operative Society and manager and secretary of the Cork Co-operative Bakery Society. This included social enterprises such as Cooperative Tea, Cooperative Bread, Cooperative Baking Powder and Cooperative Cream. He was also a member of the Cork Co-operators' Guild.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Advertisements|date=June 1939|work=The Cork Co-Operator|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> He was also the editor of ''The Cork Co-Operator'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Letters to the Editor|last=|first=|date=January 1940|work=The Cork Co-Operator|access-date=}}</ref> a monthly publication of the [[co-operative movement]] in Cork. The paper attracted the attention of Steve Denny, the director of the London Co-operative Society (England's largest co-op society at the time). In a letter to the editor, published on the cover of the June 1939 issue, Denny described the publication as a 'bright little paper'.<ref>Cork Co-Operator, June 1939, Page 1, Letter from Director of England's biggest Co-operative Society</ref> Quill frequently attended the [[Co-operative Congress|Co-Operative Congress]] in the UK throughout the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Co-Operative Congress 1939 Edition|publisher=|year=1939|isbn=|location=UK|pages=Delegates To Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Co-Operative Congress 1942 Edition|publisher=|year=1942|isbn=|location=UK|pages=Delegates To Congress}}</ref> An article from 1951 states that, inspired by [[Robert Owen]], he built cottages for the workers on his land.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=A Day with 'The Cork Co-Operator' Timothy Quill|last=|first=|date=1951|work=The Evening Echo|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Quill regarded himself as a Christian Socialist.<ref name=\":3\" /> He resigned his position in the co-operative movement in 1954.<ref name=\":1\" />

== Personal life ==
He also used an Irish language version of his name, Taig Ui Cuill, (using various spellings of his first name, including 'Taig', and 'Tadgh'), with his last name spelled as 'Ui Cuill'. Annual reports from 1924 and 1925 show him using the names 'Tadhg O'Quill', 'Tadhg Quill' and 'Tadgh Quill'. Issues of 'The Cork Co-Operator' from 1939 show his name styled as 'T. Quill'.<ref name=ITUC_Annual_report_1924/><ref name=ITUC_Annual_report_1925/><ref name=ITUC_Annual_report_1923/>

In the 1940s, Quill lived at Ferney House in [[Blackrock, Cork]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/places/streetandtradedirectories/guyscorkdirectory1945_25feb/files/assets/basic-html/page20.html|title=Page 38-39 - Guys Cork Almanac 1945_OCR|website=www.corkpastandpresent.ie|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> where he grew vegetables and kept livestock. His first trial of [[Holstein Friesian cattle]] took place here. He served as the honorary secretary of the Irish Friesian Society.<ref name=\":0\" /> His interest in farming manifested itself in a number of different ways. As well as being an active member of the Munster Agricultural Society and he wrote a farming column in The Cork Examiner. By the 1950s he had settled at a property near [[Blarney]], left public life and was Chair of the Blarney National Farmer's Association at the time of his death.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xjEiAQAAIAAJ&q=timothy+quill+cork+county+council&dq=timothy+quill+cork+county+council|title=Annual Report|last=Agriculture|first=Ireland Dept of|date=1959|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=11/06/1960|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]] is a young female who is willing to give up her life to save her father. She enters the army as a man named Ping. She faces the worst enemy China's ever seen, the Hun leader Shan-Yu, who has an army willing to destroy anything in their path. She succeeds in fighting them and saves all of China single-handedly without any help whatsoever . The Emperor of China awards her for her effort and the whole of China celebrate her return.

In [[Mulan (2020 film)|the upcoming 2020 live-action film]], Mulan's surname will be changed \"Hua (花),\" the traditional surname of Mulan, and will assume the pseudonym \"Hua Jun\" during her time in the army.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />

'''Captain/General Li Shang''' is a Chinese [[army captain]]. His speaking voice was provided by [[B.D. Wong]] in all three titles, and his singing vocals were performed by [[Donny Osmond]] ([[Jackie Chan]] in the Cantonese version). During his appointment in the first movie, Shang is a highly capable leader with a dedication to his cause to match, albeit at times being too \"by-the-book\" and putting his duty above his feelings, in contrast to Mulan. He is exceptionally handsome due to his dashing good looks and strong physique. He is reserved and thoughtful, a more logical and calming influence to Mulan's adventurous personality.  Shortly after his initial introduction in ''Mulan'', Shang is appointed newly as an army captain by his father, who is a general. Later through the film, he becomes friends with Ping (who is Fa Mulan disguised as a man), after his life is saved. Shortly after, however, he finds out she is actually a woman, which is forbidden by the empire's law, punishable by death. Shang spares her life, and after helping her save the empire, he falls in love with her and joins her family for dinner. 

In ''[[Mulan II]]'', the film begins with Shang proposing marriage to Mulan, to which she gladly agrees. He is promoted from captain to general by the emperor, and he and Mulan are directed by the emperor to escort his three daughters to a conflicting kingdom in hopes that an arranged marriage between them and the three princes of the opposing nation will bring peace. He and Mulan go through many conflicts around their relationship thanks to Mushu's meddling, and midway through the film, he is assumed dead after falling into a [[canyon]] with streaming [[river]] further down. Later, when it is revealed he is alive (with help from his gray-spotted white horse), [[List of Mulan characters#Mushu|Mushu]] and Cri-Kee saves the day by pretending to be the Golden Dragon of Unity and freeing the princesses from their vows.  Mushu (still posing as the Golden Dragon) marries Mulan and Shang.  Mulan later tells Shang about Mushu and he combines both families’ temples so that Mushu can remain as Mulan's guardian.

Note: In [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)|Chinese naming convention]], personal names in Chinese, unlike Western names, present the family/clan name first.  This convention was followed in the first film; his family name was given to be Li and he was addressed as \"Captain Li.\"  In the second film, the convention was overlooked and Shang was used as his family name by mistake.

In [[Mulan (2020 film)|the upcoming 2020 live-action film]], a similar character is portrayed by [[Yoson An]], called '''Chen Honghui''', a confident and ambitious recruit who joins Commander Tung's unit. He becomes Mulan's most important ally and eventual love interest. His militaristic characteristics were incorporated into Commander Tung as the filmmakers found it uncomfortable for Mulan to have a relationship with a commanding officer, as a result of the [[Me Too movement]] following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases|allegations of sex crimes by Harvey Weinstein]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />

}}
'''Mushu''' is Fa Mulan's closest companion throughout the ''Mulan'' series. He is the only creature that talks. He is a scrawny, tiny, red, orange-accented [[Chinese dragon]] with blue horns and a cheeky-chappy personality. He is voiced by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his first appearance and [[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]] (a professional Eddie Murphy impressionist) afterward.

At first, Mulan's companions were to be two reptilian creatures; the idea of the creatures being dragons had not been established. However, feeling that two sidekicks would overcrowd the story, the animators then decided on a two-headed dragon, though they were green and grotesque. After the animators decided on a single-headed dragon, they established Mushu's physical concept. For better use, the animators shrunk Mushu to a smaller size.<ref name=drawn>From the \"Drawn to Animation\" show in the Animation Building in [[Hollywood Pictures Backlot]] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]].  An animator shows Mushu's development, from a sketched idea to the finished product.</ref>

Around the time when the music of the film was to be created, the songwriters had written a piece for Mushu, for him to sing to assure Mulan that he will be there to help her. However, after Eddie Murphy came to voice the character, the character and his dynamic changed. Although the animators canceled the scene, the song was a favorite among the filmmakers.<ref>According to behind-the-scenes clips on the ''Mulan'' DVD</ref>

Mushu was once a [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]] of Mulan's family, but he has been demoted to the unappreciated position of an incense burner and gong-ringer for the deceased Fa ancestors ever since he failed to protect a family member, a soldier named Fa Deng, resulting in the soldier's demise by [[decapitation]] (he's seen carrying his own head as a spirit). In contrast to Mulan, Mushu is in most situations more zany, impulsive, and enthusiastic.<ref name=archive>{{cite web | work=Disney Archives | title=Mushu Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/mushu/mushu.html}}</ref>

He strives to be one of the family guardians again, but he is content to help Mulan, even if he's the one who starts the trouble.<ref name=archive /> He can also be selfish at times, but his [[hero]]ism proves that he has a good heart.<ref name=archive /> Mushu is very sensitive about his size, claiming to Mulan that his small stature was simply for her convenience rather than his default state. He also hates being mistaken for a lizard, insisting that he doesn't do \"that tongue thing\".

He has the body of a snake, the horns of an elk, the claws of an eagle, and the face of a camel, coming to resemble a legendary dragon found in Chinese art around the time.<ref name=drawn /> He is able to survive more like a mythical creature than an animal; he endures being stomped on, being caught in explosions, and (literally) riding out an avalanche in the first movie. He can also understand other animals, as seen when he converses with Cri-kee (Mulan's cricket) and horse Khan.

At one point when he wants to disguise as a soldier riding a horse to get them out of the camp, he uses a [[giant panda]] as the soldier's steed after Khan, Mulan's horse, refused to help him and Cri-kee. Like many dragons, he is able to breathe fire, at first unsuccessfully, but masters it in time to stop Shan Yu's falcon, Hayabusa, from alerting the Huns to Li Shang's presence.

At the start of the film, Mushu does not make his official appearance until after Mulan runs away from home to serve in her elderly father Fa Zhou's place in a war against the deadly Hun army. Knowing that Mulan's exposure will lead to the disgrace of the Fa family, the spirits of the ancestors choose to send the Great Stone Dragon to retrieve her. For the task of awakening him, they send Mushu, who would rather go himself.

After several unsuccessful attempts, he eventually ends up accidentally destroying the dragon statue. In order to escape punishment from the ancestors, he pretends to be the Great Stone Dragon and secretly sets out to make Mulan a war hero. Mushu is extremely diligent and with the help of Cri-kee, helps Mulan defeat Shan-Yu, resulting in him being returned to the position of a guardian.

In ''[[Mulan II]]'', Mushu serves as an antagonist, though he redeems himself at the end. When Mulan prepares to marry Li Shang, Mushu is at first overjoyed to the point of tears, going as far as planning the wedding himself. His happiness is short-lived, however, when the ancestors gleefully inform him that once Mulan marries Shang, she will become part of his family, and Shang's family guardians will take over guardianship; Mushu would thus lose his status and be demoted back to Gong duty. Desperate to keep his pedestal, he continuously tries to break Mulan and Shang apart while Cri-kee attempts to thwart his attempts. After Cri-kee pressures him to tell the truth to Mulan, this leads her to scold him for his actions before going to reconcile with Shang. 

He later changes his ways, weds them (pretending to be the golden dragon), and decides that he's happy if Mulan's happy. His sacrifice causes Mulan to forgive him for trying to break her and Shang up. He even brings the peace of the kingdom by uniting Shang and Mulan. Mushu also uses his impersonation to save three princesses from being forced into an arranged marriage so they can marry whoever they want. He is then gratified when Shang combines the family temples, allowing Mushu to keep his pedestal.

Mushu will not appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], but at least some of his role in the narrative will be taken by a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hypebae.com/2019/7/mulan-disney-live-action-remake-movie-2020-mushu-replaced-by-phoenix}}</ref>

Mushu also appears in the ''Drawn to Animation'' show at [[Disney California Adventure Park]]'s ''Disney Animation'' building and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]'s [[The Magic of Disney Animation]]. He is also a [[meetable character]] at the parks.

===Cri-Kee===
'''Cri-Kee''' is a \"lucky\" cricket that was given to Mulan while getting her ready to meet the Matchmaker. He is first seen in possession of Grandmother Fa, who crosses a road while covering her eyes to demonstrate Cri-kee's ability; however, his actions lead the Matchmaker to reject Mulan. Afterward, Mulan lets Cri-kee go, but he continues to follow her and later befriends Mushu before joining him on his mission to protect Mulan. During an ambush by the Huns, he and Mushu were nearly killed when the wagon that they're in catches fire and explodes and Cri-kee follows Mulan (who has picked up Mushu while fleeing). Mushu later rescues him from an avalanche that Mulan caused to wipe out the Huns. After Mulan is expelled from the army, Cri-kee finally confesses that he isn't a lucky cricket at all. Despite this, he and Mushu help Mulan stop Shan Yu and save the Emperor, leading Mushu to deem him a lucky bug after all. In the second film, he becomes an enemy to Mushu when he tries to break up Shang and Mulan to keep his job. Cri-kee does whatever he can to foil Mushu's plans and ensure that the duo stays together, even after Mushu causes an accident that results in the destruction of a carriage that Mulan and Shang are using to transport the Emperor's daughters. Later in a canyon, Cri-kee forces Mushu to tell the truth and later becomes friends with Mushu again at the end. He will not appear in the upcoming 2020 live-action remake. He is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].

| alias              = Bori Khan
}}
A physically imposing and ruthless [[Hun]] chieftain and the general of the Huns who serves as the main [[antagonist]] of the film. He is voiced by [[Miguel Ferrer]] in ''Mulan''. Shan Yu is the cruel leader of the Huns who is bent on conquering China, and with his Hun army, climbs over the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and invades the land to prove his \"superiority\" to the Emperor. He is the only Hun to have eyes with black scleras and orange irises.

As his people, Shan Yu is trained in living off the earth, possessing heightened senses and a [[saker falcon]] as his pet. His strength is demonstrated many times during the course of the film, such as easily breaking down a barricaded door or effortlessly slicing through a massive pillar with his sword, making him easily one of the strongest characters in the film (second perhaps only to Chien-Po). Ruthless and cold-hearted, Shan Yu kills without mercy or remorse and, on occasion, as a joke; for example, after freeing two captured Chinese scouts to carry a message to the Emperor, he then comments to an archer, \"How many men does it take to deliver a message?\" (The archer replies \"one\", nocking an arrow.) While clearly heartless to his foes, he is proud of his army, as shown at the beginning when he thought it was perfect that all of China knew him and his army were thereafter the signal fire was lit and when he flatly refused to avoid the Imperial troops and instead opt to take them head on, despite knowing that they are the elite of China's armies.

Sometime after General Li's recruits complete their training, Shan Yu's falcon acquires a doll from a village in the Tung Shao Pass. After close examination of the doll and traces on it by his five main men, Shan Yu deduces that the Imperial Army is waiting for them. Ambushing General Li's army, Shan-Yu wipes out the Emperor's best troops, including General Li, and sets the village on fire, only the aftermath of which is seen in the film. No survivors are found by Li Shang's troops. As they head for the Imperial City, the Hun army ambushes Li Shang's troops in the Tung Shao Pass (Mushu having accidentally given away their position by firing a cannon), and fires flaming arrows from the mountains to disintegrate the army's ammunition. Shan-Yu then leads his entire army to wipe out Li Shang's small battalion. Mulan, however, takes control of Li Shang's last cannon, aiming it for a nearby mountain. This maneuver triggers an avalanche that wipes out almost all of Shan-Yu's army and encases Shan Yu in a blanket of snow. At first, it seems like a victory, thanks to Mulan. Unfortunately, it is not. Following the avalanche and the departure of Li Shang's troops, Shan Yu rises from the snow, shaken and infuriated at the loss of his army. A loud yell of anger is all it takes for Mulan to realize that there is still a chance for the Huns; Shan Yu's pet falcon and five of his best troops had survived the assault. With no one to stop him, Shan Yu and his troops head for the Imperial City with Mulan close behind.

While his troops hide within a Chinese dragon at the Imperial celebration, Shan Yu lies in wait on top of the roof of the Emperor's palace. At the right moment, Shan Yu's falcon retrieves his sword and his troops spring into action, locking up the palace and kidnapping the Emperor. As Shan Yu threatens the Emperor to bow to him, Mulan, Li Shang, Yao, Chien-Pao, and Ling infiltrate the palace in an attempt to rescue the Emperor, the latter three being in drag (as a disguise).  Mulan, Yao, Chien-Po, and Ling defeat Shan Yu's men and his pet falcon is fried by Mushu. After securing the Emperor, in an attempt to distract Shan Yu from Shang (whom he was about to slaughter) Mulan reveals that it was she who destroyed his army. Pursuing her throughout the palace and onto the roof, Shan-Yu's attempt to kill Mulan backfires when Mulan initiates a plan of her own. Immobilizing Shan-Yu on the roof, she steals his sword using a hand fan and pins him to the roof with his own sword while Mushu aims a rocket at Shan Yu. Releasing the rocket, Mushu, Mulan, and Crik-ee escape the roof as the Hun leader is pulled by the rocket into a munitions tower and is destroyed in a brilliant explosion. Mulan is then awarded Shan-Yu's sword for her success at ridding China of the Huns forever.


In an earlier story treatment written by Barry Cook, Shan Yu was originally intended to return in Mulan II where he and his deceased army, all are ghosts now, would have started to haunt Northern China, prompting the Emperor to send Mulan and Shang there. The finale would have involved Shan Yu's ghost army even himself fighting against Mulan and her allies, including the Fa Family Ancestors


In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jason Scott Lee]] and is known as '''Bori Khan''', a warrior leader allied with a powerful witch who is intent on avenging his father's death. He will be the secondary antagonist in the movie. Instead of being Hun, Khan will be of [[Rouran Khaganate|Rouran]] descent.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />

===Yao, Ling and Chien-Po===

}}
The army recruited '''Yao''', '''Ling''' and '''Chien-Po''' to fight the [[Huns]]. Like other newly recruited soldiers, they lacked military skills before they were trained. However, they were harder to train than most. Even [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] learned faster than they. Eventually, their training paid off and the trio were capable fighters. Even so, they still had trouble doing things right and were rather clumsy. They served largely as the [[comic relief]], often involving [[slapstick]] humor that made them reminiscent of [[the Three Stooges]]. Eventually, despite some early conflict, the three extended an open hand to Mulan and became her \"army buddies\", though they, like the rest of the army, though she was a man named Ping. As soldiers, they each had a different color uniform: green for Mulan, red for Yao, yellow for Ling and blue for Chien-Po. Unlike most other soldiers, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po did not seem to think any less of her when they found out she was a woman, and even briefly tried to interfere when Shang was about to execute her. When they later met up, they even agreed to participate in her plan to stop the surviving Huns by disguising themselves as [[Concubinage|concubine]]s. Somehow, they fooled the guards, though none of the three made a very attractive woman (especially Yao, as he kept his facial hair even in makeup).

In the second film, the three were given a more substantial role and are shown not to have changed since the first film. Reprised by the original voice actors (sans Wilder; Watanabe did his own singing), they had been to see the matchmaker that rejected Mulan in the first film, but she decided there could not be a match for any of them and threw them out. They were discouraged but felt better when Mulan and [[Li Shang (Mulan character)|Li Shang]] came to recruit them for another mission. Shang claimed to the emperor that just the five of them would be enough protection for his three daughters. Although still as bumbling as ever, Shang knew that they were instrumental in their victory against the Huns, which they did not appear to have received the same credit for. They gladly joined the escort to get the emperor's daughters to the Qui Gong princes they are engaged to. Along the way, they develop feelings for the princesses, Yao with Mei, Ling with Ting-Ting, and Chien-Po with Su. They take the princesses to a carnival for some amusement. Eventually, all three princesses admit that their feeling is mutual, and do not want to marry the princes, despite their duty. Mulan, knowing this, leaves the trio with the princesses, and goes to offer herself to the royal family instead. However, the trio arrives with the princesses, as does Shang. [[Mushu]] pretends to be the Great Golden Dragon of Unity who commands that they are allowed to marry whoever they want, allowing them to be with Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po. Presumably, they did marry, though nothing was shown to indicate this.

====Yao====
'''Yao''' is the self-appointed leader of the trio. His signature color is [[red]] in the first film and [[purple]] in the second film. An arrogant and short-tempered individual with a bit of a [[Napoleon complex]], he is short, stocky and has a permanent black eye. In the first film, he enjoys picking on Mulan for fun at first but eventually becomes her friend. His clumsiness reveals, however, that he is not as powerful a man as he claims to be. He states about wanting a girl who'd admire his strength and battle scars.

In the second film, he reveals a rewarding [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] that has a picture of himself on his chest and falls in love with Princess Mei, the emperor's middle daughter. She accepted the idea that \"my duty is to my heart\" and is the easiest to be won over. In his encounter, he puts the slipper back onto her foot and sets the table for her with [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[baozi|meat bun]]s and [[tea]]. He wanted to marry a girl who would be impressed with his looks and his fighting ability. Although such traits leave something to be desired, he managed to impress her, and when he wins a fight at a carnival and is given a prize, he chooses a stuffed [[giant panda|panda bear]] with three black legs and one white leg and gives it to her.

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Chen Tang (actor)|Chen Tang]].

====Ling====
'''Ling''' is the group's middleman of medium height and very slim build. His signature color is [[yellow]] in the first film and [[blue]] in the second film. He is a friendly and enthusiastic man with a joke for every occasion. Though he teases Mulan at first, he, like the other two, becomes her friend. He and Yao occasionally have disagreements, but he grows to accept him as their leader. He was the one who coined the phrase \"a girl worth fighting for.\"

In the second film, he falls in love with Princess Ting-Ting, the eldest princess. She is the most uptight princess, devoted to honor, and tries be a role model to her sisters. Ling, who wanted a girl who would laugh at his jokes (even knowing the chopstick nose trick that Ling believes to have invented), had to try harder than his partners to impress her. Unlike most people, Ting-Ting is amused by his puns, but would not laugh, claiming to dislike laughter, though the reason is that she thinks her snorting laugh is embarrassing. He begins to doubt himself. However, at the carnival, when some fireflies accidentally set off firecrackers that hit Ling, she cannot contain herself at his misfortune. She snorts, but Ling doesn't mind and thinks it's cute. At the end, they are able to get married because of Mushu.

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jimmy Wong]].

====Chien-Po====
'''Chien-Po''', or '''Po''' for short, is by far the tallest and most obese of Mulan's friends with a bald head. His signature color is [[blue]] in the first film and [[green]] in the second film. He is the calmest and most spiritual of the three, and his appearance seems to have been inspired by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] imagery. He is rather naïve compared to his partners, and loves food more than anything, which is the main thing he considers when searching for a woman for he wishes for a wife that will be good at cooking and preparing food. He is very good-natured and would never do anything to upset anyone, making him the most ready to befriend Mulan. He also possesses great strength and can lift multiple people (or a massive stone statue) with ease.

In the second film, he falls in love with Princess Su, the youngest sister. The most childlike, she is easily swayed and is soon convinced of Mei's opinions. She loves food as much as Chien-Po, and when the group stops traveling for a while, she spends her time picking fruit from trees. Chien-Po discovers this, and the two of them bond easily. He even saves her when the carriage ends up falling in the water. At the carnival, they both order some [[dumpling]]s, [[ginger]], [[Ginseng]]s and [[soybean]]s.

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Doua Moua]].

==Characters from ''Mulan''==

===The Fa family===
====Fa Zhou====
'''Fa Zhou''' is Mulan's father who is very strict and also a famed war veteran who got injured in war. At first glance he seems like he only cares about the honor of the family and that he is quick to frustration with Mulan. He first appears putting an incense stick on the hanging dish and praying to the honorable ancestors while Mulan is seeing the matchmaker. Nothing distracts him from his prayers, even when [[chicken]]s go running around in the shrine to crazily devour the [[chicken feed]]. When Chi-Fu calls him from the Fa family for military duty, he puts down the cane, stands straight and accepts his assignment scroll, not caring about his old crippled body despite his limping and visible pain. Mulan worries that he is risking his life, especially after seeing him collapse after some sword exercises. When Mulan returns in a triumph of defeating Shan Yu, she gives him Shan Yu's sword with the blade wrapped in cloth and the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the emperor; the two gifts that honor the Fa Family. On receiving these gifts, he immediately puts them down and confesses that all he ever wanted was Mulan to be happy and safe, informing her that his greatest honor is having her as a daughter. He was voiced by [[Soon-Tek Oh]].

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Tzi Ma]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />
====Fa Li====
'''Fa Li''' is Mulan's mother. She initially stays with the dresser waiting for Mulan to come. She is frustrated when her daughter's hair is messed with [[hay]] and sends her inside to have her bathed and cleaned up. She and all the dressers help her get dressed after the bath. After they have finished beautifying Mulan, she sends her to the impatient matchmaker who then gets enraged by Mulan's accidents. Fa Li consoles her after the matchmaker rejects her. During the rainy night, she weeps for her daughter who runs away with Khan the horse, and her husband Fa Zhou consoles her while watching over her at the same time. When Li Shang shows up in the middle of a conversation between Fa Li and Grandmother Fa about Mulan's war exploits and that she should've brought a man home, Fa Li is left stunned. According to her second film, the only other child she likes is Sha-Ron (a faux-Chinese version of the name [[Sharon (disambiguation)|Sharon]]), a little girl who wears a lavender outfit and [[bun (hairstyle)#Double bun|ox-horns]]. She was voiced by [[Freda Foh Shen]].

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action film]], she is portrayed by [[Rosalind Chao]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />

====Grandmother Fa====
'''Grandmother Fa''' is Mulan's grandmother. She is very easy-going and gives Mulan the most freedom. She also provides comic relief in the family. She is first seen holding a cage with Cri-Kee in it. She covers her eyes while crossing a road and demonstrates the ability to show how lucky this cricket is. After Fa Li and all the dressers have finished beautifying Mulan, Grandma Fa gives her a few items to make her look perfect (apple, pendant, jade necklace and Cri-Kee). She constantly encourages her to find a good husband. During the rainy night, she recognizes that her granddaughter has run away to join the army in her father's place, and she picks up a [[lantern]] and prays to the ancestors, awakening First Ancestor Fa. When Mulan returns home with Shan Yu's sword and the Emperor's crest, she comments that Mulan should have brought a man home and is shocked when Li Shang arrives, causing her to jokingly say to sign her up for the next war.  When Mulan asks Shang to stay for dinner, she asks him to stay forever. Mulan is shown to be fondly annoyed by this but Shang does agree to stay for dinner. In her second film, she plays a game in the house of Fa and brings in food for the perfect couple Mulan and Shang. Her speaking voice is provided by [[June Foray]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Marni Nixon]].

====First Ancestor Fa====
'''First Ancestor Fa''' is the ghostly eldest member of the Fa family and acts as leader of the ancestors. He carries a staff with him. When he is summoned, he brings Mushu to life by saying the word \"awaken\". He usually stops the other ancestors from fighting and requests (what he thinks are) better plans such as summoning the Great Stone Dragon. When Mushu returns with Mulan, he gives him his job as a guardian again, though showing a frustrated face. At the beginning of his second film, he performs something interesting with the forming of smoke. He was voiced by [[George Takei]].

=====Other Ancestors=====
'''Other Ancestors''', members of the company including the farmer and his wife (a parody of the famous painting [[American Gothic]]), and the counter who is always fiddling with his [[abacus]]. Fa Deng is the only ancestor whose head is cut off, a result of Mushu's misguidance to him when he was a guardian. Many of these ancestors clamor about Mulan when she's away. [[Mary Kay Bergman]] did the voice of the female ancestors in the first film and in the second film, they are voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].

===Khan===
'''Khan''' is Mulan's [[horse]] with a [[black]] coat and [[white]] markings on his face, belly and legs. He is portrayed as a very intelligent and confident horse. When he first saw Mushu, he tried to kill him with his hooves out of fear. In the first film, during the surprise ambush on the mountains, Mulan causes an [[avalanche]] killing many Huns. Khan risks his life to save Mulan and tries his best to run to safety before he almost falls to his death off the cliff. He also seems to be very close to Mulan but doesn't like Mushu so much. In the second film, he gets angry at Mushu who tries to break Mulan and Shang up after his [[saddle]] is unbuckled and in one of his attempts, he injures him by stomping on him with his [[Horse hoof|hooves]] as payback. Khan is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].

He will appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]].

===Little Brother===
'''Little Brother''' is Mulan's pet dog. He has a blue [[Dog collar|collar]] around his neck. Mulan often uses him to spread chicken feeds by hanging a bone in front of him, similar to the [[carrot on a stick]] trick. He is voiced by [[Chris Sanders]] in the first movie and [[Frank Welker]] in the second movie.

===The Emperor of China===
Based on the real-life emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], this character is shown as the wisest of all China. He lives in a palace (modeled, perhaps anachronistically, upon the [[Forbidden City]]) and he has a long mustache and beard. [[Yellow]] is the color that he wears. In his first film, when everybody's ambushed, he gets captured by Shan Yu and his henchmen resulting his hat to fall off, but then with Mulan and Shang, in order to save him, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (disguised as concubines) trick Shan Yu's henchmen into being attracted to them and so dropping their guard. After Shan Yu is terminated, the emperor comes down the steps and, though he sternly reprimands Mulan for impersonating a soldier, he then thanks her for saving their beloved country. He is the first person to bow to her, and even offers her a position on his council, but Mulan politely declines the offer by saying that she feels she should return to her family. In gratitude, he takes off his crest and puts it on her neck and gives Shan Yu's sword to her as tokens for her efforts, the crest representing what she did for him while the sword represents what she did for China. After she leaves, he puts his hat back on and tells Li Shang to go after her, noting that \"You don't meet a girl like that every [[dynasty|dynas-day]]\". His role is a little smaller in the second film, where he suggests Mulan and Shang to take his daughters to Qui-Gong as part of the mission.

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jet Li]].

===Chi-Fu===
'''Chi-Fu''' is a member of the Emperor's council and adviser to Li Shang who refuses to allow the recruits to join the battle against the Huns and serves as a minor antagonist of the film. He is shown to harbor substantial prejudice towards women. He is most often clad in [[Blue]] and places considerable importance on his clothing. He is shown to be devoted to his job and loyal to the Emperor, but is incompetent, [[egotism|egotistic]], pompous and [[misogyny|misogynistic]], as he silences Mulan and tells Fa Zhou to teach her silence in a man's presence, orders Li Shang to execute her once her secret is revealed, despite her saving everyone, and close to the film's conclusion pompously scoffs to Shang that Mulan would never be worth anything because she's a woman. At the end of the film, as the Emperor praises Mulan for defeating Shan-Yu and saving China, he tells Chi-Fu to arrange Mulan for membership in his council. Still believing that Mulan isn't worth anything because she is a woman, Chi-Fu attempts to dissuade him from doing so by claiming that there are no more available seats in the council, but this backfires when the Emperor tells Mulan she can have Chi-Fu's job, causing him to faint. He does not appear in ''Mulan II'', but it is shown that someone strikingly similar to Chi-Fu is a royal adviser to Lord Qin of [[Qigong]]. He was voiced by [[James Hong]].

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he will be replaced by '''The Chancellor''' (portrayed by [[Nelson Lee]]).

===General Li===
'''General Li''' was Li Shang's father and a high-ranking member of the Chinese army who was killed along with his elite troops in a battle against the Hun army, leaving his helmet behind to be found by his son and his battalion when they discover the aftermath. He was voiced by [[James Shigeta]].

===The Matchmaker===
This character is an impatient and harsh woman, who obnoxiously judges potential brides. After the musical number called \"Honor To Us All,\" she opens the doors, calls Mulan's name and takes her inside. She distastefully judges Mulan, calling her too skinny, and asks her to pour the tea as the second part of the test. Cri-Kee, who attempts to escape, ends up in the Matchmaker's cup of tea, and when Mulan tries to take the cup back, The Matchmaker falls on the floor where Cri-Kee gets into the clothing and when she gets up to tell Mulan what happened, she notices that Cri-Kee is in her clothing, causing her to crash into a stove, lighting her backside on burning embers; Mulan tries to extinguish with a paper fan, but the hot embers turn into fire, which Mulan manages to extinguish by pouring the tea on her. Blaming Mulan for the troubles, she publicly humiliates her and says that she will never bring any honor to her family being a wife. She also called Mulan a disgrace when the Matchmaker was the real disgrace. Grandmother Fa noticed her as a little stinker. The second film reveals that she's \"smug and snooty,\" as accused by Ling, which causes her to throw a [[Pottery|pot]] onto his head as she flings out the masculine trio. She is voiced by [[Miriam Margolyes]] in the first film and [[April Winchell]] in the second film.

She will appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]] and be portrayed by [[Cheng Pei-pei]].

===Hayabusa===
Hayabusa is Shan Yu's pet [[saker falcon]], who acts as his master's eyes and ears from the distance. At the end of the first film, his feathers are burned down by a fireball from Mushu to stop him from warning the Huns of Li Shang's presence, who then taunts him as \"[[Mongolian barbecue|Mongolian barbeque]]\" while Cri-kee laughs at him. He isn't seen afterward.

In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Hayabusa appears in the boss battle against Shan Yu. He can grab Sora, lift him into the air, and throw him.

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action film]], Hayabusa has been replaced by '''Xian Lang''' (portrayed by [[Gong Li]]), a powerful witch allied with Bori Khan who can transform herself into a falcon. She will be the main antagonist of the film.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />

==Characters from ''Mulan II''==

===Daughters of the Emperor of China===
The Emperor of China's three children that are known anyway; Ting-Ting, Mei and Su are princesses. He sends them into the [[carriage]] to complete the mission which is to marry the Princes of Qui Gong hiding their pretty faces with [[Fan (implement)|paper fan]]s. When in the carriage, these princesses begin to panic as Mushu causes it to slide down by banging his head on the wheel.

*'''Ting-Ting''' is the eldest daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[indigo]] and she is taller than both of her sisters. After Mushu has caused the carriage to slide down, she forces her younger sisters out and tries to escape, but her foot is stuck only to be saved by Ling and the carriage breaks afterward. When she hears his jokes, she thinks they are funny but she tries not to laugh, as she has an embarrassing snorting laugh. However, when the [[firecracker]]s lit by the [[firefly|fireflies]] hit him, she laughs, which causes her to snort like a pig, which Ling thought was cute. Ting-Ting appears as mature and level-headed but is actually carefree in her heart. Her speaking voice is provided by Canadian award-winning actress [[Sandra Oh]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Judy Kuhn]]. She is Crown Princess of China and one day to be ''Her Majesty'' The Empress of China.

*'''Mei''' is the middle daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[pink]] and she is in between her sisters in height. She likes to get along with Yao because she thinks he is good-looking and gentle at heart. She is convinced by Mulan that her duty is to her heart and she knows that it is true. Frustrated by her older sister, she drops her fan to get in the tent and writes, \"And so, my dear father, I cannot complete this mission. I have come to realize that my duty is to my heart.\" When Yao has won a wrestling fight, he chooses the stuffed [[Giant panda|panda bear]] and he shares it with her. Considered a slight [[Damsel in distress|damsel-in-distress]], she has been kidnapped by the enemies of China when the heroes have been knocked down during their fight but saved by her friends. Mei is passionate, brave and caring. Her speaking voice is provided by [[Lucy Liu]] and her singing voice is provided by Beth Blankenship.

*'''Su''' is the youngest daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and she is shorter than both of her sisters. Her favorite thing to do is gathering food from the trees and she likes to spend time with Chien-Po who likes food also. When the carriage is damaged and the [[fruit]] floats in the water, she picks them up again and she gets saved by him too. She is bright, childish and cheerful. Her speaking voice is provided by [[Lauren Tom]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Mandy Gonzalez]].

===Sha-Ron===
'''Sha-Ron''' is a very excited little girl. She first visits Fa Li and says that she wants to see Mulan, who's practicing kung-fu with a rake. Then as she goes outside and drops the [[bucket]]s down, she and all of the other excited daughters of the villagers meet her and get trained on how to fight enemies as so during the \"Lesson Number One\" musical number. Then as General Shang arrives, she takes his helmet with more excitement and runs home. She is voiced by Jillian Henry.

===Lord Qin and Prince Jeeki===
'''Lord Qin''' is the priest of [[Qigong]]. When Mulan is about to complete the mission, he allows her to marry his son '''Prince Jeeki''' who likes playing with the [[Chinese finger trap]]. As Lord Qin engages Mulan and his son, their wedding is interrupted and he makes Shang go away until the Golden Dragon of Unity begins to talk with Mushu's voice. He timidly allows Mulan and Shang to marry each other and then begins to play with the fingertip Jeeki used to play with. Lord Qin is voiced by  [[Keone Young]] and Prince Jeeki is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]].

==Characters from ''Mulan'' (2020 film)==

==Main characters==
===Fa Mulan / Ping===
{{Main|Mulan (Disney character)}} 

[[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]] is a young female who is willing to give up her life to save her father. She enters the army as a man named Ping. She faces the worst enemy China's ever seen, the Hun leader Shan-Yu, who has an army willing to destroy anything in their path. She succeeds in fighting them and saves all of China single-handedly without any help whatsoever . The Emperor of China awards her for her effort and the whole of China celebrate her return.

In [[Mulan (2020 film)|the upcoming 2020 live-action film]], Mulan's surname will be changed \"Hua (花),\" the traditional surname of Mulan, and will assume the pseudonym \"Hua Jun\" during her time in the army.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />

}}
'''Captain/General Li Shang''' is a Chinese [[army captain]]. His speaking voice was provided by [[B.D. Wong]] in all three titles, and his singing vocals were performed by [[Donny Osmond]] ([[Jackie Chan]] in the Cantonese version). During his appointment in the first movie, Shang is a highly capable leader with a dedication to his cause to match, albeit at times being too \"by-the-book\" and putting his duty above his feelings, in contrast to Mulan. He is exceptionally handsome due to his dashing good looks and strong physique. He is reserved and thoughtful, a more logical and calming influence to Mulan's adventurous personality.  Shortly after his initial introduction in ''Mulan'', Shang is appointed newly as an army captain by his father, who is a general. Later through the film, he becomes friends with Ping (who is Fa Mulan disguised as a man), after his life is saved. Shortly after, however, he finds out she is actually a woman, which is forbidden by the empire's law, punishable by death. Shang spares her life, and after helping her save the empire, he falls in love with her and joins her family for dinner. 

In ''[[Mulan II]]'', the film begins with Shang proposing marriage to Mulan, to which she gladly agrees. He is promoted from captain to general by the emperor, and he and Mulan are directed by the emperor to escort his three daughters to a conflicting kingdom in hopes that an arranged marriage between them and the three princes of the opposing nation will bring peace. He and Mulan go through many conflicts around their relationship thanks to Mushu's meddling, and midway through the film, he is assumed dead after falling into a [[canyon]] with streaming [[river]] further down. Later, when it is revealed he is alive (with help from his gray-spotted white horse), [[List of Mulan characters#Mushu|Mushu]] and Cri-Kee saves the day by pretending to be the Golden Dragon of Unity and freeing the princesses from their vows.  Mushu (still posing as the Golden Dragon) marries Mulan and Shang.  Mulan later tells Shang about Mushu and he combines both families’ temples so that Mushu can remain as Mulan's guardian.

Note: In [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)|Chinese naming convention]], personal names in Chinese, unlike Western names, present the family/clan name first.  This convention was followed in the first film; his family name was given to be Li and he was addressed as \"Captain Li.\"  In the second film, the convention was overlooked and Shang was used as his family name by mistake.

In [[Mulan (2020 film)|the upcoming 2020 live-action film]], a similar character is portrayed by [[Yoson An]], called '''Chen Honghui''', a confident and ambitious recruit who joins Commander Tung's unit. He becomes Mulan's most important ally and eventual love interest. His militaristic characteristics were incorporated into Commander Tung as the filmmakers found it uncomfortable for Mulan to have a relationship with a commanding officer, as a result of the [[Me Too movement]] following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases|the allegations of sex crimes by Harvey Weinstein]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />

===Mushu===

}}
'''Mushu''' is Fa Mulan's closest companion throughout the ''Mulan'' series. He is the only creature that talks. He is a scrawny, tiny, red, orange-accented [[Chinese dragon]] with blue horns and a cheeky-chappy personality. He is voiced by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his first appearance and [[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]] (a professional Eddie Murphy impressionist) afterward.

At first, Mulan's companions were to be two reptilian creatures; the idea of the creatures being dragons had not been established. However, feeling that two sidekicks would overcrowd the story, the animators then decided on a two-headed dragon, though they were green and grotesque. After the animators decided on a single-headed dragon, they established Mushu's physical concept. For better use, the animators shrunk Mushu to a smaller size.<ref name=drawn>From the \"Drawn to Animation\" show in the Animation Building in [[Hollywood Pictures Backlot]] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]].  An animator shows Mushu's development, from a sketched idea to the finished product.</ref>

Around the time when the music of the film was to be created, the songwriters had written a piece for Mushu, for him to sing to assure Mulan that he will be there to help her. However, after Eddie Murphy came to voice the character, the character and his dynamic changed. Although the animators canceled the scene, the song was a favorite among the filmmakers.<ref>According to behind-the-scenes clips on the ''Mulan'' DVD</ref>

Mushu was once a [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]] of Mulan's family, but he has been demoted to the unappreciated position of an incense burner and gong-ringer for the deceased Fa ancestors ever since he failed to protect a family member, a soldier named Fa Deng, resulting in the soldier's demise by [[decapitation]] (he's seen carrying his own head as a spirit). In contrast to Mulan, Mushu is in most situations more zany, impulsive, and enthusiastic.<ref name=archive>{{cite web | work=Disney Archives | title=Mushu Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/mushu/mushu.html}}</ref>

He strives to be one of the family guardians again, but he is content to help Mulan, even if he's the one who starts the trouble.<ref name=archive /> He can also be selfish at times, but his [[hero]]ism proves that he has a good heart.<ref name=archive /> Mushu is very sensitive about his size, claiming to Mulan that his small stature was simply for her convenience rather than his default state. He also hates being mistaken for a lizard, insisting that he doesn't do \"that tongue thing\".

He has the body of a snake, the horns of an elk, the claws of an eagle, and the face of a camel, coming to resemble a legendary dragon found in Chinese art around the time.<ref name=drawn /> He is able to survive more like a mythical creature than an animal; he endures being stomped on, being caught in explosions, and (literally) riding out an avalanche in the first movie. He can also understand other animals, as seen when he converses with Cri-kee (Mulan's cricket) and horse Khan.

At one point when he wants to disguise as a soldier riding a horse to get them out of the camp, he uses a [[giant panda]] as the soldier's steed after Khan, Mulan's horse, refused to help him and Cri-kee. Like many dragons, he is able to breathe fire, at first unsuccessfully, but masters it in time to stop Shan Yu's falcon, Hayabusa, from alerting the Huns to Li Shang's presence.

At the start of the film, Mushu does not make his official appearance until after Mulan runs away from home to serve in her elderly father Fa Zhou's place in a war against the deadly Hun army. Knowing that Mulan's exposure will lead to the disgrace of the Fa family, the spirits of the ancestors choose to send the Great Stone Dragon to retrieve her. For the task of awakening him, they send Mushu, who would rather go himself.

After several unsuccessful attempts, he eventually ends up accidentally destroying the dragon statue. In order to escape punishment from the ancestors, he pretends to be the Great Stone Dragon and secretly sets out to make Mulan a war hero. Mushu is extremely diligent and with the help of Cri-kee, helps Mulan defeat Shan-Yu, resulting in him being returned to the position of a guardian.

In ''[[Mulan II]]'', Mushu serves as an antagonist, though he redeems himself at the end. When Mulan prepares to marry Li Shang, Mushu is at first overjoyed to the point of tears, going as far as planning the wedding himself. His happiness is short-lived, however, when the ancestors gleefully inform him that once Mulan marries Shang, she will become part of his family, and Shang's family guardians will take over guardianship; Mushu would thus lose his status and be demoted back to Gong duty. Desperate to keep his pedestal, he continuously tries to break Mulan and Shang apart while Cri-kee attempts to thwart his attempts. After Cri-kee pressures him to tell the truth to Mulan, this leads her to scold him for his actions before going to reconcile with Shang. 

He later changes his ways, weds them (pretending to be the golden dragon), and decides that he's happy if Mulan's happy. His sacrifice causes Mulan to forgive him for trying to break her and Shang up. He even brings the peace of the kingdom by uniting Shang and Mulan. Mushu also uses his impersonation to save three princesses from being forced into an arranged marriage so they can marry whoever they want. He is then gratified when Shang combines the family temples, allowing Mushu to keep his pedestal.

Mushu will not appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], but at least some of his role in the narrative will be taken by a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hypebae.com/2019/7/mulan-disney-live-action-remake-movie-2020-mushu-replaced-by-phoenix}}</ref>

Mushu also appears in the ''Drawn to Animation'' show at [[Disney California Adventure Park]]'s ''Disney Animation'' building and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]'s [[The Magic of Disney Animation]]. He is also a [[meetable character]] at the parks.

===Cri-Kee===
'''Cri-Kee''' is a \"lucky\" cricket that was given to Mulan while getting her ready to meet the Matchmaker. He is first seen in possession of Grandmother Fa, who crosses a road while covering her eyes to demonstrate Cri-kee's ability; however, his actions lead the Matchmaker to reject Mulan. Afterward, Mulan lets Cri-kee go, but he continues to follow her and later befriends Mushu before joining him on his mission to protect Mulan. During an ambush by the Huns, he and Mushu were nearly killed when the wagon that they're in catches fire and explodes and Cri-kee follows Mulan (who has picked up Mushu while fleeing). Mushu later rescues him from an avalanche that Mulan caused to wipe out the Huns. After Mulan is expelled from the army, Cri-kee finally confesses that he isn't a lucky cricket at all. Despite this, he and Mushu help Mulan stop Shan Yu and save the Emperor, leading Mushu to deem him a lucky bug after all. In the second film, he becomes an enemy to Mushu when he tries to break up Shang and Mulan to keep his job. Cri-kee does whatever he can to foil Mushu's plans and ensure that the duo stays together, even after Mushu causes an accident that results in the destruction of a carriage that Mulan and Shang are using to transport the Emperor's daughters. Later in a canyon, Cri-kee forces Mushu to tell the truth and later becomes friends with Mushu again at the end. He will not appear in the upcoming 2020 live-action remake. He is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].

| alias              = Bori Khan
}}
A physically imposing and ruthless [[Hun]] chieftain and the general of the Huns who serves as the main [[antagonist]] of the film. He is voiced by [[Miguel Ferrer]] in ''Mulan''. Shan Yu is the cruel leader of the Huns who is bent on conquering China, and with his Hun army, climbs over the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and invades the land to prove his \"superiority\" to the Emperor. He is the only Hun to have eyes with black scleras and orange irises.

As his people, Shan Yu is trained in living off the earth, possessing heightened senses and a [[saker falcon]] as his pet. His strength is demonstrated many times during the course of the film, such as easily breaking down a barricaded door or effortlessly slicing through a massive pillar with his sword, making him easily one of the strongest characters in the film (second perhaps only to Chien-Po). Ruthless and cold-hearted, Shan Yu kills without mercy or remorse and, on occasion, as a joke; for example, after freeing two captured Chinese scouts to carry a message to the Emperor, he then comments to an archer, \"How many men does it take to deliver a message?\" (The archer replies \"one\", nocking an arrow.) While clearly heartless to his foes, he is proud of his army, as shown at the beginning when he thought it was perfect that all of China knew him and his army were thereafter the signal fire was lit and when he flatly refused to avoid the Imperial troops and instead opt to take them head on, despite knowing that they are the elite of China's armies.

Sometime after General Li's recruits complete their training, Shan Yu's falcon acquires a doll from a village in the Tung Shao Pass. After close examination of the doll and traces on it by his five main men, Shan Yu deduces that the Imperial Army is waiting for them. Ambushing General Li's army, Shan-Yu wipes out the Emperor's best troops, including General Li, and sets the village on fire, only the aftermath of which is seen in the film. No survivors are found by Li Shang's troops. As they head for the Imperial City, the Hun army ambushes Li Shang's troops in the Tung Shao Pass (Mushu having accidentally given away their position by firing a cannon), and fires flaming arrows from the mountains to disintegrate the army's ammunition. Shan-Yu then leads his entire army to wipe out Li Shang's small battalion. Mulan, however, takes control of Li Shang's last cannon, aiming it for a nearby mountain. This maneuver triggers an avalanche that wipes out almost all of Shan-Yu's army and encases Shan Yu in a blanket of snow. At first, it seems like a victory, thanks to Mulan. Unfortunately, it is not. Following the avalanche and the departure of Li Shang's troops, Shan Yu rises from the snow, shaken and infuriated at the loss of his army. A loud yell of anger is all it takes for Mulan to realize that there is still a chance for the Huns; Shan Yu's pet falcon and five of his best troops had survived the assault. With no one to stop him, Shan Yu and his troops head for the Imperial City with Mulan close behind.

While his troops hide within a Chinese dragon at the Imperial celebration, Shan Yu lies in wait on top of the roof of the Emperor's palace. At the right moment, Shan Yu's falcon retrieves his sword and his troops spring into action, locking up the palace and kidnapping the Emperor. As Shan Yu threatens the Emperor to bow to him, Mulan, Li Shang, Yao, Chien-Pao, and Ling infiltrate the palace in an attempt to rescue the Emperor, the latter three being in drag (as a disguise).  Mulan, Yao, Chien-Po, and Ling defeat Shan Yu's men and his pet falcon is fried by Mushu. After securing the Emperor, in an attempt to distract Shan Yu from Shang (whom he was about to slaughter) Mulan reveals that it was she who destroyed his army. Pursuing her throughout the palace and onto the roof, Shan-Yu's attempt to kill Mulan backfires when Mulan initiates a plan of her own. Immobilizing Shan-Yu on the roof, she steals his sword using a hand fan and pins him to the roof with his own sword while Mushu aims a rocket at Shan Yu. Releasing the rocket, Mushu, Mulan, and Crik-ee escape the roof as the Hun leader is pulled by the rocket into a munitions tower and is destroyed in a brilliant explosion. Mulan is then awarded Shan-Yu's sword for her success at ridding China of the Huns forever.


In an earlier story treatment written by Barry Cook, Shan Yu was originally intended to return in Mulan II where he and his deceased army, all are ghosts now, would have started to haunt Northern China, prompting the Emperor to send Mulan and Shang there. The finale would have involved Shan Yu's ghost army even himself fighting against Mulan and her allies, including the Fa Family Ancestors


In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jason Scott Lee]] and is known as '''Bori Khan''', a warrior leader allied with a powerful witch who is intent on avenging his father's death. He will be the secondary antagonist in the movie. Instead of being Hun, Khan will be of [[Rouran Khaganate|Rouran]] descent.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />

===Yao, Ling and Chien-Po===

}}
The army recruited '''Yao''', '''Ling''' and '''Chien-Po''' to fight the [[Huns]]. Like other newly recruited soldiers, they lacked military skills before they were trained. However, they were harder to train than most. Even [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] learned faster than they. Eventually, their training paid off and the trio were capable fighters. Even so, they still had trouble doing things right and were rather clumsy. They served largely as the [[comic relief]], often involving [[slapstick]] humor that made them reminiscent of [[the Three Stooges]]. Eventually, despite some early conflict, the three extended an open hand to Mulan and became her \"army buddies\", though they, like the rest of the army, though she was a man named Ping. As soldiers, they each had a different color uniform: green for Mulan, red for Yao, yellow for Ling and blue for Chien-Po. Unlike most other soldiers, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po did not seem to think any less of her when they found out she was a woman, and even briefly tried to interfere when Shang was about to execute her. When they later met up, they even agreed to participate in her plan to stop the surviving Huns by disguising themselves as [[Concubinage|concubine]]s. Somehow, they fooled the guards, though none of the three made a very attractive woman (especially Yao, as he kept his facial hair even in makeup).

In the second film, the three were given a more substantial role and are shown not to have changed since the first film. Reprised by the original voice actors (sans Wilder; Watanabe did his own singing), they had been to see the matchmaker that rejected Mulan in the first film, but she decided there could not be a match for any of them and threw them out. They were discouraged but felt better when Mulan and [[Li Shang (Mulan character)|Li Shang]] came to recruit them for another mission. Shang claimed to the emperor that just the five of them would be enough protection for his three daughters. Although still as bumbling as ever, Shang knew that they were instrumental in their victory against the Huns, which they did not appear to have received the same credit for. They gladly joined the escort to get the emperor's daughters to the Qui Gong princes they are engaged to. Along the way, they develop feelings for the princesses, Yao with Mei, Ling with Ting-Ting, and Chien-Po with Su. They take the princesses to a carnival for some amusement. Eventually, all three princesses admit that their feeling is mutual, and do not want to marry the princes, despite their duty. Mulan, knowing this, leaves the trio with the princesses, and goes to offer herself to the royal family instead. However, the trio arrives with the princesses, as does Shang. [[Mushu]] pretends to be the Great Golden Dragon of Unity who commands that they are allowed to marry whoever they want, allowing them to be with Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po. Presumably, they did marry, though nothing was shown to indicate this.

'''Yao''' is the self-appointed leader of the trio. His signature color is [[red]] in the first film and [[purple]] in the second film. An arrogant and short-tempered individual with a bit of a [[Napoleon complex]], he is short, stocky and has a permanent black eye. In the first film, he enjoys picking on Mulan for fun at first but eventually becomes her friend. His clumsiness reveals, however, that he is not as powerful a man as he claims to be. He states about wanting a girl who'd admire his strength and battle scars.

In the second film, he reveals a rewarding [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] that has a picture of himself on his chest and falls in love with Princess Mei, the emperor's middle daughter. She accepted the idea that \"my duty is to my heart\" and is the easiest to be won over. In his encounter, he puts the slipper back onto her foot and sets the table for her with [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[baozi|meat bun]]s and [[tea]]. He wanted to marry a girl who would be impressed with his looks and his fighting ability. Although such traits leave something to be desired, he managed to impress her, and when he wins a fight at a carnival and is given a prize, he chooses a stuffed [[giant panda|panda bear]] with three black legs and one white leg and gives it to her.

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Chen Tang (actor)|Chen Tang]].

====Ling====
'''Ling''' is the group's middleman of medium height and very slim build. His signature color is [[yellow]] in the first film and [[blue]] in the second film. He is a friendly and enthusiastic man with a joke for every occasion. Though he teases Mulan at first, he, like the other two, becomes her friend. He and Yao occasionally have disagreements, but he grows to accept him as their leader. He was the one who coined the phrase \"a girl worth fighting for.\"

In the second film, he falls in love with Princess Ting-Ting, the eldest princess. She is the most uptight princess, devoted to honor, and tries be a role model to her sisters. Ling, who wanted a girl who would laugh at his jokes (even knowing the chopstick nose trick that Ling believes to have invented), had to try harder than his partners to impress her. Unlike most people, Ting-Ting is amused by his puns, but would not laugh, claiming to dislike laughter, though the reason is that she thinks her snorting laugh is embarrassing. He begins to doubt himself. However, at the carnival, when some fireflies accidentally set off firecrackers that hit Ling, she cannot contain herself at his misfortune. She snorts, but Ling doesn't mind and thinks it's cute. At the end, they are able to get married because of Mushu.

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jimmy Wong]].

====Chien-Po====
'''Chien-Po''', or '''Po''' for short, is by far the tallest and most obese of Mulan's friends with a bald head. His signature color is [[blue]] in the first film and [[green]] in the second film. He is the calmest and most spiritual of the three, and his appearance seems to have been inspired by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] imagery. He is rather naïve compared to his partners, and loves food more than anything, which is the main thing he considers when searching for a woman for he wishes for a wife that will be good at cooking and preparing food. He is very good-natured and would never do anything to upset anyone, making him the most ready to befriend Mulan. He also possesses great strength and can lift multiple people (or a massive stone statue) with ease.

In the second film, he falls in love with Princess Su, the youngest sister. The most childlike, she is easily swayed and is soon convinced of Mei's opinions. She loves food as much as Chien-Po, and when the group stops traveling for a while, she spends her time picking fruit from trees. Chien-Po discovers this, and the two of them bond easily. He even saves her when the carriage ends up falling in the water. At the carnival, they both order some [[dumpling]]s, [[ginger]], [[Ginseng]]s and [[soybean]]s.

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Doua Moua]].

==Characters from ''Mulan''==

===The Fa family===
====Fa Zhou====
'''Fa Zhou''' is Mulan's father who is very strict and also a famed war veteran who got injured in war. At first glance he seems like he only cares about the honor of the family and that he is quick to frustration with Mulan. He first appears putting an incense stick on the hanging dish and praying to the honorable ancestors while Mulan is seeing the matchmaker. Nothing distracts him from his prayers, even when [[chicken]]s go running around in the shrine to crazily devour the [[chicken feed]]. When Chi-Fu calls him from the Fa family for military duty, he puts down the cane, stands straight and accepts his assignment scroll, not caring about his old crippled body despite his limping and visible pain. Mulan worries that he is risking his life, especially after seeing him collapse after some sword exercises. When Mulan returns in a triumph of defeating Shan Yu, she gives him Shan Yu's sword with the blade wrapped in cloth and the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the emperor; the two gifts that honor the Fa Family. On receiving these gifts, he immediately puts them down and confesses that all he ever wanted was Mulan to be happy and safe, informing her that his greatest honor is having her as a daughter. He was voiced by [[Soon-Tek Oh]].

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Tzi Ma]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />
====Fa Li====
'''Fa Li''' is Mulan's mother. She initially stays with the dresser waiting for Mulan to come. She is frustrated when her daughter's hair is messed with [[hay]] and sends her inside to have her bathed and cleaned up. She and all the dressers help her get dressed after the bath. After they have finished beautifying Mulan, she sends her to the impatient matchmaker who then gets enraged by Mulan's accidents. Fa Li consoles her after the matchmaker rejects her. During the rainy night, she weeps for her daughter who runs away with Khan the horse, and her husband Fa Zhou consoles her while watching over her at the same time. When Li Shang shows up in the middle of a conversation between Fa Li and Grandmother Fa about Mulan's war exploits and that she should've brought a man home, Fa Li is left stunned. According to her second film, the only other child she likes is Sha-Ron (a faux-Chinese version of the name [[Sharon (disambiguation)|Sharon]]), a little girl who wears a lavender outfit and [[bun (hairstyle)#Double bun|ox-horns]]. She was voiced by [[Freda Foh Shen]].

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action film]], she is portrayed by [[Rosalind Chao]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />

====Grandmother Fa====
'''Grandmother Fa''' is Mulan's grandmother. She is very easy-going and gives Mulan the most freedom. She also provides comic relief in the family. She is first seen holding a cage with Cri-Kee in it. She covers her eyes while crossing a road and demonstrates the ability to show how lucky this cricket is. After Fa Li and all the dressers have finished beautifying Mulan, Grandma Fa gives her a few items to make her look perfect (apple, pendant, jade necklace and Cri-Kee). She constantly encourages her to find a good husband. During the rainy night, she recognizes that her granddaughter has run away to join the army in her father's place, and she picks up a [[lantern]] and prays to the ancestors, awakening First Ancestor Fa. When Mulan returns home with Shan Yu's sword and the Emperor's crest, she comments that Mulan should have brought a man home and is shocked when Li Shang arrives, causing her to jokingly say to sign her up for the next war.  When Mulan asks Shang to stay for dinner, she asks him to stay forever. Mulan is shown to be fondly annoyed by this but Shang does agree to stay for dinner. In her second film, she plays a game in the house of Fa and brings in food for the perfect couple Mulan and Shang. Her speaking voice is provided by [[June Foray]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Marni Nixon]].

====First Ancestor Fa====
'''First Ancestor Fa''' is the ghostly eldest member of the Fa family and acts as leader of the ancestors. He carries a staff with him. When he is summoned, he brings Mushu to life by saying the word \"awaken\". He usually stops the other ancestors from fighting and requests (what he thinks are) better plans such as summoning the Great Stone Dragon. When Mushu returns with Mulan, he gives him his job as a guardian again, though showing a frustrated face. At the beginning of his second film, he performs something interesting with the forming of smoke. He was voiced by [[George Takei]].

=====Other Ancestors=====
'''Other Ancestors''', members of the company including the farmer and his wife (a parody of the famous painting [[American Gothic]]), and the counter who is always fiddling with his [[abacus]]. Fa Deng is the only ancestor whose head is cut off, a result of Mushu's misguidance to him when he was a guardian. Many of these ancestors clamor about Mulan when she's away. [[Mary Kay Bergman]] did the voice of the female ancestors in the first film and in the second film, they are voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].

===Khan===
'''Khan''' is Mulan's [[horse]] with a [[black]] coat and [[white]] markings on his face, belly and legs. He is portrayed as a very intelligent and confident horse. When he first saw Mushu, he tried to kill him with his hooves out of fear. In the first film, during the surprise ambush on the mountains, Mulan causes an [[avalanche]] killing many Huns. Khan risks his life to save Mulan and tries his best to run to safety before he almost falls to his death off the cliff. He also seems to be very close to Mulan but doesn't like Mushu so much. In the second film, he gets angry at Mushu who tries to break Mulan and Shang up after his [[saddle]] is unbuckled and in one of his attempts, he injures him by stomping on him with his [[Horse hoof|hooves]] as payback. Khan is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].

He will appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]].

===Little Brother===
'''Little Brother''' is Mulan's pet dog. He has a blue [[Dog collar|collar]] around his neck. Mulan often uses him to spread chicken feeds by hanging a bone in front of him, similar to the [[carrot on a stick]] trick. He is voiced by [[Chris Sanders]] in the first movie and [[Frank Welker]] in the second movie.

===The Emperor of China===
Based on the real-life emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], this character is shown as the wisest of all China. He lives in a palace (modeled, perhaps anachronistically, upon the [[Forbidden City]]) and he has a long mustache and beard. [[Yellow]] is the color that he wears. In his first film, when everybody's ambushed, he gets captured by Shan Yu and his henchmen resulting his hat to fall off, but then with Mulan and Shang, in order to save him, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (disguised as concubines) trick Shan Yu's henchmen into being attracted to them and so dropping their guard. After Shan Yu is terminated, the emperor comes down the steps and, though he sternly reprimands Mulan for impersonating a soldier, he then thanks her for saving their beloved country. He is the first person to bow to her, and even offers her a position on his council, but Mulan politely declines the offer by saying that she feels she should return to her family. In gratitude, he takes off his crest and puts it on her neck and gives Shan Yu's sword to her as tokens for her efforts, the crest representing what she did for him while the sword represents what she did for China. After she leaves, he puts his hat back on and tells Li Shang to go after her, noting that \"You don't meet a girl like that every [[dynasty|dynas-day]]\". His role is a little smaller in the second film, where he suggests Mulan and Shang to take his daughters to Qui-Gong as part of the mission.

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jet Li]].

===Chi-Fu===
'''Chi-Fu''' is a member of the Emperor's council and adviser to Li Shang who refuses to allow the recruits to join the battle against the Huns and serves as a minor antagonist of the film. He is shown to harbor substantial prejudice towards women. He is most often clad in [[Blue]] and places considerable importance on his clothing. He is shown to be devoted to his job and loyal to the Emperor, but is incompetent, [[egotism|egotistic]], pompous and [[misogyny|misogynistic]], as he silences Mulan and tells Fa Zhou to teach her silence in a man's presence, orders Li Shang to execute her once her secret is revealed, despite her saving everyone, and close to the film's conclusion pompously scoffs to Shang that Mulan would never be worth anything because she's a woman. At the end of the film, as the Emperor praises Mulan for defeating Shan-Yu and saving China, he tells Chi-Fu to arrange Mulan for membership in his council. Still believing that Mulan isn't worth anything because she is a woman, Chi-Fu attempts to dissuade him from doing so by claiming that there are no more available seats in the council, but this backfires when the Emperor tells Mulan she can have Chi-Fu's job, causing him to faint. He does not appear in ''Mulan II'', but it is shown that someone strikingly similar to Chi-Fu is a royal adviser to Lord Qin of [[Qigong]]. He was voiced by [[James Hong]].

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he will be replaced by '''The Chancellor''' (portrayed by [[Nelson Lee]]).

===General Li===
'''General Li''' was Li Shang's father and a high-ranking member of the Chinese army who was killed along with his elite troops in a battle against the Hun army, leaving his helmet behind to be found by his son and his battalion when they discover the aftermath. He was voiced by [[James Shigeta]].

===The Matchmaker===
This character is an impatient and harsh woman, who obnoxiously judges potential brides. After the musical number called \"Honor To Us All,\" she opens the doors, calls Mulan's name and takes her inside. She distastefully judges Mulan, calling her too skinny, and asks her to pour the tea as the second part of the test. Cri-Kee, who attempts to escape, ends up in the Matchmaker's cup of tea, and when Mulan tries to take the cup back, The Matchmaker falls on the floor where Cri-Kee gets into the clothing and when she gets up to tell Mulan what happened, she notices that Cri-Kee is in her clothing, causing her to crash into a stove, lighting her backside on burning embers; Mulan tries to extinguish with a paper fan, but the hot embers turn into fire, which Mulan manages to extinguish by pouring the tea on her. Blaming Mulan for the troubles, she publicly humiliates her and says that she will never bring any honor to her family being a wife. She also called Mulan a disgrace when the Matchmaker was the real disgrace. Grandmother Fa noticed her as a little stinker. The second film reveals that she's \"smug and snooty,\" as accused by Ling, which causes her to throw a [[Pottery|pot]] onto his head as she flings out the masculine trio. She is voiced by [[Miriam Margolyes]] in the first film and [[April Winchell]] in the second film.

She will appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]] and be portrayed by [[Cheng Pei-pei]].

===Hayabusa===
Hayabusa is Shan Yu's pet [[saker falcon]], who acts as his master's eyes and ears from the distance. At the end of the first film, his feathers are burned down by a fireball from Mushu to stop him from warning the Huns of Li Shang's presence, who then taunts him as \"[[Mongolian barbecue|Mongolian barbeque]]\" while Cri-kee laughs at him. He isn't seen afterward.

In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Hayabusa appears in the boss battle against Shan Yu. He can grab Sora, lift him into the air, and throw him.

In the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action film]], Hayabusa has been replaced by '''Xian Lang''' (portrayed by [[Gong Li]]), a powerful witch allied with Bori Khan who can transform herself into a falcon. She will be the main antagonist of the film.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />

==Characters from ''Mulan II''==

===Daughters of the Emperor of China===
The Emperor of China's three children that are known anyway; Ting-Ting, Mei and Su are princesses. He sends them into the [[carriage]] to complete the mission which is to marry the Princes of Qui Gong hiding their pretty faces with [[Fan (implement)|paper fan]]s. When in the carriage, these princesses begin to panic as Mushu causes it to slide down by banging his head on the wheel.

*'''Ting-Ting''' is the eldest daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[indigo]] and she is taller than both of her sisters. After Mushu has caused the carriage to slide down, she forces her younger sisters out and tries to escape, but her foot is stuck only to be saved by Ling and the carriage breaks afterward. When she hears his jokes, she thinks they are funny but she tries not to laugh, as she has an embarrassing snorting laugh. However, when the [[firecracker]]s lit by the [[firefly|fireflies]] hit him, she laughs, which causes her to snort like a pig, which Ling thought was cute. Ting-Ting appears as mature and level-headed but is actually carefree in her heart. Her speaking voice is provided by Canadian award-winning actress [[Sandra Oh]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Judy Kuhn]]. She is Crown Princess of China and one day to be ''Her Majesty'' The Empress of China.

*'''Mei''' is the middle daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[pink]] and she is in between her sisters in height. She likes to get along with Yao because she thinks he is good-looking and gentle at heart. She is convinced by Mulan that her duty is to her heart and she knows that it is true. Frustrated by her older sister, she drops her fan to get in the tent and writes, \"And so, my dear father, I cannot complete this mission. I have come to realize that my duty is to my heart.\" When Yao has won a wrestling fight, he chooses the stuffed [[Giant panda|panda bear]] and he shares it with her. Considered a slight [[Damsel in distress|damsel-in-distress]], she has been kidnapped by the enemies of China when the heroes have been knocked down during their fight but saved by her friends. Mei is passionate, brave and caring. Her speaking voice is provided by [[Lucy Liu]] and her singing voice is provided by Beth Blankenship.

*'''Su''' is the youngest daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and she is shorter than both of her sisters. Her favorite thing to do is gathering food from the trees and she likes to spend time with Chien-Po who likes food also. When the carriage is damaged and the [[fruit]] floats in the water, she picks them up again and she gets saved by him too. She is bright, childish and cheerful. Her speaking voice is provided by [[Lauren Tom]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Mandy Gonzalez]].

===Sha-Ron===
'''Sha-Ron''' is a very excited little girl. She first visits Fa Li and says that she wants to see Mulan, who's practicing kung-fu with a rake. Then as she goes outside and drops the [[bucket]]s down, she and all of the other excited daughters of the villagers meet her and get trained on how to fight enemies as so during the \"Lesson Number One\" musical number. Then as General Shang arrives, she takes his helmet with more excitement and runs home. She is voiced by Jillian Henry.

===Lord Qin and Prince Jeeki===
'''Lord Qin''' is the priest of [[Qigong]]. When Mulan is about to complete the mission, he allows her to marry his son '''Prince Jeeki''' who likes playing with the [[Chinese finger trap]]. As Lord Qin engages Mulan and his son, their wedding is interrupted and he makes Shang go away until the Golden Dragon of Unity begins to talk with Mushu's voice. He timidly allows Mulan and Shang to marry each other and then begins to play with the fingertip Jeeki used to play with. Lord Qin is voiced by  [[Keone Young]] and Prince Jeeki is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]].

== Production ==
=== Background ===
[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]'s (WWE) flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]]. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April.<ref>{{cite web|title=WrestleMania 29 press conference brings WWE to Radio City Music Hall|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/29/wrestlemania-press-conference-radio-city-music-hall-26103938|publisher=WWE|accessdate=March 31, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407015228/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/29/wrestlemania-press-conference-radio-city-music-hall-26103938|archivedate=April 7, 2013|quote=...&nbsp;WWE's flagship event lights up MetLife Stadium&nbsp;...

It was also the first WrestleMania to be held under the first [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] that began in March 2002, which split the roster between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands, represented by the shows of the same name. It was also the first WrestleMania to feature the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] that was introduced for Raw in September 2002 after the WWE Undisputed Championship became exclusive to SmackDown and renamed to WWE Championship.

A documentary entitled ''The Mania of WrestleMania'' was filmed live during the event and released the following year. It was the first sole production from [[WWE Studios|WWE Films]].

=== Storylines ===
The main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into [[WrestleMania]] on the [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] was between [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Brock Lesnar]], with the two feuding over the [[WWE Championship]]. Angle won the title three months prior at [[Armageddon (2002)|Armageddon]] by defeating then-champion [[Big Show]] with Lesnar's help; Lesnar had lost the title at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] in November 2002 after his agent, [[Paul Heyman]], betrayed him and assisted Big Show in winning the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/armageddon02.html|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=WWE Armageddon (2002) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the edition of ''SmackDown!'' immediately following Armageddon, Angle revealed that he too had taken on Heyman as his agent and together they would ensure Lesnar never got a shot to regain his title. Lesnar responded by brutally attacking Angle following the show, injuring the champion's knee.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/smackdown02.htm</ref>

At the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]], Angle faced [[Chris Benoit]] for his championship while Lesnar was forced to wrestle Big Show for a spot in the [[Royal Rumble match]], which guaranteed the winner a shot at his [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]'s championship at WrestleMania.

The main feud on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] brand was between [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]. On the February 20 episode of ''SmackDown!'', The Rock returned to WWE after a six-month hiatus from wrestling (since [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]]). On that evening, he was in a confrontation with [[Hulk Hogan]] before their [[WrestleMania X8]] rematch at [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]]. At No Way Out, The Rock defeated Hogan with the help of [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]]. On the February 24 episode of ''Raw'', The Rock moved to the Raw brand and competed in a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|20-man Battle royal]] that would determine the number one contender for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. The Rock however, lost after he was eliminated by [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]; after the match, The Rock criticized Austin for being chosen as the ''Superstar of the Decade'' by the WWE fans in January, beginning the feud between Rock and Austin.<ref name=\"RAWFeb242\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030224.html|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=WWE Raw (February 24, 2003) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 3 episode of ''Raw'', Austin, who was on a long hiatus before returning at No Way Out,<ref name=\"NWO1\"/> made his WWE television return, as he cut a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promo]] about the WWE fans, before he was interrupted by The Rock, who challenged him to a match at WrestleMania because The Rock was obsessed of not beating Austin at a WrestleMania event as by the time they fought at [[WrestleMania XV]] and [[WrestleMania X-Seven|X-Seven]] during a four-year span. As soon as the challenge was made, Raw General Manager [[Eric Bischoff]] announced that the following week on ''Raw'', The Rock would face Booker T in a match, and if he won, he would have the choice to face either Austin or Triple H at WrestleMania.<ref name=\"RAWMar32\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030303.html|title=WWE Raw (March 2, 2003) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 10 episode of ''Raw'', Rock, with Bischoff's approval, announced that he would pick his own opponent for later that night, which turned out to be [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]], in hopes for The Rock to gain an easy victory.

[[File:Ashanti at WrestleMania XIX.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Ashanti performing \"America the Beautiful\"]]
The secondary feud on the SmackDown! brand was between [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]]. One month prior at No Way Out, during a match between Hogan and The Rock, McMahon came down to the ring, only to distract Hogan, which allowed the referee, [[Sylvan Grenier]] to give The Rock a chair, which Rock used to hit Hogan and pin him for the win.<ref name=\"No Way Out - Main events\">{{cite web|date=2003-02-23|accessdate=2008-02-22|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2003/mainevent/|title=Co-Main Events: Triple H vs. Scott Steiner for the World Heavyweight Championship (RAW) and The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan (SmackDown)|publisher=WWE}}</ref> After No Way Out, McMahon proclaimed that Hulkamania was dead and proclaiming a new 'mania; McMahonamania. On the March 6 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Hogan informed McMahon that Hulkamania was not dead and that McMahon had nothing to do with creating it. McMahon informed Hogan that he did not hate Hulkamaniacs or Hulkamania, but he hated Hogan. He then told Hogan that he hated him for leaving WWE (then known as the WWF) for [[Ted Turner]]'s [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and for testifying against him in the [[Vince McMahon#Legal trial|steroid trial]] in the 1990s. McMahon proceeded by challenging Hogan to a match at WrestleMania where if Hogan lost, he would have to retire from [[professional wrestling]]. Hogan accepted his challenge later that night.<ref name=\"SDMar61\"/> Two weeks later on the March 20 episode of ''SmackDown!'', McMahon and Hogan had a contract signing for their match at WrestleMania. As Hogan was preparing to sign the contract, McMahon attacked with a steel chair from behind. Shortly afterward, McMahon hit Hogan several times with the chair in the head, causing him to [[Blading (professional wrestling)|bleed]]. McMahon then signed the contract and forced Hogan to sign with his blood.<ref name=\"SDMar201\"/>

Another feud on the Raw brand was between [[Triple H]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], with the two feuding over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. Triple H won the title three months prior at [[Armageddon (2002)|Armageddon]] by defeating then-champion [[Shawn Michaels]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Two out of three falls|3 Stages of Hell match]].<ref name=\"Armageddon - HHH vs HBK\">{{cite web|date=2002-12-15|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/2002/mainevent/|title=Triple H defeated Shawn Michaels in a Three Stages of Hell Match to win the World Heavyweight Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> Since that event, Triple H had wrestled [[Scott Steiner]] during the following two pay-per-view events for the World Heavyweight Championship. First was at the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]], where Triple H got himself disqualified when he nailed Steiner with the [[sledgehammer]] but retained the title. Then at No Way Out, he defeated Steiner by [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]] to retain the title. On the February 24 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T won a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|20-man battle royal]] by last eliminating The Rock to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania.<ref name=\"RAWFeb242\"/> On the March 3 episode of ''Raw'', World Heavyweight Champion Triple H cut a controversial promo on Booker T. Triple H downplayed Booker T's WCW success, pointing out that the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] had been held by non-wrestlers like [[Vince Russo]] and actor [[David Arquette]] calling WCW and its title \"a joke\". He implied that Booker T, as a convicted criminal, would never win a world championship in WWE. In the WrestleMania XIX press conference [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] questioned Triple H as to whether he had cut a racist promo, Triple H confirmed this was not the case and was indeed referring to Booker's criminal past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030303.html|title=RAW Results March 3, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 10 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T got revenge by attacking Triple H in the bathroom, laying him out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030310.html|title=RAW Results March 10, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 24 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T and [[Goldust]] defeated Triple H and [[Ric Flair]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Tag team match|tag team match]].

Another feud from the Raw brand was the squabble over the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|Women's Championship]]; the champion Victoria had captured the title from Trish Stratus at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]]. Then at Armageddon, Victoria defeated Stratus and Jacqueline in a [[Professional wrestling#Triple Threat match|triple threat match]] to retain the Women's Championship. Stratus and the returning Jazz had a match on ''Raw'' to determine who would challenge Victoria for the title at WrestleMania. During the match, Victoria entered the ring and hit both women with the title belt, earning a double disqualification. It was then announced that Victoria would defend the title against both Stratus and Jazz in a triple threat match at the event.

A smaller feud, also from the Raw brand was between [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]. After Shawn Michaels lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Triple H at Armageddon, he appeared in an in-ring segment with Chris Jericho, during which Jericho stated Michaels was washed up. After mocking Michaels and threatening to attack him, Jericho turned around into a [[superkick]]. When Michaels was a guest on Jericho's in-ring show ''The Highlight Reel'' the following month, Jericho claimed he had idolized Michaels from a young age and that he had been his inspiration to become a wrestler. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho eliminated Michaels from the Royal Rumble match. Michaels returned later in the match and attacked Jericho, helping to lead to his elimination. The two agreed to meet at WrestleMania XIX in a match.

'''WrestleMania XIX''' was the 19th annual [[WrestleMania]] [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|event]] produced by [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE). It took place on March 30, 2003, at [[Safeco Field]] in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm19/venue/|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=WrestleMania XIX Venue|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> The event was the first WrestleMania held in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

WrestleMania XIX was the first WrestleMania to be promoted under the WWE name and the first to have taken place after the [[WWE brand extension]]. It was a [[WWE brand extension|joint-promotion]] pay-per-view event, featuring performers from the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] brands. The tagline for WrestleMania XIX was \"''Dare to Dream''\". The official theme song for the event was \"[[Crack Addict (song)|Crack Addict]]\" by [[Limp Bizkit]]. Limp Bizkit performed the theme song live, as well as \"[[Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)]]\" during [[The Undertaker]]'s entrance.

The main match from the SmackDown! brand was [[Kurt Angle]] versus [[Brock Lesnar]] for the [[WWE Championship]], which Lesnar won by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] after executing an [[Facebuster#F5|F5]].<ref name=\"Powell\">{{cite web|first=John|last=Powell|accessdate=2008-02-25|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/03/31/55003.html|title=WWE shines at WrestleMania XIX|date=2003-03-31|work=Slam!

== Production ==
=== Background ===
[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]'s (WWE) flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]]. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April.<ref>{{cite web|title=WrestleMania 29 press conference brings WWE to Radio City Music Hall|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/29/wrestlemania-press-conference-radio-city-music-hall-26103938|publisher=WWE|accessdate=March 31, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407015228/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/29/wrestlemania-press-conference-radio-city-music-hall-26103938|archivedate=April 7, 2013|quote=...&nbsp;WWE's flagship event lights up MetLife Stadium&nbsp;...

''Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition'' (p. 160)</ref> It has been described as the [[Super Bowl]] of [[sports entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gelston|first=Dan|title=WrestleMania is Super Bowl of sports entertainment|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/wrestlemania-super-bowl-sports-entertainment|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=March 31, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331101111/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/wrestlemania-super-bowl-sports-entertainment|archivedate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> It was the first WrestleMania promoted under the WWE name, following the company being renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May 2002. It was also the first WrestleMania to be held under the first [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] that began in March 2002, which split the roster between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands, represented by the shows of the same name. It was also the first WrestleMania to feature the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] that was introduced for Raw in September 2002 after the WWE Undisputed Championship became exclusive to SmackDown and renamed to WWE Championship.

A documentary entitled ''The Mania of WrestleMania'' was filmed live during the event and released the following year. It was the first sole production from [[WWE Studios|WWE Films]].

=== Storylines ===
The main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into [[WrestleMania]] on the [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] was between [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Brock Lesnar]], with the two feuding over the [[WWE Championship]]. Angle won the title three months prior at [[Armageddon (2002)|Armageddon]] by defeating then-champion [[Big Show]] with Lesnar's help; Lesnar had lost the title at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] in November 2002 after his agent, [[Paul Heyman]], betrayed him and assisted Big Show in winning the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/armageddon02.html|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=WWE Armageddon (2002) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the edition of ''SmackDown!'' immediately following Armageddon, Angle revealed that he too had taken on Heyman as his agent and together they would ensure Lesnar never got a shot to regain his title. Lesnar responded by brutally attacking Angle following the show, injuring the champion's knee.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/smackdown02.htm</ref>

At the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]], Angle faced [[Chris Benoit]] for his championship while Lesnar was forced to wrestle Big Show for a spot in the [[Royal Rumble match]], which guaranteed the winner a shot at his [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]'s championship at WrestleMania. Angle defeated Benoit by submission to retain his title. Lesnar defeated Big Show, despite interference from Heyman, to win his way into the Royal Rumble, which he entered at number 29 and won after last eliminating [[The Undertaker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881141/results/|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=WWE Royal Rumble (2003) Results|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The following month at [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]], Lesnar and Benoit defeated [[The World's Greatest Tag Team|Team Angle]] (Kurt Angle, [[Shelton Benjamin]], and [[Charlie Haas]]) in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]]. During that pay-per-view, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] was supposed to team up with Lesnar & Benoit to wrestle Team Angle in the scheduled [[Professional wrestling match types#Six Man Tag Team match|Six Man Tag team match]] but Edge was attacked backstage and it was announced he could not participate in the match.<ref name=\"NWO1\">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-02-22|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/nowayout03.html|title=WWE No Way Out (2003) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref name=\"NWO2\">{{cite web|publisher=WWE|title=WWE No Way Out (2003) Results|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2003/results/|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> On the March 6 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Lesnar defeated [[Paul Heyman]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] to earn a championship match against Angle.<ref name=\"SDMar61\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030306.html|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=WWE SmackDown!

Before the match began, Kurt, who was \"praying\" in the corner, switched with his brother [[Eric Angle|Eric]]. Lesnar then came out and the match began. Shortly after the match began, Benjamin and Haas came to the ring and distracted Lesnar, which gave Eric time to switch back with Kurt. As Lesnar regained his focus, Kurt was able to pin him with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Small package|small package]] for the win.<ref name=\"SDMar131\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030313.html|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=WWE SmackDown!

The main feud on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] brand was between [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]. On the February 20 episode of ''SmackDown!'', The Rock returned to WWE after a six-month hiatus from wrestling (since [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]]). On that evening, he was in a confrontation with [[Hulk Hogan]] before their [[WrestleMania X8]] rematch at [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]]. At No Way Out, The Rock defeated Hogan with the help of [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]]. On the February 24 episode of ''Raw'', The Rock moved to the Raw brand and competed in a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|20-man Battle royal]] that would determine the number one contender for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. The Rock however, lost after he was eliminated by [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]; after the match, The Rock criticized Austin for being chosen as the ''Superstar of the Decade'' by the WWE fans in January, beginning the feud between Rock and Austin.<ref name=\"RAWFeb242\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030224.html|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=WWE Raw (February 24, 2003) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 3 episode of ''Raw'', Austin, who was on a long hiatus before returning at No Way Out,<ref name=\"NWO1\"/> made his WWE television return, as he cut a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promo]] about the WWE fans, before he was interrupted by The Rock, who challenged him to a match at WrestleMania because The Rock was obsessed of not beating Austin at a WrestleMania event as by the time they fought at [[WrestleMania XV]] and [[WrestleMania X-Seven|X-Seven]] during a four-year span. As soon as the challenge was made, Raw General Manager [[Eric Bischoff]] announced that the following week on ''Raw'', The Rock would face Booker T in a match, and if he won, he would have the choice to face either Austin or Triple H at WrestleMania.<ref name=\"RAWMar32\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030303.html|title=WWE Raw (March 2, 2003) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 10 episode of ''Raw'', Rock, with Bischoff's approval, announced that he would pick his own opponent for later that night, which turned out to be [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]], in hopes for The Rock to gain an easy victory. However, Austin made his way down the entrance ramp, which distracted The Rock and allowed The Hurricane to [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll up]] The Rock into a successful pinfall, which made the Austin-Rock match at WrestleMania official.<ref name=\"RAWMar102\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030310.html|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=WWE Raw (March 10, 2003) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 24 episode of ''Raw'', Austin was banned from entering the arena. He managed to enter the arena and attack The Rock, however, before The Rock fled the ring.<ref name=\"RAWMar242\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030324.html|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=WWE Raw (March 24, 2003) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

[[File:Ashanti at WrestleMania XIX.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Ashanti performing \"America the Beautiful\"]]
The secondary feud on the SmackDown! brand was between [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]]. One month prior at No Way Out, during a match between Hogan and The Rock, McMahon came down to the ring, only to distract Hogan, which allowed the referee, [[Sylvan Grenier]] to give The Rock a chair, which Rock used to hit Hogan and pin him for the win.<ref name=\"No Way Out - Main events\">{{cite web|date=2003-02-23|accessdate=2008-02-22|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2003/mainevent/|title=Co-Main Events: Triple H vs. Scott Steiner for the World Heavyweight Championship (RAW) and The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan (SmackDown)|publisher=WWE}}</ref> After No Way Out, McMahon proclaimed that Hulkamania was dead and proclaiming a new 'mania; McMahonamania. On the March 6 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Hogan informed McMahon that Hulkamania was not dead and that McMahon had nothing to do with creating it. McMahon informed Hogan that he did not hate Hulkamaniacs or Hulkamania, but he hated Hogan. He then told Hogan that he hated him for leaving WWE (then known as the WWF) for [[Ted Turner]]'s [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and for testifying against him in the [[Vince McMahon#Legal trial|steroid trial]] in the 1990s. McMahon proceeded by challenging Hogan to a match at WrestleMania where if Hogan lost, he would have to retire from [[professional wrestling]]. Hogan accepted his challenge later that night.<ref name=\"SDMar61\"/> Two weeks later on the March 20 episode of ''SmackDown!'', McMahon and Hogan had a contract signing for their match at WrestleMania. As Hogan was preparing to sign the contract, McMahon attacked with a steel chair from behind. Shortly afterward, McMahon hit Hogan several times with the chair in the head, causing him to [[Blading (professional wrestling)|bleed]]. McMahon then signed the contract and forced Hogan to sign with his blood.<ref name=\"SDMar201\"/>

Another feud on the Raw brand was between [[Triple H]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], with the two feuding over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. Triple H won the title three months prior at [[Armageddon (2002)|Armageddon]] by defeating then-champion [[Shawn Michaels]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Two out of three falls|3 Stages of Hell match]].<ref name=\"Armageddon - HHH vs HBK\">{{cite web|date=2002-12-15|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/2002/mainevent/|title=Triple H defeated Shawn Michaels in a Three Stages of Hell Match to win the World Heavyweight Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> Since that event, Triple H had wrestled [[Scott Steiner]] during the following two pay-per-view events for the World Heavyweight Championship. First was at the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]], where Triple H got himself disqualified when he nailed Steiner with the [[sledgehammer]] but retained the title. Then at No Way Out, he defeated Steiner by [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]] to retain the title. On the February 24 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T won a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|20-man battle royal]] by last eliminating The Rock to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania.<ref name=\"RAWFeb242\"/> On the March 3 episode of ''Raw'', World Heavyweight Champion Triple H cut a controversial promo on Booker T. Triple H downplayed Booker T's WCW success, pointing out that the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] had been held by non-wrestlers like [[Vince Russo]] and actor [[David Arquette]] calling WCW and its title \"a joke\". He implied that Booker T, as a convicted criminal, would never win a world championship in WWE. In the WrestleMania XIX press conference [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] questioned Triple H as to whether he had cut a racist promo, Triple H confirmed this was not the case and was indeed referring to Booker's criminal past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030303.html|title=RAW Results March 3, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 10 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T got revenge by attacking Triple H in the bathroom, laying him out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030310.html|title=RAW Results March 10, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 24 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T and [[Goldust]] defeated Triple H and [[Ric Flair]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Tag team match|tag team match]].

Another feud from the Raw brand was the squabble over the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|Women's Championship]]; the champion Victoria had captured the title from Trish Stratus at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]]. Then at Armageddon, Victoria defeated Stratus and Jacqueline in a [[Professional wrestling#Triple Threat match|triple threat match]] to retain the Women's Championship. Stratus and the returning Jazz had a match on ''Raw'' to determine who would challenge Victoria for the title at WrestleMania. During the match, Victoria entered the ring and hit both women with the title belt, earning a double disqualification. It was then announced that Victoria would defend the title against both Stratus and Jazz in a triple threat match at the event.

A smaller feud, also from the Raw brand was between [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]. After Shawn Michaels lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Triple H at Armageddon, he appeared in an in-ring segment with Chris Jericho, during which Jericho stated Michaels was washed up. After mocking Michaels and threatening to attack him, Jericho turned around into a [[superkick]]. When Michaels was a guest on Jericho's in-ring show ''The Highlight Reel'' the following month, Jericho claimed he had idolized Michaels from a young age and that he had been his inspiration to become a wrestler. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho eliminated Michaels from the Royal Rumble match. Michaels returned later in the match and attacked Jericho, helping to lead to his elimination. The two agreed to meet at WrestleMania XIX in a match.

==Background==

Zachrich was born on October 1, 1981, in [[Defiance, Ohio]]. During his [[freshman]] year, Zachrich was a varsity football player at [[Bowling Green University]] in [[Bowling Green, Ohio]]. After sustaining an injury in one of the last scheduled games of the season, he chose to discontinue his upstart career in football and find a different profession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2008/04/site-news-tuf-cast-member-luke-zachrich-joins-mmajunkie-com|title=Site News: \"TUF\" cast member Luke Zachrich joins MMAjunkie.com|publisher=MMAJunkie.com|date=April 10, 2008}}</ref> 

In the last couple of years in college, Zachrich was a part-time [[lacrosse]] player and then graduated with [[bachelor's degree]] in 2005. Around the same time, he stumbled upon mixed martial arts and began training with UFC legend and [[UFC Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Dan Severn]] at his gym, The Beast Academy, in [[Coldwater, Michigan]] and also trained with renowned Jujitsu practitioner Dave Morris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dietandexerciseguru.com/?p=26|title=Luke Zachrich > MMA > Brazilian Jujitsu > sports training|publisher=dietandexerciseguru.com|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> An upstart, Zachrich trained for two years under the tutelage of Severn and [[Jorge Gurgel]]'s team, before accepting a last-minute offer to compete in an amateur bout in early 2006.

During an interview with MMA.TV, he was asked about how he made the transition to mixed martial arts.

{{cquote|Honestly, it was by chance. I had a short stint in college football and when that was over I really felt something missing in my life. Being a competitor was all I had ever known. So I started driving from Bowling Green to Toledo and started boxing. I continued that through the last couple years of college. Then, it just seemed like I kept meeting people and training with them that were involved in different aspects of MMA. Even though I had no intentions or aspirations of ever fighting. 

Then one day, I met an MMA guy when I moved back to Defiance, Ohio, [and] started training with him for fun and after a few months, someone needed a last minute fill in and I said yes. I won that fight pretty easily but I still didn't really see myself as a fighter. After that first fight, I just kept getting more offers and kept winning.<ref name=\"MMATVInterview\" />}}

==Mixed martial arts career==

In the first combat bout of his career, Zachrich faced off against fellow fighting newcomer Ben Kelley at Mega Fighting Championship's premiere event on January 14, 2006. It was a showcase of heavy stand-up striking for a majority of the bout, with Zachrich coming out on top with a first round [[Knockout|technical knockout]] victory. Following more training, Zachrich would receive the opportunity to turn pro three months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/mma.cfm?go=stats.fightCard&eid=F232875B-2652-4BA3-A662-945AB5062458#fight_38730|title=Mega Fighting Championship 1 Official Results|publisher=mixedmartialarts.com|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/events/MFC-1-Mega-Fighting-Championship-8862|title=Amateur MMA: MFC 1 - Mega Fighting Championship Results|publisher=sherdog.com|date=January 14, 2006}}</ref> On April 15, 2006, he made a successful transition to professional mixed martial arts, as he submitted Cliff Perillo with strikes at the Ultimate Fight Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/events/UFS-Ultimate-Fight-Series-3764|title=Ultimate Fight Series results|publisher=Sherdog.com|date=April 15, 2006}}</ref>

===The Ultimate Fighter (2008)===

After capturing Xtreme Fighting Organization's middleweight championship with a vicious first round knockout of mixed martial arts journeyman William 'Bill' Hill, the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] announced that Zachrich would be one of the sixteen [[Middleweight (MMA)|Middleweight]] competitors set to take part in the seventh season of their hit reality show, [[The Ultimate Fighter]], hosted by coaches [[Quinton Jackson]] and [[Forrest Griffin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaplayground.com/discussion/topic/luke-zachrich-tapped-ultimate-fighter-14773p1.html|title=Luke Zachrich Tapped for \"The Ultimate Fighter 7?|publisher=mmaplayground.com|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref>

In the last couple of years in college, Zachrich was a part-time [[lacrosse]] player and then graduated with [[bachelor's degree]] in 2005. Around the same time, he stumbled upon mixed martial arts and began training with UFC legend and [[UFC Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Dan Severn]] at his gym, The Beast Academy, in [[Coldwater, Michigan]] and also trained with renowned Jujitsu practitioner Dave Morris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dietandexerciseguru.com/?p=26|title=Luke Zachrich > MMA > Brazilian Jujitsu > sports training|publisher=dietandexerciseguru.com|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> An upstart, Zachrich trained for two years under the tutelage of Severn and [[Jorge Gurgel]]'s team, before accepting a last-minute offer to compete in an amateur bout in early 2006.

During an interview with MMA.TV, he was asked about how he made the transition to mixed martial arts.

{{cquote|Honestly, it was by chance. I had a short stint in college football and when that was over I really felt something missing in my life. Being a competitor was all I had ever known. So I started driving from Bowling Green to Toledo and started boxing. I continued that through the last couple years of college. Then, it just seemed like I kept meeting people and training with them that were involved in different aspects of MMA. Even though I had no intentions or aspirations of ever fighting. 

Then one day, I met an MMA guy when I moved back to Defiance, Ohio, [and] started training with him for fun and after a few months, someone needed a last minute fill in and I said yes. I won that fight pretty easily but I still didn't really see myself as a fighter. After that first fight, I just kept getting more offers and kept winning.<ref name=\"MMATVInterview\" />}}

==Mixed martial arts career==

In the first combat bout of his career, Zachrich faced off against fellow fighting newcomer Ben Kelley at Mega Fighting Championship's premiere event on January 14, 2006. It was a showcase of heavy stand-up striking for a majority of the bout, with Zachrich coming out on top with a first round [[Knockout|technical knockout]] victory. Following more training, Zachrich would receive the opportunity to turn pro three months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/mma.cfm?go=stats.fightCard&eid=F232875B-2652-4BA3-A662-945AB5062458#fight_38730|title=Mega Fighting Championship 1 Official Results|publisher=mixedmartialarts.com|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/events/MFC-1-Mega-Fighting-Championship-8862|title=Amateur MMA: MFC 1 - Mega Fighting Championship Results|publisher=sherdog.com|date=January 14, 2006}}</ref> On April 15, 2006, he made a successful transition to professional mixed martial arts, as he submitted Cliff Perillo with strikes at the Ultimate Fight Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/events/UFS-Ultimate-Fight-Series-3764|title=Ultimate Fight Series results|publisher=Sherdog.com|date=April 15, 2006}}</ref>

===The Ultimate Fighter (2008)===

After capturing Xtreme Fighting Organization's middleweight championship with a vicious first round knockout of mixed martial arts journeyman William 'Bill' Hill, the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] announced that Zachrich would be one of the sixteen [[Middleweight (MMA)|Middleweight]] competitors set to take part in the seventh season of their hit reality show, [[The Ultimate Fighter]], hosted by coaches [[Quinton Jackson]] and [[Forrest Griffin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaplayground.com/discussion/topic/luke-zachrich-tapped-ultimate-fighter-14773p1.html|title=Luke Zachrich Tapped for \"The Ultimate Fighter 7?|publisher=mmaplayground.com|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref>

'''F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: [[Pharmaceutical company|Pharmaceutical]]s and [[Roche Diagnostics|Diagnostics]]. Its [[holding company]], '''Roche Holding AG''', has [[Bearer instrument|bearer shares]] listed on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]]. The company headquarters are located in [[Basel]].

The company controls the American [[biotechnology]] company [[Genentech]], which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company [[Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.|Chugai Pharmaceuticals]], as well as the United States-based [[Ventana Medical Systems|Ventana]]. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2018 were 56.85 billion [[Swiss franc]]s,<ref name=\"FR18\" /> or approximately US$57 billion. Roche is the second-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide.<ref name=\"pharmexec50\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2019-04-17.htm |title = Roche reports a strong start in 2019 and raises the outlook for the full-year}}</ref>
Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families own slightly over half of the bearer shares with voting rights (a pool of family shareholders 45%, and Maja Oeri a further 5% apart), with Swiss pharma firm [[Novartis]] owning a further third of its shares. Roche is one of the few companies increasing their dividend every year, for 2018 as the 32nd consecutive year.<ref name=\"FR18\" /> F. Hoffmann-La Roche is a full member of the [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]] (EFPIA).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.efpia.eu/content/default.asp?PageID=559&DocID=4883 |title=The Pharmaceutical Industry in Figures – 2008 Edition |publisher=European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) |page=49 |accessdate=2008-08-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916100937/http://www.efpia.eu/content/default.asp?PageID=559&DocID=4883 |archivedate=16 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==History==
Founded in 1896 by [[Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche]], the company was early on known for producing various [[vitamin]] preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.

In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in [[Seveso]], Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination; see [[Seveso disaster]]. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]]. That year Hoffmann-La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.<ref name=\"fundingroche\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc|publisher= FundingUniverse.com}}</ref>

Roche has also produced various [[HIV test]]s and [[antiretroviral drug]]s. It bought the [[patent]]s for the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|highly active anti-retroviral therapy]] (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 <ref>{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = HIV Surveillance --- United States, 1981—2008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 8 November 2013 }}</ref> On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann-La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.

[[Oseltamivir]] is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the [[H5N1|bird flu]]. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by [[Gilead Sciences]].  Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowed in the original licensing agreement.<ref name=\"royalty\">{{cite news|url=http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=14507&hed=Roche%2C+Gilead+End+Tamiflu+Feud

On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann-La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1120533,00.html|title=Why Roche Released Tamiflu|accessdate=2008-05-22|last=Kher|first=Unmesh|date=2005-10-19|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.}}</ref>

Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to [[Afucosylated monoclonal antibodies|afucosylate antibodies]]; one of its products in development was [[obinutuzumab]], which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].<ref name=\"roche\">{{cite web |url=http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205033013/http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 February 2015 |title=Roche - Roche acquires Swiss based GlycArt Biotechnology to strengthen expertise in therapeutic antibody research |publisher=roche.com |accessdate=2015-04-29 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002757/https://ec.europa.eu/research/health/pdf/event04/joel-jean-mairet-31032011_en.pdf Presentation: GlycArt Biotechnology AG From Inception to trade sale – and what happened after...] by Dr. Joël Jean-Mairet.

== Price-fixing conspiracy ==
{{see also|Cartel}}

[[Stanley Adams (whistleblower)|Stanley Adams]], Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking [[antitrust laws]], engaging in [[price fixing]] and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure&nbsp;— an offence under Swiss law&nbsp;— and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.<ref name=observer>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/nov/25/businessofresearch.research | title=Blowing the final whistle | last = Mathiason | first = Nick| work=[[The Observer]] | date=25 November 2001 | accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>

In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for [[vitamin supplement|vitamins]] sold in the US and globally.

'''F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: [[Pharmaceutical company|Pharmaceutical]]s and [[Roche Diagnostics|Diagnostics]]. Its [[holding company]], '''Roche Holding AG''', has [[Bearer instrument|bearer shares]] listed on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]]. The company headquarters are located in [[Basel]].

The company controls the American [[biotechnology]] company [[Genentech]], which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company [[Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.|Chugai Pharmaceuticals]], as well as the United States-based [[Ventana Medical Systems|Ventana]]. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2018 were 56.85 billion [[Swiss franc]]s,<ref name=\"FR18\" /> or approximately US$57 billion. Roche is the second-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide.<ref name=\"pharmexec50\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2019-04-17.htm |title = Roche reports a strong start in 2019 and raises the outlook for the full-year}}</ref>
Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families own slightly over half of the bearer shares with voting rights (a pool of family shareholders 45%, and Maja Oeri a further 5% apart), with Swiss pharma firm [[Novartis]] owning a further third of its shares. Roche is one of the few companies increasing their dividend every year, for 2018 as the 32nd consecutive year.<ref name=\"FR18\" /> F.

==History==
Founded in 1896 by [[Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche]], the company was early on known for producing various [[vitamin]] preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.

In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in [[Seveso]], Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination; see [[Seveso disaster]]. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]]. That year Hoffmann-La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.<ref name=\"fundingroche\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc|publisher= FundingUniverse.com}}</ref>

Roche has also produced various [[HIV test]]s and [[antiretroviral drug]]s. It bought the [[patent]]s for the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|highly active anti-retroviral therapy]] (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 <ref>{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = HIV Surveillance --- United States, 1981—2008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 8 November 2013 }}</ref> On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann-La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.

[[Oseltamivir]] is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the [[H5N1|bird flu]]. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by [[Gilead Sciences]].  Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowed in the original licensing agreement.<ref name=\"royalty\">{{cite news|url=http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=14507&hed=Roche%2C+Gilead+End+Tamiflu+Feud

On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann-La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1120533,00.html|title=Why Roche Released Tamiflu|accessdate=2008-05-22|last=Kher|first=Unmesh|date=2005-10-19|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.}}</ref>

Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to [[Afucosylated monoclonal antibodies|afucosylate antibodies]]; one of its products in development was [[obinutuzumab]], which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].<ref name=\"roche\">{{cite web |url=http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205033013/http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 February 2015 |title=Roche - Roche acquires Swiss based GlycArt Biotechnology to strengthen expertise in therapeutic antibody research |publisher=roche.com |accessdate=2015-04-29 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002757/https://ec.europa.eu/research/health/pdf/event04/joel-jean-mairet-31032011_en.pdf Presentation: GlycArt Biotechnology AG From Inception to trade sale – and what happened after...] by Dr. Joël Jean-Mairet.

[[Stanley Adams (whistleblower)|Stanley Adams]], Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking [[antitrust laws]], engaging in [[price fixing]] and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure&nbsp;— an offence under Swiss law&nbsp;— and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.<ref name=observer>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/nov/25/businessofresearch.research | title=Blowing the final whistle | last = Mathiason | first = Nick| work=[[The Observer]] | date=25 November 2001 | accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>

The '''Kingdom of Kush''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ʊ|ʃ|,_|k|ʌ|ʃ}}; <small><small>in [[LXX]]</small></small> {{lang-grc|Κυς and Κυσι}}; {{lang-cop|{{Script/Coptic|ⲉϭⲱϣ}}}}) was an ancient kingdom in [[Nubia]], located at the [[Sudan]]ese and southern [[Egypt]]ian [[Nile Valley]].

The Kushite era of rule in da p*&$%# was established after the cok laid into it[[Late Bronze Age collapse]] and the disintegration of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Kush was centered at [[Napata]] (now modern [[Karima, Sudan]]) during its early phase. After [[Kashta]] (\"the Kushite\") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the [[List of monarchs of Kush|monarchs of Kush]] were also the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]], until they were defeated by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] under the rule of [[Ashurbanipal]] a century later and finally expelled from Egypt by [[Psamtik I]].

During [[classical antiquity]], the Kushite imperial capital was located at [[Meroë]]. In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Aethiopia]]. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the [[Kingdom of Aksum]]. Afterwards the [[Nubians]] established the three, eventually [[Christianity|Christianized]], kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]].

The native name of the Kingdom was recorded in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as ''{{lang|egy|k3š}}'', likely pronounced {{IPA-all|kuɫuʃ|}} or {{IPA-all|kuʔuʃ|}} in [[Middle Egyptian language|Middle Egyptian]], when the term was first used for Nubia, based on the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]-era [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] transliteration as the genitive ''kūsi''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldenberg|first=David M.|chapter=|title=The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTyJ3HiNOAsC&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q=burnt%20swarthy%20black&f=false |year=2005|edition=New|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691123707|page=17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Esarhaddon and Egypt: An Analysis of the First Invasion of Egypt|last = Spalinger|first = Anthony|date = 1974|journal = Orientalia, NOVA SERIES, Vol. 43 Pp. 295-326, XI|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Ancient Egyptian Language: An Historical Study|url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gd6aAAAAQBAJ&dq=ancient+egyptian+allen|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2013-07-11|access-date = 2015-04-15|isbn = 9781107032460|first = James P.|last = Allen|page = 53}}</ref>

It is also an ethnic term for the native population who initiated the kingdom of Kush. The term is also displayed in the names of Kushite persons,<ref>Török, László. Der Nahe und Mittlere Osten. BRILL, 1997. Print.</ref> such as King [[Kashta]] (a transcription of ''k3š-t3'' \"(one from) the land of Kush\"). Geographically, Kush referred to the region south of the [[first cataract]] in general. Kush also was the home of the rulers of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]].<ref name=\"Van 2011\">Van, de M. M. A History of Ancient Egypt. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. Print.</ref>

The name ''Kush'', since at least the time of [[Josephus]], has been connected with the biblical character [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ({{lang-he-n|כּוּשׁ}}), son of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] (Genesis 10:6). Ham had four sons named: Cush, Put, Canaan and Mizraim (Hebrew name for Egypt). According to the Bible, [[Nimrod]], a son of Cush, was the founder and king of [[Babylon]], [[Uruk|Erech]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] and [[Calneh]], in [[Shinar]] (Gen 10:10).<ref name=\"kingjamesbibleonline.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-10-10/|title=GENESIS 10:10 KJV \"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\"|website=www.kingjamesbibleonline.org}}</ref> The Bible also makes reference to someone named Cush who is a [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamite]] (Psalms 7:1, KJV).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-Chapter-7/|title=PSALMS CHAPTER 7 KJV|website=www.kingjamesbibleonline.org}}</ref>

In [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] sources Kush was known as ''Kous'' (Κους) or ''[[Aithiopia]]'' (Αἰθιοπία).<ref>Török (1997), p. 69ff.</ref>

==History==
=== Origins ===
[[File:Anlamani-Statue-CloseUpOfHead MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|upright|Statue of the Kushite pharaoh [[Aspelta]], [[Napata]] period ({{circa|620–580 BC}})]]
[[Mentuhotep II]], the 21st century BC founder of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 29th and 31st years of his reign. This is the earliest Egyptian reference to ''Kush''; the [[Nubia]]n region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom.<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval Nubia'', Richard A. Lobban Jr., p. 254.</ref> Under [[Thutmose I]], Egypt made several campaigns south.<ref>De Mola, Paul J. \"Interrelations of Kerma and Pharaonic Egypt\". Ancient History Encyclopedia: http://www.ancient.eu/article/487/</ref> This eventually resulted in their annexation of Nubia {{circa|1504 BC}}. After the conquest, Kerma culture was increasingly Egyptianized, yet rebellions continued for 220 years until {{circa|1300 BC}}. Nubia nevertheless became a key province of the New Kingdom, economically, politically and spiritually. Indeed, major pharonic ceremonies were held at Jebel Barkal near Napata.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jebelbarkal.org/|title=Jebal Barkal: History and Archaeology of Ancient Napata|accessdate=21 March 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AmeGLI5N?url=http://www.jebelbarkal.org/|archive-date=19 September 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As an Egyptian colony from the 16th century BC, Nubia (\"Kush\") was governed by an Egyptian [[Viceroy of Kush]]. With the disintegration of the New Kingdom around 1070 BC, ''Kush'' became an independent kingdom centered at [[Napata]] in modern northern Sudan.<ref>Morkot, Robert G. \"On the Priestly Origin of the Napatan Kings: The Adaptation, Demise and Resurrection of Ideas in Writing Nubian History\" in O'Connor, David and Andrew Reid, eds. ''Ancient Egypt in Africa (Encounters with Ancient Egypt) (University College London Institute of Archaeology Publications)'' Left Coast Press (1 Aug 2003) {{ISBN|978-1-59874-205-3}} p.151</ref>

The extent of cultural/political continuity between the [[Kerma culture]] and the chronologically succeeding Kingdom of Kush is difficult to determine. The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the [[Dongola Reach]] was nonexistent. By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper [[Dongola Reach]]. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of [[Amun]] at the rebuilt [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta [[stele]] at [[Elephantine]], places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century. This first period of the kingdom's history, the 'Napatan', was succeeded by the 'Meroitic', when the royal cemeteries relocated to Meroë around 300 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=David |title=The Nubian Past |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxon |isbn=9780415369886 |pages=2,75,112,114–117,120}}</ref>

The Kushites buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. Archaeologists refer to these practices as the \"Pan-grave culture\".<ref>[http://archaeology.about.com/od/pterms/g/pangrave.htm Pan Grave Culture] – By K. Kris Hirst</ref> This was given its name due to the way in which the remains are buried. They would dig a pit and put stones around them in a circle.<ref>[http://www.numibia.net/nubia/c-group2.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024115915/http://www.numibia.net/nubia/c-group2.htm |date=2013-10-24 }} – By Manfred Bietak</ref> Kushites also built burial mounds and [[Nubian pyramids|pyramids]], and shared some of the same gods worshiped in Egypt, especially Ammon and Isis. With the worshiping of these gods, the Kushites began to take some of the names of the gods as their throne names.<ref name=\"Van 2011\"/>

The Kush rulers were regarded as guardians of the state religion and were responsible for maintaining the houses of the gods. Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state. Northern Kush seems to have been more productive and wealthier than the Southern area.<ref name=\"Welsby, Derek A 1998\">Welsby, Derek A. The Kingdom of Kush: the Napatan and Meroitic Empires.

Dental trait analysis of fossils dating from the Meroitic period in [[Semna (Nubia)|Semna]], northern Nubia, found that they displayed traits similar to those of populations inhabiting the [[Nile]], [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Maghreb]]. The Meroitic skeletons and these ancient and recent fossils were also phenotypically distinct from those belonging to recent [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] and [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]]-speaking populations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], as well as from the [[Mesolithic]] inhabitants of [[Jebel Sahaba]] in Nubia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Irish|first1=Joel D.|title=Dental morphological affinities of Late Pleistocene through recent sub-Saharan and north African peoples|journal=Bulletins et Mémoires de la Société d'anthropologie de Paris|date=1998|volume=10|issue=3|pages=237–272|doi=10.3406/bmsap.1998.2517|url=http://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/bmsap_0037-8984_1998_num_10_3_2517.pdf|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>

=== Conquest of Egypt ([[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|25th Dynasty]]) ===
{{Main|Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt}}
[[File:Kushite empire 700bc.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Maximum extent of Kush in 700 BC]]
Resistance to the early eighteenth Dynasty Egyptian rule by neighbouring Kush is evidenced in the writings of [[Ahmose, son of Ebana]], an Egyptian warrior who served under Nebpehtrya Ahmose (1539-1514 BC), Djeserkara Amenhotep I (1514–1493 BC) and Aakheperkara Thutmose I (1493–1481 BC). At the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] (mid-sixteenth century BC), Egypt faced the twin existential threats—the [[Hyksos]] in the North and the Kushites in the South. Taken from the autobiographical inscriptions on the walls of his tomb-chapel, the Egyptians undertook campaigns to defeat Kush and conquer Nubia under the rule of [[Amenhotep I]] (1514–1493 BC). In Ahmose's writings, the Kushites are described as [[archery|archers]], \"Now after his Majesty had slain the Bedoin of Asia, he sailed upstream to [[Upper Nubia]] to destroy the Nubian bowmen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings from Ancient Egypt|last=Wilkinson|first=Toby|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2016|isbn=978-0-141-39595-1|location=United Kingdom|pages=19}}</ref> The tomb writings contain two other references to the Nubian bowmen of Kush.

Egypt's international prestige had declined considerably towards the end of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]]. Its historical allies, the inhabitants of [[Canaan]], had fallen to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1020 BC), and then the resurgent [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (935–605 BC). The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], from the 10th century BC onwards, had once more expanded from northern [[Mesopotamia]], and conquered a vast empire, including the whole of the [[Near East]], and much of [[Anatolia]], the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[History of Iran#Early Iron Age|early Iron Age Iran]].

In 945 BC, [[Shoshenq I]] and [[Libu]] princes took control of the Nile Delta and founded the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt]], also known as the Libyan or Bubastite dynasty, which would rule for some 200&nbsp;years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. In 711, Shoshenq made [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] his northern capital.<ref>Van, de M. M. A History of Ancient Egypt. Chichester, West Sul\"ssex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. p289. Print.</ref> However, Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in [[Leontopolis]] and Kushites threatened from the south.

[[File:Temple Amon Napata elevation 2.jpg|left|thumb|Amun temple of Jebel Barkal, originally built during the Egyptian New Kingdom but greatly enhanced by Piye]]
[[Alara of Nubia|Alara]] founded the [[Napata#Napatan period|Napatan]], or 25th, Kushite dynasty at Napata in [[Nubia]], now Sudan. Alara's successor [[Kashta]] extended Kushite control north to [[Elephantine]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. Kashta's successor [[Piye#Piye's Conquest of Egypt|Piye]] seized control of Lower Egypt around 727&nbsp;BC.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 345</ref> Piye's 'Victory Stela', celebrating these campaigns between 728-716 BC, was found in the Amun temple at Jebel Barkal. He invaded an Egypt fragmented into four kingdoms, ruled by King [[Peftjauawybast]], King [[Nimlot of Hermopolis|Nimlot]], King [[Iuput II]], and King [[Osorkon IV]].<ref name=David>{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=David |title=The Nubian Past |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxon |isbn=9780415369886 |pages=2, 75, 77–78}}</ref>{{rp|115,120}}

Why the Kushites chose to enter Egypt at this crucial point of foreign domination is subject to debate. Archaeologist Timothy Kendall offers his own hypotheses, connecting it to a claim of legitimacy associated with [[Jebel Barkal]].<ref name=\"Kendall, T.K. 2002\">Kendall, T.K., 2002.

Piye's successor, [[Shabaqo]], defeated the Saite kings of northern Egypt between 711-710 BC, and installed himself as king in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. He then established ties with [[Sargon II]].<ref name=David/>{{rp|120}}

Piye's son [[Taharqa]] enjoyed some minor initial success in his attempts to regain Egyptian influence in the Near East. He aided King [[Hezekiah]] from attack by [[Sennacherib]] and the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:9; Isaiah 37:9), however disease among the besieging Assyrian army appears to have been the main cause of failure to take [[Jerusalem]] rather than any military setback, and Assyrian records indicate Hezekiah was forced to pay tribute. The Assyrian King Sennacherib then defeated [[Taharqa]] and drove the Nubians and Egyptians from the region and back over the Sinai into Egypt.

Taharqa initially defeated the Assyrians when war broke out in 674 BC. Yet, in 671 BC, the Assyrian King [[Esarhaddon]], took Memphis, and Taharqo retreated to the south, while his heir and other family members were taken to Assyria as prisoners. However, the native Egyptian vassal rulers installed by Esarhaddon as puppets were unable to effectively retain full control, and Taharqa was able regain control of Memphis. Esarhaddon's 669 BC campaign to once more eject Taharqa was abandoned when Esarhaddon died in Palestine on the way to Egypt. Yet, Esarhaddon's successor, [[Ashurbanipal]], did defeat Taharqa, and Taharqa died soon after.<ref name=David/>{{rp|121}}

Taharqa's successor [[Tantamani]] attempted to regain Egypt. He successfully defeated [[Necho I|Necho]], the subject ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Memphis in the process. The Assyrians, who had a military presence in the Levant, then sent a large army southwards in 663 BC. Tantamani was routed, and the Assyrian army [[Sack of Thebes|sacked Thebes]] to such an extent it never truly recovered. Tantamani was chased back to Nubia, but his control over Upper Egypt endured until c. 656 BC.

[[Martin Meredith]] states the Kushite rulers chose Meroë, between the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Fifth and Sixth Cataracts]], because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for [[iron working]]. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the [[Red Sea]]. The Kush traded iron products with the Romans, in addition to gold, ivory and slaves. Yet, the [[Butana]] plain was stripped of its forests, leaving behind [[slag]] piles.<ref name=Martin>{{cite book |last1=Meredith |first1=Martin |title=The Fortunes of Africa |date=2014 |publisher=Public Affairs |location=New York |isbn=9781610396356 |pages=43–44}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Shillington |first1=Kevin |title=History of Africa |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |isbn=9780230308473 |pages=50–51}}</ref>

In about 300 BC the move to Meroë was made more complete when the [[monarchs]] began to be buried there, instead of at Napata. One theory is that this represents the monarchs breaking away from the power of the priests at Napata. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], a Kushite king, \"[[Ergamenes]]\", defied the priests and had them slaughtered. This story may refer to the first ruler to be buried at Meroë with a similar name such as [[Arqamani]],<ref>Fage, J. D.: Roland Anthony Oliver (1979) ''The Cambridge History of Africa'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-21592-7}} p. 228 [https://books.google.com/books?id=hb8YXTINiDMC&pg=PA228&dq=Ergamenes+is+Arqamani]</ref> who ruled many years after the royal cemetery was opened at Meroë. During this same period, Kushite authority may have extended some 1,500&nbsp;km along the Nile River valley from the Egyptian frontier in the north to areas far south of modern Khartoum and probably also substantial territories to the east and west.<ref>Edwards, page 141</ref>

Kushite civilization continued for several centuries. In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars. It is not as yet possible to connect the Meroitic language with other known languages.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html|title=Meroitic script|website=www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk}}</ref>

Indeed, it seems that [[Gaius Petronius|Petronius's]] attack might have had a revitalizing influence on the kingdom. Just three years later, in 22 BC, a large Kushite force moved northward with intention of attacking Qasr Ibrim.{{r|jackson2002}}{{rp|149}}

Alerted to the advance, Petronius again marched south and managed to reach Qasr Ibrim and bolster its defences before the invading Kushites arrived. Although the ancient sources give no description of the ensuing battle, we know that at some point the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius. By the end of the second campaign, however, Petronius was in no mood to deal further with the Kushites.{{r|jackson2002}}{{rp|149}} The Kushites succeeded in negotiating a peace treaty on favourable terms<ref name=\"afraf.oxfordjournals.org\"/> and trade between the two nations increased.{{r|jackson2002}}{{rp|149}} Some historians like [[Theodore Mommsen]] wrote that during [[Augustus]] times Nubia was a possible [[client state]] of the [[Roman Empire]].

== Language ==
[[File:Meroitische Inschrift, Meroe 1. Jh. n. Chr., Aegyptisches Museum, Muenchen-1.jpg|thumb|Meroitic [[ostracon]]]]
The [[Meroitic language]] was spoken in Meroë and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BC). It became extinct about 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the [[Meroitic alphabet]]: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a [[stylus]] and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of [[bilingual]] texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180–170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen [[Shanakdakhete]]. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.<ref name=\"Howf\">{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Steven Roger|title=History of Writing|date=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1861895887|pages=133–134|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iYMXnSko5QwC|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>

By the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the [[Meroitic alphabet|Meroitic]], consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. Meroitic is an [[alphabet]] originally derived from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] that was used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Meroë/Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (about 700–300 BC), and first appears in the second century BC. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the [[Old Nubian language]] of the successor Nubian kingdoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html |title=\"Meroe: Writing\", ''Digital Egypt,'' University College, London |publisher=Digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref>

It is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the [[Egyptian language]], belongs to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family. She bases this on its sound inventory and [[phonotactics]], which she argues are similar to those of the Afro-Asiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages.<ref>Rowan, Kirsty (2011). \"Meroitic Consonant and Vowel Patterning\". ''Lingua Aegytia'', 19.</ref><ref>Rowan, Kirsty (2006), [http://www.soas.ac.uk/linguistics/research/workingpapers/volume-14/file37822.pdf \"Meroitic - An Afroasiatic Language?\"] ''{{abbr|SOAS|School of Oriental and African Studies}} Working Papers in Linguistics'' 14:169–206.</ref> 
Claude Rilly proposes that Meroitic, like the [[Nobiin language]], belongs to the [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern Sudanic]] branch of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family, based in part on its syntax, morphology, and known vocabulary.<ref>{{cite book | authors = Rilly, Claude & de Voogt, Alex | year = 2012 | title = The Meroitic Language and Writing System | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-1107008663 | url = | access-date =  | quote = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Rilly, Claude | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/projets/clhass/PageWeb/ressources/Isolats/Meroitic%20Rilly%202004.pdf | title = The Linguistic Position of Meroitic | journal = Sudan Electronic Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology | access-date = 2017-11-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213222/http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/projets/clhass/PageWeb/ressources/Isolats/Meroitic%20Rilly%202004.pdf | archive-date = 2015-09-23 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Rilly2016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C  | title = Meroitic | journal = UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology | date = June 2016 |url = https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3128r3sw }}</ref>

== Kush and Egyptology ==
On account of the Kingdom of Kush's proximity to [[Ancient Egypt]] — the [[first cataract]] at [[Elephantine]] usually being considered the traditional border between the two [[Polity|polities]] — and because the 25th dynasty ruled over both states in the 8th century BC, from the Rift Valley to the Taurus mountains, historians have closely associated the study of Kush with Egyptology, in keeping with the general assumption that the complex sociopolitical development of Egypt's neighbours can be understood in terms of Egyptian models.<ref name=\"edwards 1998\">{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2F22648_C6A5D4D0922E24022C27DEA7035B07DB_journals__AFH_AFH39_02_S002185379700717Xa.pdf&cover=Y&code=2a79b8f52131a8547fc0936b8a4b398c|title=David N. Edwards, \"Meroe and the Sudanic Kingdoms\", \"Journal of African History\" (UK). Vol. 39 No. 2 (1998), pp 175–193|publisher=}}</ref> As a result, the political structure and organization of Kush as an independent ancient state has not received as thorough attention from scholars, and there remains much ambiguity especially surrounding the earliest periods of the state. Edwards<ref name=\"edwards 1998\"/> has suggested that study of the region could benefit from increased recognition of Kush as a state in its own right, with distinct cultural conditions, rather than merely as a secondary state on the periphery of Egypt.

The '''Kingdom of Kush''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ʊ|ʃ|,_|k|ʌ|ʃ}}; <small><small>in [[LXX]]</small></small> {{lang-grc|Κυς and Κυσι}}; {{lang-cop|{{Script/Coptic|ⲉϭⲱϣ}}}}) was an ancient kingdom in [[Nubia]], located at the [[Sudan]]ese and southern [[Egypt]]ian [[Nile Valley]].

The Kushite era of rule in Nubia was established after the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] and the disintegration of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Kush was centered at [[Napata]] (now modern [[Karima, Sudan]]) during its early phase. After [[Kashta]] (\"the Kushite\") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the [[List of monarchs of Kush|monarchs of Kush]] were also the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]], until they were defeated by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] under the rule of [[Ashurbanipal]] a century later and finally expelled from Egypt by [[Psamtik I]].

During [[classical antiquity]], the Kushite imperial capital was located at [[Meroë]]. In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Aethiopia]]. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the [[Kingdom of Aksum]]. Afterwards the [[Nubians]] established the three, eventually [[Christianity|Christianized]], kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]].

The native name of the Kingdom was recorded in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as ''{{lang|egy|k3š}}'', likely pronounced {{IPA-all|kuɫuʃ|}} or {{IPA-all|kuʔuʃ|}} in [[Middle Egyptian language|Middle Egyptian]], when the term was first used for Nubia, based on the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]-era [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] transliteration as the genitive ''kūsi''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldenberg|first=David M.|chapter=|title=The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTyJ3HiNOAsC&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q=burnt%20swarthy%20black&f=false |year=2005|edition=New|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691123707|page=17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Esarhaddon and Egypt: An Analysis of the First Invasion of Egypt|last = Spalinger|first = Anthony|date = 1974|journal = Orientalia, NOVA SERIES, Vol. 43 Pp. 295-326, XI|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Ancient Egyptian Language: An Historical Study|url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gd6aAAAAQBAJ&dq=ancient+egyptian+allen|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2013-07-11|access-date = 2015-04-15|isbn = 9781107032460|first = James P.|last = Allen|page = 53}}</ref>

It is also an ethnic term for the native population who initiated the kingdom of Kush. The term is also displayed in the names of Kushite persons,<ref>Török, László. Der Nahe und Mittlere Osten. BRILL, 1997. Print.</ref> such as King [[Kashta]] (a transcription of ''k3š-t3'' \"(one from) the land of Kush\"). Geographically, Kush referred to the region south of the [[first cataract]] in general. Kush also was the home of the rulers of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]].<ref name=\"Van 2011\">Van, de M. M. A History of Ancient Egypt. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. Print.</ref>

The name ''Kush'', since at least the time of [[Josephus]], has been connected with the biblical character [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ({{lang-he-n|כּוּשׁ}}), son of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] (Genesis 10:6). Ham had four sons named: Cush, Put, Canaan and Mizraim (Hebrew name for Egypt). According to the Bible, [[Nimrod]], a son of Cush, was the founder and king of [[Babylon]], [[Uruk|Erech]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] and [[Calneh]], in [[Shinar]] (Gen 10:10).<ref name=\"kingjamesbibleonline.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-10-10/|title=GENESIS 10:10 KJV \"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\"|website=www.kingjamesbibleonline.org}}</ref> The Bible also makes reference to someone named Cush who is a [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamite]] (Psalms 7:1, KJV).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-Chapter-7/|title=PSALMS CHAPTER 7 KJV|website=www.kingjamesbibleonline.org}}</ref>

In [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] sources Kush was known as ''Kous'' (Κους) or ''[[Aithiopia]]'' (Αἰθιοπία).<ref>Török (1997), p. 69ff.</ref>

==History==
=== Origins ===
[[File:Anlamani-Statue-CloseUpOfHead MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|upright|Statue of the Kushite pharaoh [[Aspelta]], [[Napata]] period ({{circa|620–580 BC}})]]
[[Mentuhotep II]], the 21st century BC founder of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 29th and 31st years of his reign. This is the earliest Egyptian reference to ''Kush''; the [[Nubia]]n region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom.<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval Nubia'', Richard A. Lobban Jr., p. 254.</ref> Under [[Thutmose I]], Egypt made several campaigns south.<ref>De Mola, Paul J. \"Interrelations of Kerma and Pharaonic Egypt\". Ancient History Encyclopedia: http://www.ancient.eu/article/487/</ref> This eventually resulted in their annexation of Nubia {{circa|1504 BC}}. After the conquest, Kerma culture was increasingly Egyptianized, yet rebellions continued for 220 years until {{circa|1300 BC}}. Nubia nevertheless became a key province of the New Kingdom, economically, politically and spiritually. Indeed, major pharonic ceremonies were held at Jebel Barkal near Napata.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jebelbarkal.org/|title=Jebal Barkal: History and Archaeology of Ancient Napata|accessdate=21 March 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AmeGLI5N?url=http://www.jebelbarkal.org/|archive-date=19 September 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As an Egyptian colony from the 16th century BC, Nubia (\"Kush\") was governed by an Egyptian [[Viceroy of Kush]]. With the disintegration of the New Kingdom around 1070 BC, ''Kush'' became an independent kingdom centered at [[Napata]] in modern northern Sudan.<ref>Morkot, Robert G. \"On the Priestly Origin of the Napatan Kings: The Adaptation, Demise and Resurrection of Ideas in Writing Nubian History\" in O'Connor, David and Andrew Reid, eds. ''Ancient Egypt in Africa (Encounters with Ancient Egypt) (University College London Institute of Archaeology Publications)'' Left Coast Press (1 Aug 2003) {{ISBN|978-1-59874-205-3}} p.151</ref>

The extent of cultural/political continuity between the [[Kerma culture]] and the chronologically succeeding Kingdom of Kush is difficult to determine. The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the [[Dongola Reach]] was nonexistent. By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper [[Dongola Reach]]. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of [[Amun]] at the rebuilt [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta [[stele]] at [[Elephantine]], places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century. This first period of the kingdom's history, the 'Napatan', was succeeded by the 'Meroitic', when the royal cemeteries relocated to Meroë around 300 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=David |title=The Nubian Past |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxon |isbn=9780415369886 |pages=2,75,112,114–117,120}}</ref>

The Kushites buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. Archaeologists refer to these practices as the \"Pan-grave culture\".<ref>[http://archaeology.about.com/od/pterms/g/pangrave.htm Pan Grave Culture] – By K. Kris Hirst</ref> This was given its name due to the way in which the remains are buried. They would dig a pit and put stones around them in a circle.<ref>[http://www.numibia.net/nubia/c-group2.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024115915/http://www.numibia.net/nubia/c-group2.htm |date=2013-10-24 }} – By Manfred Bietak</ref> Kushites also built burial mounds and [[Nubian pyramids|pyramids]], and shared some of the same gods worshiped in Egypt, especially Ammon and Isis. With the worshiping of these gods, the Kushites began to take some of the names of the gods as their throne names.<ref name=\"Van 2011\"/>

The Kush rulers were regarded as guardians of the state religion and were responsible for maintaining the houses of the gods. Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state. Northern Kush seems to have been more productive and wealthier than the Southern area.<ref name=\"Welsby, Derek A 1998\">Welsby, Derek A. The Kingdom of Kush: the Napatan and Meroitic Empires.

Dental trait analysis of fossils dating from the Meroitic period in [[Semna (Nubia)|Semna]], northern Nubia, found that they displayed traits similar to those of populations inhabiting the [[Nile]], [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Maghreb]]. The Meroitic skeletons and these ancient and recent fossils were also phenotypically distinct from those belonging to recent [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] and [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]]-speaking populations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], as well as from the [[Mesolithic]] inhabitants of [[Jebel Sahaba]] in Nubia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Irish|first1=Joel D.|title=Dental morphological affinities of Late Pleistocene through recent sub-Saharan and north African peoples|journal=Bulletins et Mémoires de la Société d'anthropologie de Paris|date=1998|volume=10|issue=3|pages=237–272|doi=10.3406/bmsap.1998.2517|url=http://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/bmsap_0037-8984_1998_num_10_3_2517.pdf|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>

=== Conquest of Egypt ([[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|25th Dynasty]]) ===
{{Main|Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt}}
[[File:Kushite empire 700bc.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Maximum extent of Kush in 700 BC]]
Resistance to the early eighteenth Dynasty Egyptian rule by neighbouring Kush is evidenced in the writings of [[Ahmose, son of Ebana]], an Egyptian warrior who served under Nebpehtrya Ahmose (1539-1514 BC), Djeserkara Amenhotep I (1514–1493 BC) and Aakheperkara Thutmose I (1493–1481 BC). At the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] (mid-sixteenth century BC), Egypt faced the twin existential threats—the [[Hyksos]] in the North and the Kushites in the South. Taken from the autobiographical inscriptions on the walls of his tomb-chapel, the Egyptians undertook campaigns to defeat Kush and conquer Nubia under the rule of [[Amenhotep I]] (1514–1493 BC). In Ahmose's writings, the Kushites are described as [[archery|archers]], \"Now after his Majesty had slain the Bedoin of Asia, he sailed upstream to [[Upper Nubia]] to destroy the Nubian bowmen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings from Ancient Egypt|last=Wilkinson|first=Toby|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2016|isbn=978-0-141-39595-1|location=United Kingdom|pages=19}}</ref> The tomb writings contain two other references to the Nubian bowmen of Kush.

Egypt's international prestige had declined considerably towards the end of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]]. Its historical allies, the inhabitants of [[Canaan]], had fallen to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1020 BC), and then the resurgent [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (935–605 BC). The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], from the 10th century BC onwards, had once more expanded from northern [[Mesopotamia]], and conquered a vast empire, including the whole of the [[Near East]], and much of [[Anatolia]], the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[History of Iran#Early Iron Age|early Iron Age Iran]].

In 945 BC, [[Shoshenq I]] and [[Libu]] princes took control of the Nile Delta and founded the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt]], also known as the Libyan or Bubastite dynasty, which would rule for some 200&nbsp;years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. In 711, Shoshenq made [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] his northern capital.<ref>Van, de M. M. A History of Ancient Egypt. Chichester, West Sul\"ssex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. p289. Print.</ref> However, Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in [[Leontopolis]] and Kushites threatened from the south.

[[File:Temple Amon Napata elevation 2.jpg|left|thumb|Amun temple of Jebel Barkal, originally built during the Egyptian New Kingdom but greatly enhanced by Piye]]
[[Alara of Nubia|Alara]] founded the [[Napata#Napatan period|Napatan]], or 25th, Kushite dynasty at Napata in [[Nubia]], now Sudan. Alara's successor [[Kashta]] extended Kushite control north to [[Elephantine]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. Kashta's successor [[Piye#Piye's Conquest of Egypt|Piye]] seized control of Lower Egypt around 727&nbsp;BC.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 345</ref> Piye's 'Victory Stela', celebrating these campaigns between 728-716 BC, was found in the Amun temple at Jebel Barkal. He invaded an Egypt fragmented into four kingdoms, ruled by King [[Peftjauawybast]], King [[Nimlot of Hermopolis|Nimlot]], King [[Iuput II]], and King [[Osorkon IV]].<ref name=David>{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=David |title=The Nubian Past |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxon |isbn=9780415369886 |pages=2, 75, 77–78}}</ref>{{rp|115,120}}

Why the Kushites chose to enter Egypt at this crucial point of foreign domination is subject to debate. Archaeologist Timothy Kendall offers his own hypotheses, connecting it to a claim of legitimacy associated with [[Jebel Barkal]].<ref name=\"Kendall, T.K. 2002\">Kendall, T.K., 2002. Napatan Temples: a Case Study from Gebel Barkal. The Mythological Nubian Origin of Egyptian Kingship and the Formation of the Napatan State. Tenth International Conference of Nubian Studies. Rome, September 9–14, 2002.</ref> Kendall cites the Victory Stele of Piye at Jebel Barkal, which states that \"[[Amun]] of Napata granted me to be ruler of every foreign country,\" and \"Amun in Thebes granted me to be ruler of the Black Land ([[Km (hieroglyph)#km.t|Kmt]])\". According to Kendall, \"foreign lands\" in this regard seems to include Lower Egypt while \"Kmt\" seems to refer to a united Upper Egypt and Nubia.<ref name=\"Kendall, T.K. 2002\"/>

Piye's successor, [[Shabaqo]], defeated the Saite kings of northern Egypt between 711-710 BC, and installed himself as king in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. He then established ties with [[Sargon II]].<ref name=David/>{{rp|120}}
[[File:Battle scene, Jebel Barkal.jpg|thumb|Relief from the Amon temple of Jebel Barkal, showing a battle between Kushites and Assyrians]]
Piye's son [[Taharqa]] enjoyed some minor initial success in his attempts to regain Egyptian influence in the Near East. He aided King [[Hezekiah]] from attack by [[Sennacherib]] and the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:9; Isaiah 37:9), however disease among the besieging Assyrian army appears to have been the main cause of failure to take [[Jerusalem]] rather than any military setback, and Assyrian records indicate Hezekiah was forced to pay tribute. The Assyrian King Sennacherib then defeated [[Taharqa]] and drove the Nubians and Egyptians from the region and back over the Sinai into Egypt.

Taharqa initially defeated the Assyrians when war broke out in 674 BC. Yet, in 671 BC, the Assyrian King [[Esarhaddon]], took Memphis, and Taharqo retreated to the south, while his heir and other family members were taken to Assyria as prisoners. However, the native Egyptian vassal rulers installed by Esarhaddon as puppets were unable to effectively retain full control, and Taharqa was able regain control of Memphis. Esarhaddon's 669 BC campaign to once more eject Taharqa was abandoned when Esarhaddon died in Palestine on the way to Egypt. Yet, Esarhaddon's successor, [[Ashurbanipal]], did defeat Taharqa, and Taharqa died soon after.<ref name=David/>{{rp|121}}

Taharqa's successor [[Tantamani]] attempted to regain Egypt. He successfully defeated [[Necho I|Necho]], the subject ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Memphis in the process. The Assyrians, who had a military presence in the Levant, then sent a large army southwards in 663 BC. Tantamani was routed, and the Assyrian army [[Sack of Thebes|sacked Thebes]] to such an extent it never truly recovered. Tantamani was chased back to Nubia, but his control over Upper Egypt endured until c. 656 BC. At this date, a native Egyptian ruler, [[Psamtik I]] son of Necho, placed on the throne as a vassal of Ashurbanipal, took control of Thebes.<ref name=\"Török, László 1997\"/><ref>Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq pp. 330–332</ref> The last links between Kush and Upper Egypt were severed after hostilities with the Saite kings in the 590s BC.<ref name=David/>{{rp|121–122}}

[[Martin Meredith]] states the Kushite rulers chose Meroë, between the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Fifth and Sixth Cataracts]], because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for [[iron working]]. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the [[Red Sea]]. The Kush traded iron products with the Romans, in addition to gold, ivory and slaves. Yet, the [[Butana]] plain was stripped of its forests, leaving behind [[slag]] piles.<ref name=Martin>{{cite book |last1=Meredith |first1=Martin |title=The Fortunes of Africa |date=2014 |publisher=Public Affairs |location=New York |isbn=9781610396356 |pages=43–44}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Shillington |first1=Kevin |title=History of Africa |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |isbn=9780230308473 |pages=50–51}}</ref>

===Meroitic period===

In about 300 BC the move to Meroë was made more complete when the [[monarchs]] began to be buried there, instead of at Napata. One theory is that this represents the monarchs breaking away from the power of the priests at Napata. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], a Kushite king, \"[[Ergamenes]]\", defied the priests and had them slaughtered. This story may refer to the first ruler to be buried at Meroë with a similar name such as [[Arqamani]],<ref>Fage, J. D.: Roland Anthony Oliver (1979) ''The Cambridge History of Africa'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-21592-7}} p. 228 [https://books.google.com/books?id=hb8YXTINiDMC&pg=PA228&dq=Ergamenes+is+Arqamani]</ref> who ruled many years after the royal cemetery was opened at Meroë. During this same period, Kushite authority may have extended some 1,500&nbsp;km along the Nile River valley from the Egyptian frontier in the north to areas far south of modern Khartoum and probably also substantial territories to the east and west.<ref>Edwards, page 141</ref>

Kushite civilization continued for several centuries. In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars. It is not as yet possible to connect the Meroitic language with other known languages.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html|title=Meroitic script|website=www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk}}</ref>

Alerted to the advance, Petronius again marched south and managed to reach Qasr Ibrim and bolster its defences before the invading Kushites arrived. Although the ancient sources give no description of the ensuing battle, we know that at some point the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius.

== Language ==
[[File:Meroitische Inschrift, Meroe 1. Jh. n. Chr., Aegyptisches Museum, Muenchen-1.jpg|thumb|Meroitic [[ostracon]]]]
The [[Meroitic language]] was spoken in Meroë and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BC). It became extinct about 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the [[Meroitic alphabet]]: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a [[stylus]] and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of [[bilingual]] texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180–170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen [[Shanakdakhete]]. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.<ref name=\"Howf\">{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Steven Roger|title=History of Writing|date=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1861895887|pages=133–134|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iYMXnSko5QwC|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>

By the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the [[Meroitic alphabet|Meroitic]], consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. Meroitic is an [[alphabet]] originally derived from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] that was used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Meroë/Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (about 700–300 BC), and first appears in the second century BC. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the [[Old Nubian language]] of the successor Nubian kingdoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html |title=\"Meroe: Writing\", ''Digital Egypt,'' University College, London |publisher=Digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref>

It is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the [[Egyptian language]], belongs to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family. She bases this on its sound inventory and [[phonotactics]], which she argues are similar to those of the Afro-Asiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages.<ref>Rowan, Kirsty (2011). \"Meroitic Consonant and Vowel Patterning\".

Claude Rilly proposes that Meroitic, like the [[Nobiin language]], belongs to the [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern Sudanic]] branch of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family, based in part on its syntax, morphology, and known vocabulary.<ref>{{cite book | authors = Rilly, Claude & de Voogt, Alex | year = 2012 | title = The Meroitic Language and Writing System | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-1107008663 | url = | access-date =  | quote = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Rilly, Claude | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/projets/clhass/PageWeb/ressources/Isolats/Meroitic%20Rilly%202004.pdf | title = The Linguistic Position of Meroitic | journal = Sudan Electronic Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology | access-date = 2017-11-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213222/http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/projets/clhass/PageWeb/ressources/Isolats/Meroitic%20Rilly%202004.pdf | archive-date = 2015-09-23 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Rilly2016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C  | title = Meroitic | journal = UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology | date = June 2016 |url = https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3128r3sw }}</ref>

== Kush and Egyptology ==
On account of the Kingdom of Kush's proximity to [[Ancient Egypt]] — the [[first cataract]] at [[Elephantine]] usually being considered the traditional border between the two [[Polity|polities]] — and because the 25th dynasty ruled over both states in the 8th century BC, from the Rift Valley to the Taurus mountains, historians have closely associated the study of Kush with Egyptology, in keeping with the general assumption that the complex sociopolitical development of Egypt's neighbours can be understood in terms of Egyptian models.<ref name=\"edwards 1998\">{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2F22648_C6A5D4D0922E24022C27DEA7035B07DB_journals__AFH_AFH39_02_S002185379700717Xa.pdf&cover=Y&code=2a79b8f52131a8547fc0936b8a4b398c|title=David N. Edwards, \"Meroe and the Sudanic Kingdoms\", \"Journal of African History\" (UK). Vol. 39 No. 2 (1998), pp 175–193|publisher=}}</ref> As a result, the political structure and organization of Kush as an independent ancient state has not received as thorough attention from scholars, and there remains much ambiguity especially surrounding the earliest periods of the state. Edwards<ref name=\"edwards 1998\"/> has suggested that study of the region could benefit from increased recognition of Kush as a state in its own right, with distinct cultural conditions, rather than merely as a secondary state on the periphery of Egypt.

{{short description|Dry chemical leavening agent}}
[[File:BakingPowder.jpg|thumb|U.S. consumer-packaged baking powder. This particular type of baking powder contains monocalcium phosphate, sodium bicarbonate, and cornstarch.]]
'''Baking powder''' is a dry chemical [[leavening agent]], a mixture of a [[carbonate]] or [[bicarbonate]] and a weak [[acid]]. The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as [[cornstarch]]. Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods. It works by releasing [[carbon dioxide]] gas into a batter or dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus [[leavening agent|leavening]] the mixture.  The first single-acting baking powder was  developed by a Birmingham based food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in England in 1843. The first double-acting baking powder was developed by [[Eben Norton Horsford]] in the United States of America in the 1860s.

Baking powder is used instead of [[yeast]] for end-products where [[fermentation]] flavors would be undesirable,<ref>{{cite book | last=Matz | first=Samuel A. | title=Bakery Technology and Engineering | edition=3 | year=1992 | page=54 | publisher=Springer | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=rU1wQotD3jIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>  
where the batter lacks the elastic structure to hold gas bubbles for more than a few minutes,<ref>{{cite book | last=McGee| first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking | edition=revised | year=2004 | page=533 | publisher=Scribner-Simon &amp; Schuster | url= https://books.google.com/?id=bKVCtH4AjwgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22on+food+and+cooking%22+mcgee | accessdate=2009-08-12| isbn=9781416556374 }}</ref> and to speed the production of baked goods. Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical leavening are called [[quick bread]]s.  The introduction of baking powder was revolutionary in minimizing the time and labor required to make breadstuffs. It led to the creation of new types of cakes, cookies, biscuits, and other baked goods.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/>

==Formulation and mechanism==
Baking powder is made up of a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], an [[acid]], and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"KO\"/> 
Most commercially available baking powders are made up of [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, also known as [[baking soda]] or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more [[acid salt]]s.<ref name=\"KO\"/>

===Acid-base reactions===
When combined with water, the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous [[carbon dioxide]]. 
Whether commercially or domestically prepared, the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same. The acid-base reaction can be generically represented as shown:<ref>{{cite book | editor=A.J. Bent | title=The Technology of Cake Making | edition=6 | year=1997 | page=102 | publisher=Springer | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=OTy8aIWxHhQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

:NaHCO<sub>3</sub>  +  H<sup>+</sup>   →   Na<sup>+</sup>  +  CO<sub>2</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O

The real reactions are more complicated because the acids are complicated. For example, starting with baking soda and monocalcium phosphate the reaction produces carbon dioxide by the following [[stoichiometry]]:<ref name=KO/>

:14 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>  +  5 Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>    →   14 CO<sub>2</sub>  +  Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH  + 7 Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>  +  13 H<sub>2</sub>O

[[Image:Calcium dihydrogen phosphate.png|thumb|220px|[[Monocalcium phosphate]] (\"MCP\") is a common acid component in domestic baking powders.]]
A typical formulation (by weight) could call for 30% sodium bicarbonate, 5–12% [[monocalcium phosphate]], and 21–26% [[sodium aluminium sulfate]].  
Alternately, a commercial baking powder might use [[sodium acid pyrophosphate]] as one of the two acidic components instead of sodium aluminium sulfate.
Another typical acid in such formulations is [[cream of tartar]] ([[potassium|K]][[Carbon|C<sub>4</sub>]][[hydrogen|H<sub>5</sub>]][[oxygen|O<sub>6</sub>]]), a derivative of [[tartaric acid]].<ref name=\"KO\"/>
In some jurisdictions, it is required that baking soda must produce at least 10 per cent of its weight of [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-33.html#h-65|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Food and Drug Regulations|last=Branch|first=Legislative Services|website=laws.justice.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Lallemand\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lallemand.com/BakerYeastNA/eng/PDFs/LBU%20PDF%20FILES/1_12CHEM.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030303163912/http://www.lallemand.com/BakerYeastNA/eng/PDFs/LBU%20PDF%20FILES/1_12CHEM.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-03-03 |title=Chemical Leaveners, Lallemand Baking Update, Vol. 1 No. 12, 1996 |accessdate=2009-03-05 |publisher=Lallemand Inc. }}</ref>

===Single- and double-acting baking powders===
The use of two acidic components is the basis of the term \"double acting.\"<ref name=\"KO\"/>    
The acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting.<ref>{{cite book | last=Lindsay | first=Robert C. | editor=Owen R. Fennema | title=Food Chemistry | edition=3 | year=1996 | page=772 | publisher=CRC Press | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=1OhFPZ7tFz8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA772#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> 
A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature, and a slow-acting acid does not react until heated. When the chemical reactions in baking powders involve both fast- and slow-acting acids, they are known as \"double-acting\"; those that contain only one acid are \"single-acting\".<ref name=\"google\"/>

By providing a second rise in the oven, double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical. This is the type of baking powder most widely available to consumers today. Double-acting baking powders work in two phases; once when cold, and once when hot.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=BakeWise: The Hows and Whys of Successful Baking with Over 200 Magnificent Recipes|author=Corriher, S.O.|date=2008|publisher=Scribner|isbn=9781416560838|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-iwjIb2RxwC|accessdate=2014-10-25}}</ref>

For example, Rumford Baking Powder is a double-acting product that contains only monocalcium phosphate as a leavening acid. With this acid, about two-thirds of the available gas is released within about two minutes of mixing at room temperature. It then becomes dormant because an intermediate form of dicalcium phosphate is generated during the initial mixing. Further release of gas requires the batter to be heated above 140&nbsp;°F (60&nbsp;°C).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.clabbergirl.com/faq.php | title=Frequently Asked Questions | work=Clabber Girl | publisher=[[Clabber Girl]] | date=2014 | accessdate=2014-03-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329214603/http://www.clabbergirl.com/faq.php | archive-date=2014-03-29 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Common low-temperature acid salts include [[cream of tartar]] and [[monocalcium phosphate]] (also called calcium acid phosphate). High-temperature acid salts include [[sodium aluminium sulfate]], [[sodium aluminium phosphate]], and [[sodium acid pyrophosphate]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Matz | first=Samuel A. | title=Bakery Technology and Engineering | edition=3 | year=1992 | pages=71–72 | publisher=Springer | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=rU1wQotD3jIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA71#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

===Starch component===
Baking powders also include components to improve their stability and consistency. [[Cornstarch]], [[flour]], or [[potato starch]] are often used as buffers.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"KO\">John Brodie, John Godber  \"Bakery Processes, Chemical Leavening Agents\" in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 2001, John Wiley & Sons. {{DOI|10.1002/0471238961.0308051303082114.a01.pub2}}</ref> 
An inert starch serves several functions in baking powder. Primarily it is used to absorb moisture, and thus prolong shelf life of the compound by keeping the powder's alkaline and acidic components dry so as not to react with each other prematurely. A dry powder also flows and mixes more easily. Finally, the added bulk allows for more accurate measurements.<ref>{{cite book | last=McGee| first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking | edition=revised | year=2004 | page=534 | publisher=Scribner-Simon &amp; Schuster | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA534#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

== History ==
===Before baking powder===
When Amelia Simmons published ''[[American Cookery]]'' (1792), the first American cookbook, the recipes she included used three possible types of leavening: [[baker's yeast]], emptins (from the leavings of [[brewer's yeast]]), and [[pearlash]]. 
At that time, the mechanisms underlying the action of yeasts and other leavenings were not understood, and reliable commercial products were not available.  Bakers obtained yeasts from brewers or distillers or made their own by exposing mixtures of flour and water to the open air. If lucky, they could capture useful wild yeast and keep some alive, regularly feeding it for ongoing use and trying to avoid contamination. Women who made their own ale could use the brewing dregs or \"emptins\" in their baking.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>
  
The effectiveness of such leavenings varied widely. Resulting baked goods often had a sour or bitter taste.  Breads were made of grain, water, yeast, and sometimes salt. Cooks also made yeast, sponge and [[pound cake]]s. Yeast cakes were similar to breads but included fancier ingredients, like sugar, spices, fruits or nuts.  Sponge cakes used beaten egg whites for leavening.  Pound cakes combined butter, sugar, and flour and eggs, and were particularly dense. Making cakes was even more laborious than making bread: to prepare a cake, a manservant might have to beat the ingredients together as long as an hour.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>

===Pearlash===
The third type of leavening, pearlash, was the precursor to modern baking powder. Pearlash was a purified form of [[potash]].  It was the subject of the first patent in the United States, issued in April 1790. Its preparation was time-consuming, but could be accomplished by a housewife with a cast-iron kettle: it involved soaking fireplace ashes in water to make  [[lye]], and then boiling the lye to remove water and obtain \"salts\".<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>

The active ingredient in pearlash was [[potassium carbonate]] ([[potassium|K<sub>2</sub>]][[carbonate|CO<sub>3</sub>]]). Combining it with an acidic ingredient like [[sour milk]] or [[lemon juice]] resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"FPF\">{{cite web |title=The History Dish: Pearlash, The First Chemical Leavening |url=http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/the-history-dish-pearlash-the-first-chemical-leavening/ |website=Four Pounds Flour |accessdate=11 January 2019|date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>
Once prepared, the white powder was much more stable than yeast. Small amounts could be used on a daily basis, rather than baking a week or two weeks' worth of bread at one time.  ''American Cookery'' was the first cookbook to call for its use, but by no means the last. With pearlash, cooks were able to create new recipes for new types of cakes, cookies, and biscuits that were quicker and easier to make than yeast-based recipes.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Martha C. |title=Of Pearl Ash, Emptins, And Tree Sweetnin' America's First Native Cookbook |journal=American Heritage |date=1981 |volume=32 |issue=5 |url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/pearl-ash-emptins-and-tree-sweetnin%E2%80%99 |accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Stavely\">{{cite news |last1=Stavely |first1=Keith |last2=Fitzgerald |first2=Kathleen |title=What America’s First Cookbook Says About Our Country and Its Cuisine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-americas-first-cookbook-says-about-our-country-its-cuisine-180967809/ |accessdate=24 January 2019 |work=Smithsonian magazine |date=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Longone\">{{cite web |last1=Longone |first1=Jan |title=Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project By Jan Longone, Curator of American Culinary History, Clements Library, University of Michigan |url=https://d.lib.msu.edu/fa/introduction |website=Clements Library, University of Michigan |accessdate=26 January 2019|date=2002}}</ref>

===Experimentation===
Between the publication of ''American Cookery'' in 1796, and the mid-1800s, cooks experimented with a variety of acids, alkalis, and mineral salts as possible chemical leaveners. Many were already available in households as medicinal, cleaning or solvent products. [[Smelling salts]], [[hartshorn]], and [[sal volatile]] were all ammonia inhalants, containing forms of [[ammonium carbonate]].  The term \"saleratus\" was  applied confusingly to both [[potassium bicarbonate]] and to [[sodium bicarbonate]] ([[sodium|Na]][[bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub>]], what we now call baking soda).<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24–25}} Baking soda and cream of tartar were relatively new ingredients for cooks: Soda may have been introduced to American cooking by female Irish immigrants who found work as kitchen help.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|39}} [[Cream of tartar]], also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate, was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from France and Italy.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24–25}}

In 1846, the first edition of Catherine Beecher's cookbook ''Domestic Recipe Book'' (1846) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar.  
Several recipes in the compilation cookbook ''Practical American Cookery'' (1855) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough.  There were recipes for a \"crust\" similar to modern dumplings or cobbler, several for cakes, and one for \"soda doughnuts\".<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24–25}}  When the third edition of ''Miss Beecher's Domestic Receipt Book'' appeared in 1858, it included 8 types of leaveners, only two of which could be made at home.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|31–32}}

Baking soda and cream of tartar were sold by chemists rather than in grocery stores. Pharmacists purchased the materials in bulk and then dispensed them individually in small amounts in paper packaging. At least one contributor to ''Practical American Cookery'' provided instructions on how to handle baking soda and cream of tartar.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24–25}} Even with instructions, early leaveners could be difficult to obtain, awkward to store, unstandardized, and unpredictable to use.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|26–32}}

The chemical leavening effects were accomplished by the activating of a base such as baking soda in the presence of liquid(s) and an acid such as sour milk, [[vinegar]], lemon juice, or cream of tartar.<ref>{{cite book | last=Stauffer | first=Clyde E. | title=Functional Additives for Bakery Foods | year=1990 | page=193 | publisher=Springer | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ckfdE5sRbqAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> Because these acidulants react with baking soda quickly, retention of gas bubbles was dependent on batter viscosity. It was critical for the batter to be baked quickly, before the gas escaped.  The next step, the development of baking powder, created a system where the gas-producing reactions could be delayed until needed.<ref>{{cite book | last=Edwards | first=W.P. | title=The Science of Bakery Products | year=2007 | page=73 | publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=oCVPjK0mSfkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

===The rise of baking powder===
[[File:Chemical Baking Powder.jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement for DeLand & Co's Chemical Baking Powder. Earliest possible date: 1877; latest possible date: 1893]]
The creation of shelf-stable chemical combinations of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar is seen as marking the true introduction of baking powder.<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>  Although cooks had used both sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar in recipes, they had to purchase the ingredients individually and store them separately to prevent them from spoiling or reacting prematurely. As chemists developed more uniform constituents, they also began to experiment with ways of combining them. In the mid-late 1800s, chemists introduced the first modern baking powders.<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>

====Alfred Bird====
The first to create a form of baking powder was English chemist and food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in 1843. Bird was motivated to develop a yeast-free leavener because his wife Elizabeth was allergic to eggs and yeast. His formulation included bicarbonate of soda and tartaric acid, mixed with starch to absorb moisture and prevent the other ingredients from reacting. A single-action form of baking powder, Alfred Bird's Baking Powder reacted as soon as it became damp.<ref name=\"Davidson\">{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Alan |last2=Saberi |first2=Helen |last3=Jaine |first3=Tom |last4=Davidson |first4=Jane L. |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |year=2014 |publisher=OUP Oxford |page=55 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA55 |accessdate=24 January 2019|isbn=978-0191040726 }}</ref>

Bird focused on selling his baking powder to the [[British Army]] during the [[Crimean War]], and to explorers like [[Francis McClintock|Captain Sir Francis Leopold McClintock]], rather than the domestic market.<ref name=\"Chynoweth\">{{cite web |last1=Chynoweth |first1=Tessa |title=Birmingham Manufactures: Alfred Bird & Sons – Poles Apart |url=http://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/blog/posts/birmingham-manufactures-alfred-bird-sons-poles-apart |website=Birmingham Museums |accessdate=25 January 2019|date=23 April 2018}}</ref> 
Nonetheless, Bird's creation of baking powder enabled cooks to take recipes for cakes such as the patriotically-named [[Victoria sponge]] and make them rise higher.<ref name=\"Earle\">{{cite news |last1=Earle |first1=Rebecca |title=How to make Victoria Sponge the way Queen Victoria would have eaten it |url=http://theconversation.com/how-to-make-victoria-sponge-the-way-queen-victoria-would-have-eaten-it-67798 |accessdate=25 January 2019 |work=The Conversation |date=October 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Cloake\">{{cite news |last1=Cloake |first1=Felicity |title=How to make the perfect Victoria sponge cake |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/may/16/how-bake-perfect-victoria-sponge-cake |accessdate=24 January 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=16 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Hughes\">{{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=Kathryn |title=The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton |date=2005 |publisher=Fourth Estate |location=London}}</ref>
He did not patent his discovery, and others such as [[Henry Jones (baker)|Henry Jones]] of Bristol soon produced and patented similar products. In 1845, Jones patented \"A new preparation of flour\" ([[self-raising flour]]) that included sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid to obtain a leavening effect.<ref name=\"Page\">{{cite journal |last1=Page |first1=Frederick G. |title=BAKING POWDER AND SELF-RISING FLOUR (1) IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY BRITAIN: THE CARBON DIOXIDE AERATIONS OF HENRY JONES AND ALFRED BIRD |journal=Bulletin for the History of Chemistry |date=2013 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=140–154 |url=http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v38-2/v38-2%20p140-154.pdf |accessdate=31 January 2019}}</ref>

====Eben Norton Horsford====
[[File:Prof. Horsford's Baking Powder (3093625150).jpg|thumb|right|Prof. Horsford's Phosphatic Baking Powder, ca. 1900]]
In America,  [[Eben Norton Horsford]], a student of [[Justus von Liebig]], set out to create a flour fortifier and leavening agent. In 1856, he was awarded a patent for \"pulverulent phosphoric acid,\" a process for extracting monocalcium pyrophosphate extracted from bones. Combined with baking soda, [[monocalcium phosphate|monocalcium pyrophosphate]] provided a double-acting form of leavening.  Its initial reaction, when exposed to water, released carbon dioxide and produced  dicalcium phosphate, which then reacted under heat to release second-stage carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36–44}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>

In 1859, Horsford and George Wilson formed the Rumford Chemical Works, named in honor of [[Count Rumford]]. In 1861, Horsford published ''The theory and art of breadmaking: A new process without the use of ferment'', describing his innovations. In 1864, he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or \"Bread preparation\" in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36–44}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>

Horsford's research was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]], but in 1869 Horsford finally created an already-mixed leavening agent by using [[cornstarch]] as a buffer. Rumford Chemical Works then began the manufacture of what can be considered a true baking powder. Throughout his career, Horsford continued to experiment extensively with possible techniques and preparations for baking powder. Horsford's leavening products were marketed originally as \"Horsford's Yeast Powder\" and later as \"Rumford Baking Powder\". They were packaged in glass bottles and later in metal cans.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36–44}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/> In 2006 the Rumford Chemical Works in East Providence, Rhode Island were designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] in recognition of baking powder's impact in making baking easier, quicker, and more reliable.<ref name=\"Landmark\">{{cite web|title=Development of Baking Powder: National Historic Chemical Landmark|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder.html |website=ACS Chemistry for Life|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|accessdate=2018-01-22}}</ref>

In the 1860s, Horsford shared his formula for baking powder with his former teacher, Justus von Liebig, who in turn shared it with [[Ludwig Clamor Marquart]] and Carl Zimmer in Germany. Baking powders based on Horsford's formula were sold in England as \"Horsford-Liebig Baking Powder\". They were also sold by several companies in Germany, beginning with Marquart and with Zimmer. However, baking powder was not successful in Germany at that time. Much of German baking occurred in guild-based bakeries, rather than in private homes, and the guilds were not interested in replacing centuries-old craft skills with a new technology.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|33–44}}<ref name=\"Jones\"/> Nonetheless, Liebig clearly saw the importance of Horsford's work, stating:

{{quote|The preparation of baking powder by Professor Horsford in Cambridge in North America, I consider one of the most important and beneficial discoveries that has been made in the last decade.|[[Justus von Liebig]]<ref name=\"Jones\"/>{{rp|73}}}}

====Dr. Oetker's Baking Powder====
[[Image:X014.jpg|thumb|right|German advertisement for Dr.&nbsp;Oetker's baking powder in 1903.]]
In the 1890s, the German pharmacist [[August Oetker]] began to market a baking powder directly to housewives. It became popular in Germany as \"Dr. Oetker's Baking Powder\" and as \"Backin\". Oetker started the mass production of phosphate-based baking powder in 1898 and patented his technique in 1903.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|93–94}} <ref name=\"Jones\"/>

Research by Paul R. Jones in 1993 has shown that Oetker's original recipe was a descendant of Horsford's phosphate-based recipe, obtained from Louis Marquand, a son of  Ludwig Clamor Marquart.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|93–94}}<ref name=\"Jones\">{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Paul R. |title=Justus Von Liebig, Eben Horsford and the Development of the Baking Powder Industry |journal=Ambix |date=18 July 2013 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=65–74 |doi=10.1179/amb.1993.40.2.65 |pmid=29185890 }}</ref> Dr. Oetker Baking Powder continues to be sold, currently listing its ingredients as sodium acid pyrophosphate, sodium bicarbonate and corn starch.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|93–94}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr. Oetker Baking Powder |url=https://www.oetker.ca/ca-en/our-products/dr-oetker-baking-powder/dr-oetker-baking-powder.html |website=Dr. Oetker |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>

====Royal Baking Powder====
In the U.S., in 1866, [[Joseph C. Hoagland]] and his brother Cornelius developed a baking powder product with the help of Thomas M. Biddle.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|70–74}} They sold a single-action baking powder containing cream of tartar, bicarbonate of soda and starch. Their formula became known as Royal Baking Powder.<ref name=\"Royal1942\">{{cite book |last1=Royal Baking Powder |title=A Guide to Royal Success in Baking |date=1942 |publisher=Standard Brands Incorporated |page=4 |url=https://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/sliker/msuspcsbs_royb_royalbakin46/msuspcsbs_royb_royalbakin46.pdf |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>

Initially in partnership as Biddle & Hoagland, the Hoaglands moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Chicago, leaving Biddle behind, and then to New York. They incorporated there as the [[Royal Baking Powder Company]] in 1868. Various battles for control ensued between the Hoagland brothers and their one-time employee [[William Ziegler (industrialist)|William Ziegler]]. Finally, on March 2, 1899, Ziegler established the New Jersey-based Royal Baking Powder Corporation which combined the three major cream of tartar baking powder companies then in existence in the United States: Dr. Price (Ziegler), Royal (Joseph Hoagland) and Cleveland (Cornelius Nevius Hoagland).<ref name=\"Civitello\">{{cite book |last1=Civitello |first1=Linda |title=Baking powder wars : the cutthroat food fight that revolutionized cooking |date=2017 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location=Urbana |isbn=978-0252041082 |pages=45, 70–74}}</ref>

====Alum based baking powders ====
Cream of tartar was an expensive ingredient in the United States, since it had to be imported from France.  In the 1880s, several companies developed double-action baking powders containing cheaper alternative acids known as [[Alum]]s, a class of compounds involving double sulfates of aluminum.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|68}}
The use of various types of alum in medicines and dyes is mentioned in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History]]''.<ref name=\"pliny\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D35%3Achapter%3D52 |chapter=Alumen, and the several varieties of it; Thirty-eight remedies |author=Pliny the Elder |author-link=Pliny the Elder |trans-title=[[Natural History]] |title=Naturalis Historia |orig-year=77 CE |at=book&nbsp;35, chapter&nbsp;52 |series=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=[[Tufts University]] |access-date=27 December 2011 |language=la, en}}</ref> 
However, the actual composition of alum was not determined until 1798, when [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin|Louis Vauquelin]] demonstrated that common alum is a [[double salt]], composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash.<ref>Vauquelin (1797) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015065209101;view=1up;seq=266 \"Sur la nature de l'Alun du commerce, sur l'existence de la potasse dans ce sel, et sur diverses combinaisons simples ou triples de l'alumine avec l'acide sulfurique\"]. In ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', 1st series, volume 22, pp. 258–279.</ref> and [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal]] published the analysis of four different kinds of alum.<ref>Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1797), [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015065209101;view=1up;seq=288 \"Comparée des quatre principales sortes d'Alun connues dans le commerce; et Observations sur leur nature et leur usage\"]. In ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', 1st series, volume 22, pp. 280–296.</ref>

In 1888, [[William Monroe Wright]] (a former salesman for Dr. Price) and [[George Campbell Rew]] in Chicago introduced a new form of baking powder, which they called [[Calumet Baking Powder Company|Calumet]].  Calumet Baking Powder contained baking soda, a cornstarch buffer, [[sodium aluminum sulfate]] ({{chem|NaAl(SO|4|)|2|·12H|2|O}}) as a leavening agent, and [[albumen]].<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|83–85}}  In 1899, after years of experimentation with various possible formulae beginning in the 1870s, [[Hulman & Company|Herman Hulman]] of [[Terre Haute]] also introduced a baking powder made with sodium aluminium sulfate. He called his baking powder  [[Clabber Girl|Clabber]], referencing a German baking tradition in which [[Clabber (food)|soured milk]] was used for leavening.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|92–95}}

====Cream of tartar vs. alum====
Sodium aluminum sulfate baking powders were double-acting, and much less expensive to produce than cream of tartar-based baking powders. Cooks also needed less alum-based baking powder to produce a comparable effect.  As a result alum-based baking powders were severe competition for Royal Baking Powder's cream of tartar-based products.  William Ziegler of the Royal Baking Powder Company used a variety of tactics, ranging from false advertising and industrial espionage to bribery, to try to convince consumers and legislators that aluminum-based baking powders were harmful. He suggested (without actual evidence) that alum was unnatural and poisonous, while cream of tartar was natural and healthful. He attempted (and in [[Missouri]] briefly succeeded) in convincing legislators to ban aluminum compounds from use in baking powders.  At the same time, he changed his own \"Dr. Price\" baking powder to an aluminum-based formula that cornered two-thirds of the baking powder market in the southern states. Eventually, after a number of legal and commercial battles that included bribery charges against Ziegler and a grand jury hearing, Royal lost the baking powder wars.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|97–113}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Panko|first1=Ben|title=The Great Uprising: How a Powder Revolutionized Baking|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-uprising-how-powder-revolutionized-baking-180963772/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=20 June 2017}}</ref>

The idea that aluminum in baking powder is dangerous can be traced to Ziegler's attack advertising, and has little if any scientific support.  Aluminum is a commonly-found metal that appears in trace quantities in most foods.<ref name=\"Schwarcz\">{{cite news |last1=Schwarcz |first1=Joe |title=The Right Chemistry: Why might baking powder contain aluminum or GMOs? |url=https://montrealgazette.com/technology/science/the-right-chemistry-why-might-baking-power-contain-aluminum-or-gmos |accessdate=29 January 2019 |work=Montreal Gazette |date=June 3, 2016}}</ref>
By the 1970s Royal had ceased to produce a cream of tartar baking powder. For those who wanted something similar, [[James Beard]] suggested combining two parts cream of tartar to one part baking soda just before using it, since the mixture would not keep.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|175}}   
Instead of cream of tartar, modern Royal baking powder contains a mixture of Hulman's sodium aluminum sulfate and Horsford's monocalcium phosphate.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|187}}

====Bakewell Baking Powder====
One more type of baking powder was introduced during [[World War II]] under the brand name Bakewell.  Faced with wartime shortages of cream of tartar and baking powder, Byron H. Smith, a U.S. inventor in [[Bangor, Maine]], created substitute products for American housewives. [[Bakewell Cream]] was introduced as a replacement for cream of tartar.<ref>{{cite web |title=All About Bakewell Cream |url=https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5827-all-about-bakewell-cream |website=Cook's Illustrated |accessdate=29 January 2019|date= January 2011}}</ref> It contained [[sodium acid pyrophosphate]] and cornstarch and was labeled as a leavening agent. It could be substituted for cream of tartar or mixed with baking soda to replace baking powder.<ref name=\"Oliver\">{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Sandra |last2=Standish |first2=Marjorie |title=Cooking Maine style : tried and true recipes from Down East |date=May 31, 2018 |publisher=Down East Books |location=Lanham, MD |isbn=978-1608939534 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d99jDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA112 |accessdate=29 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Jampel\">{{cite web |last1=Jampel |first1=Sarah |title=Is This Ingredient the Secret to the Best Biscuits of Your Life?! |url=https://food52.com/blog/16844-is-this-ingredient-the-secret-to-the-best-biscuits-of-your-life |website=Food52 |accessdate=29 January 2019|date=May 11, 2016}}</ref>

Smith also sold a baking powder replacement, in which [[sodium acid pyrophosphate]] was already mixed with bicarbonate of soda and cornstarch.  Somewhat confusingly, it was marketed as \"Bakewell Baking Powder\" or \"Bakewell Cream Baking Powder\". Some packaging uses the phrase \"The Original Bakewell Cream\". A product labelled  \"Bakewell Cream\" may be either the cream of tartar substitute or the baking powder substitute depending on whether it is additionally identified as \"Double acting\" \"Baking Powder\". A modern version containing acid sodium pyrophosphate, sodium bicarbonate and redried starch, is sold as being both aluminum-free and gluten-free.<ref name=\"Pollard\">{{cite news |last1=Pollard |first1=Nancy |title=A Gift Of A Better Baking Powder |url=https://lacuisineus.com/superior-source-for-baking-powder-a-great-rise/ |accessdate=29 January 2019 |work=Kitchen Detail |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>

The formation of a brand's current baking powder may be very different from the original formula they produced, shown above. They may now use combinations of acids, or different acids altogether.  Nonetheless,
Rumford Baking Power in the United States<ref name=\"CooksCountry\"/> and Magic Baking Powder in Canada continue to produce double-acting baking powders containing  monocalcium phosphate, baking soda, and cornstarch. 
As of 2010, the two main baking powder companies in the United States were Clabber Girl and Calumet, both of which use sodium aluminum sulfate.  Calument held about 1/3 of the American baking powder market, with Clabber Girl dominating 2/3.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|187–188}}

== How much to use ==
[[File:BakingPowderFoaming.jpg|thumb|125px|Effective baking powder foams when placed in hot water.]]
Generally, one [[teaspoon]] (5 g or 1/6 oz) of baking powder is used to [[leavening|raise]] a mixture of one [[Cup (unit)|cup]] (120&nbsp;g or 4oz) of flour, one cup of liquid, and one egg. However, if the mixture is acidic, baking powder's additional acids remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food. High acidity can be caused by ingredients such as [[buttermilk]], [[lemon juice]], [[yogurt]], [[citrus]], or [[honey]]. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only ½ teaspoon of baking powder—the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with ¼ teaspoon of baking soda.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

However, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess alkaline substances can sometimes [[deprotonate]] the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem, though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.

Moisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time, and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container. Regardless of the expiration date, the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water. If it bubbles vigorously, it is still active and usable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder |title=Baking Powder |accessdate=2009-03-06 | publisher=Fine Cooking | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201093809/http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder| archivedate= 1 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

== Comparisons ==
Different brands of baking powder can perform quite differently in the oven. Early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks, to promote their new products, to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them, and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder. Baking powders using cream-of-tartar, phosphates, or alums could behave very differently, and required different amounts for a desired rising effect.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>

In 2015, ''[[Cook's Country]]'', an American TV show and magazine, evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers. In one test, six U.S. brands were used to bake white cake, cream biscuits, and chocolate cookies. Depending on the brand, the thickness of the cakes varied by up to 20% (from 0.89 to 1.24 in). It was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies. Also, 30% of the testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminum.<ref name=\"CooksCountry\">{{cite journal|last=Savoie|first=Lauren|year=2015|title=Taste Test: Baking Powder|journal=[[Cook's Country]]|issue=66|page=31|issn=1552-1990|ref=https://archive.org/details/Cooks_Country_January_2015/page/n31}}<!--=2015-11-21 --></ref>

== Substituting in recipes ==

===Substitute acids===
As described above, baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid. In principle, a number of kitchen acids may be combined with baking soda to simulate commercial baking powders. [[Vinegar]] (dilute acetic acid), especially white vinegar, is also a common acidifier in baking; for example, many heirloom chocolate cake recipes call for a tablespoon or two of vinegar.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Chocolate Cake with Vinegar – Antique Recipe Still Very Good | date= | publisher= | url=http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,176,151187-238193,00.html | work =Cooks.com | pages = | accessdate = 2009-06-12 }}</ref> Where a recipe already uses [[buttermilk]] or [[yogurt]], baking soda can be used without cream of tartar (or with less). Alternatively, lemon juice can be substituted for some of the liquid in the recipe, to provide the required acidity to activate the baking soda. The main variable with the use of these kitchen acids is the rate of leavening.

[[File:BakingPowder.jpg|thumb|U.S. consumer-packaged baking powder. This particular type of baking powder contains monocalcium phosphate, sodium bicarbonate, and cornstarch.]]
'''Baking powder''' is a dry chemical [[leavening agent]], a mixture of a [[carbonate]] or [[bicarbonate]] and a weak [[acid]]. The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as [[cornstarch]]. Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods. It works by releasing [[carbon dioxide]] gas into a batter or dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus [[leavening agent|leavening]] the mixture.  The first single-acting baking powder was  developed by a Birmingham based food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in England in 1843. The first double-acting baking powder was developed by [[Eben Norton Horsford]] in the United States of America in the 1860s.

Baking powder is used instead of [[yeast]] for end-products where [[fermentation]] flavors would be undesirable,<ref>{{cite book | last=Matz | first=Samuel A. | title=Bakery Technology and Engineering | edition=3 | year=1992 | page=54 | publisher=Springer | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=rU1wQotD3jIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>  
where the batter lacks the elastic structure to hold gas bubbles for more than a few minutes,<ref>{{cite book | last=McGee| first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking | edition=revised | year=2004 | page=533 | publisher=Scribner-Simon &amp; Schuster | url= https://books.google.com/?id=bKVCtH4AjwgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22on+food+and+cooking%22+mcgee | accessdate=2009-08-12| isbn=9781416556374 }}</ref> and to speed the production of baked goods. Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical leavening are called [[quick bread]]s.  The introduction of baking powder was revolutionary in minimizing the time and labor required to make breadstuffs. It led to the creation of new types of cakes, cookies, biscuits, and other baked goods.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/>

==Formulation and mechanism==
Baking powder is made up of a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], an [[acid]], and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"KO\"/> 
Most commercially available baking powders are made up of [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, also known as [[baking soda]] or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more [[acid salt]]s.<ref name=\"KO\"/>

===Acid-base reactions===
When combined with water, the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous [[carbon dioxide]]. 
Whether commercially or domestically prepared, the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same. The acid-base reaction can be generically represented as shown:<ref>{{cite book | editor=A.J. Bent | title=The Technology of Cake Making | edition=6 | year=1997 | page=102 | publisher=Springer | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=OTy8aIWxHhQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

:NaHCO<sub>3</sub>  +  H<sup>+</sup>   →   Na<sup>+</sup>  +  CO<sub>2</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O

The real reactions are more complicated because the acids are complicated. For example, starting with baking soda and monocalcium phosphate the reaction produces carbon dioxide by the following [[stoichiometry]]:<ref name=KO/>

:14 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>  +  5 Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>    →   14 CO<sub>2</sub>  +  Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH  + 7 Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>  +  13 H<sub>2</sub>O

[[Image:Calcium dihydrogen phosphate.png|thumb|220px|[[Monocalcium phosphate]] (\"MCP\") is a common acid component in domestic baking powders.]]
A typical formulation (by weight) could call for 30% sodium bicarbonate, 5–12% [[monocalcium phosphate]], and 21–26% [[sodium aluminium sulfate]].  
Alternately, a commercial baking powder might use [[sodium acid pyrophosphate]] as one of the two acidic components instead of sodium aluminium sulfate.
Another typical acid in such formulations is [[cream of tartar]] ([[potassium|K]][[Carbon|C<sub>4</sub>]][[hydrogen|H<sub>5</sub>]][[oxygen|O<sub>6</sub>]]), a derivative of [[tartaric acid]].<ref name=\"KO\"/>
In some jurisdictions, it is required that baking soda must produce at least 10 per cent of its weight of [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-33.html#h-65|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Food and Drug Regulations|last=Branch|first=Legislative Services|website=laws.justice.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Lallemand\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lallemand.com/BakerYeastNA/eng/PDFs/LBU%20PDF%20FILES/1_12CHEM.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030303163912/http://www.lallemand.com/BakerYeastNA/eng/PDFs/LBU%20PDF%20FILES/1_12CHEM.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-03-03 |title=Chemical Leaveners, Lallemand Baking Update, Vol. 1 No. 12, 1996 |accessdate=2009-03-05 |publisher=Lallemand Inc. }}</ref>

===Single- and double-acting baking powders===
The use of two acidic components is the basis of the term \"double acting.\"<ref name=\"KO\"/>    
The acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting.<ref>{{cite book | last=Lindsay | first=Robert C. | editor=Owen R. Fennema | title=Food Chemistry | edition=3 | year=1996 | page=772 | publisher=CRC Press | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=1OhFPZ7tFz8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA772#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> 
A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature, and a slow-acting acid does not react until heated. When the chemical reactions in baking powders involve both fast- and slow-acting acids, they are known as \"double-acting\"; those that contain only one acid are \"single-acting\".<ref name=\"google\"/>

By providing a second rise in the oven, double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical. This is the type of baking powder most widely available to consumers today. Double-acting baking powders work in two phases; once when cold, and once when hot.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=BakeWise: The Hows and Whys of Successful Baking with Over 200 Magnificent Recipes|author=Corriher, S.O.|date=2008|publisher=Scribner|isbn=9781416560838|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-iwjIb2RxwC|accessdate=2014-10-25}}</ref>

For example, Rumford Baking Powder is a double-acting product that contains only monocalcium phosphate as a leavening acid. With this acid, about two-thirds of the available gas is released within about two minutes of mixing at room temperature. It then becomes dormant because an intermediate form of dicalcium phosphate is generated during the initial mixing. Further release of gas requires the batter to be heated above 140&nbsp;°F (60&nbsp;°C).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.clabbergirl.com/faq.php | title=Frequently Asked Questions | work=Clabber Girl | publisher=[[Clabber Girl]] | date=2014 | accessdate=2014-03-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329214603/http://www.clabbergirl.com/faq.php | archive-date=2014-03-29 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Common low-temperature acid salts include [[cream of tartar]] and [[monocalcium phosphate]] (also called calcium acid phosphate). High-temperature acid salts include [[sodium aluminium sulfate]], [[sodium aluminium phosphate]], and [[sodium acid pyrophosphate]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Matz | first=Samuel A. | title=Bakery Technology and Engineering | edition=3 | year=1992 | pages=71–72 | publisher=Springer | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=rU1wQotD3jIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA71#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

===Starch component===
Baking powders also include components to improve their stability and consistency. [[Cornstarch]], [[flour]], or [[potato starch]] are often used as buffers.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"KO\">John Brodie, John Godber  \"Bakery Processes, Chemical Leavening Agents\" in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 2001, John Wiley & Sons. {{DOI|10.1002/0471238961.0308051303082114.a01.pub2}}</ref> 
An inert starch serves several functions in baking powder. Primarily it is used to absorb moisture, and thus prolong shelf life of the compound by keeping the powder's alkaline and acidic components dry so as not to react with each other prematurely. A dry powder also flows and mixes more easily. Finally, the added bulk allows for more accurate measurements.<ref>{{cite book | last=McGee| first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking | edition=revised | year=2004 | page=534 | publisher=Scribner-Simon &amp; Schuster | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA534#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

== History ==
===Before baking powder===
When Amelia Simmons published ''[[American Cookery]]'' (1792), the first American cookbook, the recipes she included used three possible types of leavening: [[baker's yeast]], emptins (from the leavings of [[brewer's yeast]]), and [[pearlash]]. 
At that time, the mechanisms underlying the action of yeasts and other leavenings were not understood, and reliable commercial products were not available.  Bakers obtained yeasts from brewers or distillers or made their own by exposing mixtures of flour and water to the open air. If lucky, they could capture useful wild yeast and keep some alive, regularly feeding it for ongoing use and trying to avoid contamination. Women who made their own ale could use the brewing dregs or \"emptins\" in their baking.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>
  
The effectiveness of such leavenings varied widely. Resulting baked goods often had a sour or bitter taste.  Breads were made of grain, water, yeast, and sometimes salt. Cooks also made yeast, sponge and [[pound cake]]s. Yeast cakes were similar to breads but included fancier ingredients, like sugar, spices, fruits or nuts.  Sponge cakes used beaten egg whites for leavening.  Pound cakes combined butter, sugar, and flour and eggs, and were particularly dense. Making cakes was even more laborious than making bread: to prepare a cake, a manservant might have to beat the ingredients together as long as an hour.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>

===Pearlash===
The third type of leavening, pearlash, was the precursor to modern baking powder. Pearlash was a purified form of [[potash]].  It was the subject of the first patent in the United States, issued in April 1790. Its preparation was time-consuming, but could be accomplished by a housewife with a cast-iron kettle: it involved soaking fireplace ashes in water to make  [[lye]], and then boiling the lye to remove water and obtain \"salts\".<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>

The active ingredient in pearlash was [[potassium carbonate]] ([[potassium|K<sub>2</sub>]][[carbonate|CO<sub>3</sub>]]). Combining it with an acidic ingredient like [[sour milk]] or [[lemon juice]] resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"FPF\">{{cite web |title=The History Dish: Pearlash, The First Chemical Leavening |url=http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/the-history-dish-pearlash-the-first-chemical-leavening/ |website=Four Pounds Flour |accessdate=11 January 2019|date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>
Once prepared, the white powder was much more stable than yeast. Small amounts could be used on a daily basis, rather than baking a week or two weeks' worth of bread at one time.  ''American Cookery'' was the first cookbook to call for its use, but by no means the last. With pearlash, cooks were able to create new recipes for new types of cakes, cookies, and biscuits that were quicker and easier to make than yeast-based recipes.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Martha C. |title=Of Pearl Ash, Emptins, And Tree Sweetnin' America's First Native Cookbook |journal=American Heritage |date=1981 |volume=32 |issue=5 |url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/pearl-ash-emptins-and-tree-sweetnin%E2%80%99 |accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Stavely\">{{cite news |last1=Stavely |first1=Keith |last2=Fitzgerald |first2=Kathleen |title=What America’s First Cookbook Says About Our Country and Its Cuisine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-americas-first-cookbook-says-about-our-country-its-cuisine-180967809/ |accessdate=24 January 2019 |work=Smithsonian magazine |date=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Longone\">{{cite web |last1=Longone |first1=Jan |title=Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project By Jan Longone, Curator of American Culinary History, Clements Library, University of Michigan |url=https://d.lib.msu.edu/fa/introduction |website=Clements Library, University of Michigan |accessdate=26 January 2019|date=2002}}</ref>

===Experimentation===
Between the publication of ''American Cookery'' in 1796, and the mid-1800s, cooks experimented with a variety of acids, alkalis, and mineral salts as possible chemical leaveners. Many were already available in households as medicinal, cleaning or solvent products. [[Smelling salts]], [[hartshorn]], and [[sal volatile]] were all ammonia inhalants, containing forms of [[ammonium carbonate]].  The term \"saleratus\" was  applied confusingly to both [[potassium bicarbonate]] and to [[sodium bicarbonate]] ([[sodium|Na]][[bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub>]], what we now call baking soda).<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24–25}} Baking soda and cream of tartar were relatively new ingredients for cooks: Soda may have been introduced to American cooking by female Irish immigrants who found work as kitchen help.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|39}} [[Cream of tartar]], also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate, was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from France and Italy.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24–25}}

In 1846, the first edition of Catherine Beecher's cookbook ''Domestic Recipe Book'' (1846) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar.  
Several recipes in the compilation cookbook ''Practical American Cookery'' (1855) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough.  There were recipes for a \"crust\" similar to modern dumplings or cobbler, several for cakes, and one for \"soda doughnuts\".<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24–25}}  When the third edition of ''Miss Beecher's Domestic Receipt Book'' appeared in 1858, it included 8 types of leaveners, only two of which could be made at home.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|31–32}}

Baking soda and cream of tartar were sold by chemists rather than in grocery stores. Pharmacists purchased the materials in bulk and then dispensed them individually in small amounts in paper packaging. At least one contributor to ''Practical American Cookery'' provided instructions on how to handle baking soda and cream of tartar.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24–25}} Even with instructions, early leaveners could be difficult to obtain, awkward to store, unstandardized, and unpredictable to use.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|26–32}}

The chemical leavening effects were accomplished by the activating of a base such as baking soda in the presence of liquid(s) and an acid such as sour milk, [[vinegar]], lemon juice, or cream of tartar.<ref>{{cite book | last=Stauffer | first=Clyde E. | title=Functional Additives for Bakery Foods | year=1990 | page=193 | publisher=Springer | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ckfdE5sRbqAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> Because these acidulants react with baking soda quickly, retention of gas bubbles was dependent on batter viscosity. It was critical for the batter to be baked quickly, before the gas escaped.  The next step, the development of baking powder, created a system where the gas-producing reactions could be delayed until needed.<ref>{{cite book | last=Edwards | first=W.P. | title=The Science of Bakery Products | year=2007 | page=73 | publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=oCVPjK0mSfkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

===The rise of baking powder===
[[File:Chemical Baking Powder.jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement for DeLand & Co's Chemical Baking Powder. Earliest possible date: 1877; latest possible date: 1893]]
The creation of shelf-stable chemical combinations of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar is seen as marking the true introduction of baking powder.<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>  Although cooks had used both sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar in recipes, they had to purchase the ingredients individually and store them separately to prevent them from spoiling or reacting prematurely. As chemists developed more uniform constituents, they also began to experiment with ways of combining them. In the mid-late 1800s, chemists introduced the first modern baking powders.<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>

====Alfred Bird====
The first to create a form of baking powder was English chemist and food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in 1843. Bird was motivated to develop a yeast-free leavener because his wife Elizabeth was allergic to eggs and yeast. His formulation included bicarbonate of soda and tartaric acid, mixed with starch to absorb moisture and prevent the other ingredients from reacting. A single-action form of baking powder, Alfred Bird's Baking Powder reacted as soon as it became damp.<ref name=\"Davidson\">{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Alan |last2=Saberi |first2=Helen |last3=Jaine |first3=Tom |last4=Davidson |first4=Jane L. |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |date=August 21, 2014 |publisher=OUP Oxford |page=55 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA55 |accessdate=24 January 2019|isbn=9780191040726 }}</ref>

Bird focused on selling his baking powder to the [[British Army]] during the [[Crimean War]], and to explorers like [[Francis McClintock|Captain Sir Francis Leopold McClintock]], rather than the domestic market.<ref name=\"Chynoweth\">{{cite web |last1=Chynoweth |first1=Tessa |title=Birmingham Manufactures: Alfred Bird & Sons – Poles Apart |url=http://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/blog/posts/birmingham-manufactures-alfred-bird-sons-poles-apart |website=Birmingham Museums |accessdate=25 January 2019|date=23 April 2018}}</ref> 
Nonetheless, Bird's creation of baking powder enabled cooks to take recipes for cakes such as the patriotically-named [[Victoria sponge]] and make them rise higher.<ref name=\"Earle\">{{cite news |last1=Earle |first1=Rebecca |title=How to make Victoria Sponge the way Queen Victoria would have eaten it |url=http://theconversation.com/how-to-make-victoria-sponge-the-way-queen-victoria-would-have-eaten-it-67798 |accessdate=25 January 2019 |work=The Conversation |date=October 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Cloake\">{{cite news |last1=Cloake |first1=Felicity |title=How to make the perfect Victoria sponge cake |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/may/16/how-bake-perfect-victoria-sponge-cake |accessdate=24 January 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=16 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Hughes\">{{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=Kathryn |title=The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton |date=2005 |publisher=Fourth Estate |location=London}}</ref>
He did not patent his discovery, and others such as [[Henry Jones (baker)|Henry Jones]] of Bristol soon produced and patented similar products. In 1845, Jones patented \"A new preparation of flour\" ([[self-raising flour]]) that included sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid to obtain a leavening effect.<ref name=\"Page\">{{cite journal |last1=Page |first1=Frederick G. |title=BAKING POWDER AND SELF-RISING FLOUR (1) IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY BRITAIN: THE CARBON DIOXIDE AERATIONS OF HENRY JONES AND ALFRED BIRD |journal=Bulletin for the History of Chemistry |date=2013 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=140–154 |url=http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v38-2/v38-2%20p140-154.pdf |accessdate=31 January 2019}}</ref>

====Eben Norton Horsford====
[[File:Prof. Horsford's Baking Powder (3093625150).jpg|thumb|right|Prof. Horsford's Phosphatic Baking Powder, ca.1900]]
In America,  [[Eben Norton Horsford]], a student of [[Justus von Liebig]], set out to create a flour fortifier and leavening agent. In 1856, he was awarded a patent for \"pulverulent phosphoric acid,\" a process for extracting monocalcium pyrophosphate extracted from bones. Combined with baking soda, [[monocalcium phosphate|monocalcium pyrophosphate]] provided a double-acting form of leavening.  Its initial reaction, when exposed to water, released carbon dioxide and produced  dicalcium phosphate, which then reacted under heat to release second-stage carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36–44}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>

In 1859, Horsford and George Wilson formed the Rumford Chemical Works, named in honor of [[Count Rumford]]. In 1861, Horsford published ''The theory and art of breadmaking: A new process without the use of ferment'', describing his innovations. In 1864, he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or \"Bread preparation\" in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36–44}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>

Horsford's research was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]], but in 1869 Horsford finally created an already-mixed leavening agent by using [[cornstarch]] as a buffer. Rumford Chemical Works then began the manufacture of what can be considered a true baking powder. Throughout his career, Horsford continued to experiment extensively with possible techniques and preparations for baking powder. Horsford's leavening products were marketed originally as \"Horsford's Yeast Powder\" and later as \"Rumford Baking Powder\". They were packaged in glass bottles and later in metal cans.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36–44}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/> In 2006 the Rumford Chemical Works in East Providence, Rhode Island were designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] in recognition of baking powder's impact in making baking easier, quicker, and more reliable.<ref name=\"Landmark\">{{cite web|title=Development of Baking Powder: National Historic Chemical Landmark|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder.html |website=ACS Chemistry for Life|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|accessdate=2018-01-22}}</ref>

In the 1860s, Horsford shared his formula for baking powder with his former teacher, Justus von Liebig, who in turn shared it with [[Ludwig Clamor Marquart]] and Carl Zimmer in Germany. Baking powders based on Horsford's formula were sold in England as \"Horsford-Liebig Baking Powder\". They were also sold by several companies in Germany, beginning with Marquart and with Zimmer. However, baking powder was not successful in Germany at that time. Much of German baking occurred in guild-based bakeries, rather than in private homes, and the guilds were not interested in replacing centuries-old craft skills with a new technology.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|33–44}}<ref name=\"Jones\"/> Nonetheless, Liebig clearly saw the importance of Horsford's work, stating:

====Dr. Oetker's Baking Powder====
[[Image:X014.jpg|thumb|right|German advertisement for Dr.&nbsp;Oetker's baking powder in 1903.]]
In the 1890s, the German pharmacist [[August Oetker]] began to market a baking powder directly to housewives. It became popular in Germany as \"Dr. Oetker's Baking Powder\" and as \"Backin\". Oetker started the mass production of phosphate-based baking powder in 1898 and patented his technique in 1903.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|93–94}} <ref name=\"Jones\"/>

Research by Paul R. Jones in 1993 has shown that Oetker's original recipe was a descendant of Horsford's phosphate-based recipe, obtained from Louis Marquand, a son of  Ludwig Clamor Marquart.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|93–94}}<ref name=\"Jones\">{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Paul R. |title=Justus Von Liebig, Eben Horsford and the Development of the Baking Powder Industry |journal=Ambix |date=18 July 2013 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=65–74 |doi=10.1179/amb.1993.40.2.65 |pmid=29185890 }}</ref> Dr. Oetker Baking Powder continues to be sold, currently listing its ingredients as sodium acid pyrophosphate, sodium bicarbonate and corn starch.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|93–94}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr. Oetker Baking Powder |url=https://www.oetker.ca/ca-en/our-products/dr-oetker-baking-powder/dr-oetker-baking-powder.html |website=Dr. Oetker |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>

====Royal Baking Powder====
In the U.S., in 1866, [[Joseph C. Hoagland]] and his brother Cornelius developed a baking powder product with the help of Thomas M. Biddle.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|70–74}} They sold a single-action baking powder containing cream of tartar, bicarbonate of soda and starch. Their formula became known as Royal Baking Powder.<ref name=\"Royal1942\">{{cite book |last1=Royal Baking Powder |title=A Guide to Royal Success in Baking |date=1942 |publisher=Standard Brands Incorporated |page=4 |url=https://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/sliker/msuspcsbs_royb_royalbakin46/msuspcsbs_royb_royalbakin46.pdf |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>

Initially in partnership as Biddle & Hoagland, the Hoaglands moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Chicago, leaving Biddle behind, and then to New York. They incorporated there as the [[Royal Baking Powder Company]] in 1868. Various battles for control ensued between the Hoagland brothers and their one-time employee [[William Ziegler (industrialist)|William Ziegler]]. Finally, on March 2, 1899, Ziegler established the New Jersey-based Royal Baking Powder Corporation which combined the three major cream of tartar baking powder companies then in existence in the United States: Dr. Price (Ziegler), Royal (Joseph Hoagland) and Cleveland (Cornelius Nevius Hoagland).<ref name=\"Civitello\">{{cite book |last1=Civitello |first1=Linda |title=Baking powder wars : the cutthroat food fight that revolutionized cooking |date=2017 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location=Urbana, Illinois |isbn=9780252041082 |page=45,70–74}}</ref>

====Alum based baking powders ====
Cream of tartar was an expensive ingredient in the United States, since it had to be imported from France.  In the 1880s, several companies developed double-action baking powders containing cheaper alternative acids known as [[Alum]]s, a class of compounds involving double sulfates of aluminum.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|68}}
The use of various types of alum in medicines and dyes is mentioned in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History]]''.<ref name=\"pliny\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D35%3Achapter%3D52 |chapter=Alumen, and the several varieties of it; Thirty-eight remedies |author=Pliny the Elder |author-link=Pliny the Elder |trans-title=[[Natural History]] |title=Naturalis Historia |orig-year=77 CE |at=book&nbsp;35, chapter&nbsp;52 |series=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=[[Tufts University]] |access-date=27 December 2011 |language=la, en}}</ref> 
However, the actual composition of alum was not determined until 1798, when [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin|Louis Vauquelin]] demonstrated that common alum is a [[double salt]], composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash.<ref>Vauquelin (1797) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015065209101;view=1up;seq=266 \"Sur la nature de l'Alun du commerce, sur l'existence de la potasse dans ce sel, et sur diverses combinaisons simples ou triples de l'alumine avec l'acide sulfurique\"]. In ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', 1st series, volume 22, pages 258–279.</ref> and [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal]] published the analysis of four different kinds of alum.<ref>Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1797), [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015065209101;view=1up;seq=288 \"Comparée des quatre principales sortes d'Alun connues dans le commerce; et Observations sur leur nature et leur usage\"]. In ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', 1st series, volume 22, pages 280–296.</ref>

In 1888, [[William Monroe Wright]] (a former salesman for Dr. Price) and [[George Campbell Rew]] in Chicago introduced a new form of baking powder, which they called [[Calumet Baking Powder Company|Calumet]].  Calumet Baking Powder contained baking soda, a cornstarch buffer, [[sodium aluminum sulfate]] ({{chem|NaAl(SO|4|)|2|·12H|2|O}}) as a leavening agent, and [[albumen]].<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|83–85}}  In 1899, after years of experimentation with various possible formulae beginning in the 1870s, [[Hulman & Company|Herman Hulman]] of [[Terre Haute]] also introduced a baking powder made with sodium aluminium sulfate. He called his baking powder  [[Clabber Girl|Clabber]], referencing a German baking tradition in which [[Clabber (food)|soured milk]] was used for leavening.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|92–95}}

====Cream of tartar vs. alum====
Sodium aluminum sulfate baking powders were double-acting, and much less expensive to produce than cream of tartar-based baking powders. Cooks also needed less alum-based baking powder to produce a comparable effect.  As a result alum-based baking powders were severe competition for Royal Baking Powder's cream of tartar-based products.  William Ziegler of the Royal Baking Powder Company used a variety of tactics, ranging from false advertising and industrial espionage to bribery, to try to convince consumers and legislators that aluminum-based baking powders were harmful. He suggested (without actual evidence) that alum was unnatural and poisonous, while cream of tartar was natural and healthful. He attempted (and in [[Missouri]] briefly succeeded) in convincing legislators to ban aluminum compounds from use in baking powders.  At the same time, he changed his own \"Dr. Price\" baking powder to an aluminum-based formula that cornered two-thirds of the baking powder market in the southern states. Eventually, after a number of legal and commercial battles that included bribery charges against Ziegler and a grand jury hearing, Royal lost the baking powder wars.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|97–113}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Panko|first1=Ben|title=The Great Uprising: How a Powder Revolutionized Baking|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-uprising-how-powder-revolutionized-baking-180963772/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=20 June 2017}}</ref>

The idea that aluminum in baking powder is dangerous can be traced to Ziegler's attack advertising, and has little if any scientific support.  Aluminum is a commonly-found metal that appears in trace quantities in most foods.<ref name=\"Schwarcz\">{{cite news |last1=Schwarcz |first1=Joe |title=The Right Chemistry: Why might baking powder contain aluminum or GMOs? |url=https://montrealgazette.com/technology/science/the-right-chemistry-why-might-baking-power-contain-aluminum-or-gmos |accessdate=29 January 2019 |work=Montreal Gazette |date=June 3, 2016}}</ref>
By the 1970s Royal had ceased to produce a cream of tartar baking powder. For those who wanted something similar, [[James Beard]] suggested combining two parts cream of tartar to one part baking soda just before using it, since the mixture would not keep.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|175}}   
Instead of cream of tartar, modern Royal baking powder contains a mixture of Hulman's sodium aluminum sulfate and Horsford's monocalcium phosphate.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|187}}

====Bakewell Baking Powder====
One more type of baking powder was introduced during [[World War II]] under the brand name Bakewell.  Faced with wartime shortages of cream of tartar and baking powder, Byron H. Smith, a U.S. inventor in [[Bangor, Maine]], created substitute products for American housewives. [[Bakewell Cream]] was introduced as a replacement for cream of tartar.<ref>{{cite web |title=All About Bakewell Cream |url=https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5827-all-about-bakewell-cream |website=Cook's Illustrated |accessdate=29 January 2019|date= January 2011}}</ref> It contained [[sodium acid pyrophosphate]] and cornstarch and was labeled as a leavening agent. It could be substituted for cream of tartar or mixed with baking soda to replace baking powder.<ref name=\"Oliver\">{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Sandra |last2=Standish |first2=Marjorie |title=Cooking Maine style : tried and true recipes from Down East |date=May 31, 2018 |publisher=Down East Books |location=Lanham, MD |isbn=978-1608939534 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d99jDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA112 |accessdate=29 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Jampel\">{{cite web |last1=Jampel |first1=Sarah |title=Is This Ingredient the Secret to the Best Biscuits of Your Life?! |url=https://food52.com/blog/16844-is-this-ingredient-the-secret-to-the-best-biscuits-of-your-life |website=Food52 |accessdate=29 January 2019|date=May 11, 2016}}</ref>

Smith also sold a baking powder replacement, in which [[sodium acid pyrophosphate]] was already mixed with bicarbonate of soda and cornstarch.  Somewhat confusingly, it was marketed as \"Bakewell Baking Powder\" or \"Bakewell Cream Baking Powder\". Some packaging uses the phrase \"The Original Bakewell Cream\". A product labelled  \"Bakewell Cream\" may be either the cream of tartar substitute or the baking powder substitute depending on whether it is additionally identified as \"Double acting\" \"Baking Powder\". A modern version containing acid sodium pyrophosphate, sodium bicarbonate and redried starch, is sold as being both aluminum-free and gluten-free.<ref name=\"Pollard\">{{cite news |last1=Pollard |first1=Nancy |title=A Gift Of A Better Baking Powder |url=https://lacuisineus.com/superior-source-for-baking-powder-a-great-rise/ |accessdate=29 January 2019 |work=Kitchen Detail |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>

The formation of a brand's current baking powder may be very different from the original formula they produced, shown above. They may now use combinations of acids, or different acids altogether.  Nonetheless,
Rumford Baking Power in the United States<ref name=\"CooksCountry\"/> and Magic Baking Powder in Canada continue to produce double-acting baking powders containing  monocalcium phosphate, baking soda, and cornstarch. 
As of 2010, the two main baking powder companies in the United States were Clabber Girl and Calumet, both of which use sodium aluminum sulfate.  Calument held about 1/3 of the American baking powder market, with Clabber Girl dominating 2/3.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|187–188}}

== How much to use ==
[[File:BakingPowderFoaming.jpg|thumb|125px|Effective baking powder foams when placed in hot water.]]
Generally, one [[teaspoon]] (5 g or 1/6 oz) of baking powder is used to [[leavening|raise]] a mixture of one [[Cup (unit)|cup]] (120&nbsp;g or 4oz) of flour, one cup of liquid, and one egg. However, if the mixture is acidic, baking powder's additional acids remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food. High acidity can be caused by ingredients such as [[buttermilk]], [[lemon juice]], [[yogurt]], [[citrus]], or [[honey]]. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only ½ teaspoon of baking powder—the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with ¼ teaspoon of baking soda.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

However, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess alkaline substances can sometimes [[deprotonate]] the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem, though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.

Moisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time, and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container. Regardless of the expiration date, the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water. If it bubbles vigorously, it is still active and usable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder |title=Baking Powder |accessdate=2009-03-06 | publisher=Fine Cooking | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201093809/http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder| archivedate= 1 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

== Comparisons ==
Different brands of baking powder can perform quite differently in the oven. Early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks, to promote their new products, to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them, and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder. Baking powders using cream-of-tartar, phosphates, or alums could behave very differently, and required different amounts for a desired rising effect.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>

In 2015, ''[[Cook's Country]]'', an American TV show and magazine, evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers. In one test, six U.S. brands were used to bake white cake, cream biscuits, and chocolate cookies. Depending on the brand, the thickness of the cakes varied by up to 20% (from 0.89 to 1.24 in). It was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies. Also, 30% of the testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminum.<ref name=\"CooksCountry\">{{cite journal|last=Savoie|first=Lauren|year=2015|title=Taste Test: Baking Powder|journal=[[Cook's Country]]|issue=66|page=31|issn=1552-1990|ref=https://archive.org/details/Cooks_Country_January_2015/page/n31}}<!--=2015-11-21 --></ref>

== Substituting in recipes ==

===Substitute acids===
As described above, baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid. In principle, a number of kitchen acids may be combined with baking soda to simulate commercial baking powders. [[Vinegar]] (dilute acetic acid), especially white vinegar, is also a common acidifier in baking; for example, many heirloom chocolate cake recipes call for a tablespoon or two of vinegar.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Chocolate Cake with Vinegar – Antique Recipe Still Very Good | date= | publisher= | url=http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,176,151187-238193,00.html | work =Cooks.com | pages = | accessdate = 2009-06-12 }}</ref> Where a recipe already uses [[buttermilk]] or [[yogurt]], baking soda can be used without cream of tartar (or with less). Alternatively, lemon juice can be substituted for some of the liquid in the recipe, to provide the required acidity to activate the baking soda. The main variable with the use of these kitchen acids is the rate of leavening.

The host unit at Andersen AFB is the '''[[36th Wing]] (36 WG)''', assigned to the [[Pacific Air Forces]] [[Eleventh Air Force]].  As a non-flying wing, the 36 WG's mission is to provide support to deployed air and space forces of USAF, foreign air forces to Andersen, and tenant units assigned to the base.

Andersen AFB was established in 1944 as '''North Field''' and is named for [[Brigadier General]] [[James Roy Andersen]] (1904–1945).  The 36th Wing Commander is Brig. Gen. Gentry W. Boswell.  The Vice Wing Commander is Colonel Matthew J.

Due to Guam's almost unrestricted airspace and the close proximity of the [[Farallon de Medinilla|Farallon de Medinilla Island]], a naval bombing range {{convert|184|mi|km}} north, the base is in an ideal training location.

==History==
Andersen Air Force Base was established on 3 December 1944 and is named for Brigadier General James Roy Andersen (1904–1945).  General Andersen graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1926, served at various army installations, and obtained his wings at [[Kelly AFB|Kelly Field]], Texas, in 1936. During 1943–1944 he served on the War Department General Staff. In January 1945, General Andersen was assigned to HQ AAF, Pacific Ocean Area. He died on 26 February 1945 in the crash of a [[B-24 Liberator]] aircraft between [[Kwajalein]] and [[Johnston Island]] while en route to [[Hawaii]].

Andersen Air Force Base's origins begin on 7 December 1941 when Guam was attacked by the armed forces of [[Imperial Japan]] in the [[Battle of Guam (1941)]] three hours after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The United States Navy surrendered Guam to the Japanese on 10 December. At the height of the war, approximately 19,000 Japanese soldiers and sailors were deployed to the island. Guam was liberated by the [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine Corps']] 3rd Amphibious Corps on 21 July 1944, in the [[Battle of Guam (1944)]], after a 13-day pre-invasion bombardment.

The Japanese managed to contain the Marines on two beachheads, but their counter-attack failed. The Marines renewed their assault, and reached the northern tip of the island on 10 August 1944.  Japanese guerrilla activities continued until the end of the war, and some were [[Japanese holdout|holdouts]] for many years afterwards.

Guam was considered ideal to establish air bases to launch [[B-29 Superfortress]] operations against the [[Japanese Archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]]. The [[Marianas Islands]] are about {{convert|1500|mi|km}} from Tokyo, a range which the B-29s could just about manage. Most important of all, it could be put on a direct supply line from the United States by ship.  \"North Field,\" as Andersen AFB was first named, was the first air base built in Guam after its liberation. Its construction began in November 1944 and was supported by the [[United States Navy]] [[Seabee]]s.  North Field and its co-located [[Northwest Field (Guam)|Northwest Field]] was a massive installation, with four main runways, taxiways, [[Revetment (aircraft)|revetments]] for over 200 B-29s, and a large containment area for base operations and personnel.

The first host unit at North Field was the [[314th Air Division|314th Bombardment Wing]], [[XXI Bomber Command]], [[Twentieth Air Force]].  The 314th arrived in Guam on 16 January 1945 from Peterson Field, Colorado.  The 314th controlled four operational B-29 bomb groups, the [[19th Air Refueling Wing|19th]], (Square M), [[29th Bombardment Group|29th]] (Square O), [[39th Air Expeditionary Wing|39th]] (Square P), and [[330th Bombardment Group (VH)|330th]] (Square K).

B-29 Superfortress missions from North Field were attacks against strategic targets in Japan, operating in daylight and at a high altitude to bomb factories, refineries, and other objectives. In March 1945, the XXI Bomber Command changed tactics and started carrying out low-level night incendiary raids on area targets.  During the Allied assault on [[Okinawa]], groups of the 314th Bomb Wing attacked airfields from which the Japanese were sending out [[kamikaze|suicide planes]] against the invasion force.

Flying out of Guam, [[Henry E. Erwin|S/Sgt Henry E Erwin]] of the 29th Bombardment Group was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for action that saved his B-29 during a mission over [[Koriyama]], Japan, on 12 April 1945. When a phosphorus smoke bomb exploded in the launching chute and shot back into the plane, Sgt Erwin picked up the burning bomb, carried it to a window, and threw it out.

After the war, B-29s from North Field dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners and participated in several show-of-force missions over Japan.  The 29th, 39th and 330th Bomb Groups returned to the United States and deactivated in December 1945. The 19th remained in Guam to become the station's host unit after the 314th Bomb Wing was reassigned to [[Johnson AB]], Japan for occupation duty.

===Postwar years===
[[File:Aerial view of Andersen AFB.jpg|thumb|alt=Aerial view|Northwest Field at Andersen Air Force Base]]
After the end of [[World War II]], [[Guam]] served as a collection point for surplus war goods that had accumulated in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]].

The [[19th Bombardment Wing]] (BW) was formed at North AFB in 1948 from the resources of the former North Guam Air Force Base Command (Provisional). The 19th BW operated [[Andersen AFB]] and continued utilizing B-29s. In May 1949, the headquarters of the [[Twentieth Air Force]] moved from Guam to [[Kadena AB]], [[Okinawa]]. Its former staff was assigned to the 19th BW.

At Andersen, the wing assumed responsibility for supervising two active bases and one semi-active base, an assortment of communication, weather, radar, rescue and other facilities and units, including the [[Marianas Air Material Area]], a wing size unit.<ref>Ravenstein, Charles A. ''Air Force Combat Wings Lineage and Honors Histories 1947–1977''. [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], [[Alabama]]: Office of Air Force History 1984. {{ISBN|0-912799-12-9}}.</ref> Many of the units and facilities were deactivated within a few months.

In October 1949, the 19th Wing was transferred to the 20th Air Force's command. The remaining units in the Marianas and Bonin Islands were shifted to other organizations.  From 17 October 1949 until 28 June 1950, the wing continued B-29 training, operation of Andersen Air Force Base, and rescue and reconnaissance missions.

===1950s===
Three days after [[North Korea]] invaded [[South Korea]] in 1950, the 19th Bomb Group deployed [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] to Andersen to begin bombing targets throughout [[South Korea]]. A few days later, the group was detached from the 19th BW and deployed to [[Kadena Air Base]] on [[Okinawa Island]], Japan. The rest of the wing remained at Andersen, provided maintenance for transient aircraft, and operated ammunition dumps until 1953.

In 1951, the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) selected several overseas bases to support rotational unit deployments of its bombers from stateside bases, starting with [[B-29 Superfortress]] units and later including [[Convair B-36]], [[B-47 Stratojet]], [[B-50 Superfortress]] bombers, and [[Boeing KB-29|KB-29]] refueling tankers.

With decreased hostility in [[Korea]], the 19th BW headquarters was relocated to [[Kadena Air Base]], Japan in 1953 and was replaced by the 6319th Air Base Wing of the [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Forces (FEAF)]].

However, the [[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF Bomber Command]] ([[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF's]] 19th Bomb Wing and [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] 98th and 307th Bomb Wings) was deactivated in 1954. Its three B-29 wings returned to the contiguous United States and were replaced with [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47s]].

The 3rd Air Division was activated on 18 June in its place. Its objective was to control all SAC units in the Far East. The division operated as a tenant unit from June 1954 until April 1955 and received host-base support services from the 6319th until that unit was inactivated on 1 April 1955. The 6319th was replaced with the SAC-aligned 3960th Air Base Wing.

The [[Strategic Air Command]] continued its 90-day unit rotational training program and began to take control of the base from the [[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF]]. After the 1 April 1955 base transfer and activation of the 3960th Air Base Wing, [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47s]] replaced the [[Convair B-36|B-36s]] in the rotations. The 43rd Bomb Wing from [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], operated from July to October 1957, which eventually became Andersen's host unit. The 3960th Air Base Wing was redesignated on 1 July 1956 as the 3960th Air Base Group.

The [[41st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] of the [[United States Pacific Air Forces|Pacific Air Forces]], along with its [[F-86 Sabre|F-86s]], was stationed at Andersen from August 1956 until it was deactivated in March 1960. After that, the air defense mission was provided by deployments of [[Fifth Air Force|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Air Force]] units flying the [[F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]] aircraft.<ref name=\"global\">{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/andersen.htm |title=Andersen AFB |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=25 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708195013/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/andersen.htm |archivedate=8 July 2014  }}</ref>

===Vietnam===
Andersen's rotational duties concluded when the [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47]] was phased out and replaced by the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. The first [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]], the \"City of El Paso,\" arrived from the 95th Bomb Wing at [[Biggs Army Airfield|Biggs Air Force Base]], Texas in March 1964. It was followed by [[KC-135 Stratotanker]]s.

With the start of [[Operation Arc Light]] in June 1965, [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52Fs]] and [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135As]] began regular bombing missions over [[Vietnam]] and continued until 1973, with a break between August 1970 and early 1972.

In support of [[Operation Arc Light]], [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] activated the [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|4133rd Bombardment Wing (Provisional)]] on 1 February 1966. The [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|3960th Strategic Wing]], which was originally activated in 1955 as the 3960th Air Base Wing, continued as the base's host wing until it was deactivated and replaced by the [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|43rd Strategic Wing]] on 1 April 1970. The 43rd assumed the mission of the 4133rd on 1 July 1970 and continued in this capacity until the 57th Air Division (Provisional) and [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|72nd Strategic Wing (Provisional)]] were activated in June 1972 in support of '''Operation Bullet Shot'''<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>). The 303rd Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Wing (Provisional) was activated in July of the same year. All of the provisional units remained at Andersen until bombing missions ceased on 15 November 1973.

[[File:Andersen AFB with 150 B-52s 1972.jpg|thumb|About 150 B-52s at Andersen AFB, fall 1972]]
[[Operation Linebacker II]] continued the mission of [[Operation Arc Light]], and was most notable for its 11-day bombing campaign between 18 and 29 December 1972, in which more than 150 [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers flew 729 [[sortie]]s in 11 days. The [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] at Andersen, combined with other bombers stationed at [[U-Tapao International Airport|U-Tapao Field]] in Thailand, constituted about 50 percent of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] total bomber force and 75 percent of all combat crews. Two bases contained the equivalent of 13 stateside bomber wings.

The frequent bombings resulted in a cease-fire in [[Vietnam]]. However, the [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] continued to fly missions over [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] until those were halted on 15 August 1973. With the end of these runs, more than 100 [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]], both D and G Models, were deployed elsewhere in the world by October 1973. The [[Eighth Air Force]] moved to [[Barksdale Air Force Base]], [[Louisiana]], and the 3rd Air Division was reactivated on 1 January 1975.

When the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]] forces overran [[South Vietnam]] later in 1975, the base provided emergency relief and shelter for thousands of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] evacuees as a part of ''[[Operation New Life]]''. After the fall of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], Andersen received almost 40,000 refugees and processed another 109,000 for transportation to the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacaf.af.mil/Info/FactSheets/Display/tabid/420/Article/909895/andersen-air-force-base.aspx|title=Andersen Air Force Base|website=Pacific Air Forces|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>

The base returned to routine operations by the late 1970s, but continued to serve as one of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] strategic locations. Crews and aircraft were regularly sent to sites between Australia, [[Alaska]], and [[Korea]] and supported sea surveillance operations support for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].

Andersen was also home to the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron \"Typhoon Chasers\" during the 1960s through the 1980s. Air crews flying [[WC-130]]s tracked and penetrated typhoons, providing advanced warnings to military and civilian populations throughout the western Pacific. During the Vietnam War, the 54th also provided cloud-seeding capability along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and synoptic reconnaissance, deploying from [[Udorn RTAFB]] when not in Guam. The 54th WRS was inactivated in September 1987.

===Post-Vietnam===
In 1983, the 43rd completed its transition from the [[B-52 Stratofortress#B-52D|B-52D]] to the [[B-52 Stratofortress#B-52G|B-52G]] and became one of only two [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] bomber wings equipped with the [[Boeing Harpoon|Harpoon anti-ship missile]].

The base saw a major change in 1989, when control transferred from the [[Strategic Air Command]] to [[Pacific Air Forces]]. The 633rd Air Base Wing activated on 1 October 1989, which led to the deactivations of the 43rd Bomb Wing on 26 March 1990 and the 60th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 30 April 1990.

In August 1990, Andersen personnel began shipping over 37,000 tons of munitions to forces in the [[Persian Gulf]] in support of [[Gulf War|Operations Desert Shield]] and [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/trump-s-plan-pay-border-wall-air-force-funds-risks-n1054091|title=Trump's plan to pay for border wall with Air Force funds risks national security, report says|last=Kube|first=Courtney|work=NBC News|language=en|url-status=live|date=13 September 2019}}</ref>

With the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991, Andersen was instrumental in caring for American evacuees and their pets as a part of [[Operation Fiery Vigil]]. In December, Andersen became home to the [[Thirteenth Air Force]], which had evacuated from [[Clark Air Base]] in the [[Philippines]] after the eruption.

The host unit was changed on 1 October 1994, when the 633rd Air Base Wing was deactivated. The 36th Air Base Wing took over host operations and was redesignated as the [[36th Wing]] on 12 April 2006. In October 1994, the U.S. Navy's Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Five (HC-5) relocated to Andersen from the now-closed [[Naval Air Station Agana]], Guam.  HC-5 was later redesignated as Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Twenty-Five ([[HSC-25]]) following its transition from the [[CH-46]] to the [[MH-60S]].

The base was one of the [[Space Shuttle#Landing sites|few places in the world]] where the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]] was permitted to land, serving as an Augmented Emergency Landing Site for the Shuttle orbiter.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |title=Space Shuttle Emergency Landing Sites |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=20 July 2011|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331115426/http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |archivedate=31 March 2016  }}</ref>

In 2007, the 50-year-old South Runway's condition had deteriorated to a point at which complete removal and replacement of the runway was necessary to maintain safety. The 50.6 million-dollar runway replacement was a Design-Build project from the [[Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency]] to the Tutor-Perini Corporation and its local subsidiary, Black Construction Company.<ref name=\":0\" /> The project's scope included demolition and reconstruction of the existing 11,185 feet by 200 feet South Runway, repairs and tie-ins to existing taxiway intersections, removal and replacement of degraded airfield lighting, and arresting gear realignment and reconstruction.

On 23 February 2008, a USAF [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber, one of the most expensive military aircraft in the world, [[Andersen Air Force Base B-2 accident|crashed on the base]].  Both pilots ejected safely before the plane, valued at {{formatprice|1400000000}} U.S. dollars, crashed moments after take-off due to a mechanical failure. This was the first time a B-2 had crashed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7260231.stm US stealth bomber crashes on Guam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225223734/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7260231.stm |date=25 February 2008 }}, BBC News.

[[File:B-52 over Guam.jpg|thumb|A B-52 Stratofortress and other planes flying over Guam in 2009]]

B-2s and B-52 aircraft from the [[13th Bomb Squadron]] and [[393d Bomb Squadron]] have taken turns in order to provide a continuous bomber presence at the base. One four-month deployment involving four B-2s began in March 2009.<ref>Dumat-ol Daleno, Gaynor, \"Stealth Bombers to Deploy to Guam\", ''[[Pacific Daily News]]'', 27 February 2009.</ref>

In March 2009, the base announced that it would investigate allegations made by a whistleblower of environmental violations within the [[Guam National Wildlife Refuge#Military overlay units|protected area]] of the base.  The allegations included poaching, illegal trapping of coconut crabs and resale of trophy deer, paving beaches, and stripping vegetation used for nesting by endangered hawksbill turtles and green sea turtles. [[Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility|Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER)]] said, \"The Air Force program for protecting Guam's natural resources has utterly broken down.\"<ref>''[[Pacific Daily News]]'', \"Andersen To Review Alleged Environmental Violations\", 7 March 2009.</ref> The Department of Defense Inspector General (DOD IG) determined that the Air Force responses to the PEER allegations adequately addressed the issues raised.  Consequently, DoD IG determined further investigation was not warranted.

The strategic importance of Andersen AFB was brought to the forefront on Tuesday, 12 February 2013 when the base was circled by two Russian [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tupolev Tu-95 Bear-H bombers]] hours prior to [[President Obama]]'s [[State of the Union]] Address. Their flight was monitored by US [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15 fighter jets]].

The host unit at Andersen AFB is the '''[[36th Wing]] (36 WG)''', assigned to the [[Pacific Air Forces]] [[Eleventh Air Force]].  As a non-flying wing, the 36 WG's mission is to provide support to deployed air and space forces of USAF, foreign air forces to Andersen, and tenant units assigned to the base.

Andersen AFB was established in 1944 as '''North Field''' and is named for [[Brigadier General]] [[James Roy Andersen]] (1904–1945).  The 36th Wing Commander is Brig. Gen. Gentry W. Boswell.  The Vice Wing Commander is Colonel Matthew J.

Due to Guam's almost unrestricted airspace and the close proximity of the [[Farallon de Medinilla|Farallon de Medinilla Island]], a naval bombing range {{convert|184|mi|km}} north, the base is in an ideal training location.

==History==
Andersen Air Force Base was established on 3 December 1944 and is named for Brigadier General James Roy Andersen (1904–1945).  General Andersen graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1926, served at various army installations, and obtained his wings at [[Kelly AFB|Kelly Field]], Texas, in 1936. During 1943–1944 he served on the War Department General Staff. In January 1945, General Andersen was assigned to HQ AAF, Pacific Ocean Area. He died on 26 February 1945 in the crash of a [[B-24 Liberator]] aircraft between [[Kwajalein]] and [[Johnston Island]] while en route to [[Hawaii]].

===World War II===
Andersen Air Force Base's origins begin on 7 December 1941 when Guam was attacked by the armed forces of [[Imperial Japan]] in the [[Battle of Guam (1941)]] three hours after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The United States Navy surrendered Guam to the Japanese on 10 December. At the height of the war, approximately 19,000 Japanese soldiers and sailors were deployed to the island. Guam was liberated by the [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine Corps']] 3rd Amphibious Corps on 21 July 1944, in the [[Battle of Guam (1944)]], after a 13-day pre-invasion bombardment.

The Japanese managed to contain the Marines on two beachheads, but their counter-attack failed. The Marines renewed their assault, and reached the northern tip of the island on 10 August 1944.  Japanese guerrilla activities continued until the end of the war, and some were [[Japanese holdout|holdouts]] for many years afterwards.

Guam was considered ideal to establish air bases to launch [[B-29 Superfortress]] operations against the [[Japanese Archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]]. The [[Marianas Islands]] are about {{convert|1500|mi|km}} from Tokyo, a range which the B-29s could just about manage. Most important of all, it could be put on a direct supply line from the United States by ship.  \"North Field,\" as Andersen AFB was first named, was the first air base built in Guam after its liberation. Its construction began in November 1944 and was supported by the [[United States Navy]] [[Seabee]]s.  North Field and its co-located [[Northwest Field (Guam)|Northwest Field]] was a massive installation, with four main runways, taxiways, revetments for over 200 B-29s, and a large containment area for base operations and personnel.

The first host unit at North Field was the [[314th Air Division|314th Bombardment Wing]], [[XXI Bomber Command]], [[Twentieth Air Force]].  The 314th arrived in Guam on 16 January 1945 from Peterson Field, Colorado.  The 314th controlled four operational B-29 bomb groups, the [[19th Air Refueling Wing|19th]], (Square M), [[29th Bombardment Group|29th]] (Square O), [[39th Air Expeditionary Wing|39th]] (Square P), and [[330th Bombardment Group (VH)|330th]] (Square K).

B-29 Superfortress missions from North Field were attacks against strategic targets in Japan, operating in daylight and at a high altitude to bomb factories, refineries, and other objectives. In March 1945, the XXI Bomber Command changed tactics and started carrying out low-level night incendiary raids on area targets.  During the Allied assault on [[Okinawa]], groups of the 314th Bomb Wing attacked airfields from which the Japanese were sending out [[kamikaze|suicide planes]] against the invasion force.

Flying out of Guam, [[Henry E. Erwin|S/Sgt Henry E Erwin]] of the 29th Bombardment Group was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for action that saved his B-29 during a mission over [[Koriyama]], Japan, on 12 April 1945. When a phosphorus smoke bomb exploded in the launching chute and shot back into the plane, Sgt Erwin picked up the burning bomb, carried it to a window, and threw it out.

After the war, B-29s from North Field dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners and participated in several show-of-force missions over Japan.  The 29th, 39th and 330th Bomb Groups returned to the United States and deactivated in December 1945. The 19th remained in Guam to become the station's host unit after the 314th Bomb Wing was reassigned to [[Johnson AB]], Japan for occupation duty.

===Postwar years===
[[File:Aerial view of Andersen AFB.jpg|thumb|alt=Aerial view|Northwest Field at Andersen Air Force Base]]
After the end of [[World War II]], [[Guam]] served as a collection point for surplus war goods that had accumulated in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]].

The [[19th Bombardment Wing]] (BW) was formed at North AFB in 1948 from the resources of the former North Guam Air Force Base Command (Provisional). The 19th BW operated [[Andersen AFB]] and continued utilizing B-29s. In May 1949, the headquarters of the [[Twentieth Air Force]] moved from Guam to [[Kadena AB]], [[Okinawa]]. Its former staff was assigned to the 19th BW.

At Andersen, the wing assumed responsibility for supervising two active bases and one semi-active base, an assortment of communication, weather, radar, rescue and other facilities and units, including the [[Marianas Air Material Area]], a wing size unit.<ref>Ravenstein, Charles A. ''Air Force Combat Wings Lineage and Honors Histories 1947–1977''. [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], [[Alabama]]: Office of Air Force History 1984. {{ISBN|0-912799-12-9}}.</ref> Many of the units and facilities were deactivated within a few months.

In October 1949, the 19th Wing was transferred to the 20th Air Force's command. The remaining units in the Marianas and Bonin Islands were shifted to other organizations.  From 17 October 1949 until 28 June 1950, the wing continued B-29 training, operation of Andersen Air Force Base, and rescue and reconnaissance missions.

===1950s===
Three days after [[North Korea]] invaded [[South Korea]] in 1950, the 19th Bomb Group deployed [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] to Andersen to begin bombing targets throughout [[South Korea]]. A few days later, the group was detached from the 19th BW and deployed to [[Kadena Air Base]] on [[Okinawa Island]], Japan. The rest of the wing remained at Andersen, provided maintenance for transient aircraft, and operated ammunition dumps until 1953.

In 1951, the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) selected several overseas bases to support rotational unit deployments of its bombers from stateside bases, starting with [[B-29 Superfortress]] units and later including [[Convair B-36]], [[B-47 Stratojet]], [[B-50 Superfortress]] bombers, and [[Boeing KB-29|KB-29]] refueling tankers.

With decreased hostility in [[Korea]], the 19th BW headquarters was relocated to [[Kadena Air Base]], Japan in 1953 and was replaced by the 6319th Air Base Wing of the [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Forces (FEAF)]].

However, the [[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF Bomber Command]] ([[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF's]] 19th Bomb Wing and [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] 98th and 307th Bomb Wings) was deactivated in 1954. Its three B-29 wings returned to the contiguous United States and were replaced with [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47s]].

The 3rd Air Division was activated on 18 June in its place. Its objective was to control all SAC units in the Far East. The division operated as a tenant unit from June 1954 until April 1955 and received host-base support services from the 6319th until that unit was inactivated on 1 April 1955. The 6319th was replaced with the SAC-aligned 3960th Air Base Wing.

The [[Strategic Air Command]] continued its 90-day unit rotational training program and began to take control of the base from the [[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF]]. After the 1 April 1955 base transfer and activation of the 3960th Air Base Wing, [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47s]] replaced the [[Convair B-36|B-36s]] in the rotations. The 43rd Bomb Wing from [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], operated from July to October 1957, which eventually became Andersen's host unit. The 3960th Air Base Wing was redesignated on 1 July 1956 as the 3960th Air Base Group.

The [[41st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] of the [[United States Pacific Air Forces|Pacific Air Forces]], along with its [[F-86 Sabre|F-86s]], was stationed at Andersen from August 1956 until it was deactivated in March 1960. After that, the air defense mission was provided by deployments of [[Fifth Air Force|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Air Force]] units flying the [[F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]] aircraft.<ref name=\"global\">{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/andersen.htm |title=Andersen AFB |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=25 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708195013/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/andersen.htm |archivedate=8 July 2014  }}</ref>

===Vietnam===
Andersen's rotational duties concluded when the [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47]] was phased out and replaced by the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. The first [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]], the \"City of El Paso,\" arrived from the 95th Bomb Wing at [[Biggs Army Airfield|Biggs Air Force Base]], Texas in March 1964. It was followed by [[KC-135 Stratotanker]]s.

With the start of [[Operation Arc Light]] in June 1965, [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52Fs]] and [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135As]] began regular bombing missions over [[Vietnam]] and continued until 1973, with a break between August 1970 and early 1972.

The [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|3960th Strategic Wing]], which was originally activated in 1955 as the 3960th Air Base Wing, continued as the base's host wing until it was deactivated and replaced by the [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|43rd Strategic Wing]] on 1 April 1970. The 43rd assumed the mission of the 4133rd on 1 July 1970 and continued in this capacity until the 57th Air Division (Provisional) and [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|72nd Strategic Wing (Provisional)]] were activated in June 1972 in support of '''Operation Bullet Shot'''<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>). The 303rd Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Wing (Provisional) was activated in July of the same year. All of the provisional units remained at Andersen until bombing missions ceased on 15 November 1973.

[[File:Andersen AFB with 150 B-52s 1972.jpg|thumb|About 150 B-52s at Andersen AFB, fall 1972]]
[[Operation Linebacker II]] continued the mission of [[Operation Arc Light]], and was most notable for its 11-day bombing campaign between 18 and 29 December 1972, in which more than 150 [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers flew 729 [[sortie]]s in 11 days. The [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] at Andersen, combined with other bombers stationed at [[U-Tapao International Airport|U-Tapao Field]] in Thailand, constituted about 50 percent of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] total bomber force and 75 percent of all combat crews. Two bases contained the equivalent of 13 stateside bomber wings.

The frequent bombings resulted in a cease-fire in [[Vietnam]]. However, the [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] continued to fly missions over [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] until those were halted on 15 August 1973. With the end of these runs, more than 100 [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]], both D and G Models, were deployed elsewhere in the world by October 1973. The [[Eighth Air Force]] moved to [[Barksdale Air Force Base]], [[Louisiana]], and the 3rd Air Division was reactivated on 1 January 1975.

When the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]] forces overran [[South Vietnam]] later in 1975, the base provided emergency relief and shelter for thousands of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] evacuees as a part of ''[[Operation New Life]]''. After the fall of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], Andersen received almost 40,000 refugees and processed another 109,000 for transportation to the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacaf.af.mil/Info/FactSheets/Display/tabid/420/Article/909895/andersen-air-force-base.aspx|title=Andersen Air Force Base|website=Pacific Air Forces|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>

The base returned to routine operations by the late 1970s, but continued to serve as one of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] strategic locations. Crews and aircraft were regularly sent to sites between Australia, [[Alaska]], and [[Korea]] and supported sea surveillance operations support for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].

Andersen was also home to the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron \"Typhoon Chasers\" during the 1960s through the 1980s. Air crews flying [[WC-130]]s tracked and penetrated typhoons, providing advanced warnings to military and civilian populations throughout the western Pacific. During the Vietnam War, the 54th also provided cloud-seeding capability along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and synoptic reconnaissance, deploying from [[Udorn RTAFB]] when not in Guam. The 54th WRS was inactivated in September 1987.

===Post-Vietnam===
In 1983, the 43rd completed its transition from the [[B-52 Stratofortress#B-52D|B-52D]] to the [[B-52 Stratofortress#B-52G|B-52G]] and became one of only two [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] bomber wings equipped with the [[Boeing Harpoon|Harpoon anti-ship missile]].

The base saw a major change in 1989, when control transferred from the [[Strategic Air Command]] to [[Pacific Air Forces]]. The 633rd Air Base Wing activated on 1 October 1989, which led to the deactivations of the 43rd Bomb Wing on 26 March 1990 and the 60th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 30 April 1990.

In August 1990, Andersen personnel began shipping over 37,000 tons of munitions to forces in the [[Persian Gulf]] in support of [[Gulf War|Operations Desert Shield]] and [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/trump-s-plan-pay-border-wall-air-force-funds-risks-n1054091|title=Trump's plan to pay for border wall with Air Force funds risks national security, report says|last=Kube|first=Courtney|work=NBC News|language=en|url-status=live|date=13 September 2019}}</ref>

With the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991, Andersen was instrumental in caring for American evacuees and their pets as a part of [[Operation Fiery Vigil]]. In December, Andersen became home to the [[Thirteenth Air Force]], which had evacuated from [[Clark Air Base]] in the [[Philippines]] after the eruption.

=== Post Cold War ===

The host unit was changed on 1 October 1994, when the 633rd Air Base Wing was deactivated. The 36th Air Base Wing took over host operations and was redesignated as the [[36th Wing]] on 12 April 2006. In October 1994, the U.S. Navy's Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Five (HC-5) relocated to Andersen from the now-closed [[Naval Air Station Agana]], Guam.  HC-5 was later redesignated as Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Twenty-Five ([[HSC-25]]) following its transition from the [[CH-46]] to the [[MH-60S]].

The base was one of the [[Space Shuttle#Landing sites|few places in the world]] where the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]] was permitted to land, serving as an Augmented Emergency Landing Site for the Shuttle orbiter.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |title=Space Shuttle Emergency Landing Sites |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=20 July 2011|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331115426/http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |archivedate=31 March 2016  }}</ref>

In 2007, the 50-year-old South Runway's condition had deteriorated to a point at which complete removal and replacement of the runway was necessary to maintain safety. The 50.6 million-dollar runway replacement was a Design-Build project from the [[Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency]] to the Tutor-Perini Corporation and its local subsidiary, Black Construction Company.<ref name=\":0\" /> The project's scope included demolition and reconstruction of the existing 11,185 feet by 200 feet South Runway, repairs and tie-ins to existing taxiway intersections, removal and replacement of degraded airfield lighting, and arresting gear realignment and reconstruction.

On 23 February 2008, a USAF [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber, one of the most expensive military aircraft in the world, [[Andersen Air Force Base B-2 accident|crashed on the base]].  Both pilots ejected safely before the plane, valued at {{formatprice|1400000000}} U.S. dollars, crashed moments after take-off due to a mechanical failure. This was the first time a B-2 had crashed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7260231.stm US stealth bomber crashes on Guam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225223734/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7260231.stm |date=25 February 2008 }}, BBC News.

On 21 July 2008, a US [[B-52 Stratofortress]] [[2008 Guam B-52 crash|crashed into the sea]] while on a training mission that was to fly over a parade in Guam commemorating the [[Battle of Guam (1944)|U.S. liberation of the island from Japanese occupation in 1944]].

[[File:B-52 over Guam.jpg|thumb|A B-52 Stratofortress and other planes flying over Guam in 2009]]

B-2s and B-52 aircraft from the [[13th Bomb Squadron]] and [[393d Bomb Squadron]] have taken turns in order to provide a continuous bomber presence at the base. One four-month deployment involving four B-2s began in March 2009.<ref>Dumat-ol Daleno, Gaynor, \"Stealth Bombers to Deploy to Guam\", ''[[Pacific Daily News]]'', 27 February 2009.</ref>

In March 2009, the base announced that it would investigate allegations made by a whistleblower of environmental violations within the [[Guam National Wildlife Refuge#Military overlay units|protected area]] of the base.  The allegations included poaching, illegal trapping of coconut crabs and resale of trophy deer, paving beaches, and stripping vegetation used for nesting by endangered hawksbill turtles and green sea turtles. [[Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility|Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER)]] said, \"The Air Force program for protecting Guam's natural resources has utterly broken down.\"<ref>''[[Pacific Daily News]]'', \"Andersen To Review Alleged Environmental Violations\", 7 March 2009.</ref> The Department of Defense Inspector General (DOD IG) determined that the Air Force responses to the PEER allegations adequately addressed the issues raised.  Consequently, DoD IG determined further investigation was not warranted.

The strategic importance of Andersen AFB was brought to the forefront on Tuesday, 12 February 2013 when the base was circled by two Russian [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tupolev Tu-95 Bear-H bombers]] hours prior to [[President Obama]]'s [[State of the Union]] Address. Their flight was monitored by US [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15 fighter jets]]. The Russian bombers later left the area in a northbound direction.<ref>Gertz, Bill {{cite web |url=http://freebeacon.com/bear-bombers-over-guam/ |title=Bear Bombers over Guam |accessdate=20 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218033738/http://freebeacon.com/bear-bombers-over-guam/ |archivedate=18 February 2013  |date=15 February 2013 }}''The Washington Free Beacon'', retrieved 15 February 2013 \"Bear Bombers over Guam\"</ref>

Higher educational opportunities are available for those in the military, Department of Defense employees, and family members at Andersen through contracted academic institutions such as The Asian Division of [[University of Maryland University College]] (UMUC)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asia.umuc.edu |title=University of Maryland University College Asia - UMUC Asia |publisher=Asia.umuc.edu |accessdate=25 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227232531/http://www.asia.umuc.edu/ |archivedate=27 February 2014  }}</ref> and The Pacific Far East Division of [[Central Texas College]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pfec.ctcd.edu |title=Pacific Far East - Central Texas College |publisher=Pfec.ctcd.edu |date=18 July 2013|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302123807/http://pfec.ctcd.edu/ |archivedate=2 March 2014  }}</ref>

===Andersen Middle School===
Andersen Middle School caters to a population of 6th to 8th graders from [[United States|American]] military families.  The school is within the [[Department of Defense Education Activity]] school system and the subsystem [[DDESS]] Guam. It has a 5-year accreditation obtained from the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]].  In September 1997, DoDEA opened its own schools for children of military personnel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=12381|title=Guam School to Be Renamed in Honor of NASA Astronaut William McCool}}</ref>

====Sports====
Andersen Middle School's sports include volleyball, cross country, softball, soccer, and basketball.

====History====
Andersen Middle School was founded in 1997 and was scattered across Andersen Air Force Base.  Classes for the original school were held in former Air Force dormitories. Many rooms had walls knocked out in order to accommodate class sizes. The original library for the elementary school was shared with the base library for its first year.  As of 2012, it is now permanently located in an air conditioned building.

====Classes====
Andersen Middle School adopted the [[block scheduling]] system. The required core classes are [[physical education]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[social studies]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], and [[language arts]]. The elective classes include [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Marching band|band]], [[study skills]], [[video production]], [[culture]] and [[drama]]. The school offers both a [[special education]] program and opportunities to take high school courses, such as [[algebra]] and [[geometry]].

The '''Compromise of 1850''' was a package of five separate bills passed by the [[United States Congress]] in September 1850 that defused a political confrontation between [[slave and free states]] on the status of [[Mexican Cession|territories acquired]] in the [[Mexican–American War]]. It also set [[Texas]]'s western and northern borders and included provisions addressing [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] and the slave trade. The compromise was brokered by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] senator [[Henry Clay]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senator [[Stephen Douglas]] with the support of President [[Millard Fillmore]].

A debate over slavery in the territories had erupted during the Mexican–American War, as many Southerners sought to expand slavery to the newly-acquired lands and many Northerners opposed any such expansion. The debate was further complicated by Texas's claim to all former Mexican territory north and east of the [[Rio Grande]], including areas it had never effectively controlled. These issues prevented the passage of [[organic act]]s to create organized territorial governments for the land acquired in the Mexican–American War. In early 1850, [[Henry Clay|Clay]] proposed a package of bills that would settle most of the pressing issues before Congress. Clay's proposal was opposed by President [[Zachary Taylor]], anti-slavery Whigs like [[William Seward]], and pro-slavery Democrats like [[John C. Calhoun]], and congressional debate over the territories continued.

After Taylor died and was succeeded by Fillmore, Douglas took the lead in passing Clay's compromise through Congress as five separate bills. Under the compromise, Texas surrendered its claims to present-day [[New Mexico]] and other states in return for federal assumption of Texas's public debt. [[California]] was admitted as a free state, while the remaining portions of the Mexican Cession were organized into [[New Mexico Territory]] and [[Utah Territory]]. Under the concept of [[popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]], the people of each territory would decide whether or not slavery would be permitted. The compromise also included a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]] and banned the slave trade in [[Washington, D.C.]] The issue of slavery in the territories would be re-opened by the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], but many historians argue that the Compromise of 1850 played a major role in postponing the [[American Civil War]].

The [[Republic of Texas]] gained independence from Mexico following the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836, and, partly because Texas had been settled by a large number of Americans, there was a strong sentiment in both Texas and the United States for the annexation of Texas by the United States.<ref name=Merry120124>Merry, pg. 120–124</ref> In December 1845, President [[James K. Polk]] signed a resolution annexing Texas, and Texas became the 28th state in the union.<ref>Merry, pp. 211–212</ref> Polk sought further expansion through the acquisition of the Mexican province of [[Alta California]], which represented new lands to settle as well as a potential gateway to trade in [[Asia]].<ref>Howe, pp. 735–736</ref> His administration attempted to purchase California from Mexico,<ref>Howe, p. 734</ref> but the annexation of Texas stoked tensions between Mexico and the United States.<ref>Merry, pp. 176–177</ref> Relations between the two countries were further complicated by Texas's claim to all land north of the Rio Grande; Mexico argued that the more northern [[Nueces River]] was the proper Texan border.<ref name=Merry187>Merry, pg. 187</ref>

==Issues==
Three major types of issues were addressed by the Compromise of 1850: a variety of boundary issues, the status of territory issues, and the issue of slavery. While capable of analytical distinction, the boundary and territory issues were included in the overarching issue of slavery. Pro-slavery and anti-slavery interests were each concerned with both the amount of land on which slavery was permitted and with the number of States in the slave or free camps. Since Texas was a slave state, not only the residents of that state but also both camps on a national scale had an interest in the size of Texas.

===Texas===
[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Proposals for Texas's northwestern boundary]]

The independent [[Republic of Texas]] won the decisive [[Battle of San Jacinto]] (April 21, 1836) against Mexico and captured Mexican president [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]]. He signed the [[Treaties of Velasco]], which recognized the [[Rio Grande]] as the boundary of the Republic of Texas. The treaties were then repudiated by the government of Mexico, which insisted that Mexico remained sovereign over Texas since Santa Anna had signed the treaty under coercion, and promised to reclaim the lost territories. To the extent that there was a ''de facto'' recognition, Mexico treated the [[Nueces River]] as its northern boundary control. A vast, largely-unsettled area was between the two rivers. Neither Mexico nor the Republic of Texas had the military strength to assert its territorial claim. On December 29, 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States and became the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|28th state]]. Texas was staunchly committed to slavery, with its constitution making it illegal for the legislature to free slaves.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo made no mention of the claims of the Republic of Texas; Mexico simply agreed to a [[Mexico–United States border]] south of both the \"Mexican Cession\" and the Republic of Texas claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/nbc02|title=Handbook of Texas Online: Compromise of 1850|website=Tshaonline.org |accessdate=2016-02-03|date=June 12, 2010}}</ref> After the end of the Mexican–American War, Texas continued to claim a large stretch of disputed land that it had never effectively controlled in present-day eastern New Mexico. New Mexico had long prohibited slavery, a fact that affected the debate over its territorial status, but many New Mexican leaders opposed joining Texas primarily because Texas's capital lay hundreds of miles away{{sfn|Smith|pp=98, 101–102}} and because Texas and New Mexico had a history of conflict dating back to the 1841 [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition|Santa Fe Expedition]].{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=65–66}} Outside of Texas, many Southern leaders supported Texas's claims to New Mexico to secure as much territory as possible for the expansion of slavery.{{sfn|Bordewich|p=149}}

Another issue that would affect the compromise was Texas's debt; it had approximately $10 million in debt left over from its time as an independent nation, and that debt would become a factor in the debates over the territories.{{sfn|Smith|pp=110–111}}

===California===
[[File:Map of Mexico including Yucatan and Upper California 1847.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''Map of Mexico''. S. Augustus Mitchell, Philadelphia, 1847. New California is depicted with a northeastern border at the meridian leading north of the Rio Grande [[source (river or stream)|headwaters]].]]

California was part of the Mexican Cession. After the Mexican War, California was essentially run by military governors. President [[James K. Polk]] tried to get Congress to establish a territorial government in California officially, but the increasingly sectional debates prevented that.<ref>California and New Mexico: Message from the President of the United States. By United States. President (1849–1850 : Taylor), United States. War Dept (Ex. Doc 17 page 1) Google eBook</ref> The South wanted to extend slave territory to [[Southern California]] and to the Pacific Coast, but the North did not.

From late 1848, Americans and foreigners of many different countries rushed into California for the [[California Gold Rush]], exponentially increasing the population. In response to growing demand for a better more representative government, a [[Constitutional Convention (California)|Constitutional Convention]] was held in 1849. The delegates unanimously outlawed slavery. They had no interest in extending the Missouri Compromise Line through California and splitting the state; the lightly populated southern half never had slavery and was heavily Hispanic.<ref>William Henry Ellison. ''A self-governing dominion, California, 1849–1860'' (1950) [https://books.google.com/books?id=T8v4nWGB0T0C online]</ref>

===Other issues===
Aside from the disposition of the territories, other issues had risen to prominence during the Taylor years.{{sfn|Smith|pp=98–99}} The Washington, D.C. slave trade angered many in the North, who viewed the presence of slavery in the capital as a blemish on the nation. Disputes around fugitive slaves had grown since 1830 in part due to improving means of transportation, as escaped slaves used roads, railroads, and ships to escape. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]] had granted jurisdiction to all state and federal judges over cases regarding fugitive slaves, but several Northern states, dissatisfied by the lack of [[due process]] in these cases, had passed [[personal liberty laws]] that made it more difficult to return alleged fugitive slaves to the South.{{sfn|Finkelman|pp=58–62, 71}} Congress also faced the issue of [[Utah]], which like California and New Mexico, had been ceded by Mexico. Utah was inhabited largely by [[Mormons]], whose practice of [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]] was unpopular in the United States.{{sfn|Smith|pp=97–98}}

==Passage==
===Taylor takes office===
{{Events leading to US Civil War}}
{{Further|Presidency of Zachary Taylor}}

When Taylor took office, the issue of slavery in the Mexican Cession remained unresolved. While a Southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy.<ref>[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 101–102.</ref> In Taylor's view, the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the [[Gold Rush]] was well underway at the time of his inauguration, and California's population was exploding.<ref>Bauer, pp. 290–291.</ref> In October 1849, a California constitutional convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.<ref>Bauer, pp. 291–292.</ref> In his December 1849 [[State of the Union address|State of the Union report]], Taylor endorsed California's and New Mexico's applications for statehood, and recommended that Congress approve them as written and \"should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character\".<ref>Bauer, p. 298–299.</ref>

===Clay proposes compromise===

Rothermel]]):<br />[[Henry Clay]] takes the floor of the [[Old Senate Chamber]]; Vice President [[Millard Fillmore]] presides as [[John C. Calhoun]] (to the right of the Speaker's chair) and [[Daniel Webster]] (seated to the left of Clay) look on.]]

On January 29, 1850, Senator Henry Clay introduced a plan which combined the major subjects under discussion. His legislative package included the admission of California as a free state, the [[State cessions|cession]] by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of [[New mexican Territory|New Mexico]] and [[Utah Territory|Utah]] territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Smith|pp=111–112}} Clay had originally favored voting on each of his proposals separately, but Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] of Mississippi convinced him to combine the proposals regarding California's admission and the disposition of Texas's borders into one bill.{{sfn|Smith|pp=132–139}} Clay hoped that this combination of measures would convince congressmen from both North and South to support the overall package of laws even if they objected to specific provisions.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}} Clay's proposal attracted the support of some Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs, but it lacked the backing necessary to win passage, and debate over the bill continued.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}}

===Opposition===

President Trump opposed the compromise and continued to call for immediate statehood for both California and New Mexico.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}} Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] and some other Southern leaders argued that the compromise was biased against the South because it would lead to the creation of new free states.{{sfn|Smith|pp=112–113, 117}} Most Northern Whigs, led by [[William Henry Seward]], who delivered his famous \"Higher Law\" speech during the controversy, opposed the Compromise as well because it would apply the Wilmot Proviso to the western territories and because of the pressing of ordinary citizens into duty on slave-hunting patrols. That provision was inserted by Democratic Virginia Senator [[James M. Mason]] to entice border-state Whigs, who faced the greatest danger of losing slaves as fugitives but were lukewarm on general sectional issues related to the South on Texas's land claims.<ref>John M. Taylor, ''William Henry Seward: Lincoln's right hand'' (1996) p. 85</ref>

===Debate and results===
{{see also|Presidency of Millard Fillmore}}
[[File:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|upright=1.1|An animation showing [[slave and free states]] and territories, 1789–1861]]

On April 17, a \"Committee of Thirteen\" agreed on the border of Texas as part of Clay's plan. The dimensions were later changed. That same day, during debates on the measures in the Senate, Vice President Fillmore and Senator Benton verbally sparred, with Fillmore charging that the Missourian was \"out of order.\" During the heated debates, Compromise floor leader [[Henry S. Foote]] of [[Mississippi]] drew a pistol on Benton.

In early June, nine slaveholding Southern states sent delegates to the [[Nashville Convention]] to determine their course of action if the compromise passed. While some delegates preached [[secession]], the moderates ruled and proposed a series of compromises, including extending the dividing line designated by the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820 to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]].

Taylor died in July 1850, and was succeeded by Vice President Fillmore, who had privately come to support Clay's proposal.{{sfn|Smith|pp=158, 165–166}} The various bills were initially combined into one \"omnibus\" bill. Despite Clay's efforts, it failed in a crucial vote on July 31, opposed by southern Democrats and by northern Whigs. He announced on the Senate floor the next day that he intended to pass each part of the bill. The 73-year-old Clay, however, was physically exhausted as the effects of [[tuberculosis]], which would eventually kill him, began to take their toll. Clay left the Senate to recuperate in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], and Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took the lead in attempting to pass Clay's proposals through the Senate.<ref>Eaton (1957) pp. 192–193. Remini (1991) pp. 756–759</ref>

Fillmore, anxious to find a quick solution to the conflict in Texas over the border with New Mexico, which threatened to become an armed conflict between Texas militia and the federal soldiers, reversed the administration's position late in July and threw its support to the compromise measures.<ref>Michael Holt, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party'' (1999), pp. 529–530: \"only rapid passage of the omnibus bill appeared to offer a timely escape from the crisis.\"</ref> At the same time, Fillmore denied Texas's claims to New Mexico, asserting that the United States had promised to protect the territorial integrity of New Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.{{sfn|Smith|pp=181–184}} Fillmore's forceful response helped convince Texas's U.S. Senators, [[Sam Houston]] and [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]], to support Stephen Douglas's compromise. With their support, a Senate bill providing for a final settlement of Texas's borders won passage days after Fillmore delivered his message. Under the terms of the bill, the U.S. would assume Texas's debts, while Texas's northern border was set at the 36° 30' parallel north (the Missouri Compromise line) and much of its western border followed the 103rd meridian. The bill attracted the support of a bipartisan coalition of Whigs and Democrats from both sections, though most opposition to the bill came from the South.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=306–313}} The Senate quickly moved onto the other major issues, passing bills that provided for the admission of California, the organization of New Mexico Territory, and the establishment of a new fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=314–316, 329}}

The debate then moved to the House of Representatives, where Fillmore, Senator [[Daniel Webster]], Douglas, Congressman [[Linn Boyd]], and Speaker of the House [[Howell Cobb]] took the lead in convincing members to support the compromise bills that had been passed in the Senate.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=333–334}} The Senate's proposed settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary faced intense opposition from many Southerners, as well as from some Northerners who believed that Texas did not deserve monetary compensation. After a series of close votes that nearly delayed consideration of the issue, the House voted to approve a Texas bill similar to that which had been passed by the Senate.{{sfn|Smith|pp=186–188}} Following that vote, the House and the Senate quickly agreed on each of the major issues, including the banning of the slave trade in Washington.{{sfn|Smith|p=188–189}} The president quickly signed each bill into law save for the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]; he ultimately signed that law as well after Attorney General Crittenden assured him that the law was constitutional.{{sfn|Scarry|p=172}} Though some in Texas still favored sending a military expedition into New Mexico, in November 1850 the state legislature voted to accept the compromise.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=347–348, 359–360}}

==Provisions==
===Settlement of borders===
[[File:New Mexico Territory, 1852.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of [[New Mexico Territory]] in 1852]]
[[File:Utah Territory with Deseret Border, vector image - 2011.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Utah Territory is shown in blue and outlined in black. The boundaries of the provisional [[State of Deseret]] are shown with a dotted line.]]

The general solution that was adopted by the Compromise of 1850 was to transfer a considerable part of the territory claimed by Texas state to the federal government; to organize two new territories formally, the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah, which expressly would be allowed to locally determine whether they would become slave or free territories, to add another free state to the Union (California), to adopt a severe measure to recover slaves who had escaped to a free state or free territory (the Fugitive Slave Law); and to abolish the slave trade in the District of Columbia. A key provision of each of the laws respectively organizing the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah was that slavery would be decided by local option, called popular sovereignty. That was an important repudiation of the idea behind the failure to prohibit slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico.  However, the admission of California as a free state meant that southerners were giving up their goal of a coast-to-coast belt of slave states.<ref>Not all southerners gave up on the idea. After California's admission, there were several [[Partition_and_secession_in_California#Post-statehood|efforts to divide the state]].  At least one of these enjoyed significant support from southern members of Congress, but the Civil War prevented action on it.</ref>

Texas was allowed to keep the following portions of the disputed land: south of the [[32nd parallel north|32nd parallel]] and south of the [[36°30' parallel north]] and east of the [[103rd meridian west]]. The rest of the disputed land was transferred to the Federal Government. The United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 3) does not permit Congress unilaterally to reduce the territory of any state, so the first part of the Compromise of 1850 had to take the form of an offer to the Texas State Legislature, rather than a unilateral enactment. This ratified the bargain and, in due course, the transfer of a broad swath of land from the state of Texas to the federal government was accomplished. In return for giving up this land, the United States assumed the debts of Texas.

From the Mexican Cession, the New Mexico Territory received most of the present-day state of Arizona, most of the western part of the present-day state of New Mexico, and the southern tip of present-day Nevada (south of the [[37th parallel north|37th parallel]]). The territory also received most of present-day eastern New Mexico, a portion of present-day Colorado (east of the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]], west of the 103rd meridian, and south of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]); all of this land had been claimed by Texas.

From the Mexican Cession, the Utah Territory received present-day Utah, most of present-day Nevada (everything north of the 37th parallel), a major part of present-day Colorado (everything west of the crest of the Rocky Mountains), and a small part of present-day Wyoming. That included the newly founded colony at [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake]], of [[Brigham Young]]. The Utah Territory also received some land that had claimed by Texas; this land is now part of present-day Colorado that is east of the crest of the Rocky Mountains.

===Fugitive Slave Law===
One statute of the Compromise of 1850, enacted September 18, 1850, is informally known as the Fugitive Slave Law, or the Fugitive Slave Act. It bolstered the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]]. The new version of the Fugitive Slave Law required federal judicial officials in all states and federal territories, including in those states and territories in which slavery was prohibited, to assist with the return of escaped slaves to their masters actively in the states and territories permitting slavery. Any [[US Marshals Service|federal marshal]] or other official who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave was liable to a fine of $1000. Law enforcement everywhere in the US had a duty to arrest anyone suspected of being a [[fugitive slave]] on no more evidence than a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. Suspected slaves could neither ask for a jury trial nor testify on their own behalf. Also, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was to be subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1000 fine. Officers capturing a fugitive slave were entitled to a fee for their work.

In addition to federal officials, the ordinary citizens of free states could be summoned to join a posse and be required to assist in the capture, custody, and/or transportation of the alleged escaped slave.

The law was so rigorously pro-slavery as to prohibit the admission of the testimony of a person accused of being an escaped slave into evidence at the judicial hearing to determine the status of the accused escaped slave. Thus, if a freedman were claimed to be an escaped slave, they could not resist their return to slavery by truthfully telling their actual history.

The Fugitive Slave Act was essential to meet Southern demands. In terms of public opinion in the North, the critical provision was that ordinary citizens were required to aid slave catchers. Many northerners deeply resented that requirement to help slavery personally. Resentment towards the Act continued to heighten tensions between the North and South, which were inflamed further by abolitionists such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. Her book, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', stressed the horrors of recapturing escaped slaves and outraged Southerners.<ref>Larry Gara, \"The Fugitive Slave Law: A Double Paradox,\" ''Civil War History'', September 1964, vol. 10#3, pp. 229–240</ref>

===End of slave trade in District of Columbia===
A statute enacted as part of the compromise prohibited the slave trade but allowed slavery itself in the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>David L. Lewis, ''District of Columbia: A Bicentennial History'', (W.W. Norton, 1976), 54-56.</ref> Southerners in Congress were unanimous in opposing that provision, which was seen as a concession to the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], but they were outvoted.<ref>Damani Davis, \"Slavery and Emancipation in the Nation'S Capital,\" ''Prologue'', Spring 2010, vol. 42#1, pp. 52–59</ref>

==Implications==
{{see also|Presidency of Franklin Pierce|Origins of the American Civil War}}
[[File:Map of Free and Slave States.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of free and slave states {{circa|1856}}]]

Passage of the Compromise of 1850, as it became known, caused celebration in Washington and elsewhere, with crowds shouting, \"the Union is saved!\" Fillmore himself described the Compromise of 1850 as a \"final settlement\" of sectional issues, though the future of slavery in New Mexico and Utah remained unclear.{{sfn|McPherson|pp=75–76}} The admission of new states, or the organization of territories in the remaining unorganized portion of the Louisiana Purchase, could also potentially reopen the polarizing debate over slavery.{{sfn|McPherson|pp=121–123}}{{sfn|Smith|p=248}} Not all accepted the Compromise of 1850; a South Carolina newspaper wrote, \"the [[Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon is passed]] ... and the Southern States are now vassals in this Confederacy.\"{{sfn|Smith|pp=193–194}} Many Northerners, meanwhile, were displeased by the fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Smith|p=201}} The debate over slavery in the territories would be re-opened in 1854 through the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]].

Many historians argue that the Compromise played a major role in postponing the American Civil War for a decade, while the Northwest was growing more wealthy and more populous and was being brought into closer relations with the Northeast.<ref>Robert Remini,''The House: A History of the House of Representatives'' (2006) p. 147</ref> During that decade, the Whig Party had completely broken down, to be replaced with the new Republican Party dominant in the North and the Democrats in the South.<ref>Holt, Michael F. ''The Political Crisis of the 1850s'' (1978).</ref>

Others argue that the Compromise only made more obvious the pre-existing sectional divisions and laid the groundwork for future conflict. They view the Fugitive Slave Law as helping to polarize the US, as shown in the enormous reaction to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused feelings of bitterness in the North. Furthermore, the Compromise of 1850 led to a breakdown in the spirit of compromise in the United States in the antebellum period, directly before the Civil War. The Compromise exemplifies that spirit, but the deaths of influential senators who worked on the compromise, primarily Henry Clay and [[Daniel Webster]], contributed to the feeling of increasing disparity between the North and South.

The delay of hostilities for ten years allowed the free economy of the northern states to continue to industrialize. The southern states, largely based on slave labor and cash crop production, lacked the ability to industrialize heavily.<ref>Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, ''Fruits of Merchant Capital'' (1983).</ref> By 1860, the northern states had added many more miles of railroad, steel production, modern factories, and population to the advantages already possessed in 1850. The North was better able to supply, equip, and man its armed forces, which would prove decisive in the later stages of the war.

According to historian Mark Stegmaier, \"The Fugitive Slave Act, the abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia, the admission of California as a free state, and even the application of the formula of popular sovereignty to the territories were all less important than the least remembered component of the Compromise of 1850—the statute by which Texas relinquished its claims to much of New Mexico in return for federal assumption of the debts.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDp6AAAAMAAJ|author=Mark J.

==Other proposals==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}

Proposals in 1846 to 1850 on the division of the Southwest included the following (some of which are not mutually exclusive):
* The '''[[Wilmot Proviso]]''' banning slavery in any new territory to be acquired from Mexico, not including Texas, which had been annexed the previous year. It passed the House in August 1846 and February 1847 but not the Senate. Later, an effort failed to attach the proviso to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].
* The '''Extension of the Missouri Compromise line''' was proposed by failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by [[William W. Wick]] and then Stephen Douglas to extend the Missouri Compromise line ([[36°30' parallel north]]) west to the Pacific (south of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]]) to allow the possibility of slavery in most of present-day New Mexico and Arizona, and Southern California. That line was again proposed by the [[Nashville Convention]] of June 1850.
* '''[[Popular sovereignty]]''', developed by [[Lewis Cass]] and Stephen Douglas as the position of the Democratic Party, was to let each territory decide for itself whether to allow slavery.
* [[William L. Yancey]]'s '''\"Alabama Platform\"''', endorsed by the Alabama and the Georgia legislatures and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia, called for no restrictions on slavery in the territories by the federal government or territorial governments before statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty, and federal legislation to overrule Mexican anti-slavery laws.
* '''Two free states''' were proposed by [[Zachary Taylor]], who served as President from March 1849 to July 1850. As President, he proposed that the entire area become two free states, called California and New Mexico but much larger than the ones today. None of the area would be left as an unorganized or [[organized territory]], which would avoid the question of slavery in the territories.
* '''Changing Texas's borders''' was proposed by Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in December 1849 or January 1850. Texas's western and northern boundaries would be the [[102nd meridian west]] and the [[34th parallel north]].
* '''Two southern states''' were proposed by Senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], with the assent of Texas, in February 1850. New Mexico would get all Texas land north of the 34th parallel north, including today's [[Texas Panhandle]], while the area to the south, including the southeastern part of today's New Mexico, would be divided at the [[Colorado River of Texas]] into two Southern states, balancing the admission of California and New Mexico as free states.<ref>{{Cite news|title=ADJUSTMENT OF THE TEXAS BOUNDARY IN 1850.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNQ1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185|journal=Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association|date=January 1904|volume=7|author=W. J. Spillman}}</ref>
* The '''first draft of the compromise of 1850''' had Texas's northwestern boundary be a straight, diagonal line from the Rio Grande 20 miles north of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] to the [[Red River of the South|Red River (Mississippi watershed)]] at the [[100th meridian west]], the southwestern corner of today's [[Oklahoma]].

The '''Compromise of 1850''' was a package of five separate bills passed by the [[United States Congress]] in September 1850 that defused a political confrontation between [[slave and free states]] on the status of [[Mexican Cession|territories acquired]] in the [[Mexican–American War]]. It also set [[Texas]]'s western and northern borders and included provisions addressing [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] and the slave trade. The compromise was brokered by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] senator [[Henry Clay]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senator [[Stephen Douglas]] with the support of President [[Millard Fillmore]].

A debate over slavery in the territories had erupted during the Mexican–American War, as many Southerners sought to expand slavery to the newly-acquired lands and many Northerners opposed any such expansion. The debate was further complicated by Texas's claim to all former Mexican territory north and east of the [[Rio Grande]], including areas it had never effectively controlled. These issues prevented the passage of [[organic act]]s to create organized territorial governments for the land acquired in the Mexican–American War. In early 1850, [[Henry Clay|Clay]] proposed a package of bills that would settle most of the pressing issues before Congress. Clay's proposal was opposed by President [[Zachary Taylor]], anti-slavery Whigs like [[William Seward]], and pro-slavery Democrats like [[John C. Calhoun]], and congressional debate over the territories continued.

After Taylor died and was succeeded by Fillmore, Douglas took the lead in passing Clay's compromise through Congress as five separate bills. Under the compromise, Texas surrendered its claims to present-day [[New Mexico]] and other states in return for federal assumption of Texas's public debt. [[California]] was admitted as a free state, while the remaining portions of the Mexican Cession were organized into [[New Mexico Territory]] and [[Utah Territory]]. Under the concept of [[popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]], the people of each territory would decide whether or not slavery would be permitted. The compromise also included a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]] and banned the slave trade in [[Washington, D.C.]] The issue of slavery in the territories would be re-opened by the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], but many historians argue that the Compromise of 1850 played a major role in postponing the [[American Civil War]].

The [[Republic of Texas]] gained independence from Mexico following the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836, and, partly because Texas had been settled by a large number of Americans, there was a strong sentiment in both Texas and the United States for the annexation of Texas by the United States.<ref name=Merry120124>Merry, pg. 120–124</ref> In December 1845, President [[James K. Polk]] signed a resolution annexing Texas, and Texas became the 28th state in the union.<ref>Merry, pp. 211–212</ref> Polk sought further expansion through the acquisition of the Mexican province of [[Alta California]], which represented new lands to settle as well as a potential gateway to trade in [[Asia]].<ref>Howe, pp. 735–736</ref> His administration attempted to purchase California from Mexico,<ref>Howe, p. 734</ref> but the annexation of Texas stoked tensions between Mexico and the United States.<ref>Merry, pp. 176–177</ref> Relations between the two countries were further complicated by Texas's claim to all land north of the Rio Grande; Mexico argued that the more northern [[Nueces River]] was the proper Texan border.<ref name=Merry187>Merry, pg. 187</ref>

==Issues==
Three major types of issues were addressed by the Compromise of 1850: a variety of boundary issues, the status of territory issues, and the issue of slavery. While capable of analytical distinction, the boundary and territory issues were included in the overarching issue of slavery. Pro-slavery and anti-slavery interests were each concerned with both the amount of land on which slavery was permitted and with the number of States in the slave or free camps. Since Texas was a slave state, not only the residents of that state but also both camps on a national scale had an interest in the size of Texas.

===Texas===
[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Proposals for Texas's northwestern boundary]]

The independent [[Republic of Texas]] won the decisive [[Battle of San Jacinto]] (April 21, 1836) against Mexico and captured Mexican president [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]]. He signed the [[Treaties of Velasco]], which recognized the [[Rio Grande]] as the boundary of the Republic of Texas. The treaties were then repudiated by the government of Mexico, which insisted that Mexico remained sovereign over Texas since Santa Anna had signed the treaty under coercion, and promised to reclaim the lost territories. To the extent that there was a ''de facto'' recognition, Mexico treated the [[Nueces River]] as its northern boundary control. A vast, largely-unsettled area was between the two rivers. Neither Mexico nor the Republic of Texas had the military strength to assert its territorial claim. On December 29, 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States and became the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|28th state]]. Texas was staunchly committed to slavery, with its constitution making it illegal for the legislature to free slaves.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo made no mention of the claims of the Republic of Texas; Mexico simply agreed to a [[Mexico–United States border]] south of both the \"Mexican Cession\" and the Republic of Texas claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/nbc02|title=Handbook of Texas Online: Compromise of 1850|website=Tshaonline.org |accessdate=2016-02-03|date=June 12, 2010}}</ref> After the end of the Mexican–American War, Texas continued to claim a large stretch of disputed land that it had never effectively controlled in present-day eastern New Mexico. New Mexico had long prohibited slavery, a fact that affected the debate over its territorial status, but many New Mexican leaders opposed joining Texas primarily because Texas's capital lay hundreds of miles away{{sfn|Smith|pp=98, 101–102}} and because Texas and New Mexico had a history of conflict dating back to the 1841 [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition|Santa Fe Expedition]].{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=65–66}} Outside of Texas, many Southern leaders supported Texas's claims to New Mexico to secure as much territory as possible for the expansion of slavery.{{sfn|Bordewich|p=149}}

Another issue that would affect the compromise was Texas's debt; it had approximately $10 million in debt left over from its time as an independent nation, and that debt would become a factor in the debates over the territories.{{sfn|Smith|pp=110–111}}

===California===
[[File:Map of Mexico including Yucatan and Upper California 1847.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''Map of Mexico''. S. Augustus Mitchell, Philadelphia, 1847. New California is depicted with a northeastern border at the meridian leading north of the Rio Grande [[source (river or stream)|headwaters]].]]

California was part of the Mexican Cession. After the Mexican War, California was essentially run by military governors. President [[James K. Polk]] tried to get Congress to establish a territorial government in California officially, but the increasingly sectional debates prevented that.<ref>California and New Mexico: Message from the President of the United States. By United States. President (1849–1850 : Taylor), United States. War Dept (Ex. Doc 17 page 1) Google eBook</ref> The South wanted to extend slave territory to [[Southern California]] and to the Pacific Coast, but the North did not.

From late 1848, Americans and foreigners of many different countries rushed into California for the [[California Gold Rush]], exponentially increasing the population. In response to growing demand for a better more representative government, a [[Constitutional Convention (California)|Constitutional Convention]] was held in 1849. The delegates unanimously outlawed slavery. They had no interest in extending the Missouri Compromise Line through California and splitting the state; the lightly populated southern half never had slavery and was heavily Hispanic.<ref>William Henry Ellison. ''A self-governing dominion, California, 1849–1860'' (1950) [https://books.google.com/books?id=T8v4nWGB0T0C online]</ref>

===Other issues===
Aside from the disposition of the territories, other issues had risen to prominence during the Taylor years.{{sfn|Smith|pp=98–99}} The Washington, D.C. slave trade angered many in the North, who viewed the presence of slavery in the capital as a blemish on the nation. Disputes around fugitive slaves had grown since 1830 in part due to improving means of transportation, as escaped slaves used roads, railroads, and ships to escape. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]] had granted jurisdiction to all state and federal judges over cases regarding fugitive slaves, but several Northern states, dissatisfied by the lack of [[due process]] in these cases, had passed [[personal liberty laws]] that made it more difficult to return alleged fugitive slaves to the South.{{sfn|Finkelman|pp=58–62, 71}} Congress also faced the issue of [[Utah]], which like California and New Mexico, had been ceded by Mexico. Utah was inhabited largely by [[Mormons]], whose practice of [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]] was unpopular in the United States.{{sfn|Smith|pp=97–98}}

==Passage==
===Taylor takes office===
{{Events leading to US Civil War}}
{{Further|Presidency of Zachary Taylor}}

When Taylor took office, the issue of slavery in the Mexican Cession remained unresolved. While a Southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy.<ref>[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 101–102.</ref> In Taylor's view, the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the [[Gold Rush]] was well underway at the time of his inauguration, and California's population was exploding.<ref>Bauer, pp. 290–291.</ref> In October 1849, a California constitutional convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.<ref>Bauer, pp. 291–292.</ref> In his December 1849 [[State of the Union address|State of the Union report]], Taylor endorsed California's and New Mexico's applications for statehood, and recommended that Congress approve them as written and \"should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character\".<ref>Bauer, p. 298–299.</ref>

===Clay proposes compromise===

Rothermel]]):<br />[[Henry Clay]] takes the floor of the [[Old Senate Chamber]]; Vice President [[Millard Fillmore]] presides as [[John C. Calhoun]] (to the right of the Speaker's chair) and [[Daniel Webster]] (seated to the left of Clay) look on.]]

On January 29, 1850, Senator Henry Clay introduced a plan which combined the major subjects under discussion. His legislative package included the admission of California as a free state, the [[State cessions|cession]] by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of [[New mexican Territory|New Mexico]] and [[Utah Territory|Utah]] territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Smith|pp=111–112}} Clay had originally favored voting on each of his proposals separately, but Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] of Mississippi convinced him to combine the proposals regarding California's admission and the disposition of Texas's borders into one bill.{{sfn|Smith|pp=132–139}} Clay hoped that this combination of measures would convince congressmen from both North and South to support the overall package of laws even if they objected to specific provisions.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}} Clay's proposal attracted the support of some Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs, but it lacked the backing necessary to win passage, and debate over the bill continued.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}}

===Opposition===

President Taylor opposed the compromise and continued to call for immediate statehood for both California and New Mexico.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}} Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] and some other Southern leaders argued that the compromise was biased against the South because it would lead to the creation of new free states.{{sfn|Smith|pp=112–113, 117}} Most Northern Whigs, led by [[William Henry Seward]], who delivered his famous \"Higher Law\" speech during the controversy, opposed the Compromise as well because it would apply the Wilmot Proviso to the western territories and because of the pressing of ordinary citizens into duty on slave-hunting patrols. That provision was inserted by Democratic Virginia Senator [[James M. Mason]] to entice border-state Whigs, who faced the greatest danger of losing slaves as fugitives but were lukewarm on general sectional issues related to the South on Texas's land claims.<ref>John M. Taylor, ''William Henry Seward: Lincoln's right hand'' (1996) p. 85</ref>

===Debate and results===
{{see also|Presidency of Millard Fillmore}}
[[File:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|upright=1.1|An animation showing [[slave and free states]] and territories, 1789–1861]]

On April 17, a \"Committee of Thirteen\" agreed on the border of Texas as part of Clay's plan. The dimensions were later changed. That same day, during debates on the measures in the Senate, Vice President Fillmore and Senator Benton verbally sparred, with Fillmore charging that the Missourian was \"out of order.\" During the heated debates, Compromise floor leader [[Henry S. Foote]] of [[Mississippi]] drew a pistol on Benton.

In early June, nine slaveholding Southern states sent delegates to the [[Nashville Convention]] to determine their course of action if the compromise passed. While some delegates preached [[secession]], the moderates ruled and proposed a series of compromises, including extending the dividing line designated by the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820 to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]].

Taylor died in July 1850, and was succeeded by Vice President Fillmore, who had privately come to support Clay's proposal.{{sfn|Smith|pp=158, 165–166}} The various bills were initially combined into one \"omnibus\" bill. Despite Clay's efforts, it failed in a crucial vote on July 31, opposed by southern Democrats and by northern Whigs. He announced on the Senate floor the next day that he intended to pass each part of the bill. The 73-year-old Clay, however, was physically exhausted as the effects of [[tuberculosis]], which would eventually kill him, began to take their toll. Clay left the Senate to recuperate in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], and Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took the lead in attempting to pass Clay's proposals through the Senate.<ref>Eaton (1957) pp. 192–193. Remini (1991) pp. 756–759</ref>

Fillmore, anxious to find a quick solution to the conflict in Texas over the border with New Mexico, which threatened to become an armed conflict between Texas militia and the federal soldiers, reversed the administration's position late in July and threw its support to the compromise measures.<ref>Michael Holt, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party'' (1999), pp. 529–530: \"only rapid passage of the omnibus bill appeared to offer a timely escape from the crisis.\"</ref> At the same time, Fillmore denied Texas's claims to New Mexico, asserting that the United States had promised to protect the territorial integrity of New Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.{{sfn|Smith|pp=181–184}} Fillmore's forceful response helped convince Texas's U.S. Senators, [[Sam Houston]] and [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]], to support Stephen Douglas's compromise. With their support, a Senate bill providing for a final settlement of Texas's borders won passage days after Fillmore delivered his message. Under the terms of the bill, the U.S. would assume Texas's debts, while Texas's northern border was set at the 36° 30' parallel north (the Missouri Compromise line) and much of its western border followed the 103rd meridian. The bill attracted the support of a bipartisan coalition of Whigs and Democrats from both sections, though most opposition to the bill came from the South.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=306–313}} The Senate quickly moved onto the other major issues, passing bills that provided for the admission of California, the organization of New Mexico Territory, and the establishment of a new fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=314–316, 329}}

The debate then moved to the House of Representatives, where Fillmore, Senator [[Daniel Webster]], Douglas, Congressman [[Linn Boyd]], and Speaker of the House [[Howell Cobb]] took the lead in convincing members to support the compromise bills that had been passed in the Senate.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=333–334}} The Senate's proposed settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary faced intense opposition from many Southerners, as well as from some Northerners who believed that Texas did not deserve monetary compensation. After a series of close votes that nearly delayed consideration of the issue, the House voted to approve a Texas bill similar to that which had been passed by the Senate.{{sfn|Smith|pp=186–188}} Following that vote, the House and the Senate quickly agreed on each of the major issues, including the banning of the slave trade in Washington.{{sfn|Smith|p=188–189}} The president quickly signed each bill into law save for the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]; he ultimately signed that law as well after Attorney General Crittenden assured him that the law was constitutional.{{sfn|Scarry|p=172}} Though some in Texas still favored sending a military expedition into New Mexico, in November 1850 the state legislature voted to accept the compromise.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=347–348, 359–360}}

==Provisions==
===Settlement of borders===
[[File:New Mexico Territory, 1852.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of [[New Mexico Territory]] in 1852]]
[[File:Utah Territory with Deseret Border, vector image - 2011.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Utah Territory is shown in blue and outlined in black. The boundaries of the provisional [[State of Deseret]] are shown with a dotted line.]]

The general solution that was adopted by the Compromise of 1850 was to transfer a considerable part of the territory claimed by Texas state to the federal government; to organize two new territories formally, the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah, which expressly would be allowed to locally determine whether they would become slave or free territories, to add another free state to the Union (California), to adopt a severe measure to recover slaves who had escaped to a free state or free territory (the Fugitive Slave Law); and to abolish the slave trade in the District of Columbia. A key provision of each of the laws respectively organizing the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah was that slavery would be decided by local option, called popular sovereignty. That was an important repudiation of the idea behind the failure to prohibit slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico.  However, the admission of California as a free state meant that southerners were giving up their goal of a coast-to-coast belt of slave states.<ref>Not all southerners gave up on the idea. After California's admission, there were several [[Partition_and_secession_in_California#Post-statehood|efforts to divide the state]].  At least one of these enjoyed significant support from southern members of Congress, but the Civil War prevented action on it.</ref>

Texas was allowed to keep the following portions of the disputed land: south of the [[32nd parallel north|32nd parallel]] and south of the [[36°30' parallel north]] and east of the [[103rd meridian west]]. The rest of the disputed land was transferred to the Federal Government. The United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 3) does not permit Congress unilaterally to reduce the territory of any state, so the first part of the Compromise of 1850 had to take the form of an offer to the Texas State Legislature, rather than a unilateral enactment. This ratified the bargain and, in due course, the transfer of a broad swath of land from the state of Texas to the federal government was accomplished. In return for giving up this land, the United States assumed the debts of Texas.

From the Mexican Cession, the New Mexico Territory received most of the present-day state of Arizona, most of the western part of the present-day state of New Mexico, and the southern tip of present-day Nevada (south of the [[37th parallel north|37th parallel]]). The territory also received most of present-day eastern New Mexico, a portion of present-day Colorado (east of the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]], west of the 103rd meridian, and south of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]); all of this land had been claimed by Texas.

From the Mexican Cession, the Utah Territory received present-day Utah, most of present-day Nevada (everything north of the 37th parallel), a major part of present-day Colorado (everything west of the crest of the Rocky Mountains), and a small part of present-day Wyoming. That included the newly founded colony at [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake]], of [[Brigham Young]]. The Utah Territory also received some land that had claimed by Texas; this land is now part of present-day Colorado that is east of the crest of the Rocky Mountains.

===Fugitive Slave Law===
One statute of the Compromise of 1850, enacted September 18, 1850, is informally known as the Fugitive Slave Law, or the Fugitive Slave Act. It bolstered the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]]. The new version of the Fugitive Slave Law required federal judicial officials in all states and federal territories, including in those states and territories in which slavery was prohibited, to assist with the return of escaped slaves to their masters actively in the states and territories permitting slavery. Any [[US Marshals Service|federal marshal]] or other official who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave was liable to a fine of $1000. Law enforcement everywhere in the US had a duty to arrest anyone suspected of being a [[fugitive slave]] on no more evidence than a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. Suspected slaves could neither ask for a jury trial nor testify on their own behalf. Also, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was to be subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1000 fine. Officers capturing a fugitive slave were entitled to a fee for their work.

In addition to federal officials, the ordinary citizens of free states could be summoned to join a posse and be required to assist in the capture, custody, and/or transportation of the alleged escaped slave.

The law was so rigorously pro-slavery as to prohibit the admission of the testimony of a person accused of being an escaped slave into evidence at the judicial hearing to determine the status of the accused escaped slave. Thus, if a freedman were claimed to be an escaped slave, they could not resist their return to slavery by truthfully telling their actual history.

The Fugitive Slave Act was essential to meet Southern demands. In terms of public opinion in the North, the critical provision was that ordinary citizens were required to aid slave catchers. Many northerners deeply resented that requirement to help slavery personally. Resentment towards the Act continued to heighten tensions between the North and South, which were inflamed further by abolitionists such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. Her book, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', stressed the horrors of recapturing escaped slaves and outraged Southerners.<ref>Larry Gara, \"The Fugitive Slave Law: A Double Paradox,\" ''Civil War History'', September 1964, vol. 10#3, pp. 229–240</ref>

===End of slave trade in District of Columbia===
A statute enacted as part of the compromise prohibited the slave trade but allowed slavery itself in the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>David L. Lewis, ''District of Columbia: A Bicentennial History'', (W.W. Norton, 1976), 54-56.</ref> Southerners in Congress were unanimous in opposing that provision, which was seen as a concession to the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], but they were outvoted.<ref>Damani Davis, \"Slavery and Emancipation in the Nation'S Capital,\" ''Prologue'', Spring 2010, vol. 42#1, pp. 52–59</ref>

==Implications==

[[File:Map of Free and Slave States.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of free and slave states {{circa|1856}}]]

Passage of the Compromise of 1850, as it became known, caused celebration in Washington and elsewhere, with crowds shouting, \"the Union is saved!\" Fillmore himself described the Compromise of 1850 as a \"final settlement\" of sectional issues, though the future of slavery in New Mexico and Utah remained unclear.{{sfn|McPherson|pp=75–76}} The admission of new states, or the organization of territories in the remaining unorganized portion of the Louisiana Purchase, could also potentially reopen the polarizing debate over slavery.{{sfn|McPherson|pp=121–123}}{{sfn|Smith|p=248}} Not all accepted the Compromise of 1850; a South Carolina newspaper wrote, \"the [[Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon is passed]] ... and the Southern States are now vassals in this Confederacy.\"{{sfn|Smith|pp=193–194}} Many Northerners, meanwhile, were displeased by the fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Smith|p=201}} The debate over slavery in the territories would be re-opened in 1854 through the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]].

Many historians argue that the Compromise played a major role in postponing the American Civil War for a decade, while the Northwest was growing more wealthy and more populous and was being brought into closer relations with the Northeast.<ref>Robert Remini,''The House: A History of the House of Representatives'' (2006) p. 147</ref> During that decade, the Whig Party had completely broken down, to be replaced with the new Republican Party dominant in the North and the Democrats in the South.<ref>Holt, Michael F. ''The Political Crisis of the 1850s'' (1978).</ref>

Others argue that the Compromise only made more obvious the pre-existing sectional divisions and laid the groundwork for future conflict. They view the Fugitive Slave Law as helping to polarize the US, as shown in the enormous reaction to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused feelings of bitterness in the North. Furthermore, the Compromise of 1850 led to a breakdown in the spirit of compromise in the United States in the antebellum period, directly before the Civil War. The Compromise exemplifies that spirit, but the deaths of influential senators who worked on the compromise, primarily Henry Clay and [[Daniel Webster]], contributed to the feeling of increasing disparity between the North and South.

The delay of hostilities for ten years allowed the free economy of the northern states to continue to industrialize. The southern states, largely based on slave labor and cash crop production, lacked the ability to industrialize heavily.<ref>Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, ''Fruits of Merchant Capital'' (1983).</ref> By 1860, the northern states had added many more miles of railroad, steel production, modern factories, and population to the advantages already possessed in 1850. The North was better able to supply, equip, and man its armed forces, which would prove decisive in the later stages of the war.

According to historian Mark Stegmaier, \"The Fugitive Slave Act, the abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia, the admission of California as a free state, and even the application of the formula of popular sovereignty to the territories were all less important than the least remembered component of the Compromise of 1850—the statute by which Texas relinquished its claims to much of New Mexico in return for federal assumption of the debts.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDp6AAAAMAAJ|author=Mark J.

==Other proposals==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}

Proposals in 1846 to 1850 on the division of the Southwest included the following (some of which are not mutually exclusive):
* The '''[[Wilmot Proviso]]''' banning slavery in any new territory to be acquired from Mexico, not including Texas, which had been annexed the previous year. It passed the House in August 1846 and February 1847 but not the Senate. Later, an effort failed to attach the proviso to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].
* The '''Extension of the Missouri Compromise line''' was proposed by failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by [[William W. Wick]] and then Stephen Douglas to extend the Missouri Compromise line ([[36°30' parallel north]]) west to the Pacific (south of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]]) to allow the possibility of slavery in most of present-day New Mexico and Arizona, and Southern California. That line was again proposed by the [[Nashville Convention]] of June 1850.
* '''[[Popular sovereignty]]''', developed by [[Lewis Cass]] and Stephen Douglas as the position of the Democratic Party, was to let each territory decide for itself whether to allow slavery.
* [[William L. Yancey]]'s '''\"Alabama Platform\"''', endorsed by the Alabama and the Georgia legislatures and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia, called for no restrictions on slavery in the territories by the federal government or territorial governments before statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty, and federal legislation to overrule Mexican anti-slavery laws.
* '''Two free states''' were proposed by [[Zachary Taylor]], who served as President from March 1849 to July 1850. As President, he proposed that the entire area become two free states, called California and New Mexico but much larger than the ones today. None of the area would be left as an unorganized or [[organized territory]], which would avoid the question of slavery in the territories.
* '''Changing Texas's borders''' was proposed by Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in December 1849 or January 1850. Texas's western and northern boundaries would be the [[102nd meridian west]] and the [[34th parallel north]].
* '''Two southern states''' were proposed by Senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], with the assent of Texas, in February 1850. New Mexico would get all Texas land north of the 34th parallel north, including today's [[Texas Panhandle]], while the area to the south, including the southeastern part of today's New Mexico, would be divided at the [[Colorado River of Texas]] into two Southern states, balancing the admission of California and New Mexico as free states.<ref>{{Cite news|title=ADJUSTMENT OF THE TEXAS BOUNDARY IN 1850.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNQ1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185|journal=Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association|date=January 1904|volume=7|author=W. J. Spillman}}</ref>
* The '''first draft of the compromise of 1850''' had Texas's northwestern boundary be a straight, diagonal line from the Rio Grande 20 miles north of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] to the [[Red River of the South|Red River (Mississippi watershed)]] at the [[100th meridian west]], the southwestern corner of today's [[Oklahoma]].
