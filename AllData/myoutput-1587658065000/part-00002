Introduced for the 2015 model year, this generation of the F-Series is the first aluminum-intensive vehicle produced on a large scale by an American vehicle manufacturer.  For the 2017 model year, the fourth-generation Super Duty line adopted the cab design of the F-150, consolidating the cab design for the first time on Ford light-duty trucks (F-550 and below) for the first time since the 1996 model year; the Super Duty trucks still retain separate bodywork and a higher-GVWR frame.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, a second generation of the [[Ford Raptor]] made its return for 2017 as a high-performance variant of the F-150, dropping the SVT prefix). In Mexico, the F-Series XL trim is marketed as the ''F-150'', XLT and higher trims are named ''Lobo'' (Wolf in Spanish).<ref>https://www.ford.mx/camiones/f150/2019/</ref>  The Mexican-market [[Lincoln Mark LT]] was discontinued completely, replaced by the Limited and Platinum trims sold elsewhere.\n\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series is produced by Ford in [[Claycomo, Missouri]] ([[Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant|Kansas City Assembly]]) alongside the [[Ford Transit]] van and at [[Dearborn, Michigan]] ([[Ford River Rouge Complex|Dearborn Truck Plant]]).\n\n== Design overview ==\n[[File:Ford F-150 P552 Extended Cab.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|F-150 XLT SuperCab]]\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series was unveiled at the [[2014 North American International Auto Show]] on January 13, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/naias/index.ssf/2014/01/2015_ford_f-150_makes_world_de.html|title=2015 Ford F-150 makes world debut at Detroit auto show|website=mlive|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>  A number of safety technologies and driver assistance features were introduced as options, including: 360\u00b0 camera, [[Adaptive Cruise Control|adaptive cruise control]], [[Collision Warning with Brake Support|collision warning with brake support]], [[Blind Spot Information System|blind spot information system]] (BLIS) with [[Intersection assistant|cross-traffic alert]], and a [[Lane-Keeping System|lane-keeping system]].\n\nWhile not the first aluminum-bodied vehicle developed by Ford (the company developed 40 aluminum-bodied [[Mercury Sable#Special editions|Mercury Sable]] prototypes in 1993, reducing curb weight by 400 pounds<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140110/BLOG06/140119985/fords-work-with-aluminum-bodied-vehicles-goes-back-decades|title=Ford's work with aluminum-bodied vehicles goes back decades|last=Truett|first=Richard|website=Automotive News|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref>), the F-Series was the first Ford aluminum-bodied vehicle to make it to production.<ref name=\":1\" />  While changing the metal composition of the best-selling vehicle in the United States, 85% of the parts of the vehicle were domestically-sourced (as of 2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-10.aspx|title=The Most American-Made Cars #10|publisher=Bankrate.com|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-1.aspx|title=The Most American-Made Cars|work=[[Kogod School of Business]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820180255/http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-1.aspx|archivedate=20 August 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen the F-150 was equipped with the optional 2.7L EcoBoost V6 engine and two-wheel drive, it was able to comply with [[Corporate average fuel economy#Future standards|proposed future CAFE standards]] through 2024 without any modifications.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Winter|first=Drew|date=3 August 2016|title=Survey: CAFE Rules Likely to Get Tougher, Not Easier|url=https://www.wardsauto.com/industry/survey-cafe-rules-likely-get-tougher-not-easier|magazine=Ward's Auto|location=Southfield, Michigan|publisher=Informa USA|access-date=19 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Chassis ===\nWhile nearly all body panels of the F-150 were converted from steel to aluminum construction (the only significant sheetmetal component constructed of steel is the firewall<ref name=\"motortrend.com2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/trucks/1401_2015_ford_f_150_first_look/|title=2015 Ford F-150 First Look|last=Markus|first=Frank|date=2014-01-12|publisher=Motor Trend|accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sae.org/12724/|title=2015 F-150: Ford drops an aluminum blockbuster|work=SAE|publisher=SAE International|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>), the frame remained of steel construction, the use of high-strength steel in the frame was increased from 23% to 77%.<ref name=\"motortrend.com2\" />  To showcase the durability of the aluminum-intensive design, Ford entered prototypes of the model disguised as 12th generation F150s in the Baja 1000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-shows/2014-detroit-auto-show/2015-ford-f-150-baja-1000-prototype-ford-snuck-in|title=This is how Ford snuck a 2015 F-150 past everyone at the Baja 1000|website=Road and Track|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Powertrain ===\nThe F-Series underwent a revision of its powertrain offerings, largely to expand its range of both powerful and fuel-efficient engines.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web|url=http://www.torquenews.com/106/closer-look-new-base-v6-2015-ford-f150|title=A Closer Look at the New Base V6 of the 2015 Ford F150|website=Torque News|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>  As the entry-level V6, a 3.5&nbsp;L [[Ford Cyclone engine#Duratec 35|Ti-VCT]] V6 replaced the previous 3.7&nbsp;L V6;

unrelated to the larger EcoBoost engine, it is shared with the Ford Fusion and Lincoln Continental.\n\nFor model year 2017, the 3.5&nbsp;L EcoBoost engine underwent a redesign, increasing its output to 375&nbsp;hp (450&nbsp;hp for the Raptor); along with adding supplementary port fuel injection, the engine introduced auto start/stop capability.  For model year 2018, the model line received three all-new engines, as a 3.3&nbsp;L V6 replaced the naturally-aspirated 3.5&nbsp;L V6 and the 2.7&nbsp;L EcoBoost V6 was redesigned (adopting many of the changes from the 3.5&nbsp;L EcoBoost engine).  For the first time, a diesel engine was offered in the F-150, as a 250&nbsp;hp 3.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Power Stroke engine#3.0 Power Stroke|PowerStroke]] V6 was introduced during the model year, dependent on trim (commercial and fleet sales only, for XL and XLT trim).  For 2019, the 450&nbsp;hp version of the 3.5&nbsp;L engine was introduced to the flagship Limited trim.\n\nAs with the previous generation, the F-Series is offered solely with automatic transmissions.  At initial launch, a 6-speed [[Ford 6R transmission#6R80|Ford 6R80]] automatic was paired with all four engines.  As part of the introduction of the 2017 Raptor, a 10-speed [[Ford-GM 10-speed automatic transmission#10R80|Ford 10R80]] automatic (the first 10-speed transmission in a non-commercial vehicle) was paired to its 3.5&nbsp;L EcoBoost V6.

Three bed lengths are available (dependent on cab configuration): {{convert|5.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} (SuperCrew, all Raptors), {{convert|6.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} (all except Raptor), {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} (regular cab, SuperCab).\n\nThe 2015 F-150 marked several design departures from previous F-Series model lines.  While the cab design saw largely evolutionary styling changes, the rectangular grille adopted a trapezoidal shape, flanked by C-shaped headlamp units.  Using [[LED headlights]] for the first time, designers used [[polycarbonate]] [[thermoplastic]] optics to focus the beams, with one LED for each beam and an orange thermoplastic [[Light tube#In electronic devices|light pipe]] (doubling as the turn signal).<ref name=\"Miel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20140114/NEWS/140119968/fords-f-150-gets-new-look-thanks-to-plastics|title=Ford's F-150 gets new look thanks to plastics|author=Miel, Rhoda|date=January 14, 2014|work=Plastics News|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref>  Coupled with the headlamps, the taillamps adopted LED technology, also housing the [[blind spot monitor]]; these systems were not typically included on pickup trucks because the system could not be packaged inside steel bumpers typically found on pickup trucks.<ref name=\"Miel\"/>  The tailgate was redesigned; along with retaining its fold-out step functionality, the tailgate was redesigned, adopting several different styles (dependent on trim).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:'15-'17 Ford F-150 Regular Cab St. Basile Le Grand.jpg|F-150 XL regular cab\nFile:Ford F-150 Quartier Dix30.jpg|F-150 XL SuperCab \nFile:Ford 2015 F-150 Lariat (15734579807).jpg|2015 F-150 Lariat SuperCab \nFile:'15 Ford F-150 Platinum (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '15).jpg|2015 F-150 Platinum \nFile:2016 Ford F-150 Limited Super Crew 3.5L, front 6.29.19.jpg|2016 F-150 Limited SuperCrew\nFile:SLY 5618 (15833027941).jpg|2015-2017 F-150 tailgate \n</gallery>\n\n==== 2018 update ====\nFor 2018, the F-150 underwent a mid-cycle model revision, adopting several design features from the Super Duty model line.  The trapezoidal grille was replaced by an octagonal grille; the three-bar styling was replaced by a wide two-bar configuration (with a larger Ford Blue Oval emblem).  The tailgate saw minor changes, with an embossed \"F-150\" emblem replacing the previous stamped-metal logo; the taillamps saw a minor revision.  Several appearance packages were introduced for the XL, XLT, and Lariat trims.<ref name=\"Ford F-150\" />\n\nTo comply with 2018 [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]], all 2018 F-150 models received a standard rear-view backup camera.<ref name=\"Ford F-150\" />\n\nIn comparison to the exterior, the interior of the 2018 F-150 saw fewer visible changes, with most revisions focused on its [[In-Vehicle Infotainment|infotainment]] systems.

The premium audio system manufacturer shifted from Sony to [[Bang & Olufsen]], with [[SiriusXM|SiriusXM satellite radio]] becoming standard for the XLT trim.<ref name=\"Ford F-150\" />\n\nFor 2018, the top-line Limited trim received the powertrain of the Raptor, with a restyled dual exhaust for 2019; the Limited also gained a model-specific Camel Back interior color for 2019.<ref>https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/07/26/2019-f-150-limited-gains-high-output-ecoboost-v6.html</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ford F-150 Demix Extended Cab.jpg|F-150 XL SuperCab\nFile:Ford F-150 XLT 3.3 2019 (45621648615).jpg|F-150 XLT regular cab\nFile:2018 Ford F-150 XLT front 5.19.18.jpg|F-150 XLT SuperCab\nFile:2018 Ford F-150 XLT rear 5.19.18.jpg|F-150 XLT SuperCab rear, showing new tailgate\nFile:2018 Ford F-150 au salon internatiinal de l'auto de Montr\u00e9al 2018.jpg|2018 Ford F-150 King Ranch\nFile:2018 Ford F-150 Platinum au SIAM 2018.jpg|2018 F-150 Platinum \nFile:2018 Ford F-150 Limited au SIAM 2018.jpg|2018 F-150 Limited \n</gallery>\n\n==Trim==\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 225\n| image1 = 2018 Ford F-150 Lariat Crew Cab 3.5L EcoBoost front 4.22.19.jpg\n| image2 = 2018 Ford F-150 Lariat Crew Cab 3.5L EcoBoost rear 4.22.19.jpg\n| caption2 = 2018 F-150 Lariat SuperCrew FX4\n| total_width = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n}}\nFor the 2015 model year, the F-150 model line underwent several revisions, largely to consolidate the number of trim offerings.  Most visibly, the Raptor was withdrawn (put on hiatus until 2017 to complete its development), with the Tremor and Harley-Davidson special editions discontinued.  The STX, FX2, and FX4 were also discontinued as free-standing trim levels; in a revision, the features of the STX reappeared as a stand-alone option package for 2016, with the suspension features of the FX4 becoming an option package on all 4\u00d74 trims (except the Limited and Raptor).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cars.com/files/15_f150_appearanceguide-hc_sglepg_final_2-ret-.pdf|title=2015 F-150 APPEARANCE GUIDE|publisher=Cars.com|format=PDF|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series follows traditional Ford truck nomenclature with XL, XLT, and Lariat trims; along with the Super Duty line, the F-150 also has premium King Ranch, Platinum, and Limited trims (the Raptor is exclusive to the F-150).\n\n* XL (from 2015) \n* XLT (from 2015) \n* Lariat (from 2015)\n* King Ranch (from 2015) \n* Platinum (from 2015) \n* Limited (from 2016) \n* Raptor (from 2017)\n\n===F-150 Raptor===\n{{Main|Ford Raptor}}\n[[File:Ford F-150 Raptor 3.5T 2019.jpg|thumb|2019 Ford F-150 Raptor]]\nFollowing a two-year hiatus, the F-150 Raptor sub-model made its return for the 2017 model year, with the loss of its previous SVT prefix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/trucks/f150raptor/?fmccmp=lp-future-fut-hp-2017-raptor|title=2017 Ford F-150 Raptor - A Beast Off-Road & On - Ford.com|website=www.ford.com}}</ref> As with its predecessor, the 2017 Raptor is an off-road oriented vehicle produced in SuperCab and SuperCrew configurations with a model-exclusive 5.5-ft pickup bed. The model continues its lack of a Ford Blue Oval grille badge, with \"F-O-R-D\" spelled across the center of the grille.\n\nAs with a standard Ford F-150, the Raptor is an aluminum-intensive vehicle; though built upon a steel frame, nearly all its body panels are built using aluminum (reducing curb weight by nearly {{Convert|500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} over an equivalent 2014 SVT Raptor). In place of the {{Convert|411|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 6.2&nbsp;L V8, the new Raptor features a 3.5&nbsp;L twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 paired with an industry-first 10-speed automatic transmission. The new engine improves the horsepower by {{Convert|39|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|450|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and increases the torque from the old engine to {{Convert|510|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nTo improve its off-road ability over a standard F-150, the Raptor is fitted with a torque-on-demand transfer case, {{convert|13|in|cm|abbr=on}} travel front and {{convert|13.9|in|cm|abbr=on}} travel rear Fox Racing suspension, and all-terrain 35\" tires and wheels.\n\nFor 2019, the Raptor gets a new Trail Control system, optional Recaro sport bucket seats and [[Fox Racing Shox|FOX]] 3.0 Internal Bypass [[shock absorbers]] with Live Valve Technology.<ref>http://www.goseeoc.com/blog/how-has-the-ford-f-150-been-updated-for-2019/</ref>\n\n==Safety==\nThe 2019 F-150 truck has earned a five-star overall IIHS crash rating.\n\n==Recalls==\nOn October 18, 2017 Ford recalled 1.3 million 2015\u20132017 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty pickups due to door latches that can freeze in cold climates, causing the door to not open or close properly.<ref>https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/10/ford-issues-safety-recall-for-2015-17-f-150-and-2017-super-duty-.html</ref>\n\nOn September 6, 2018 Ford recalled approximately 2 million 2015\u20132018 Ford F-150 Regular Cab and SuperCrew models worldwide because front seatbelt pre-tensioners can generate excessive sparks and possibly cause a fire in the event of a collision.<ref>https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/09/06/ford-issues-safety-recall-in-north-america-for-select-2015-18-fo.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Ford F-150 (thirteenth generation)|Ford F-Series thirteenth generation}}\n* [http://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/2015/ Official Ford F-150 website]\n\n{{Ford vehicles}}\n{{Ford F-Series}}\n{{Modern North American Ford trucks}}\n\n[[Category:Ford F-Series|13th generation]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2014]]\n[[Category:2020s cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{main|Ford F-Series}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Thirteenth-generation Ford F-Series (P552)\n| image = 2018 Ford F-150 XLT front 5.19.18.jpg\n| caption = \n| manufacturer = [[Ford Motor Company]]\n| aka = [[Ford Lobo]] (Mexico)\n| production = November 11, 2014\u2013present<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20141111/OEM01/141119983/ford-to-begin-output-of-redesigned-2015-f-150-today |title=As Ford F-150 output starts, Fields says dealers will be fully stocked by Q2 |publisher=Autonews.com |date=2014-11-11 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref> (Dearborn)\n| model_years = 2015-present\n| assembly = {{plainlist |\n* [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]], United States ([[Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant|Kansas City Assembly]])\n* [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] ([[Ford Argentina]])\n* [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[Michigan]], United States ([[Dearborn Truck|Dearborn Truck Plant]])\n}}\n| designer = {{plainlist |\n* Gordon Platto (chief designer)\n* Brad Richards (lead exterior: 2011)<ref>{{cite web|last=Priddle |first=Alisa |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20140826/BUSINESS0102/308260181/2015-Ford-F-150-aerodynamic-mileage |title=Ford news &#124;

Introduced for the 2015 model year, this generation of the F-Series is the first aluminum-intensive vehicle produced on a large scale by an American vehicle manufacturer.  For the 2017 model year, the fourth-generation Super Duty line adopted the cab design of the F-150, consolidating the cab design for the first time on Ford light-duty trucks (F-550 and below) for the first time since the 1996 model year; the Super Duty trucks still retain separate bodywork and a higher-GVWR frame.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, a second generation of the [[Ford Raptor]] made its return for 2017 as a high-performance variant of the F-150, dropping the SVT prefix). In Mexico, the F-Series XL trim is marketed as the ''F-150'', XLT and higher trims are named ''Lobo'' (Wolf in Spanish).<ref>https://www.ford.mx/camiones/f150/2019/</ref>  The Mexican-market [[Lincoln Mark LT]] was discontinued completely, replaced by the Limited and Platinum trims sold elsewhere.\n\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series is produced by Ford in [[Claycomo, Missouri]] ([[Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant|Kansas City Assembly]]) alongside the [[Ford Transit]] van and at [[Dearborn, Michigan]] ([[Ford River Rouge Complex|Dearborn Truck Plant]]).\n\n== Design overview ==\n[[File:Ford F-150 P552 Extended Cab.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|F-150 XLT SuperCab]]\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series was unveiled at the [[2014 North American International Auto Show]] on January 13, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/naias/index.ssf/2014/01/2015_ford_f-150_makes_world_de.html|title=2015 Ford F-150 makes world debut at Detroit auto show|website=mlive|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>  A number of safety technologies and driver assistance features were introduced as options, including: 360\u00b0 camera, [[Adaptive Cruise Control|adaptive cruise control]], [[Collision Warning with Brake Support|collision warning with brake support]], [[Blind Spot Information System|blind spot information system]] (BLIS) with [[Intersection assistant|cross-traffic alert]], and a [[Lane-Keeping System|lane-keeping system]].\n\nWhile not the first aluminum-bodied vehicle developed by Ford (the company developed 40 aluminum-bodied [[Mercury Sable#Special editions|Mercury Sable]] prototypes in 1993, reducing curb weight by 400 pounds<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140110/BLOG06/140119985/fords-work-with-aluminum-bodied-vehicles-goes-back-decades|title=Ford's work with aluminum-bodied vehicles goes back decades|last=Truett|first=Richard|website=Automotive News|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref>), the F-Series was the first Ford aluminum-bodied vehicle to make it to production.<ref name=\":1\" />  While changing the metal composition of the best-selling vehicle in the United States, 85% of the parts of the vehicle were domestically-sourced (as of 2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-10.aspx|title=The Most American-Made Cars #10|publisher=Bankrate.com|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-1.aspx|title=The Most American-Made Cars|work=[[Kogod School of Business]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820180255/http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-1.aspx|archivedate=20 August 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen the F-150 was equipped with the optional 2.7L EcoBoost V6 engine and two-wheel drive, it was able to comply with [[Corporate average fuel economy#Future standards|proposed future CAFE standards]] through 2024 without any modifications.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Winter|first=Drew|date=3 August 2016|title=Survey: CAFE Rules Likely to Get Tougher, Not Easier|url=https://www.wardsauto.com/industry/survey-cafe-rules-likely-get-tougher-not-easier|magazine=Ward's Auto|location=Southfield, Michigan|publisher=Informa USA|access-date=19 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Chassis ===\nWhile nearly all body panels of the F-150 were converted from steel to aluminum construction (the only significant sheetmetal component constructed of steel is the firewall<ref name=\"motortrend.com2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/trucks/1401_2015_ford_f_150_first_look/|title=2015 Ford F-150 First Look|last=Markus|first=Frank|date=2014-01-12|publisher=Motor Trend|accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sae.org/12724/|title=2015 F-150: Ford drops an aluminum blockbuster|work=SAE|publisher=SAE International|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>), the frame remained of steel construction, the use of high-strength steel in the frame was increased from 23% to 77%.<ref name=\"motortrend.com2\" />  To showcase the durability of the aluminum-intensive design, Ford entered prototypes of the model disguised as 12th generation F150s in the Baja 1000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-shows/2014-detroit-auto-show/2015-ford-f-150-baja-1000-prototype-ford-snuck-in|title=This is how Ford snuck a 2015 F-150 past everyone at the Baja 1000|website=Road and Track|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Powertrain ===\nThe F-Series underwent a revision of its powertrain offerings, largely to expand its range of both powerful and fuel-efficient engines.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web|url=http://www.torquenews.com/106/closer-look-new-base-v6-2015-ford-f150|title=A Closer Look at the New Base V6 of the 2015 Ford F150|website=Torque News|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>  As the entry-level V6, a 3.5&nbsp;L [[Ford Cyclone engine#Duratec 35|Ti-VCT]] V6 replaced the previous 3.7&nbsp;L V6;

along with adding supplementary port fuel injection, the engine introduced auto start/stop capability.  For model year 2018, the model line received three all-new engines, as a 3.3&nbsp;L V6 replaced the naturally-aspirated 3.5&nbsp;L V6 and the 2.7&nbsp;L EcoBoost V6 was redesigned (adopting many of the changes from the 3.5&nbsp;L EcoBoost engine).  For the first time, a diesel engine was offered in the F-150, as a 250&nbsp;hp 3.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Power Stroke engine#3.0 Power Stroke|PowerStroke]] V6 was introduced during the model year, dependent on trim (commercial and fleet sales only, for XL and XLT trim).  For 2019, the 450&nbsp;hp version of the 3.5&nbsp;L engine was introduced to the flagship Limited trim.\n\nAs with the previous generation, the F-Series is offered solely with automatic transmissions.  At initial launch, a 6-speed [[Ford 6R transmission#6R80|Ford 6R80]] automatic was paired with all four engines.

Most visibly, the Raptor was withdrawn (put on hiatus until 2017 to complete its development), with the Tremor and Harley-Davidson special editions discontinued.  The STX, FX2, and FX4 were also discontinued as free-standing trim levels; in a revision, the features of the STX reappeared as a stand-alone option package for 2016, with the suspension features of the FX4 becoming an option package on all 4\u00d74 trims (except the Limited and Raptor).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cars.com/files/15_f150_appearanceguide-hc_sglepg_final_2-ret-.pdf|title=2015 F-150 APPEARANCE GUIDE|publisher=Cars.com|format=PDF|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series follows traditional Ford truck nomenclature with XL, XLT, and Lariat trims; along with the Super Duty line, the F-150 also has premium King Ranch, Platinum, and Limited trims (the Raptor is exclusive to the F-150).\n\n* XL (from 2015) \n* XLT (from 2015) \n* Lariat (from 2015)\n* King Ranch (from 2015) \n* Platinum (from 2015) \n* Limited (from 2016) \n* Raptor (from 2017)\n\n===F-150 Raptor===\n{{Main|Ford Raptor}}\n[[File:Ford F-150 Raptor 3.5T 2019.jpg|thumb|2019 Ford F-150 Raptor]]\nFollowing a two-year hiatus, the F-150 Raptor sub-model made its return for the 2017 model year, with the loss of its previous SVT prefix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/trucks/f150raptor/?fmccmp=lp-future-fut-hp-2017-raptor|title=2017 Ford F-150 Raptor - A Beast Off-Road & On - Ford.com|website=www.ford.com}}</ref> As with its predecessor, the 2017 Raptor is an off-road oriented vehicle produced in SuperCab and SuperCrew configurations with a model-exclusive 5.5-ft pickup bed. The model continues its lack of a Ford Blue Oval grille badge, with \"F-O-R-D\" spelled across the center of the grille.\n\nAs with a standard Ford F-150, the Raptor is an aluminum-intensive vehicle; though built upon a steel frame, nearly all its body panels are built using aluminum (reducing curb weight by nearly {{Convert|500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} over an equivalent 2014 SVT Raptor). In place of the {{Convert|411|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 6.2&nbsp;L V8, the new Raptor features a 3.5&nbsp;L twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 paired with an industry-first 10-speed automatic transmission. The new engine improves the horsepower by {{Convert|39|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|450|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and increases the torque from the old engine to {{Convert|510|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nTo improve its off-road ability over a standard F-150, the Raptor is fitted with a torque-on-demand transfer case, {{convert|13|in|cm|abbr=on}} travel front and {{convert|13.9|in|cm|abbr=on}} travel rear Fox Racing suspension, and all-terrain 35\" tires and wheels.\n\nFor 2019, the Raptor gets a new Trail Control system, optional Recaro sport bucket seats and [[Fox Racing Shox|FOX]] 3.0 Internal Bypass [[shock absorbers]] with Live Valve Technology.<ref>http://www.goseeoc.com/blog/how-has-the-ford-f-150-been-updated-for-2019/</ref>\n\n==Safety==\nThe 2019 F-150 truck has earned a five-star overall IIHS crash rating.\n\n==Recalls==\nOn October 18, 2017 Ford recalled 1.3 million 2015\u20132017 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty pickups due to door latches that can freeze in cold climates, causing the door to not open or close properly.<ref>https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/10/ford-issues-safety-recall-for-2015-17-f-150-and-2017-super-duty-.html</ref>\n\nOn September 6, 2018 Ford recalled approximately 2 million 2015\u20132018 Ford F-150 Regular Cab and SuperCrew models worldwide because front seatbelt pre-tensioners can generate excessive sparks and possibly cause a fire in the event of a collision.<ref>https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/09/06/ford-issues-safety-recall-in-north-america-for-select-2015-18-fo.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Ford F-150 (thirteenth generation)|Ford F-Series thirteenth generation}}\n* [http://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/2015/ Official Ford F-150 website]\n\n{{Ford vehicles}}\n{{Ford F-Series}}\n{{Modern North American Ford trucks}}\n\n[[Category:Ford F-Series|13th generation]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2014]]\n", "name_user": "TKOIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Removed redundant category as per WP:Subcat.
