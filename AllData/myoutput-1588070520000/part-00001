To the normal Sunday services are added special scriptural readings and hymns to all the saints (known and unknown) from the [[Pentecostarion]].\n\nIn the late spring, the Sunday following Pentecost Saturday (50 days after Easter) is set aside as a commemoration of all locally venerated saints, such as \"All Saints of America\", \"All Saints of [[Mount Athos]]\", etc. The third Sunday after Pentecost may be observed for even more localised saints, such as \"All Saints of [[St. Petersburg]]\", or for saints of a particular type, such as \"[[Persecution of Christians#Ottoman Empire and Turkey|New Martyrs of the Turkish Yoke]]\".\n\nIn addition to the Mondays mentioned above, Saturdays throughout the year are days for general commemoration of all saints, and special hymns to all saints are chanted from the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]].\n\n===Lebanon===\nThe celebration of 1 November in Lebanon as a holiday reflects the influence of Western Catholic orders present in Lebanon and is not [[Maronite]] in origin. The traditional Maronite feast equivalent to the honor of all saints in their liturgical calendar is one of three Sundays in preparation for Lent called the Sunday of the Righteous and the Just. The following Sunday is the Sunday of the Faithful Departed (similar to All Souls Day in Western calendar).\n\n===East Syriac tradition===\nIn East Syriac tradition the All Dads Day celebration falls on the first Friday after resurrection Sunday.<ref name=\"SMCLIT\" /> This is because all departed faithful are saved by the blood of Jesus and they resurrected with the Christ.

The [[Comes of W\u00fcrzburg]], the earliest existing ecclesiastical reading list, dating to the late 6th or early 7th century in what is today Germany, lists this the Sunday after Pentecost as \"dominica in natale sanctorum\" or \"Sunday of the Nativity of the Saints\". By this time, the commemoration had expanded to include all saints whether or not they were martyred.<ref name=\"new-catholic-2nd-all-saints\"/>\n\nOn 13 May 609 or 610, [[Pope Boniface IV]] consecrated the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon at Rome]] to the Blessed Virgin and all the martyrs, ordering an anniversary;<ref name=\"mershman\"/> the feast of the ''dedication Sanctae Mariae ad Martyres'' has been celebrated at Rome ever since. There is evidence that from the 5th to the 7th centuries there existed in certain places and at sporadic intervals a feast date on 13 May to celebrate the holy martyrs.<ref>C. Smith ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1967: ''s.v.'' \"Feast of All Saints\", p. 318.</ref> The origin of All Saints' Day cannot be traced with certainty, and it has been observed on various days in different places. However, there are some who maintain the belief that it has origins in the [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] observation of 13 May{{which calendar?|date=November 2019}}, the [[Lemuria (festival)|Feast of the Lemures]], in which the malevolent and restless spirits of the dead were propitiated. Some liturgiologists base the idea that this ''Lemuria'' festival was the origin of that of All Saints on their identical dates and on the similar theme of \"all the dead\".<ref>For example, Violet Alford (\"The Cat Saint\", ''Folklore'' '''52'''.3 [September 1941:161\u2013183] p. 181 note 56) observes that \"Saints were often confounded with the [[Lares]] or Dead. Repasts for both were prepared in early Christian times, and All Dad's Day was transferred in 835 to November 1st from one of the days in May which were the old Lemuralia\"; Alford notes [[Pierre Saintyves]], ''Les saints successeurs des dieux'', Paris 1906 (''sic'', i.e. 1907).</ref> Meanwhile, others consider that 13 May was perhaps deliberately chosen by the Pope because of its celebration already established in the East.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saunders|first1=William|title=All Saints and All Souls|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/all-saints-and-all-souls.html|website=catholiceducation.org|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe feast of All Saints, on its current date, is traced to the foundation by [[Pope Gregory III]] (731\u2013741) of an [[oratory (worship)|oratory]] in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] for the relics \"of the holy apostles and of all saints, martyrs and confessors, of all the just made perfect who are at rest throughout the world\",{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} with the date moved to {{OldStyleDateNY|October 27|November 1}} and 13 May feast suppressed.<ref>\"All Saints' Day\", ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', 3rd edition, ed.

James Frazer represents this school of thought by arguing that 1 November was chosen because Samhain was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead.<ref>Pseudo-Bede, ''Homiliae subdititiae''; John Hennig, 'The Meaning of All the Saints', ''Mediaeval Studies'' 10 (1948), 147\u201361.</ref><ref>\"All Saints Day\", ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', 3rd edition, ed.

In the [[Holidays in Sweden|Swedish calendar]], the observance takes place on the Saturday between 31 October and 6 November. In many Lutheran Churches, it is moved to the first Sunday of November. In the [[Church of England]], [[mother church]] of the [[Anglican Communion]], it is a [[Principal Feast]] and may be celebrated either on 1 November or on the Sunday between 30 October and 5 November. It is also celebrated by other [[Protestants]] of the English tradition, such as the [[United Church of Canada]], the [[Methodist]] churches and the [[Wesleyan Church]].\n\nProtestants generally commemorate all Christians, living and deceased, on All Dad's Day; if they observe All Dad's Day at all, they use it to remember all Christians both past and present. In the [[United Methodist Church]], All Saints' Day is celebrated on the first Sunday in November. It is held, not only to remember Saints, but also to remember all those who have died who were members of the local church congregation. In some congregations, a candle is lit by the [[Acolyte]] as each person's name is called out by the clergy. Prayers and responsive readings may accompany the event. Often, the names of those who have died in the past year are affixed to a memorial plaque.\n\nIn many Lutheran churches, All Dad's Day is celebrated the Sunday after Reformation is celebrated (the date for Reformation is 31 October, so Reformation Sunday is celebrated on or before 31 October). In most congregations, the festival is marked as an occasion to remember the dead. The names of those who have died from the congregation within the last year are read during worship and a bell is tolled, a chime is played or a candle is lit for each name read. While the dead are solemnly remembered during worship on All Saints' Sunday, the festival is ultimately a celebration of [[Atonement in Christianity|Christ's victory over death]].\n\nIn English-speaking countries, services often include the singing of the traditional hymn \"[[For All the Saints]]\" by [[Walsham How]]. The most familiar tune for this hymn is ''Sine Nomine'' by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. Other hymns that are popularly sung during corporate worship on this day are \"[[I Sing a Song of the Saints of God]]\" and \"[[Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones]]\".\n\n==Customs==\n[[File:Celebraci\u00f3n de Todos los Santos, cementerio de la Santa Cruz, Gniezno, Polonia, 2017-11-01, DD 07-09 HDR.jpg|thumb|250px|All Saints' Day at a cemetery in [[Gniezno]], Poland \u2013 flowers and candles placed to honor deceased relatives (2017)]]\n\n===Europe===\n\n====France====\nIn France, and throughout the [[Francophone]] world, the day is known as ''La Toussaint''.

Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead to clean and repair their tombs. Offerings of prayers, flowers, candles,<ref name=\"guardian-world-saints\">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/nov/01/all-saints-day \"All Saints Day around the world\", ''Guardian Weekly'', 1 November 2010]</ref> and food. [[Chinese Filipinos]] additionally burn [[joss stick|incense]] and ''[[joss paper|kim]]''. Many also spend the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the cemetery with feasts and merriment.\n\n====Pangangaluluwa trick-or-treat traditions====\nThough Halloween has usually been seen as an American influence in the Philippines, the country's trick-or-treat traditions during Undas (from the Spanish \"Honras\", meaning honours, as in \"with honors\") are actually much older. This tradition was derived from the pre-colonial tradition called pangangaluwa. Pangangaluluwa (from \"kaluluwa\" or spirit double) was a practice of early Filipinos who sang from house to house swathed in blankets pretending to be ghosts of ancestors. If the owner of the house failed to give biko or rice cakes to the \"nangangaluluwa\", the \"spirits\" would play tricks (try to steal slippers or other objects left outside the house by members of the family or run off with the owner's chickens). Pangangaluluwa practices are still seen in rural areas.\n\n====Cemetery and reunion practices====\nDuring Undas, family members visit the cemetery where the body of the loved ones rest. It is believed that by going to the cemetery and offering food, candles, flowers, and sometimes incense sticks, the spirit of the loved one is remembered and appeased. Contrary to common belief, this visitation practice is not an imported tradition. Prior to the establishment of coffins, pre-colonial Filipinos were already practicing such a tradition of visiting burial caves throughout the archipelago as confirmed by a research conducted by the [[University of the Philippines]]. The tradition of \"atang\" or \"hain\" is also practiced, where food and other offerings are placed near the grave site. If the family cannot go to the grave site, a specific area in the house is provided for the offering.\n\nThe exact date of Undas today, 1 November, is not a pre-colonial observance date but an influence from Mexico, where the same day is known as the Day of the Dead. Pre-colonial Filipinos preferred going to the burial caves of the departed occasionally as they believed that aswang (half-vampire half-werewolf beings) would take the corpse of the dead if the body was not properly guarded. The protection of the body of the loved one is called \"paglalamay\". However, in some communities, this paglalamay tradition is non-existent and is replaced by other pre-colonial traditions unique to each community.\n\nThe Undas is also seen as a family reunion, where family members coming from various regions go back to their hometown to visit the grave of loved ones. Family members are expected to remain beside the grave for the entire day and socialize with each other to mend bonds and enhance family relations. In some cases, family members going to certain burial sites exceed one hundred people. Fighting in any form is prohibited during Undas.\n\n====Roles of children====\nChildren have important roles during Undas. Children are allowed to play with melted candles in front of grave sites and turn the melted wax from the candles into round wax balls. The round balls of wax symbolize the affirmation that everything goes back to where it began, as the living will go back to ash, where everything started. In some cases, families also light candles at the front door of the home. The number of candles is equivalent to the number of departed loved ones. It is believed that this tradition aids departed loved ones and provide them with a happy path to the afterlife.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/386063/contemporary-undas-practices-derived-from-pre-colonial-influence-beliefs-cultural-anthropologist/story/</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/2013/10/31/1251413/undas-filipino-culture | title=Undas in Filipino culture | newspaper=The Philippine Star | date=31 October 2013 | first=Elfren S. | last=Cruz | accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.spot.ph/newsfeatures/the-latest-news-features/64114/10-things-pinoys-do-during-undas | title=10 Things Pinoys Do During Undas | date=29 October 2015 | first=Mimi | last=Miaco | publisher=Spot | accessdate=6 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}} \n* [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] which occurred on this day and had a great effect on society and philosophy\n* [[Portal:Catholicism/Patron Archive/November 1|All Saints' Day, patron saint archive]]\n* [[International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church]]\n* [[Dziady]]\n* [[Irish calendar]]\n* [[Litany of the Saints]]\n* [[Veneration of the dead]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=All Saints, Festival of |volume=1}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Langg\u00e4rtner, Georg. \"All Saints' Day\".

The [[Comes of W\u00fcrzburg]], the earliest existing ecclesiastical reading list, dating to the late 6th or early 7th century in what is today Germany, lists this the Sunday after Pentecost as \"dominica in natale sanctorum\" or \"Sunday of the Nativity of the Saints\". By this time, the commemoration had expanded to include all saints whether or not they were martyred.<ref name=\"new-catholic-2nd-all-saints\"/>\n\nOn 13 May 609 or 610, [[Pope Boniface IV]] consecrated the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon at Rome]] to the Blessed Virgin and all the martyrs, ordering an anniversary;<ref name=\"mershman\"/> the feast of the ''dedication Sanctae Mariae ad Martyres'' has been celebrated at Rome ever since.

Smith ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1967: ''s.v.'' \"Feast of All Saints\", p. 318.</ref> The origin of All Saints' Day cannot be traced with certainty, and it has been observed on various days in different places.

Some liturgiologists base the idea that this ''Lemuria'' festival was the origin of that of All Saints on their identical dates and on the similar theme of \"all the dead\".<ref>For example, Violet Alford (\"The Cat Saint\", ''Folklore'' '''52'''.3 [September 1941:161\u2013183] p. 181 note 56) observes that \"Saints were often confounded with the [[Lares]] or Dead.

In the [[Holidays in Sweden|Swedish calendar]], the observance takes place on the Saturday between 31 October and 6 November. In many Lutheran Churches, it is moved to the first Sunday of November. In the [[Church of England]], [[mother church]] of the [[Anglican Communion]], it is a [[Principal Feast]] and may be celebrated either on 1 November or on the Sunday between 30 October and 5 November. It is also celebrated by other [[Protestants]] of the English tradition, such as the [[United Church of Canada]], the [[Methodist]] churches and the [[Wesleyan Church]].\n\nProtestants generally commemorate all Christians, living and deceased, on All Saints' Day; if they observe All Saints Day at all, they use it to remember all Christians both past and present. In the [[United Methodist Church]], All Saints' Day is celebrated on the first Sunday in November. It is held, not only to remember Saints, but also to remember all those who have died who were members of the local church congregation. In some congregations, a candle is lit by the [[Acolyte]] as each person's name is called out by the clergy. Prayers and responsive readings may accompany the event. Often, the names of those who have died in the past year are affixed to a memorial plaque.\n\nIn many Lutheran churches, All Saints' Day is celebrated the Sunday after Reformation is celebrated (the date for Reformation is 31 October, so Reformation Sunday is celebrated on or before 31 October). In most congregations, the festival is marked as an occasion to remember the dead. The names of those who have died from the congregation within the last year are read during worship and a bell is tolled, a chime is played or a candle is lit for each name read. While the dead are solemnly remembered during worship on All Saints' Sunday, the festival is ultimately a celebration of [[Atonement in Christianity|Christ's victory over death]].\n\nIn English-speaking countries, services often include the singing of the traditional hymn \"[[For All the Saints]]\" by [[Walsham How]]. The most familiar tune for this hymn is ''Sine Nomine'' by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. Other hymns that are popularly sung during corporate worship on this day are \"[[I Sing a Song of the Saints of God]]\" and \"[[Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones]]\".\n\n==Customs==\n[[File:Celebraci\u00f3n de Todos los Santos, cementerio de la Santa Cruz, Gniezno, Polonia, 2017-11-01, DD 07-09 HDR.jpg|thumb|250px|All Saints' Day at a cemetery in [[Gniezno]], Poland \u2013 flowers and candles placed to honor deceased relatives (2017)]]\n\n===Europe===\n\n====France====\nIn France, and throughout the [[Francophone]] world, the day is known as ''La Toussaint''.

Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead to clean and repair their tombs. Offerings of prayers, flowers, candles,<ref name=\"guardian-world-saints\">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/nov/01/all-saints-day \"All Saints Day around the world\", ''Guardian Weekly'', 1 November 2010]</ref> and food. [[Chinese Filipinos]] additionally burn [[joss stick|incense]] and ''[[joss paper|kim]]''. Many also spend the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the cemetery with feasts and merriment.\n\n====Pangangaluluwa trick-or-treat traditions====\nThough Halloween has usually been seen as an American influence in the Philippines, the country's trick-or-treat traditions during Undas (from the Spanish \"Honras\", meaning honours, as in \"with honors\") are actually much older. This tradition was derived from the pre-colonial tradition called pangangaluwa. Pangangaluluwa (from \"kaluluwa\" or spirit double) was a practice of early Filipinos who sang from house to house swathed in blankets pretending to be ghosts of ancestors. If the owner of the house failed to give biko or rice cakes to the \"nangangaluluwa\", the \"spirits\" would play tricks (try to steal slippers or other objects left outside the house by members of the family or run off with the owner's chickens). Pangangaluluwa practices are still seen in rural areas.\n\n====Cemetery and reunion practices====\nDuring Undas, family members visit the cemetery where the body of the loved ones rest. It is believed that by going to the cemetery and offering food, candles, flowers, and sometimes incense sticks, the spirit of the loved one is remembered and appeased. Contrary to common belief, this visitation practice is not an imported tradition. Prior to the establishment of coffins, pre-colonial Filipinos were already practicing such a tradition of visiting burial caves throughout the archipelago as confirmed by a research conducted by the [[University of the Philippines]]. The tradition of \"atang\" or \"hain\" is also practiced, where food and other offerings are placed near the grave site. If the family cannot go to the grave site, a specific area in the house is provided for the offering.\n\nThe exact date of Undas today, 1 November, is not a pre-colonial observance date but an influence from Mexico, where the same day is known as the Day of the Dead. Pre-colonial Filipinos preferred going to the burial caves of the departed occasionally as they believed that aswang (half-vampire half-werewolf beings) would take the corpse of the dead if the body was not properly guarded. The protection of the body of the loved one is called \"paglalamay\". However, in some communities, this paglalamay tradition is non-existent and is replaced by other pre-colonial traditions unique to each community.\n\nThe Undas is also seen as a family reunion, where family members coming from various regions go back to their hometown to visit the grave of loved ones. Family members are expected to remain beside the grave for the entire day and socialize with each other to mend bonds and enhance family relations. In some cases, family members going to certain burial sites exceed one hundred people. Fighting in any form is prohibited during Undas.\n\n====Roles of children====\nChildren have important roles during Undas. Children are allowed to play with melted candles in front of grave sites and turn the melted wax from the candles into round wax balls. The round balls of wax symbolize the affirmation that everything goes back to where it began, as the living will go back to ash, where everything started. In some cases, families also light candles at the front door of the home. The number of candles is equivalent to the number of departed loved ones. It is believed that this tradition aids departed loved ones and provide them with a happy path to the afterlife.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/386063/contemporary-undas-practices-derived-from-pre-colonial-influence-beliefs-cultural-anthropologist/story/</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/2013/10/31/1251413/undas-filipino-culture | title=Undas in Filipino culture | newspaper=The Philippine Star | date=31 October 2013 | first=Elfren S. | last=Cruz | accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.spot.ph/newsfeatures/the-latest-news-features/64114/10-things-pinoys-do-during-undas | title=10 Things Pinoys Do During Undas | date=29 October 2015 | first=Mimi | last=Miaco | publisher=Spot | accessdate=6 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}} \n* [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] which occurred on this day and had a great effect on society and philosophy\n* [[Portal:Catholicism/Patron Archive/November 1|All Saints' Day, patron saint archive]]\n* [[International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church]]\n* [[Dziady]]\n* [[Irish calendar]]\n* [[Litany of the Saints]]\n* [[Veneration of the dead]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=All Saints, Festival of |volume=1}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Langg\u00e4rtner, Georg. \"All Saints' Day\".
