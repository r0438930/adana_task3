The line is around {{convert|8.5|mi|km|1}} long and runs westwards from the town of [[Welshpool]] ({{lang-cy|Y Trallwng}}) via [[Castle Caereinion]] to the village of [[Llanfair Caereinion]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early proposals===\nThe first proposal to connect Llanfair Caerinion and Welshpool by railway was the Llanfair Railway of 1864; this would have been a narrow gauge line, with a [[Dual gauge|mixed gauge]] section where it connected to the [[Cambrian Railways]]. This proposal was abandoned. The next attempt came in 1876 with the promotion of the Welshpool and Llanfair Railway Bill, which proposed a railway along a similar route to the 1864 effort. This Bill passed through the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. This attempt failed in 1882 because the promoters were unable to raise sufficient [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. In 1886, another Welshpool and Llanfair Railway Bill appeared for a {{RailGauge|3ft}} gauge railway on a similar route; this bill expired unused in 1892.<ref name=Johnson>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Johnson (railway historian)|title=An Illustrated History of the Great Western Narrow Gauge |publisher=Oxford Publishing Co |date=2011}}</ref>\n\n=== The Light Railways Act of 1896 ===\nIn 1896, the [[Light Railways Act 1896|Light Railways Act]] was passed, and this spurred further attempts at a railway to Llanfair Caereinion. The first of these was the Llanfair & Meifod Valley Light Railway bill of 1896, which proposed a [[standard-gauge railway|standard-gauge]] line from [[Arddleen]] about 8 miles north of Welshpool, through the Meifod Valley.<ref name=Johnson/>\n\nIn late December 1896, the mayor of Welshpool William Addie proposed a {{RailGauge|2ft6in}} gauge railway called the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. By March 1897, Addie had contracted with noted narrow gauge promoter [[Everard Calthrop]] to assist in preparing a case for the inquiry. An application for a Light Railway Order was submitted to the [[Board of Trade]] in May 1897. Calthrop proposed the use of [[transporter wagons]], 0-6-0 tank locomotives and a large \"[[Barsi Railway|Barsi]]-type\" locomotive for heavy market day traffic. At the August 1897 public inquiry Calthrop appeared, along with J.R. Dix manager of the [[Corris Railway]]. The enquiry considered by the Llanfair & Meifod Light Railway and the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway proposals. The commissioners took their time deciding. Meanwhile, the promoters of the W&LLR had approached the Cambrian Railways to have them pay for and construct the railway. After much time-consuming negotiations, the Cambrian agreed and on 8th. September 1899, the Light Railway Order was granted to begin construction of the line.<ref name=Johnson/>\n\n===Original operations===\n[[File:Welshpool to Llanfair Caereinion railway line (12989519473).jpg|thumb|left|Train in the streets of Welshpool (1950)]]\nIt was opened on 4 April 1903 to aid economic development in a remote area, never making a profit. It was originally operated by the Cambrian Railways, connecting with it at the former [[Oswestry and Newtown Railway]] station in the town of Welshpool. The line is built through difficult country, having a great number of curves in order to reach the summit of 600&nbsp;ft. The original terminus at Welshpool was located alongside the main line station and trains wound their way through the town, using the [[locomotive bell]] as a warning.\n\nIn the 1923 [[Railways Act 1921|Grouping]] of railway companies, Cambrian Railways, including the Welshpool to Llanfair Caereinion line, was absorbed by the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR). On 9 February 1931 the line lost its passenger service, which was replaced by a [[bus]] service, and it became a freight-only line. It was temporarily re-opened to passengers between 6 and 11 August 1945 for the [[Eisteddfod]]. The GWR itself was [[nationalisation|nationalised]] in 1948 and became part of [[British Railways]].\n\nFreight traffic lingered on until 1956, by which time [[British Railways]] decided to close the line, with services ceasing on 5 November.<ref>''Railway Magazine'' November 1956</ref>\n\n===Preservation===\n[[File:Welshpool Heritage.jpg|thumb|left|Gala Day: \"The Earl\" and \"The Countess\" at Llanfair Caerinion]]\n[[File:WLLR 2, coupling.jpg|thumb|upright=0.72|The Grondana [[Railway coupling|coupling]] now used on the railway, with a centre buffer and screw coupling link<ref name=fifteenflatout-20170221>{{cite web |url=https://fifteenflatout.wordpress.com/2017/02/21/workshop-week-part-2/ |title=Workshop Week - Part 2 |publisher=Fifteen Flatout |date=21 February 2017 |accessdate=22 July 2017}}</ref>]]\nA group of volunteers and enthusiasts took the line over and started raising money to restore it.
