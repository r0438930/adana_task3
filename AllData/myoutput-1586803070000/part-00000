range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study carried out at the [[University of Rochester]] in which [[American Sign Language]] native speakers were subject to [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax (relationship is determined by the word order) or inflection (relationship is determined by physical motion of \"moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body\").  Distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex (associated with ability to put information into sequences) being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes (associated with dividing information into its constituent parts) being more active in the inflection condition.  However, these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap.  These findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process, the brain may be using fairly basic, preexisting computational methods.<ref name=\"Newman2010\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman AJ, Supalla T, Hauser P, Newport EL, Bavelier D | title = Dissociating neural subsystems for grammar by contrasting word order and inflection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 107 | issue = 16 | pages = 7539\u201344 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20368422 | pmc = 2867749 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1003174107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.7539N }}</ref>\n\n==Clinical significance==\n[[File:Wernicke's area animation.gif|thumb|Human brain with Wernicke's area highlighted in red]]\n\n===Aphasia===\n\nWernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]] and [[psychiatrist]] who, in 1874, hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wernicke K. |chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875) |editor=Paul Eling |title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to) |publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co |location=Amsterdam |year=1995 |pages=69\u201389 |isbn=978-90-272-1893-3 |volume=4 }}</ref> He did this on the basis of the location of [[Acquired brain injury|brain injuries]] that caused [[aphasia]]. [[Receptive aphasia]] in which such abilities are preserved is also known as '''Wernicke's aphasia'''. In this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax]]. Language as a result is largely meaningless (a condition sometimes called ''fluent'' or ''[[jargon aphasia]]'').\n\nWernicke\u2019s area receives information from the auditory cortex, and functions to assign word meanings. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia?search=wernicke%27s%20aphasia&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1~4&usage_type=default&display_rank=1|title=Approach to the patient with aphasia|last=Glenn Clark|first=David|date=2018|website=Up To Date|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This is why damage to this area results in meaningless speech, often with paraphasic errors and newly created words or expressions.

Normal sentence structure and prosody are preserved, with normal intonation, inflection, rate ,and rhythm.<ref name=\":1\" /> This differs from Broca\u2019s aphasia, which is characterized by nonfluency. Patients are typically not aware that their speech is impaired in this way, as they have altered comprehension of their speech. Written language, reading, and repetition are affected as well. <ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDamage to the posterior temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere is the cause of Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. <ref name=\":1\" /> The etiology of this damage can vary greatly, with the most common cause being a cerebrovascular event such as an ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is the result of a thrombus occluding a blood vessel, restricting blood supply to a particular area of the brain. Other causes of focal damage potentially leading to Wernicke\u2019s aphasia include head trauma, infections affecting the central nervous system, neurodegenerative disease, and neoplasms. <ref name=\":1\" /> A cerebrovascular event is more likely the cause in an acute-onset presentation of aphasia, whereas a degenerative disease should be suspected in aphasia with gradual progression over time.\u00a0<ref name=\":0\" /> Imaging is often useful in identifying a lesion, with most common initial imaging consisting of computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia|title=Aphasia|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2017|website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Electroencephalography (EEG) can also be useful in patients with transient aphasia, where findings may be due to seizures, although this is a less common cause. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDiagnosis of aphasia, as well as characterization of type of aphasia, is done with language testing by the provider. Testing should evaluate fluency of speech, comprehension, repetition, ability to name objects, and writing skills. <ref name=\":1\" /> Fluency is assessed by observing the patient\u2019s spontaneous speech. Abnormalities in fluency would include shortened phrases, decreased number of words per minute, increased effort with speech, and agrammatism. <ref name=\":0\" /> Patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia should have fluent speech, so abnormalities in fluency may indicate a different type of aphasia. Comprehension is assessed by giving the patient commands to follow, beginning with simple commands and progressing to more complex commands. Repetition is evaluated by having the patient repeat phrases, progressing from simple to more complex phrases. <ref name=\":0\" /> Both comprehension and repetition would be abnormal in Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. Content should also be assessed, by listening to a patient\u2019s spontaneous or instructed speech. Content abnormalities include paraphasic errors and neologisms, both indicative of a diagnosis of Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. <ref name=\":0\" />  Neologisms are novel words that may resemble existing words. Patients with severe Wernicke's aphasia may also produce strings of such neologisms with a few connecting words, known as jargon. Errors in the selection of phonemes of patients with Wernicke's aphasia include addition, omission, or change in position. Another symptom of Wernicke's aphasia is use of semantic [[paraphasia]]s or \"empty speech\" which is the use of generic terms like \"stuff\" or \"things\" to stand in for the specific words that the patient cannot think of. Some Wernicke's aphasia patients also talk around missing words, which is called \"[[circumlocution]].\" Patients with Wernicke's aphasia can tend to run on when they talk, due to circumlocution combined with deficient self-monitoring. This overabundance of words or press of speech can be described as logorrhea. If symptoms are present, a full neurologic exam should also be done, which will help differentiate aphasia from other neurologic diagnoses potentially causing altered mental status with abnormal speech and comprehension. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an example, a patient with Wernicke's aphasia was asked what brought him to the hospital. His response was, \"Is this some of the work that we work as we did before? ... All right ... From when wine [why] I'm here.

Speech and language therapy is the first line treatment for the aphasia itself, and has a goal of improving language deficits as well as preserving the patient\u2019s remaining language skills. <ref name=\":1\" /> A subsequent critical goal of therapy is to teach the patient how to communicate in alternative ways, so they can successfully communicate in daily life. <ref name=\":1\" /> This may include gestures, pictures, or use of electronic devices. <ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nWhile neuroimaging and lesion evidence generally support the idea that malfunction of or damage to Wernicke's area is common in people with receptive aphasia, this is not always so.

range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study carried out at the [[University of Rochester]] in which [[American Sign Language]] native speakers were subject to [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax (relationship is determined by the word order) or inflection (relationship is determined by physical motion of \"moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body\").  Distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex (associated with ability to put information into sequences) being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes (associated with dividing information into its constituent parts) being more active in the inflection condition.  However, these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap.  These findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process, the brain may be using fairly basic, preexisting computational methods.<ref name=\"Newman2010\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman AJ, Supalla T, Hauser P, Newport EL, Bavelier D | title = Dissociating neural subsystems for grammar by contrasting word order and inflection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 107 | issue = 16 | pages = 7539\u201344 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20368422 | pmc = 2867749 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1003174107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.7539N }}</ref>\n\n==Clinical significance==\n[[File:Wernicke's area animation.gif|thumb|Human brain with Wernicke's area highlighted in red]]\n\n===Aphasia===\n\nWernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]] and [[psychiatrist]] who, in 1874, hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wernicke K. |chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875) |editor=Paul Eling |title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to) |publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co |location=Amsterdam |year=1995 |pages=69\u201389 |isbn=978-90-272-1893-3 |volume=4 }}</ref> He did this on the basis of the location of [[Acquired brain injury|brain injuries]] that caused [[aphasia]]. [[Receptive aphasia]] in which such abilities are preserved is also known as '''Wernicke's aphasia'''. In this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax]]. Language as a result is largely meaningless (a condition sometimes called ''fluent'' or ''[[jargon aphasia]]'').\n\nWernicke\u2019s area receives information from the auditory cortex, and functions to assign word meanings. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia?search=wernicke%27s%20aphasia&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1~4&usage_type=default&display_rank=1|title=Approach to the patient with aphasia|last=Glenn Clark|first=David|date=2018|website=Up To Date|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This is why damage to this area results in meaningless speech, often with paraphasic errors and newly created words or expressions.

Normal sentence structure and prosody are preserved, with normal intonation, inflection, rate ,and rhythm.<ref name=\":1\" /> This differs from Broca\u2019s aphasia, which is characterized by nonfluency. Patients are typically not aware that their speech is impaired in this way, as they have altered comprehension of their speech. Written language, reading, and repetition are affected as well. <ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDamage to the posterior temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere is the cause of Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. <ref name=\":1\" /> The etiology of this damage can vary greatly, with the most common cause being a cerebrovascular event such as an ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is the result of a thrombus occluding a blood vessel, restricting blood supply to a particular area of the brain. Other causes of focal damage potentially leading to Wernicke\u2019s aphasia include head trauma, infections affecting the central nervous system, neurodegenerative disease, and neoplasms. <ref name=\":1\" /> A cerebrovascular event is more likely the cause in an acute-onset presentation of aphasia, whereas a degenerative disease should be suspected in aphasia with gradual progression over time.\u00a0<ref name=\":0\" /> Imaging is often useful in identifying a lesion, with most common initial imaging consisting of computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia|title=Aphasia|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2017|website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Electroencephalography (EEG) can also be useful in patients with transient aphasia, where findings may be due to seizures, although this is a less common cause. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDiagnosis of aphasia, as well as characterization of type of aphasia, is done with language testing by the provider. Testing should evaluate fluency of speech, comprehension, repetition, ability to name objects, and writing skills. <ref name=\":1\" /> Fluency is assessed by observing the patient\u2019s spontaneous speech. Abnormalities in fluency would include shortened phrases, decreased number of words per minute, increased effort with speech, and agrammatism. <ref name=\":0\" /> Patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia should have fluent speech, so abnormalities in fluency may indicate a different type of aphasia. Comprehension is assessed by giving the patient commands to follow, beginning with simple commands and progressing to more complex commands. Repetition is evaluated by having the patient repeat phrases, progressing from simple to more complex phrases. <ref name=\":0\" /> Both comprehension and repetition would be abnormal in Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. Content should also be assessed, by listening to a patient\u2019s spontaneous or instructed speech. Content abnormalities include paraphasic errors and neologisms, both indicative of a diagnosis of Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. <ref name=\":0\" />  Neologisms are novel words that may resemble existing words. Patients with severe Wernicke's aphasia may also produce strings of such neologisms with a few connecting words, known as jargon. Errors in the selection of phonemes of patients with Wernicke's aphasia include addition, omission, or change in position. Another symptom of Wernicke's aphasia is use of semantic [[paraphasia]]s or \"empty speech\" which is the use of generic terms like \"stuff\" or \"things\" to stand in for the specific words that the patient cannot think of. Some Wernicke's aphasia patients also talk around missing words, which is called \"[[circumlocution]].\" Patients with Wernicke's aphasia can tend to run on when they talk, due to circumlocution combined with deficient self-monitoring. This overabundance of words or press of speech can be described as logorrhea. If symptoms are present, a full neurologic exam should also be done, which will help differentiate aphasia from other neurologic diagnoses potentially causing altered mental status with abnormal speech and comprehension. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an example, a patient with Wernicke's aphasia was asked what brought him to the hospital. His response was, \"Is this some of the work that we work as we did before? ... All right ... From when wine [why] I'm here.

Speech and language therapy is the first line treatment for the aphasia itself, and has a goal of improving language deficits as well as preserving the patient\u2019s remaining language skills. <ref name=\":1\" /> A subsequent critical goal of therapy is to teach the patient how to communicate in alternative ways, so they can successfully communicate in daily life. <ref name=\":1\" /> This may include gestures, pictures, or use of electronic devices. <ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nWhile neuroimaging and lesion evidence generally support the idea that malfunction of or damage to Wernicke's area is common in people with receptive aphasia, this is not always so.
