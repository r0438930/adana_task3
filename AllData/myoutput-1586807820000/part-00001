Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the sailors to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days he emailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board ship. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', were controversial and he resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.\n\n===March===\nOn 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam. On the last night some sailors stayed at a hotel where two people had tested positive for [[COVID-19]], a coronavirus disease identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness. Upon learning this, the crew were ordered back to the ship and the sailors who had stayed at the hotel were isolated. Over the next weeks the ship's medical team monitored the crew for any signs of infection.<ref name = losses/>\n\nOn 24 March, it was reported that three sailors aboard had tested positive for the virus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/24/coronavirus-3-sailors-test-positive-military-readiness-affected/2910165001/ |title=Three sailors from USS Theodore Roosevelt have coronavirus, raising concerns about pandemic's strain on military |work=USA Today |last=Vanden Brook |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Vanden Brook|date=24 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nWithin a few days, that number climbed to \"dozens.\" ''Theodore Roosevelt'' was ordered to [[Guam]] and docked on 27 March 2020.<ref name= disinfectUssTRcvn71 />\n\nOn 30 March, the ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Brett Crozier]], sent an [[Classified information in the United States#Unclassified|unclassified email]] to multiple Navy officials asking for help with the coronavirus epidemic on his ship.

Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the sailors to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days he emailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board ship. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', were controversial and he resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.\n\n===March===\nOn 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam.

Upon learning this, the crew were ordered back to the ship and the sailors who had stayed at the hotel were isolated.
