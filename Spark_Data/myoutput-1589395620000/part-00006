Ancient and medieval colonialism was practiced by the [[Phoenicians]], the [[Greeks]], and the [[crusaders]], among others. Colonialism in the modern sense began with the \"[[Age of Discovery]]\", lBetween 1580 and 1640, the two empires were both ruled by the [[Spanish monarch]]s in [[personal union]]. During the late 16th and 17th centuries, [[Kingdom of England|England]], France and the [[Dutch Republic]] also established their own overseas empires, in direct competition with each other. \n\nThe end of the 18th and early 19th century saw the first era of [[decolonization]], when most of the European colonies in the Americas, notably those of Spain, [[New France]] and the [[13 colonies]], gained their independence from their [[metropole]]. The [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (uniting [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and England), France, Portugal, and the Dutch turned their attention to the Old World, particularly South Africa, India and [[South East Asia]], where coastal enclaves had already been established. \nThe [[second industrial revolution]], in the 19th century, led to what has been termed the era of [[New Imperialism]], when the pace of colonization rapidly accelerated, the height of which was the [[Scramble for Africa]], in which Belgium, Germany and Italy were also participants.\n\nThere were conflicts between colonizing states and revolutions from colonized areas shaping areas of control and establishing independent nations. During the 20th century, the colonies of the defeated central powers in [[World War I]] were distributed amongst the victors as [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]], but it was not until the end of [[World War II]] that the second phase of decolonization began in earnest.\n\n== Periodisation ==\n\n[[File:Colonisation2.gif|400px|thumb|Colonial powers throughout history: most of them were European.]]\n\nSome commentators identify three waves of European colonialism.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Gilmartin\n| first1 = Mary\n| chapter = 9: Colonialism/imperialism\n| editor1-last = Gallaher\n| editor1-first = Carolyn\n| editor1-link = Carolyn Gallaher\n| editor2-last = Dahlman\n| editor2-first = Carl T.\n| editor3-last = Gilmartin\n| editor3-first = Mary\n| editor4-last = Mountz\n| editor4-first = Alison\n| editor5-last = Shirlow\n| editor5-first = Peter\n| title = Key Concepts in Political Geography\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC\n| series = Key Concepts in Human Geography\n| location = London\n| publisher = SAGE\n| publication-date = 2009\n| page = 115\n| isbn = 9781446243541\n| access-date = 2017-08-09\n| quote = Commentators have identified three broad waves of European colonial and imperial expansion, connected with specific territories.

The Ottomans conquered [[Southeast Europe|South Eastern Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and much of [[North Africa|Northern]] and [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]] between 1359 and 1653. The Spanish and Portuguese launched the colonisation of the [[Americas]], basing their territorial claims on the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] of 1494. This treaty demarcated the respective spheres of influence of Spain and Portugal.<ref>Gilmartin, et al. p. 115 </ref>\n\nThe expansion achieved by Spain and Portugal caught the attention of Britain, France and the Netherlands.<ref>Jonathan Hart, ''Representing the New World: the English and French uses of the Example of Spain'' (2001). pp 85-86.</ref> The entrance of these three powers into the Caribbean and North America perpetuated European colonialism in these regions.<ref name=\"Gilmartin\">Gilmartin, M.

In ''Key concepts in political geography''  London: SAGE pp. 115-123.</ref>\n\nThe second wave of European colonialism commenced with Britain's involvement in Asia in support of the British [[East India Company]]; other countries such as France, Portugal and the Netherlands also had involvement in European expansion in Asia.<ref>Gilmartin, et al. p. 115 </ref><ref>Tonio Andrade,  \"Beyond Guns, Germs, and Steel: European Expansion and Maritime Asia, 1400-1750.\" ''Journal of Early Modern History'' 14.1-2 (2010): 165-186.</ref>\n\nThe [[New Imperialism |third wave]] (\"New Imperialism\") consisted of the [[Scramble for Africa]]   regulated by the terms of the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885. The conference effectively divided Africa among the European powers. Vast regions of Africa came under the sway of Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, Belgium, Italy and Spain.<ref>George Shepperson,  \"The Centennial of the West African Conference of Berlin, 1884-1885.\" ''Phylon''  46.1 (1985): 37-48.</ref><ref>Peter J.

The first wave of European expansion involved exploring the world to find new revenue and perpetuating European [[feudalism]].  The second wave focused on developing the [[mercantilism|mercantile]] capitalism system  and the manufacturing industry in Europe.  The last wave of European colonialism solidified all capitalistic endeavours by providing new markets and raw materials.<ref>Gilmartin, et al. pp. 115-16 </ref>\n\n==China==\nIn Chinese political theory, relations between foreign states were governed by the [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary]] system. Since the [[Emperor of China]] held the [[Mandate of Heaven]], his rule was universal and extended to [[Tianxia|All under heaven]]. Sometimes neighboring states were actual [[protectorate]]s or [[vassal state]]s over which China exerted large amounts of influence, while in other cases foreign states merely acknowledged China's nominal [[suzerainty]] in order to gain access to Chinese trade, which took place through the tributary system.<ref>{{cite book|author=Warren I.

The Tang Dynasty established control over the Tarim Basin region as well, fighting wars with the new Tibetan Empire and stripping them of their colonies in Central Asia (which was abandoned after the [[An Lushan Rebellion]]). The [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279), in securing maritime trade routes that ran from South East Asia into the Indian Ocean, had established fortified trade bases in the Philippines. The Mongol-led [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279\u20131368) made attempts to invade [[Japan]] after securing the Korean peninsula through the vassaldom of the Korean [[Goryeo]] dynasty, yet both of these military ventures failed (see [[Mongol Invasions of Japan]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=James I.

The Ming loyalists quickly moved to replace the institutions and culture of Dutch colonial rule with Han Chinese colonial rule. Language and religious institutions left by the Dutch were closed and replaced with Confucian temples and Chinese language schools for both Han Chinese and aboriginals. Officials encouraged new immigration of Han Chinese from China into territory further inland, turning aboriginal lands into new farmland.<ref>J. Wills, Jr (2006), \"The Seventeenth Century Transformation\", in ''Taiwan: A New History'', ed M. Rubinstein.</ref> After fighting between the Ming loyalists and the [[Qing]] during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], the Qing attacked the Kingdom of Tungning. the Qing won the [[Battle of Penghu]] and the Ming loyalists submitted to Qing rule. Tungning was annexed as part of [[Fujian]] province. The Qing were \"reluctant colonizers\" but became convinced of Taiwan's value to their empire due to the threat the island posed if used as a base by rival powers, and by its abundant resources. <ref>Tonio Andrade, ''How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century'', Columbia University Press.</ref> The Qing turned Taiwan into its own province in 1885, after [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|Japanese interest]] and a defeated [[Keelung Campaign|French invasion]] attempt.\n\nAfter British troops [[British expedition to Tibet|invaded Tibet]] in the waning days of the Qing dynasty, the Qing responded by sending [[Zhao Erfeng]] to further integrate Tibet into China.  He succeeded in abolishing the powers of the Tibetan local leaders in [[Kham]] and appointing Chinese magistrates in their places by 1909\u201310. Qing forces were also sent to [[\u00dc-Tsang]] in 1910 to establish a direct control over Tibet proper, though a province was never established in this area.\n\n===Central Asia===\nThe ability of Qing China to project power into [[Central Asia]] came about because of two changes, one social and one technological.  The social change was that under the Qing dynasty, from 1642, China came under the control of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s who organised their military forces around cavalry which was more suited for power projection than traditional Chinese infantry.  The technological change was advances in artillery which negated the military advantage that the people of the [[Steppe]] had with their cavalry. Zunghar Khanate (\u0417\u04af\u04af\u043d \u0433\u0430\u0440\u044b\u043d \u0445\u0430\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u0443\u043b\u0441) was the last great independent nomadic power on the steppe in Central Asia. The [[Dzungars]] were deliberately exterminated in a brutal campaign during the [[Zunghar Genocide]] by Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols. It has been estimated that more than a million people were slaughtered, and it took generations for it to recover.<ref>Christian Tyler, ''Wild West China: The Taming of Xinjiang'' (Rutgers UP, 2003) p. 55</ref>  The Manchu ruling family ([[Aisin Gioro]]) was a supporter of Tibetan Buddhism and so many of the ruling groups were linked by religion.\n\n===Burma (Myanmar) === \nThe Qing campaign against Burma (Myanmar) (1765-70) was its most disastrous and costly frontier war. It ended in a stalemate but the Qing rulers could not accept Burma as an equal, and when diplomatic relations were resumed in 1790, the Qing court considered this was a restoration of Chinese suzerainty.<ref>Yingcong Dai, \"A disguised defeat: The Myanmar campaign of the Qing dynasty.\" ''Modern Asian Studies'' 38.1 (2004): 145-189.</ref>\n==Imperial Russia==\n[[File:Expansi\u00f3n territorial de Rusia.svg|thumb|320px|right|Expansion of Russia (1300\u20131945)]]\n{{Further|History of Russia}}\nThe [[Territorial changes of Russia]] happened by means of military conquest and by ideological and political unions over the centuries.<ref>Brian Catchpole,  ''A map history of Russia'' (1983) pp 6-31.</ref> This section covers (1533\u20131914).<ref> The name ''Russia'' for the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] had become common in 1547 when the [[Tsardom of Russia]] was created.<br> For the history of [[Rus' (name)|Rus']] and Moscovy before 1547 : see [[Kievan Rus']] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].

While western Europe colonized the New World, Russia expanded overland - to the east, north and south.  This continued for centuries; by the end of the 19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] reached from the [[Black Sea]] to the Pacific Ocean, and for some time [[Russian colonization of the Americas|included]] colonies in the [[Russian America|Alaska]] (1732-1867) and a short-lived [[Sagallo|unofficial colony in Africa]] (1889) in present-day [[Djibouti]].<ref>John Channon, ''The Penguin historical atlas of Russia'' (1995) pp 8-12, 44-75.</ref>\nThe acquisition of new territories, especially in the Caucasus, had an invigorating effect on the rest of Russia. According to two Russian historians:\n: the culture of Russia and that of the Caucasian peoples interacted in a reciprocally beneficial manner. The turbulent tenor of life in the Caucasus, the mountain peoples' love of freedom, and their willingness to die for independence were felt far beyond the local interaction of the Caucasian peoples and coresident Russians: they injected a potent new spirit into the thinking and creative work of Russia's progressives, strengthened the liberationist aspirations of Russian writers and exiled [[G. L.,|Decembrists]], and influenced distinguished Russian democrats, poets, and prose writers, including [[Alexander Griboyedov]], [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. These writers, who generally supported the Caucasian fight for liberation, went beyond the chauvinism of the colonial autocracy and rendered the Caucasian peoples' cultures accessible to the Russian intelligentsia. At the same time, Russian culture exerted an influence on Caucasian cultures, bolstering positive aspects while weakening the impact of the Caucasian peoples' reactionary feudalism and reducing the internecine fighting between tribes and clans.<ref>G.

The second stage from 1785 to 1830 looked south to the areas between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.  The key areas were Armenia and Georgia, with some better penetration of the Ottoman Empire, and Persia. By 1829, Russia controlled all of the Caucasus as shown in the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]]  of 1829. The third era, 1850 to 1860, was a brief interlude jumping to the East Coast, annexing the region from the Amur River to Manchuria. The fourth era, 1865 to 1885 incorporated Turkestan, and the northern approaches to India, sparking British fears of a threat to India in [[The Great Game]].<ref>Martina Winkler,  \"From ruling people to owning land: Russian concepts of imperial possession in the North Pacific, 18th and early 19th centuries.\" ''Jahrb\u00fccher f\u00fcr Geschichte Osteuropas'' (2011) 59#3: 321-353, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41302564 online in English].</ref>\n\n== Portuguese and Spanish exploration and colonization ==\n\n[[File:ElminaCastle1668.jpg|thumb|[[Elmina Castle]], Ghana, one in a chain of about fifty fortified [[factory (trading post)|factories]] to enforce Portuguese trade rule along the coast. View from the sea in 1668.]]\n[[File:Spanish Empire Anachronous 0.PNG|thumb|The combined Spanish and Portuguese empires during the [[Iberian Union]] (1580\u20131640)]]\n{{Main|Portuguese Empire|Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\nEuropean colonization of both [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere]]s has its roots in Portuguese exploration. There were financial and religious motives behind this exploration. By finding the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]], the Portuguese could reap its profits for themselves. They would also be able to probe the existence of the fabled Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]], with an eye to encircling the Islamic [[Ottoman Empire]], itself gaining territories and colonies in Eastern Europe. The first foothold outside of Europe was gained with the conquest of [[Ceuta]] in 1415. During the 15th century, Portuguese sailors discovered the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]], [[Azores]], and [[Cape Verde]], which were duly populated, and pressed progressively further along the west African coast until [[Bartolomeu Dias]] demonstrated it was possible to sail around Africa by rounding the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, paving the way for [[Vasco da Gama]] to reach India in 1498.<ref>Charles R. Boxer, ''The Portuguese Seaborne Empire 1415\u20131825'' (1969). </ref>\n\nPortuguese successes led to Spanish financing of a mission by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 to explore an alternative route to Asia, by sailing west. When Columbus eventually made landfall in the Caribbean [[Antilles]] he believed he had reached the coast of India, and that the people he encountered there were Indians with red skin. This is why [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have been called Indians or red-Indians. In truth, Columbus had [[Discovery of the Americas|arrived on a continent]] that was new to the Europeans, the Americas. After Columbus' first trips, competing Spanish and Portuguese claims to new territories and sea routes were solved with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which divided the world outside of Europe in two areas of trade an exploration, between the Iberian kingdoms of Castile and Portugal along a north\u2013south meridian, 370 leagues west of [[Cape Verde]]. According to this international agreement, the larger part of the Americas and the [[Pacific Ocean]] were open to Spanish exploration and colonization, while Africa, the [[Indian Ocean]] and most of Asia were assigned to Portugal.<ref>Lyle N. McAlister, ''Spain and Portugal in the New World, 1492-1700'' (1984).</ref>   \n\nThe boundaries specified by the Treaty of Tordesillas were put to the test in 1521 when [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and his Spanish sailors (among other Europeans), sailing for the Spanish Crown became the first European to cross the Pacific Ocean,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=history.com|title=Ferdinand Magellan|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/ferdinand-magellan|website=history.com|publisher=A+E Networks|accessdate=14 December 2017|date=2009}}</ref> reaching [[Guam]] and the Philippines, parts of which the Portuguese had already explored, sailing from the Indian Ocean. The two by now global empires, which had set out from opposing directions, had finally met on the other side of the world. The conflicts that arose between both powers were finally solved with the [[Treaty of Zaragoza]] in 1529, which defined the areas of Spanish and Portuguese influence in Asia, establishing the anti meridian, or line of demarcation on the other side of the world.<ref>Melvin E. Page, ''Colonialism:  An International Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia'' (2003) 1:361-2.</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century the Portuguese continued to press both eastwards and westwards into the Oceans. Towards Asia they made the first direct contact between Europeans and the peoples inhabiting present day countries such as [[Mozambique]], [[Madagascar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[East Timor]] (1512), China, and finally Japan. In the opposite direction, the Portuguese colonized the huge territory that eventually became Brasil, and the Spanish [[conquistadores]] established the vast Viceroyalties of [[New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]], and later of [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|R\u00edo de la Plata]] (Argentina) and [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] (Colombia). In Asia, the Portuguese encountered ancient and well populated societies, and established a seaborne empire consisting of armed coastal trading posts along their trade routes (such as [[Goa]], [[Malacca]] and [[Macau]]), so they had relatively little cultural impact on the societies they engaged. In the Western Hemisphere, the European colonization involved the emigration of large numbers of settlers, soldiers and administrators intent on owning land and exploiting the apparently primitive (as perceived by Old World standards) [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The result was that the colonization of the New World was catastrophic: native peoples were no match for European technology, ruthlessness, or their diseases which decimated the [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous population]].<ref>Page, ''Colonialism'' 2: 770-781.</ref>\n\nSpanish treatment of the indigenous populations caused a fierce debate, the [[Valladolid Controversy]], over whether Indians possessed souls and if so, whether they were entitled to the basic rights of mankind. [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], author of ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'', championed the cause of the native peoples, and was opposed by [[Juan Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda|Sep\u00falveda]], who claimed [[Amerindians]] were \"natural slaves\".<ref>Daniel R.

The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Jesuits]], and [[Franciscans]], notably [[Francis Xavier]] in Asia and [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] in North America, were particularly active in this endeavour. Many buildings erected by the Jesuits still stand, such as the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul in Macau]] and the [[La Santisima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1|Santisima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1]] in [[Paraguay]], the latter an example of the [[Jesuit Reductions]]. The Dominican and Franciscan buildings of [[Spanish missions in California|California's missions]] and [[Spanish missions in New Mexico|New Mexico's missions]] stand restored, such as [[Mission Santa Barbara]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and [[San Francisco de Asis Mission Church]] in [[Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico]].<ref>John Frederick Schwaller, ''The history of the Catholic Church in Latin America: From conquest to revolution and beyond'' (2011) ch 1-3.</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonization of the Americas 1750.PNG|thumb|200px|Map indicating the territories colonized by the European powers over the Americas in 1750 (mainly Spain, Portugal and France at the time).]]\nAs characteristically happens in any colonialism, European or not, previous or subsequent, both Spain and Portugal profited handsomely from their newfound overseas colonies: the Spanish from gold and silver from mines such as [[Potos\u00ed]] and [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] in [[New Spain]], the Portuguese from the huge markups they enjoyed as trade intermediaries, particarlarly during the [[Namban]] [[Japanese history|Japan]] trade period. The influx of precious metals to the Spanish monarchy's coffers allowed it to finance costly [[religious war]]s in Europe which ultimately proved its economic undoing: the supply of metals was not infinite and the large inflow caused inflation and debt, and subsequently affected the rest of Europe.<ref>Levack, Muir, Veldman, Maas, Brian (2007).

This challenge initially took the form of piratical attacks (such as those by [[Francis Drake]]) on Spanish treasure fleets or coastal settlements.<ref>Violet Barbour, \"Privateers and pirates of the West Indies.\" ''American Historical Review'' 16.3 (1911): 529-566.</ref> Later the Northern European countries began establishing settlements of their own, primarily in areas that were outside of Spanish interests, such as what is now the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada, or islands in the Caribbean, such as [[Aruba]], [[Martinique]] and [[Barbados]], that had been abandoned by the Spanish in favour of the mainland and larger islands.<ref>John H. Elliott, ''Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830'' (2007). </ref>\n\nWhereas Spanish colonialism was based on the religious conversion and exploitation of local populations via [[encomienda]]s (many Spaniards emigrated to the Americas to elevate their social status, and were not interested in manual labour), Northern European colonialism was bolstered by those emigrating for religious reasons (for example, the ''[[Mayflower]]'' voyage). The motive for emigration was not to become an aristocrat or to spread one's faith but to start a new society afresh, structured according to the colonists wishes. The most populous emigration of the 17th century was that of the English, who after a series of wars with the Dutch and French came to dominate the [[Thirteen Colonies]] on the eastern coast of the present day United States and other colonies such as Newfoundland and Rupert's Land in what is now Canada.<ref>Walter  Hixson, ''American settler colonialism: A history'' (2013).</ref>\n\nHowever, the English, French and Dutch were no more averse to making a profit than the Spanish and Portuguese, and whilst their areas of settlement in the Americas proved to be devoid of the precious metals found by the Spanish, trade in other commodities and products that could be sold at massive profit in Europe provided another reason for crossing the Atlantic, in particular furs from Canada, tobacco and cotton grown in [[Virginia]] and sugar in the islands of the Caribbean and Brazil. Due to the massive depletion of indigenous labour, plantation owners had to look elsewhere for manpower for these labour-intensive crops. They turned to the centuries-old slave trade of west Africa and began transporting Africans across the Atlantic on a massive scale \u2013 historians estimate that the [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought between 10 and 12 million black African slaves to the New World. The islands of the Caribbean soon came to be populated by slaves of African descent, ruled over by a white minority of plantation owners interested in making a fortune and then returning to their home country to spend it.<ref>Phyllis Raybin Emert, ed., ''Colonial Triangular Trade: An Economy Based on Human Misery'' (1995).</ref>\n\n===Role of companies in early colonialism===\nFrom its very outset, Western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture.

Rivalry among reigning European powers saw the entry of the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[English overseas possessions|English]], [[French India|French]], [[Danish India|Danish]] and others. The kingdoms of [[History of India|India]] were gradually taken over by the Europeans and indirectly controlled by puppet rulers. In 1600, Queen [[Elizabeth I]] accorded a [[charter]], forming the [[East India Company]] to trade with India and eastern Asia. The English landed in India in [[Surat]] in 1612. By the 19th century, they had assumed [[British India|direct]] and [[Princely states|indirect]] control over most of India.\n\n==Independence in the Americas (1770\u20131820)==\n{{See also|Colonization of Canada}}\nDuring the five decades following 1770, Britain, France, Spain and Portugal lost many of their possessions in the Americas.\n\n===Britain and the Thirteen Colonies===\n{{Main|Thirteen Colonies|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War|United States Declaration of Independence}}\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, Britain had emerged as the world's dominant power, but found itself mired in debt and struggling to finance the Navy and Army necessary to maintain a global empire. The [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]'s attempt to raise taxes from North American colonists raised fears among the Americans that their rights as \"Englishmen\", and particularly their rights of self-government, were in danger.<ref>Brendan Simms, ''Three Victories And A Defeat: The Rise And Fall Of The First British Empire'' (2008)</ref>\n\nFrom 1765, a series of disputes with Parliament over taxation led to the [[American Revolution]], first to informal [[committees of correspondence]] among the colonies, then to coordinated protest and resistance, with an important event in 1770, the [[Boston Massacre]]. A [[standing army]] was formed by the [[Thirteen Colonies|United Colonies]], and [[United States Declaration of Independence|independence was declared]]  by the Second [[Continental Congress]] on 4 July 1776. A new nation was born, the United States of America, and all royal officials were expelled.  On their own the Patriots captured a British Invasion army and France recognized the new nation, formed military alliance, declared war on Britain, and left the superpower without  any major ally.  The [[American War of Independence]] continued until 1783, when the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed. Britain recognised the sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded by the British possessions to the North, [[Florida]] to the South, and the Mississippi River to the west.<ref>Stephen Conway, ''The War of American Independence 1775\u20131783'' (1995). </ref>\n\n===France and the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804)===\nThe [[Haitian Revolution]], a slave revolt led by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] in the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]], established [[Ha\u00efti]] as a free, black [[republic]], the first of its kind.

Africans and people of African ancestry freed themselves from slavery and colonization by taking advantage of the conflict among whites over how to implement the reforms of the [[French Revolution]] in this slave society.

The death knell for the Spanish Empire in the Americas was Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian peninsula in 1808. With the installation of his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] on the Spanish throne, the main tie between the metropole and its colonies in the Americas, the Spanish monarchy, had been cut, leading the colonists to question their continued subordination to a declining and distant country.  With an eye on the events of the American Revolution forty years earlier, revolutionary leaders began bloody wars of independence against Spain, whose armies were ultimately unable to maintain control. By 1831, Spain had been ejected from the mainland of the Americas, leaving a collection of independent republics that stretched from Chile and Argentina in the south to Mexico in the north. Spain's colonial possessions were reduced to [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the Philippines and a number of small islands in the Pacific, all of which she was to lose to the United States in the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War]] or sell to Germany shortly thereafter.<ref>Timothy Anna, ''Spain & the Loss of Empire'' (1983). </ref>\n\n===Portugal and Brazil===\nBrazil was the only country in Latin America to gain its independence without bloodshed. The invasion of Portugal by Napoleon in 1808 had forced King [[Jo\u00e3o VI]] to escape to Brazil and establish his court in Rio de Janeiro. For thirteen years, Portugal was ruled from Brazil (the only instance of such a reversal of roles between colony and metropole) until his return to Portugal in 1821. His son, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro]], was left in charge of Brazil and in 1822 he declared independence from Portugal and himself the Emperor of Brazil. Unlike Spain's former colonies which had abandoned the monarchy in favour of republicanism, Brazil therefore retained its links with its monarchy, the [[House of Braganza]].\n\n==India (1858 onwards)==\n{{Main|Colonial India|Western imperialism in Asia}}\n[[Vasco da Gama]]'s maritime success to discover for Europeans a new sea route to India in 1498 paved the way for direct Indo-European commerce.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1497degama.html| title = Vasco da Gama: Round Africa to India, 1497\u20131498 CE| accessdate = 7 May 2007|date=June 1998 | work = Internet Modern History Sourcebook| publisher = Paul Halsall }} From: Oliver J.

They introduced a land taxation system called the [[Permanent Settlement]] which introduced a [[feudalism|feudal]]-like structure (See ''[[Zamindar]]'') in Bengal. By the 1850s, the East India Company controlled most of the Indian sub-continent, which included present-day Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]]. Their policy was sometimes summed up as [[Divide and Rule]], taking advantage of the enmity festering between various princely states and social and religious groups.\n\nThe first major movement against the British Company's high handed rule resulted in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], also known as the \"Indian Mutiny\" or \"Sepoy Mutiny\" or the \"First War of Independence\". After a year of turmoil, and reinforcement of the East India Company's troops with British soldiers, the Company overcame the rebellion. The nominal leader of the uprising, the last Mughal emperor [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]], was exiled to Burma, his children were beheaded and the Moghul line abolished. In the aftermath all power was transferred from the East India Company to the [[British Crown]], which began to administer most of India as a colony; the Company's lands were controlled directly and the rest through the rulers of what it called the [[Princely states]].

As a champion of [[Realpolitik]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] disliked colonies and thought they were a waste of time, but his hand was forced by pressure from both the elites and the general population which considered the colonization a necessity for German prestige. German colonies in [[Togo]]land, [[Samoa]], [[South-West Africa]] and [[New Guinea]] had corporate commercial roots, while the equivalent German-dominated areas in East Africa and China owed more to political motives. The British also took an interest in Africa, using the [[East Africa Company]] to take over what are now Kenya and Uganda. The British crown formally took over in 1895 and renamed the area the East Africa Protectorate.\n\n[[Leopold II of Belgium]] personally owned the [[Congo Free State]] from 1885 to 1908, When round after round of international scandal regarding the abusive treatment of native workers forced the Belgium government to take full ownership and responsibility.

The conquest of [[Ethiopia]], which had remained the last African independent territory, had to wait till the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] in 1935\u201336 (the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] in 1895\u201396 had ended in defeat for Italy).\n\nThe [[Portuguese colonial empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish colonial empire]] were smaller, mostly legacies of past colonization.

Burma had been under British rule for nearly a hundred years, however, it was always considered an \u201cimperial backwater\u201d. This accounts for the fact that Burma does not have an obvious colonial legacy and is not a part of the Commonwealth.

Ancient and medieval colonialism was practiced by the [[Phoenicians]], the [[Greeks]], and the [[crusaders]], among others. Colonialism in the modern sense began with the \"[[Age of Discovery]]\", led by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], and then by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] exploration of the [[Americas]], the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, India and [[East Asia]]. The  [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish empires]] were the first [[List of largest empires|global empires]] because they were the first to stretch across different continents, covering vast territories around the globe. Between 1580 and 1640, the two empires were both ruled by the [[Spanish monarch]]s in [[personal union]]. During the late 16th and 17th centuries, [[Kingdom of England|England]], France and the [[Dutch Republic]] also established their own overseas empires, in direct competition with each other. \n\nThe end of the 18th and early 19th century saw the first era of [[decolonization]], when most of the European colonies in the Americas, notably those of Spain, [[New France]] and the [[13 colonies]], gained their independence from their [[metropole]]. The [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (uniting [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and England), France, Portugal, and the Dutch turned their attention to the Old World, particularly South Africa, India and [[South East Asia]], where coastal enclaves had already been established. \nThe [[second industrial revolution]], in the 19th century, led to what has been termed the era of [[New Imperialism]], when the pace of colonization rapidly accelerated, the height of which was the [[Scramble for Africa]], in which Belgium, Germany and Italy were also participants.\n\nThere were conflicts between colonizing states and revolutions from colonized areas shaping areas of control and establishing independent nations. During the 20th century, the colonies of the defeated central powers in [[World War I]] were distributed amongst the victors as [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]], but it was not until the end of [[World War II]] that the second phase of decolonization began in earnest.\n\n== Periodisation ==\n\n[[File:Colonisation2.gif|400px|thumb|Colonial powers throughout history: most of them were European.]]\n\nSome commentators identify three waves of European colonialism.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Gilmartin\n| first1 = Mary\n| chapter = 9: Colonialism/imperialism\n| editor1-last = Gallaher\n| editor1-first = Carolyn\n| editor1-link = Carolyn Gallaher\n| editor2-last = Dahlman\n| editor2-first = Carl T.\n| editor3-last = Gilmartin\n| editor3-first = Mary\n| editor4-last = Mountz\n| editor4-first = Alison\n| editor5-last = Shirlow\n| editor5-first = Peter\n| title = Key Concepts in Political Geography\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC\n| series = Key Concepts in Human Geography\n| location = London\n| publisher = SAGE\n| publication-date = 2009\n| page = 115\n| isbn = 9781446243541\n| access-date = 2017-08-09\n| quote = Commentators have identified three broad waves of European colonial and imperial expansion, connected with specific territories.

The Spanish and Portuguese launched the colonisation of the [[Americas]], basing their territorial claims on the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] of 1494.

The conference effectively divided Africa among the European powers. Vast regions of Africa came under the sway of Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, Belgium, Italy and Spain.<ref>George Shepperson,  \"The Centennial of the West African Conference of Berlin, 1884-1885.\" ''Phylon''  46.1 (1985): 37-48.</ref><ref>Peter J.

The first wave of European expansion involved exploring the world to find new revenue and perpetuating European [[feudalism]].

Since the [[Emperor of China]] held the [[Mandate of Heaven]], his rule was universal and extended to [[Tianxia|All under heaven]]. Sometimes neighboring states were actual [[protectorate]]s or [[vassal state]]s over which China exerted large amounts of influence, while in other cases foreign states merely acknowledged China's nominal [[suzerainty]] in order to gain access to Chinese trade, which took place through the tributary system.<ref>{{cite book|author=Warren I.

The Ming loyalists quickly moved to replace the institutions and culture of Dutch colonial rule with Han Chinese colonial rule. Language and religious institutions left by the Dutch were closed and replaced with Confucian temples and Chinese language schools for both Han Chinese and aboriginals. Officials encouraged new immigration of Han Chinese from China into territory further inland, turning aboriginal lands into new farmland.<ref>J. Wills, Jr (2006), \"The Seventeenth Century Transformation\", in ''Taiwan: A New History'', ed M. Rubinstein.</ref> After fighting between the Ming loyalists and the [[Qing]] during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], the Qing attacked the Kingdom of Tungning. the Qing won the [[Battle of Penghu]] and the Ming loyalists submitted to Qing rule. Tungning was annexed as part of [[Fujian]] province. The Qing were \"reluctant colonizers\" but became convinced of Taiwan's value to their empire due to the threat the island posed if used as a base by rival powers, and by its abundant resources. <ref>Tonio Andrade, ''How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century'', Columbia University Press.</ref> The Qing turned Taiwan into its own province in 1885, after [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|Japanese interest]] and a defeated [[Keelung Campaign|French invasion]] attempt.\n\nAfter British troops [[British expedition to Tibet|invaded Tibet]] in the waning days of the Qing dynasty, the Qing responded by sending [[Zhao Erfeng]] to further integrate Tibet into China.  He succeeded in abolishing the powers of the Tibetan local leaders in [[Kham]] and appointing Chinese magistrates in their places by 1909\u201310. Qing forces were also sent to [[\u00dc-Tsang]] in 1910 to establish a direct control over Tibet proper, though a province was never established in this area.\n\n===Central Asia===\nThe ability of Qing China to project power into [[Central Asia]] came about because of two changes, one social and one technological.  The social change was that under the Qing dynasty, from 1642, China came under the control of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s who organised their military forces around cavalry which was more suited for power projection than traditional Chinese infantry.  The technological change was advances in artillery which negated the military advantage that the people of the [[Steppe]] had with their cavalry.

The [[Dzungars]] were deliberately exterminated in a brutal campaign during the [[Zunghar Genocide]] by Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols. It has been estimated that more than a million people were slaughtered, and it took generations for it to recover.<ref>Christian Tyler, ''Wild West China: The Taming of Xinjiang'' (Rutgers UP, 2003) p. 55</ref>  The Manchu ruling family ([[Aisin Gioro]]) was a supporter of Tibetan Buddhism and so many of the ruling groups were linked by religion.\n\n===Burma (Myanmar) === \nThe Qing campaign against Burma (Myanmar) (1765-70) was its most disastrous and costly frontier war. It ended in a stalemate but the Qing rulers could not accept Burma as an equal, and when diplomatic relations were resumed in 1790, the Qing court considered this was a restoration of Chinese suzerainty.<ref>Yingcong Dai, \"A disguised defeat: The Myanmar campaign of the Qing dynasty.\" ''Modern Asian Studies'' 38.1 (2004): 145-189.</ref>\n==Imperial Russia==\n[[File:Expansi\u00f3n territorial de Rusia.svg|thumb|320px|right|Expansion of Russia (1300\u20131945)]]\n{{Further|History of Russia}}\nThe [[Territorial changes of Russia]] happened by means of military conquest and by ideological and political unions over the centuries.<ref>Brian Catchpole,  ''A map history of Russia'' (1983) pp 6-31.</ref> This section covers (1533\u20131914).<ref> The name ''Russia'' for the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] had become common in 1547 when the [[Tsardom of Russia]] was created.<br> For the history of [[Rus' (name)|Rus']] and Moscovy before 1547 : see [[Kievan Rus']] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].

According to two Russian historians:\n: the culture of Russia and that of the Caucasian peoples interacted in a reciprocally beneficial manner. The turbulent tenor of life in the Caucasus, the mountain peoples' love of freedom, and their willingness to die for independence were felt far beyond the local interaction of the Caucasian peoples and coresident Russians: they injected a potent new spirit into the thinking and creative work of Russia's progressives, strengthened the liberationist aspirations of Russian writers and exiled [[G. L.,|Decembrists]], and influenced distinguished Russian democrats, poets, and prose writers, including [[Alexander Griboyedov]], [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. These writers, who generally supported the Caucasian fight for liberation, went beyond the chauvinism of the colonial autocracy and rendered the Caucasian peoples' cultures accessible to the Russian intelligentsia. At the same time, Russian culture exerted an influence on Caucasian cultures, bolstering positive aspects while weakening the impact of the Caucasian peoples' reactionary feudalism and reducing the internecine fighting between tribes and clans.<ref>G.

The third era, 1850 to 1860, was a brief interlude jumping to the East Coast, annexing the region from the Amur River to Manchuria.

There were financial and religious motives behind this exploration. By finding the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]], the Portuguese could reap its profits for themselves. They would also be able to probe the existence of the fabled Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]], with an eye to encircling the Islamic [[Ottoman Empire]], itself gaining territories and colonies in Eastern Europe. The first foothold outside of Europe was gained with the conquest of [[Ceuta]] in 1415. During the 15th century, Portuguese sailors discovered the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]], [[Azores]], and [[Cape Verde]], which were duly populated, and pressed progressively further along the west African coast until [[Bartolomeu Dias]] demonstrated it was possible to sail around Africa by rounding the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, paving the way for [[Vasco da Gama]] to reach India in 1498.<ref>Charles R. Boxer, ''The Portuguese Seaborne Empire 1415\u20131825'' (1969). </ref>\n\nPortuguese successes led to Spanish financing of a mission by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 to explore an alternative route to Asia, by sailing west. When Columbus eventually made landfall in the Caribbean [[Antilles]] he believed he had reached the coast of India, and that the people he encountered there were Indians with red skin. This is why [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have been called Indians or red-Indians. In truth, Columbus had [[Discovery of the Americas|arrived on a continent]] that was new to the Europeans, the Americas. After Columbus' first trips, competing Spanish and Portuguese claims to new territories and sea routes were solved with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which divided the world outside of Europe in two areas of trade an exploration, between the Iberian kingdoms of Castile and Portugal along a north\u2013south meridian, 370 leagues west of [[Cape Verde]]. According to this international agreement, the larger part of the Americas and the [[Pacific Ocean]] were open to Spanish exploration and colonization, while Africa, the [[Indian Ocean]] and most of Asia were assigned to Portugal.<ref>Lyle N. McAlister, ''Spain and Portugal in the New World, 1492-1700'' (1984).</ref>   \n\nThe boundaries specified by the Treaty of Tordesillas were put to the test in 1521 when [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and his Spanish sailors (among other Europeans), sailing for the Spanish Crown became the first European to cross the Pacific Ocean,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=history.com|title=Ferdinand Magellan|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/ferdinand-magellan|website=history.com|publisher=A+E Networks|accessdate=14 December 2017|date=2009}}</ref> reaching [[Guam]] and the Philippines, parts of which the Portuguese had already explored, sailing from the Indian Ocean. The two by now global empires, which had set out from opposing directions, had finally met on the other side of the world. The conflicts that arose between both powers were finally solved with the [[Treaty of Zaragoza]] in 1529, which defined the areas of Spanish and Portuguese influence in Asia, establishing the anti meridian, or line of demarcation on the other side of the world.<ref>Melvin E. Page, ''Colonialism:  An International Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia'' (2003) 1:361-2.</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century the Portuguese continued to press both eastwards and westwards into the Oceans. Towards Asia they made the first direct contact between Europeans and the peoples inhabiting present day countries such as [[Mozambique]], [[Madagascar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[East Timor]] (1512), China, and finally Japan. In the opposite direction, the Portuguese colonized the huge territory that eventually became Brasil, and the Spanish [[conquistadores]] established the vast Viceroyalties of [[New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]], and later of [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|R\u00edo de la Plata]] (Argentina) and [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] (Colombia). In Asia, the Portuguese encountered ancient and well populated societies, and established a seaborne empire consisting of armed coastal trading posts along their trade routes (such as [[Goa]], [[Malacca]] and [[Macau]]), so they had relatively little cultural impact on the societies they engaged. In the Western Hemisphere, the European colonization involved the emigration of large numbers of settlers, soldiers and administrators intent on owning land and exploiting the apparently primitive (as perceived by Old World standards) [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The result was that the colonization of the New World was catastrophic: native peoples were no match for European technology, ruthlessness, or their diseases which decimated the [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous population]].<ref>Page, ''Colonialism'' 2: 770-781.</ref>\n\nSpanish treatment of the indigenous populations caused a fierce debate, the [[Valladolid Controversy]], over whether Indians possessed souls and if so, whether they were entitled to the basic rights of mankind. [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], author of ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'', championed the cause of the native peoples, and was opposed by [[Juan Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda|Sep\u00falveda]], who claimed [[Amerindians]] were \"natural slaves\".<ref>Daniel R.

The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Jesuits]], and [[Franciscans]], notably [[Francis Xavier]] in Asia and [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] in North America, were particularly active in this endeavour. Many buildings erected by the Jesuits still stand, such as the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul in Macau]] and the [[La Santisima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1|Santisima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1]] in [[Paraguay]], the latter an example of the [[Jesuit Reductions]]. The Dominican and Franciscan buildings of [[Spanish missions in California|California's missions]] and [[Spanish missions in New Mexico|New Mexico's missions]] stand restored, such as [[Mission Santa Barbara]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and [[San Francisco de Asis Mission Church]] in [[Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico]].<ref>John Frederick Schwaller, ''The history of the Catholic Church in Latin America: From conquest to revolution and beyond'' (2011) ch 1-3.</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonization of the Americas 1750.PNG|thumb|200px|Map indicating the territories colonized by the European powers over the Americas in 1750 (mainly Spain, Portugal and France at the time).]]\nAs characteristically happens in any colonialism, European or not, previous or subsequent, both Spain and Portugal profited handsomely from their newfound overseas colonies: the Spanish from gold and silver from mines such as [[Potos\u00ed]] and [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] in [[New Spain]], the Portuguese from the huge markups they enjoyed as trade intermediaries, particarlarly during the [[Namban]] [[Japanese history|Japan]] trade period. The influx of precious metals to the Spanish monarchy's coffers allowed it to finance costly [[religious war]]s in Europe which ultimately proved its economic undoing: the supply of metals was not infinite and the large inflow caused inflation and debt, and subsequently affected the rest of Europe.<ref>Levack, Muir, Veldman, Maas, Brian (2007).

This challenge initially took the form of piratical attacks (such as those by [[Francis Drake]]) on Spanish treasure fleets or coastal settlements.<ref>Violet Barbour, \"Privateers and pirates of the West Indies.\" ''American Historical Review'' 16.3 (1911): 529-566.</ref> Later the Northern European countries began establishing settlements of their own, primarily in areas that were outside of Spanish interests, such as what is now the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada, or islands in the Caribbean, such as [[Aruba]], [[Martinique]] and [[Barbados]], that had been abandoned by the Spanish in favour of the mainland and larger islands.<ref>John H. Elliott, ''Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830'' (2007). </ref>\n\nWhereas Spanish colonialism was based on the religious conversion and exploitation of local populations via [[encomienda]]s (many Spaniards emigrated to the Americas to elevate their social status, and were not interested in manual labour), Northern European colonialism was bolstered by those emigrating for religious reasons (for example, the ''[[Mayflower]]'' voyage). The motive for emigration was not to become an aristocrat or to spread one's faith but to start a new society afresh, structured according to the colonists wishes. The most populous emigration of the 17th century was that of the English, who after a series of wars with the Dutch and French came to dominate the [[Thirteen Colonies]] on the eastern coast of the present day United States and other colonies such as Newfoundland and Rupert's Land in what is now Canada.<ref>Walter  Hixson, ''American settler colonialism: A history'' (2013).</ref>\n\nHowever, the English, French and Dutch were no more averse to making a profit than the Spanish and Portuguese, and whilst their areas of settlement in the Americas proved to be devoid of the precious metals found by the Spanish, trade in other commodities and products that could be sold at massive profit in Europe provided another reason for crossing the Atlantic, in particular furs from Canada, tobacco and cotton grown in [[Virginia]] and sugar in the islands of the Caribbean and Brazil. Due to the massive depletion of indigenous labour, plantation owners had to look elsewhere for manpower for these labour-intensive crops. They turned to the centuries-old slave trade of west Africa and began transporting Africans across the Atlantic on a massive scale \u2013 historians estimate that the [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought between 10 and 12 million black African slaves to the New World. The islands of the Caribbean soon came to be populated by slaves of African descent, ruled over by a white minority of plantation owners interested in making a fortune and then returning to their home country to spend it.<ref>Phyllis Raybin Emert, ed., ''Colonial Triangular Trade: An Economy Based on Human Misery'' (1995).</ref>\n\n===Role of companies in early colonialism===\nFrom its very outset, Western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture. Columbus' voyages to the Americas were partially funded by Italian investors, but whereas the Spanish state maintained a tight rein on trade with its colonies (by law, the colonies could only trade with one designated port in the mother country and treasure was brought back in special [[Spanish treasure fleet|convoys]]), the English, French and Dutch granted what were effectively trade [[monopolies]] to [[Joint stock company|joint-stock companies]] such as the [[East India Company|East India Companies]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].<ref>Bob Moore, and [[Henk van Nierop]].

Rivalry among reigning European powers saw the entry of the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[English overseas possessions|English]], [[French India|French]], [[Danish India|Danish]] and others. The kingdoms of [[History of India|India]] were gradually taken over by the Europeans and indirectly controlled by puppet rulers. In 1600, Queen [[Elizabeth I]] accorded a [[charter]], forming the [[East India Company]] to trade with India and eastern Asia. The English landed in India in [[Surat]] in 1612. By the 19th century, they had assumed [[British India|direct]] and [[Princely states|indirect]] control over most of India.\n\n==Independence in the Americas (1770\u20131820)==\n{{See also|Colonization of Canada}}\nDuring the five decades following 1770, Britain, France, Spain and Portugal lost many of their possessions in the Americas.\n\n===Britain and the Thirteen Colonies===\n{{Main|Thirteen Colonies|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War|United States Declaration of Independence}}\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, Britain had emerged as the world's dominant power, but found itself mired in debt and struggling to finance the Navy and Army necessary to maintain a global empire. The [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]'s attempt to raise taxes from North American colonists raised fears among the Americans that their rights as \"Englishmen\", and particularly their rights of self-government, were in danger.<ref>Brendan Simms, ''Three Victories And A Defeat: The Rise And Fall Of The First British Empire'' (2008)</ref>\n\nFrom 1765, a series of disputes with Parliament over taxation led to the [[American Revolution]], first to informal [[committees of correspondence]] among the colonies, then to coordinated protest and resistance, with an important event in 1770, the [[Boston Massacre]]. A [[standing army]] was formed by the [[Thirteen Colonies|United Colonies]], and [[United States Declaration of Independence|independence was declared]]  by the Second [[Continental Congress]] on 4 July 1776. A new nation was born, the United States of America, and all royal officials were expelled.  On their own the Patriots captured a British Invasion army and France recognized the new nation, formed military alliance, declared war on Britain, and left the superpower without  any major ally.  The [[American War of Independence]] continued until 1783, when the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed. Britain recognised the sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded by the British possessions to the North, [[Florida]] to the South, and the Mississippi River to the west.<ref>Stephen Conway, ''The War of American Independence 1775\u20131783'' (1995). </ref>\n\n===France and the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804)===\nThe [[Haitian Revolution]], a slave revolt led by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] in the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]], established [[Ha\u00efti]] as a free, black [[republic]], the first of its kind. Haiti became the second independent nation that was a former European colony in the [[Western Hemisphere]] after the United States. Africans and people of African ancestry freed themselves from slavery and colonization by taking advantage of the conflict among whites over how to implement the reforms of the [[French Revolution]] in this slave society. Although independence was declared in 1804, it was not until 1825 that it was formally recognized by [[King Charles X of France]].<ref>Franklin W.

The death knell for the Spanish Empire in the Americas was Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian peninsula in 1808. With the installation of his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] on the Spanish throne, the main tie between the metropole and its colonies in the Americas, the Spanish monarchy, had been cut, leading the colonists to question their continued subordination to a declining and distant country.  With an eye on the events of the American Revolution forty years earlier, revolutionary leaders began bloody wars of independence against Spain, whose armies were ultimately unable to maintain control. By 1831, Spain had been ejected from the mainland of the Americas, leaving a collection of independent republics that stretched from Chile and Argentina in the south to Mexico in the north. Spain's colonial possessions were reduced to [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the Philippines and a number of small islands in the Pacific, all of which she was to lose to the United States in the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War]] or sell to Germany shortly thereafter.<ref>Timothy Anna, ''Spain & the Loss of Empire'' (1983). </ref>\n\n===Portugal and Brazil===\nBrazil was the only country in Latin America to gain its independence without bloodshed. The invasion of Portugal by Napoleon in 1808 had forced King [[Jo\u00e3o VI]] to escape to Brazil and establish his court in Rio de Janeiro. For thirteen years, Portugal was ruled from Brazil (the only instance of such a reversal of roles between colony and metropole) until his return to Portugal in 1821. His son, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro]], was left in charge of Brazil and in 1822 he declared independence from Portugal and himself the Emperor of Brazil. Unlike Spain's former colonies which had abandoned the monarchy in favour of republicanism, Brazil therefore retained its links with its monarchy, the [[House of Braganza]].\n\n==India (1858 onwards)==\n{{Main|Colonial India|Western imperialism in Asia}}\n[[Vasco da Gama]]'s maritime success to discover for Europeans a new sea route to India in 1498 paved the way for direct Indo-European commerce.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1497degama.html| title = Vasco da Gama: Round Africa to India, 1497\u20131498 CE| accessdate = 7 May 2007|date=June 1998 | work = Internet Modern History Sourcebook| publisher = Paul Halsall }} From: Oliver J.

They introduced a land taxation system called the [[Permanent Settlement]] which introduced a [[feudalism|feudal]]-like structure (See ''[[Zamindar]]'') in Bengal. By the 1850s, the East India Company controlled most of the Indian sub-continent, which included present-day Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]]. Their policy was sometimes summed up as [[Divide and Rule]], taking advantage of the enmity festering between various princely states and social and religious groups.\n\nThe first major movement against the British Company's high handed rule resulted in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], also known as the \"Indian Mutiny\" or \"Sepoy Mutiny\" or the \"First War of Independence\". After a year of turmoil, and reinforcement of the East India Company's troops with British soldiers, the Company overcame the rebellion. The nominal leader of the uprising, the last Mughal emperor [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]], was exiled to Burma, his children were beheaded and the Moghul line abolished. In the aftermath all power was transferred from the East India Company to the [[British Crown]], which began to administer most of India as a colony; the Company's lands were controlled directly and the rest through the rulers of what it called the [[Princely states]].

As it was mostly unoccupied by the Western powers as late as the 1880s, Africa became the primary target of the \"new\" imperialist expansion (known as the [[Scramble for Africa]]), although conquest took place also in other areas \u2014 notably south-east Asia and the East Asian seaboard, where Japan joined the European powers' scramble for territory.<ref>Parker Thomas Moon, ''Imperialism and world politics'' (1926), online.</ref>\n\nThe [[Berlin Conference]] (1884\u20131885) mediated the imperial competition among Britain, France and Germany, defining \"effective occupation\" as the criterion for international recognition of colonial claims and codifying the imposition of [[wikt:direct rule|direct rule]], accomplished usually through armed force.\n\nIn Germany, rising [[pan-Germanism]] was coupled to imperialism in the ''[[Alldeutsche Verband]]'' (\"Pangermanic League\"), which argued that Britain's world power position gave the British unfair advantages on international markets, thus limiting Germany's economic growth and threatening its security.<ref>Volker Rolf Berghahn,  \"German Colonialism and Imperialism from Bismarck to Hitler\" ''German Studies Review'' 40#1 (2017)  pp. 147-162 [https://doi.org/10.1353/gsr.2017.0007 Online]\n</ref>\n\nAsking whether colonies paid, economic historian Grover Clark argues an emphatic \"No!\"  He reports that in every case the support cost, especially the military system necessary to support and defend the colonies outran the total trade they produced.

As a champion of [[Realpolitik]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] disliked colonies and thought they were a waste of time, but his hand was forced by pressure from both the elites and the general population which considered the colonization a necessity for German prestige. German colonies in [[Togo]]land, [[Samoa]], [[South-West Africa]] and [[New Guinea]] had corporate commercial roots, while the equivalent German-dominated areas in East Africa and China owed more to political motives. The British also took an interest in Africa, using the [[East Africa Company]] to take over what are now Kenya and Uganda. The British crown formally took over in 1895 and renamed the area the East Africa Protectorate.\n\n[[Leopold II of Belgium]] personally owned the [[Congo Free State]] from 1885 to 1908, When round after round of international scandal regarding the abusive treatment of native workers forced the Belgium government to take full ownership and responsibility. The [[Dutch Empire]] continued to hold the [[Dutch East Indies]], which was one of the few profitable overseas colonies.\n\nIn the same manner, [[Italian Empire|Italy]] tried to conquer its \"[[place in the sun]],\" acquiring [[Somaliland]] in 1899\u201390, [[Eritrea]] and 1899, and, taking advantage of the \"[[Sick man of Europe]],\" the [[Ottoman Empire]], also conquered [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]] (modern [[Libya]]) with the 1911 [[Italo-Turkish War|Treaty of Lausanne]]. The conquest of [[Ethiopia]], which had remained the last African independent territory, had to wait till the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] in 1935\u201336 (the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] in 1895\u201396 had ended in defeat for Italy).\n\nThe [[Portuguese colonial empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish colonial empire]] were smaller, mostly legacies of past colonization. Most of their colonies had acquired independence during the [[Latin American wars of independence|Latin American revolutions]] at the beginning of the 19th century.\n\n===Imperialism in Asia===\n{{Main|Western imperialism in Asia}}\n\nIn Asia, [[The Great Game]], which lasted from 1813 to 1907, opposed the [[British Empire]] against [[Imperial Russia]] for supremacy in [[central Asia]]. [[History of China|China]] was opened to Western influence starting with the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s (1839\u20131842; 1856\u20131860). After the visits of Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] in 1852\u20131854, Japan opened itself to the Western world during the [[Meiji period]] (1868\u20131912).\n\nImperialism also took place in Burma, Indonesia (Netherlands East Indies), Malaya and the Philippines. Burma had been under British rule for nearly a hundred years, however, it was always considered an \u201cimperial backwater\u201d. This accounts for the fact that Burma does not have an obvious colonial legacy and is not a part of the Commonwealth. In the beginning, in the mid-1820s, Burma was administered from Penang in Britain's Straits Settlements. However, it was soon brought within British India, of which it remained a part until 1937.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H5qxOL6w5p4C&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=,+in+the+mid-1820s,+Burma+was+administered+from+Penang+in+Britain%E2%80%99s+Straits+Settlements#v=onepage&q=,%20in%20the%20mid-1820s,%20Burma%20was%20administered%20from%20Penang%20in%20Britain%E2%80%99s%20Straits%20Settlements&f=false|title=Burma Redux: Global Justice and the Quest for Political Reform in Myanmar|last=Holliday|first=Ian|date=2012-03-06|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231504249|language=en}}</ref> Burma was governed as a province of India, not considered very important, and barely any accommodation was made to Burmese political culture or sensitivities.

The secret 1916 [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] partitioned the Middle East between Britain and France. French mandates included [[French mandate of Syria|Syria]] and [[French mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]], whilst the British were granted [[Mandatory Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. The bulk of the Arabian peninsula became the independent Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1922. The discovery of the world's largest easily accessible crude oil deposits led to an influx of Western [[oil companies]] that dominated the region's economies until the 1970s, and making the emirs of the oil states immensely rich, enabling them to consolidate their hold on power and giving them a stake in preserving Western hegemony over the region. During the 1920 and 1930s [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] moved towards independence, although the British and French did not formally depart the region until they were forced to do so after World War II.<ref>William L.

During the first part of the 20th century, while China was still subject to various European imperialisms, Japan became an imperialist power, conquering what it called a \"[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]\".\n\nWith the final revision of treaties in 1894, Japan may be considered to have joined the family of nations on a basis of equality with the western states. From this same time imperialism became a dominant motive in Japanese policy.\n\nJapan ruled over and governed Korea and Taiwan from 1895 when the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was concluded to 1945 when Japan was defeated. In 1910, Korea was formally annexed to the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]].
