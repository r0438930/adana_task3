Garnett initially came off the bench in his rookie year, but moved into the [[starting lineup]] soon after Saunders became head coach and with the urging of [[Sam Mitchell (basketball)|Sam Mitchell]]. In the final 42 games of the year, averaged 14 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.26 blocks as a starter.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> \nIn his rookie year, Garnett and fellow newcomer [[Tom Gugliotta]] carried the scoring load. Garnett did not immediately leap to stardom as later [[prep-to-pro]] prospects such as [[Amar'e Stoudemire]], [[LeBron James]] and [[Dwight Howard]] would, but he did have a very respectable rookie year. He was voted to the All-Rookie Second Team on averages of 10.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game.<ref name=\"stats\" /> Despite having some promising players, the Timberwolves suffered through their seventh consecutive sub-30 win season and failed to make the playoffs. At the time, Garnett was the youngest NBA player in history at 19 years and 11 months of age.<ref name=\"nbabio\"/>\n\nBefore the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], the Timberwolves made a draft-day trade for [[point guard]] [[Stephon Marbury]] of the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]]. During the season, Garnett posted improved averages of 17.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.7 steals.<ref name=\"stats\" /> He also had two games where he registered eight blocks.<ref name=\"nbabio\"/> With a 40\u201342 record, the Timberwolves made their first playoff appearance in franchise history, Garnett and Gugliotta made their first All-Star appearances, and Marbury established himself as a valuable young lead guard. However, the [[Houston Rockets]], led by [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], [[Clyde Drexler]], and [[Charles Barkley]], proved to be too much as the Timberwolves were swept 3\u20130 in the first round of the [[1997 NBA Playoffs]].\n\n====Franchise player (1997\u20132001)====\nIn August 1997, Garnett and Fleisher turned down the Timberwolves' offer of a contract worth $102 million over six years. They thought there would be more offered to them on the basis of the signings of $105 million over seven years for Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat and $100.8 million over seven years for Juwan Howard with the Washington Bullets. To get out of the spotlight while negotiations were ongoing, Garnett stayed in Fleisher's Westchester County home, north of New York City. One hour before the deadline on 1 October 1997,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> the Timberwolves and Garnett agreed on a six-year contract extension that was worth an unparalleled $126 million.<ref name=\"nbabio\"/> The contract was considered a risky move and many analysts speculated that the deal would make it impossible for the Wolves to sign new players or even keep their own. The enormous size of Garnett's contract was considered, by numerous sports writers, a major cause of labor tensions between players and owners that led to a lockout which shortened the [[1998\u201399 NBA season]]. Despite the furor over his new contract, Garnett continued to improve, averaging 18.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.8 blocks, and 1.7 steals per game. Again, he was an All-Star, and the Timberwolves finished with their first winning record in franchise history (45\u201337 for the season). For the second consecutive year, the young Timberwolves bowed out of the playoffs in the first round, this time losing 3\u20132 to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] and superstar point guard [[Gary Payton]]. The two wins against the Sonics marked the Wolves' first-ever playoff game wins. The off-season started poorly for the Timberwolves though as 20-point per game scorer [[Tom Gugliotta]] left for the [[Phoenix Suns]].\n\n[[File:Kevin Garnett with the Minnesota Timberwolves dunking, 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Garnett as a member of the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] (2007)]]\nIn the lockout-shortened [[1998\u201399 NBA season|season that followed]], Garnett broke through as a superstar. Putting up stats of 20.8 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.8 blocks per game,<ref name=\"stats\" /> he was named to the All-NBA Third Team. However, midway through the season, [[Stephon Marbury]] was traded to the [[New Jersey Nets]]. Although the Wolves received two-time All-Star [[Terrell Brandon]] in return, they were not able to overcome the discord and limped into the playoffs as the eighth seed with a 25\u201325 record. The Wolves were defeated in the first round again, this time losing 3\u20131 to the eventual champion [[San Antonio Spurs]] who were led by young superstar and eventual [[NBA Finals MVP]] [[Tim Duncan]]. In the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season]], Garnett continued his notable play, averaging 22.9 points, 11.8 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.5 steals per game. Garnett also made the first of his four All-NBA First Team appearances and came in second place in the MVP voting.<ref name=\"stats\" /> Assisted by sharpshooting rookie forward [[Wally Szczerbiak]] and steady veteran [[Terrell Brandon]], the Wolves posted a franchise-best 50\u201332 record, but succumbed in the first round to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] 3\u20131.\n\nOn May 20, 2000, Timberwolves' guard and Garnett's close friend [[Malik Sealy]] was killed by a [[Drunk driving (United States)|drunk driver]] shortly after celebrating Garnett's 24th birthday.<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2000/0520/541964.html Sealy dies in collision with pickup truck], May 22, 2000</ref> Later that year, the NBA ruled that the free agent signing of [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]] was illegal. The league punished the team for the illegal signing by stripping them of three first-round draft picks, fining [[Glen Taylor]] (the owner of the team) [[$]]3.5 million, and banning [[general manager]] [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]] for one year. In the [[2000\u201301 NBA season]], Garnett led the Wolves to a 47\u201335 record and made the All-NBA Second Team, but again, the Wolves did not survive the first round of the playoffs, losing to the Spurs 3\u20131.\n\n====MVP and division champions (2001\u20132004)====\nIn the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], Garnett posted another notable season, his averages of 21.2 points, 12.1 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.2 steals per game enough for another All-NBA Second Team nomination. However, the Timberwolves bowed out in the first round for the sixth consecutive time, this time getting swept 3\u20130 by the [[Dallas Mavericks]] led by [[Michael Finley]], [[Steve Nash]] and [[Dirk Nowitzki]]. Garnett's [[2002\u201303 NBA season|next season]] was one of the best of his career, his 23.0 ppg / 13.4 rpg / 6.0 apg / 1.6 bpg / 1.4 spg season earning him his second All-NBA First Team nomination and second place in the MVP voting.<ref name=\"nbabio\"/> The Timberwolves posted a good 51\u201331 record, but for the seventh consecutive time, they did not make it out of the first round, this time losing to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] 4\u20132.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]], things finally seemed to come together for Garnett. In past years, the Wolves had practically been a one-man show, but now, the Timberwolves had made two valuable acquisitions: highly talented but volatile swingman [[Latrell Sprewell]] and the seasoned two-time NBA champion [[Sam Cassell]], who supplanted [[Troy Hudson]] at [[point guard]]. In addition, defensive center [[Ervin Johnson]] complemented the inconsistent [[Michael Olowokandi]]. Powered by the best supporting cast up to this point in his career, Garnett averaged 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 2.2 blocks and 1.5 steals per game for the season. Having recorded career-highs in points, rebounds, blocks and leading the league rebounds, Garnett was named the league [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] for the first time in his career.<ref name=\"stats\" /> With a franchise-record 58 wins, the Wolves stormed into the playoffs, and finally conquered their playoff bane by defeating the [[Denver Nuggets]] 4\u20131 in the first round. After disposing of the strong [[Sacramento Kings]] 4\u20133 in the Western Conference semi-finals, Garnett and the Timberwolves met the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. There, playmaker Cassell went down with a back injury. With reserve point guard Hudson also injured, the Timberwolves alternated between third playmaker [[Darrick Martin]] and shooting guard [[Fred Hoiberg]] at the \"one\", or even running Garnett himself as [[point forward]] or a real point guard.

Garnett did not immediately leap to stardom as later [[prep-to-pro]] prospects such as [[Amar'e Stoudemire]], [[LeBron James]] and [[Dwight Howard]] would, but he did have a very respectable rookie year. He was voted to the All-Rookie Second Team on averages of 10.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game.<ref name=\"stats\" /> Despite having some promising players, the Timberwolves suffered through their seventh consecutive sub-30 win season and failed to make the playoffs. At the time, Garnett was the youngest NBA player in history at 19 years and 11 months of age.<ref name=\"nbabio\"/>\n\nBefore the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], the Timberwolves made a draft-day trade for [[point guard]] [[Stephon Marbury]] of the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]]. During the season, Garnett posted improved averages of 17.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.7 steals.<ref name=\"stats\" /> He also had two games where he registered eight blocks.<ref name=\"nbabio\"/> With a 40\u201342 record, the Timberwolves made their first playoff appearance in franchise history, Garnett and Gugliotta made their first All-Star appearances, and Marbury established himself as a valuable young lead guard. However, the [[Houston Rockets]], led by [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], [[Clyde Drexler]], and [[Charles Barkley]], proved to be too much as the Timberwolves were swept 3\u20130 in the first round of the [[1997 NBA Playoffs]].\n\n====Franchise player (1997\u20132001)====\nIn August 1997, Garnett and Fleisher turned down the Timberwolves' offer of a contract worth $102 million over six years. They thought there would be more offered to them on the basis of the signings of $105 million over seven years for Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat and $100.8 million over seven years for Juwan Howard with the Washington Bullets. To get out of the spotlight while negotiations were ongoing, Garnett stayed in Fleisher's Westchester County home, north of New York City. One hour before the deadline on 1 October 1997,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> the Timberwolves and Garnett agreed on a six-year contract extension that was worth an unparalleled $126 million.<ref name=\"nbabio\"/> The contract was considered a risky move and many analysts speculated that the deal would make it impossible for the Wolves to sign new players or even keep their own. The enormous size of Garnett's contract was considered, by numerous sports writers, a major cause of labor tensions between players and owners that led to a lockout which shortened the [[1998\u201399 NBA season]]. Despite the furor over his new contract, Garnett continued to improve, averaging 18.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.8 blocks, and 1.7 steals per game. Again, he was an All-Star, and the Timberwolves finished with their first winning record in franchise history (45\u201337 for the season). For the second consecutive year, the young Timberwolves bowed out of the playoffs in the first round, this time losing 3\u20132 to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] and superstar point guard [[Gary Payton]]. The two wins against the Sonics marked the Wolves' first-ever playoff game wins. The off-season started poorly for the Timberwolves though as 20-point per game scorer [[Tom Gugliotta]] left for the [[Phoenix Suns]].\n\n[[File:Kevin Garnett with the Minnesota Timberwolves dunking, 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Garnett as a member of the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] (2007)]]\nIn the lockout-shortened [[1998\u201399 NBA season|season that followed]], Garnett broke through as a superstar. Putting up stats of 20.8 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.8 blocks per game,<ref name=\"stats\" /> he was named to the All-NBA Third Team. However, midway through the season, [[Stephon Marbury]] was traded to the [[New Jersey Nets]]. Although the Wolves received two-time All-Star [[Terrell Brandon]] in return, they were not able to overcome the discord and limped into the playoffs as the eighth seed with a 25\u201325 record. The Wolves were defeated in the first round again, this time losing 3\u20131 to the eventual champion [[San Antonio Spurs]] who were led by young superstar and eventual [[NBA Finals MVP]] [[Tim Duncan]]. In the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season]], Garnett continued his notable play, averaging 22.9 points, 11.8 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.5 steals per game. Garnett also made the first of his four All-NBA First Team appearances and came in second place in the MVP voting.<ref name=\"stats\" /> Assisted by sharpshooting rookie forward [[Wally Szczerbiak]] and steady veteran [[Terrell Brandon]], the Wolves posted a franchise-best 50\u201332 record, but succumbed in the first round to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] 3\u20131.\n\nOn May 20, 2000, Timberwolves' guard and Garnett's close friend [[Malik Sealy]] was killed by a [[Drunk driving (United States)|drunk driver]] shortly after celebrating Garnett's 24th birthday.<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2000/0520/541964.html Sealy dies in collision with pickup truck], May 22, 2000</ref> Later that year, the NBA ruled that the free agent signing of [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]] was illegal. The league punished the team for the illegal signing by stripping them of three first-round draft picks, fining [[Glen Taylor]] (the owner of the team) [[$]]3.5 million, and banning [[general manager]] [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]] for one year. In the [[2000\u201301 NBA season]], Garnett led the Wolves to a 47\u201335 record and made the All-NBA Second Team, but again, the Wolves did not survive the first round of the playoffs, losing to the Spurs 3\u20131.\n\n====MVP and division champions (2001\u20132004)====\nIn the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], Garnett posted another notable season, his averages of 21.2 points, 12.1 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.2 steals per game enough for another All-NBA Second Team nomination. However, the Timberwolves bowed out in the first round for the sixth consecutive time, this time getting swept 3\u20130 by the [[Dallas Mavericks]] led by [[Michael Finley]], [[Steve Nash]] and [[Dirk Nowitzki]]. Garnett's [[2002\u201303 NBA season|next season]] was one of the best of his career, his 23.0 ppg / 13.4 rpg / 6.0 apg / 1.6 bpg / 1.4 spg season earning him his second All-NBA First Team nomination and second place in the MVP voting.<ref name=\"nbabio\"/> The Timberwolves posted a good 51\u201331 record, but for the seventh consecutive time, they did not make it out of the first round, this time losing to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] 4\u20132.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]], things finally seemed to come together for Garnett. In past years, the Wolves had practically been a one-man show, but now, the Timberwolves had made two valuable acquisitions: highly talented but volatile swingman [[Latrell Sprewell]] and the seasoned two-time NBA champion [[Sam Cassell]], who supplanted [[Troy Hudson]] at [[point guard]]. In addition, defensive center [[Ervin Johnson]] complemented the inconsistent [[Michael Olowokandi]]. Powered by the best supporting cast up to this point in his career, Garnett averaged 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 2.2 blocks and 1.5 steals per game for the season. Having recorded career-highs in points, rebounds, blocks and leading the league rebounds, Garnett was named the league [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] for the first time in his career.<ref name=\"stats\" /> With a franchise-record 58 wins, the Wolves stormed into the playoffs, and finally conquered their playoff bane by defeating the [[Denver Nuggets]] 4\u20131 in the first round. After disposing of the strong [[Sacramento Kings]] 4\u20133 in the Western Conference semi-finals, Garnett and the Timberwolves met the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. There, playmaker Cassell went down with a back injury. With reserve point guard Hudson also injured, the Timberwolves alternated between third playmaker [[Darrick Martin]] and shooting guard [[Fred Hoiberg]] at the \"one\", or even running Garnett himself as [[point forward]] or a real point guard. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] pulled off a 4\u20132 victory in the series.\n\n====Frustration (2004\u20132007)====\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]], Garnett was able to record a career-high in terms of scoring as he scored 47 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in a 115-122 loss to the Phoenix Suns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200501040MIN.html|title=Phoenix Suns at Minnesota Timberwolves Box Score, January 4, 2005|publisher=Basketball Reference|date=January 4, 2005|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref> He was also named to the All-NBA Second Team,<ref name=\"stats\" /> but the Timberwolves failed to make the playoffs for the first time in eight years with a record of 44\u201338. The [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] brought more frustration for Garnett. Sprewell turned down a three-year, $21 million extension, and the Wolves wary of his injuries and age, traded [[Sam Cassell|Cassell]] for the much less effective [[Marko Jari\u0107]], and the team's record for 2005\u201306 fell to 33\u201349. Despite Garnett's play, the team logged the second worst record since Garnett joined the franchise. Garnett subsequently earned All-NBA Third Team honors.\n\nDuring the 2007 off-season, Glen Taylor admitted that although he had planned on retaining Garnett, he would finally listen to trade offers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/507/story/1261571.html |title=Sid Hartman, June 21: KG traded?
