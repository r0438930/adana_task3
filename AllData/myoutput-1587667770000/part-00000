They follow the Chinese lunar calendar of the 12-year cycle and their typical song-dance which is famously known as Tamang selo, which include the songs of humor and wit, satire, joy and sorrow. Tamangs have their own music. Their musical instrument is called Damphu (a small round drum covered with goat skin). Loshar is their religious festival.[https://www.indigenousvoice.com/en/indigenous-peoples/18/tamang.html]\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:Tamang Sonam Lochhar 2018 DC (38533764940).jpg|thumb|Sonam Lochar Festival]]\n'''Sonam Lhochhar'''  is the main festival of the Tamangs and is celebrated in the month on Magh (February - March).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://streetnepal.com/sonam-lhochhar-celebrated/|title=Sonam Lhochhar celebrated  {{!}} Street Nepal|website=streetnepal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816080424/http://streetnepal.com/sonam-lhochhar-celebrated/|archivedate=2016-08-16}}</ref> It is celebrated to welcome the Tamang new year.\n\nColorful flags, printed Buddhist [[mantra]] cloths are put up in various places in villages and towns.<ref name=\"Ghimire\" />  The Tamangs have a genre of music called \" ''[[Tamang Selo]]\"'' that is performed with the ''[[Damphu drum|Damplu]]'' instrument, also known as Damphoo Dance, having a brisk movement and rhythmic beat specific to the Tamangs.<ref name=\"EmergentNE\" />\n\nThe second most important festival is '''Saga Dawa''' (Buddha Jayanti) and is celebrated as a religious festival.<ref name=\"Chronicles of ADVENTURE TRAVEL\"/>\n\n[[Dashain]] and [[Tihar (festival)]] is also celebrated with much enthusiasm by Tamangs.<ref name=\"Ghimire\" />\n\n===Livelihood===\nMost Tamangs are farmers, engaged in [[agriculture]]. Due to the lack of irrigation at higher altitudes, their crops are often limited to corn, millet, wheat, barley, and potatoes.  They often supplement their farming income with manual labour.  Due to the discrimination experienced by the Tamang people in the past, they have remained on the whole poorly educated, and the majority have been limited to working as farmers, mountain trekking, portering, and driving in Kathmandu. They also work in manufacture of Tibetan rugs, Thankas (Tibetan painting), driving and labour.  As far as farming is concerned, Tamang are dependent on rainfall and do not employ modern machinery.<ref name=\"Ghimire\" />\n\n==Trekking and tourism==\nTamang villages are often visited on Nepal's numerous trekking routes, one being labelled ''Tamang Heritage Trail''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Post Report |url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2015-07-30/tamang-heritage-trail-reopens-after-quake.html |title=The Kathmandu Post :: Tamang Heritage Trail reopens after quake |publisher=Kathmandupost.ekantipur.com |accessdate=2015-12-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065012/http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2015-07-30/tamang-heritage-trail-reopens-after-quake.html |archivedate=2015-12-08 }}</ref>\n== Notable Tamangs ==\n[[File:Navneet-Aditya-Waiba-Live.jpg|thumb|Navneet Aditya Waiba- Nepali Folk Singer|alt=Nepali Folk Singer]]\n[[File:Kulman-Ghising-Nepal-Electricity-Authority MD.jpg|thumb|Kulman Ghising]]\n\nTamangs are known in Nepali Art/Music, Politics, Novels and Civil servants of Nepal.
