It followed the [[1913 Auckland Rugby League season]] where [[North Shore Albions]] were crowned senior champions for the first time. The senior grade saw the addition of [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had previously competed in the lower grades only, and [[Grafton Athletic]]. The [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] and [[Eden Ramblers]] no longer contributed teams. The first grade was won once again by [[North Shore Albions]].\n\nAt a meeting of [[Auckland Rugby League]] on 9 May it was decided that the proceeds of ticket sales at club games would be split 50\u201350 between the teams and [[Auckland Rugby League]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140511.2.8.1|title=FOOTBALL.

The worst case being in the Round 9 match where [[Newton Rangers]] could only field eight players, with two spectators from the crowd later joining them as they were defeated by 43 points to 2 by [[North Shore Albions]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nNear the conclusion of the season a match was played at [[Victoria Park, New Zealand|Victoria Park]] between a team of veterans and Auckland colts on 29 August. It raised \u00a327 and 10 shillings for the Patriotic Fund. Also a \"Patriotic Carnival\" was held on 5 September. A fancy dress carnival paraded around town with Highland pipers and a brass band. It proceeded to the [[Auckland Domain]] where a 3rd grade match was being played between Remuera and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] 3rd Grade teams, and a \u2018Burlesque\u2019 football game was then played. Finally a match was played between the North Island Jockeys and [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] 3rd grade team which the jockey's won 11\u20136. \u00a349 was raised for the Patriotic Fund.<ref>{{cite news \n| title = Fancy Dress Carnival\n| page =8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15707\n| date = 1914-09-07\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140907.2.86.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-12}}</ref>\n\n==Lower Grade Clubs==\nTeams which fielded sides in lower grades were the [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote Ramblers]], Hobsonville Pirates, Sunnyside (on the North Shore), Remuera and [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau]].\n\n==Representative Season==\nThe [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative campaign got underway with a match versus the touring [[England rugby league team|England]] team where the home side lost.

The match between North Shore and Newton was a farce with Newton only mustering 8 players. Two of the spectators joined the Newton team who were being trounced and the match finished 43 to 2 in favour of North Shore. The newspapers did not bother recording the point scorers though they did mention that the Shore side gave everybody in the team a chance to kick for goal.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 5\u20132\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Ponsonby Defeats City/Wins for North Shore and Grafton\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = City\n| try1 = [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = [[Charles Webb (rugby league)|Charles Webb]] (mark)\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = [[Ernie Asher]]\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Ferguson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Otahuhu\n| score = 8\u201317\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grafton V Otahuhu\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = George Cook, [[Arthur Hardgrave]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = M Stanaway\n| try2 = [[Bob Mitchell (rugby league)|Bob Mitchell]], [[Karl Ifwersen]] 2\n| con2 = [[Karl Ifwersen]] 3\n| pen2 = [[Karl Ifwersen]]\n| stadium = Otahuhu\n| attendance =\n| referee = Tyson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = North Shore\n| score = 43\u20132\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title = North Shore V Newton\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = Newton\n| try1 = unknown x ?\n| con1 = unknown x ?\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = unknown x 1\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = Benson\n}}\n\n===Final===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 18 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 2\u201313\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Championship Final/Won by North Shore/A Record Attendance\n| page = 4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15665\n| date = 1914-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140720.2.10.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = [[Charles Webb (rugby league)|Charles Webb]]\n| try2 =Wynyard, Edward Fox, [[Stan Weston]]\n| con2 = Jack Paul 2\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = R Benson\n}}\n\n===Top Try Scorers and Point Scorers===\nNone of the North Shore point scorers from their farcical Round 9 match with Newton Rangers were credited and therefore the following lists will be inaccurate as 43 points were scored by them.
