And here, I would suggest, is the most basic connection between the Bible and violence, more basic than any command or teaching it contains....The Bible has contributed to violence in the world precisely because it has been taken to confer a degree of certitude that transcends human discussion and argumentation.\"<ref name=Collins/>{{rp|32\u201333}}  Collins, writing as a Christian scholar, also notes:  \"It is not unusual for Christian interpreters to claim that 'the Biblical witness to the innocent victims and the God of victims demystifies and demythologizes this sacred social order' in which violence is grounded.  Such a selective reading, privileging the death of Jesus or the suffering servant, is certainly possible and even commendable, but it does not negate the force of the biblical endorsements of violence that we have been considering. The full canonical shape of the Christian Bible, for what it is worth, still concludes with the judgement scene in Revelation, in which the Lamb that was slain returns as the heavenly warrior with a sword for striking down the nations.\"<ref name=Collins/>{{rp|27}}\n\n[[Regina Schwartz]] is among those who seek to reimagine Christianity and the Christian biblical canon in ways that reduce violence which she describes as arising from the ancient Israelite invention of monotheism and some of the ways that the ancient Israelites conceived of themselves in relation to that one god and to other peoples, which Christians inherited. She wrote:  \"The Other against whom Israel's identity is forged is abhorred, abject, impure, and in the \"Old Testament,\" vast numbers of them are obliterated, while in the \"New Testament,\" vast numbers are colonized (converted).  The tying of identity to rejection runs counter to much of the drive that could be found elsewhere, both in the Bible and throughout religious myth and ritual, to forge identity through analogy, even identification....Among all the rich variety, I would categorize two broad understandings of identity in the Bible: one grounded in Negation (or scarcity) and the other in Multiplicity (or plenitude).<ref name=\"Regina Schwartz\">{{cite book | last =Schwartz | first =Regina | title = The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism | url =https://archive.org/details/curseofcainviole00schw | url-access =registration | publisher = the University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, Ill | year = 1997 }}</ref>{{rp|18\u201319}} Near the end of her book, she wrote:  \"My re-vision would produce an alternative Bible that subverts the dominant vision of violence and scarcity with an ideal of plenitude and its corollary ethical imperative of generosity.

The Deuteronomists expressed their new notions of the transcendence and power of God by means of ideas and associated laws around unity\u2014the one-ness of God, worshipped at the one temple in Jerusalem, by one people, kept distinct from the rest of world just as God is; zealously and violently so.<ref name=geller>{{cite book|last1=Geller|first1=Stephen A.|title=Sacred enigmas : literary religion in the Hebrew Bible|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0415127714|edition=1. publ.}}</ref>{{rp|32-22}}  Likewise the Priestly author adapted the myths and rituals of the ANE and the specific traditions of the ancient Israelites to forge different meanings for blood sacrifice than their neighbors had, specifically in the elaborate and precarious rituals on the [[Day of Atonement]] when the High Priest had to enter the Holy of Holies and the presence of God; in their work the Priestly authors also attempted to express the transcendence and unity of God who is yet in a relationship with humanity with all its variable sinfulness.  In Geller's reading the blood is not magical nor is the animal just a substitute for a human sacrifice; instead blood is at once an expression of the violence of the fallen world where people kill in order to eat (unlike Eden) and the blood itself becomes a means for redemption; it is forbidden to be eaten, as a sign of restraint and recognition, and is instead offered to God, and in that action the relationship between fallen humanity and God is restored. The Priestly authors underline the importance of all this by recalling the mortal danger faced by the High Priests, through the telling of the deaths of [[Nadab and Abihu]] when God refused their \"strange offering\" and consumed them with fire.<ref name=geller/>{{rp|32-22}} One result of this reformulating work, is a God with aspects of terrifying and powerful otherness; as Annie Dillard wrote in [[Pilgrim at Tinker Creek]]: \"Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? The churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning. It is madness to wear ladies\u2019 straw hats and velvet hats to church; we should all be wearing crash helmets.

That is the center of Christian faith. All the rest turns on this. A curious consequence of this confession is that simply because Christians are Christians they inevitably adopt some specific posture toward the Jewish people, a posture that is always theological and practical at once....The question, then, has never been whether Christians should speak and act with reference to the Jewish people. Rather, the question has been how they should do so, and how what they would say and do would affect the existence of the Jewish people. For most of the past two millennia, the church's posture toward the Jewish people has come to expression in the teaching known as supersessionism, also known as the theology of displacement....

Fourth, genocide and mass slaughter follow in the Book of Joshua.  These highly dubious traditions of the Bible have been kept before subsequent generations of Jews and Christians in their prayers\u2026. The historical evidence, however, strongly suggests that such [[genocidal massacre]]s never actually took place, although these racist, xenophobic and militaristic narratives remained for later generations as powerful examples of divine aid in battle and of a divine command for widespread slaughter of an enemy\u2026. [Professor Bernardo Gandulla, of the University of Buenos Aires], while sharing Prior's critique of the perverse use that Zionism and the State of Israel have made of the Bible to support their 'ethnic cleansing' policies in Palestine, \u2026  Prior \u2026 found incitement to war and violence in the very foundation documents of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  In the Hebrew Bible, for instance, there is a dominant strand that sees God as ethnocentric and militaristic.  Furthermore, in their conquest of Canaan, the Israelites are commanded by Yahweh to destroy the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine.  Later in the days of the Israelite kingdoms, they are urged to show no pity, but to massacre their enemies\u2026.

It is instructive (and distressing) to note that contemporary Jewish ultra-nationalists in Israel root their politics in the Book of Joshua and equate their territorial aspirations with the will of God.  Here, for example, is [[Shlomo Aviner]], a prominent theorist of the Gush Emunim \u2026 movement: 'from the point of view of mankind's humanistic morality we were in the wrong in (taking the land) from the Canaanites.  There is only one catch.  The command of God ordered us to be the people of the land of Israel'.

David delivers two hundred, and becomes the king's son-in-law (1 Samuel 18). Saul again wishes David dead, but they are reconciled by Saul's son [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]].\n\nWar comes again, David is victorious. Saul again wants to kill David, and he flees with help from his wife. Saul searches for him and slays the inhabitants of the city [[Nob, Israel|Nob]] for aiding David (1 Samuel 22). David defeats the Philistines at [[Keilah]], then flees the city pursued by Saul (1 Samuel 22). David and Saul reconcile. David seeks refuge with [[Achish]], king of [[Gath (city)|Gath]], and claims he is raiding Judah but is actually raiding and killing in other places (1 Samuel 27). The Philistines begins a war against Saul. David's wives [[Ahinoam]] and [[Abigail]] are taken in a raid on [[Ziklag]], but he rescue them (1 Samuel 30). The men of Israel flee before the Philistines, and three of Saul's sons are slain. Saul asks his armour-bearer to kill him, but is refused, so he takes his own life. The armour-bearer also takes his own life. Saul's body is beheaded and fastened to a city-wall by the victorious Philistines, but it is retaken by inhabitants of [[Jabesh-Gilead]] (1 Samuel 30).\n\nA man tells David of Saul's death and that he himself killed Saul. David has him killed (2 Samuel 1). A long war starts between David and Saul's son [[Ish-bosheth]] (2 Samuel 3). David demands and is granted the return of his first wife Michal, despite the public grief of her new husband [[Palti, son of Laish|Palti]]. Two men assassinate Ish-bosheth, and David has them killed (2 Samuel 4). David wars victoriously with the Philistines. While transporting the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a man called [[Uzzah]] carelessly touches it and is killed by God (2 Samuel 6).\n\nDavid defeats and plunder several enemies, and \"executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.\" (2 Samuel 8). [[Ammon#Biblical narrative|The children of Ammon]] mistreat David's emissaries, and is defeated by his army (2 Samuel 10).\n\nIn order to make [[Bathsheba]] his wife, David successfully plots the death of [[Uriah the Hittite|her husband]]. This displeases God, and David is told that \"the sword shall never depart from thy house.\" God kills David's and Bathsheba's child, that was conceived during her previous marriage. She then gives birth to [[Solomon]].  David conquers and plunders the city [[Rabbah]] (2 Samuel 11-12).\n\nDavid's son [[Amnon]] rapes his half-sister [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]]. [[Absalom]], her full brother, in return has him killed (2 Samuel 13). Absalom conspires and revolts against David. Absalom is finally defeated and dies in the [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim]], and David mourns him (2 Samuel 15-19). [[Sheba son of Bichri]] revolts, but is ultimately beheaded (2 Samuel 20).\n\nIn 2 Samuel 21, David has seven of Sauls sons and grandsons killed, including \"the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul\", though he spares Sauls grandson [[Mephibosheth]].

And here, I would suggest, is the most basic connection between the Bible and violence, more basic than any command or teaching it contains....The Bible has contributed to violence in the world precisely because it has been taken to confer a degree of certitude that transcends human discussion and argumentation.\"<ref name=Collins/>{{rp|32\u201333}}  Collins, writing as a Christian scholar, also notes:  \"It is not unusual for Christian interpreters to claim that 'the Biblical witness to the innocent victims and the God of victims demystifies and demythologizes this sacred social order' in which violence is grounded.  Such a selective reading, privileging the death of Jesus or the suffering servant, is certainly possible and even commendable, but it does not negate the force of the biblical endorsements of violence that we have been considering. The full canonical shape of the Christian Bible, for what it is worth, still concludes with the judgement scene in Revelation, in which the Lamb that was slain returns as the heavenly warrior with a sword for striking down the nations.\"<ref name=Collins/>{{rp|27}}\n\n[[Regina Schwartz]] is among those who seek to reimagine Christianity and the Christian biblical canon in ways that reduce violence which she describes as arising from the ancient Israelite invention of monotheism and some of the ways that the ancient Israelites conceived of themselves in relation to that one god and to other peoples, which Christians inherited. She wrote:  \"The Other against whom Israel's identity is forged is abhorred, abject, impure, and in the \"Old Testament,\" vast numbers of them are obliterated, while in the \"New Testament,\" vast numbers are colonized (converted).  The tying of identity to rejection runs counter to much of the drive that could be found elsewhere, both in the Bible and throughout religious myth and ritual, to forge identity through analogy, even identification....Among all the rich variety, I would categorize two broad understandings of identity in the Bible: one grounded in Negation (or scarcity) and the other in Multiplicity (or plenitude).<ref name=\"Regina Schwartz\">{{cite book | last =Schwartz | first =Regina | title = The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism | url =https://archive.org/details/curseofcainviole00schw | url-access =registration | publisher = the University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, Ill | year = 1997 }}</ref>{{rp|18\u201319}} Near the end of her book, she wrote:  \"My re-vision would produce an alternative Bible that subverts the dominant vision of violence and scarcity with an ideal of plenitude and its corollary ethical imperative of generosity.

The Deuteronomists expressed their new notions of the transcendence and power of God by means of ideas and associated laws around unity\u2014the one-ness of God, worshipped at the one temple in Jerusalem, by one people, kept distinct from the rest of world just as God is; zealously and violently so.<ref name=geller>{{cite book|last1=Geller|first1=Stephen A.|title=Sacred enigmas : literary religion in the Hebrew Bible|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0415127714|edition=1. publ.}}</ref>{{rp|32-22}}  Likewise the Priestly author adapted the myths and rituals of the ANE and the specific traditions of the ancient Israelites to forge different meanings for blood sacrifice than their neighbors had, specifically in the elaborate and precarious rituals on the [[Day of Atonement]] when the High Priest had to enter the Holy of Holies and the presence of God; in their work the Priestly authors also attempted to express the transcendence and unity of God who is yet in a relationship with humanity with all its variable sinfulness.  In Geller's reading the blood is not magical nor is the animal just a substitute for a human sacrifice; instead blood is at once an expression of the violence of the fallen world where people kill in order to eat (unlike Eden) and the blood itself becomes a means for redemption; it is forbidden to be eaten, as a sign of restraint and recognition, and is instead offered to God, and in that action the relationship between fallen humanity and God is restored. The Priestly authors underline the importance of all this by recalling the mortal danger faced by the High Priests, through the telling of the deaths of [[Nadab and Abihu]] when God refused their \"strange offering\" and consumed them with fire.<ref name=geller/>{{rp|32-22}} One result of this reformulating work, is a God with aspects of terrifying and powerful otherness; as Annie Dillard wrote in [[Pilgrim at Tinker Creek]]: \"Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? The churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning.

A curious consequence of this confession is that simply because Christians are Christians they inevitably adopt some specific posture toward the Jewish people, a posture that is always theological and practical at once....The question, then, has never been whether Christians should speak and act with reference to the Jewish people. Rather, the question has been how they should do so, and how what they would say and do would affect the existence of the Jewish people. For most of the past two millennia, the church's posture toward the Jewish people has come to expression in the teaching known as supersessionism, also known as the theology of displacement.... In the early nineteenth century, some progressive Christian theologians carried the idea of supersessionism to a new level.

Accordingly, it is important to look at this particular segment of the Old Testament: it not only describes a situation where a group undertakes to totally destroy other groups, but it also had a major influence on shaping thought and belief systems that permitted, and even inspired, genocide.\"</ref>\n\nSociologists Frank Robert Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn question \"the applicability of the term [genocide] to earlier periods of history, and the judgmental and moral loadings that have become associated with it.\"<ref name=\"Frank Robert Chalk\">{{cite book|author1-last=Chalk| author1-first=Frank Robert| author2-last=Jonassohn| author2-first=Kurt| title=The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies|url=https://archive.org/details/historysociology00chal|url-access=registration| year=1990| publisher = Yale University Press| location=New Haven, Connecticut| isbn=978-0-300-04445-4| pages=[https://archive.org/details/historysociology00chal/page/3 3], 23\u201327}}</ref> Since most societies of the past endured and practiced genocide, it was accepted as \"being in the nature of life\" because of the \"coarseness and brutality\" of life.<ref name=\"Frank Robert Chalk\"/>{{rp|27}} Chalk and Jonassohn say the Old Testament contains cases they would consider genocide (if they were factual) because of women and children being killed even though it was war and casualties in war are excluded from the definition of genocide.

Berger (Ed). Transaction Publishers, 1994, p 46::\"[God] looked with favor on what we may fairly call their [Israelite] proto-genocidal destructiveness.  The Book of Joshua provides us with one of the earliest texts in which a deity quite plainly promotes the destruction of a people.  As the Hebrews, under Joshua's leadership, undertake the conquest of Canaan, they massacre everyone who stands in their way\u2026. It is instructive (and distressing) to note that contemporary Jewish ultra-nationalists in Israel root their politics in the Book of Joshua and equate their territorial aspirations with the will of God.  Here, for example, is [[Shlomo Aviner]], a prominent theorist of the Gush Emunim \u2026 movement: 'from the point of view of mankind's humanistic morality we were in the wrong in (taking the land) from the Canaanites.  There is only one catch.  The command of God ordered us to be the people of the land of Israel'.  Others have identified the Palestinians as 'Canaanites' who are engaged in a 'suicidal' struggle opposing God's own intentions;  hence the Jewish people must be prepared to destroy them if they persist in pursuing their collective 'death-wish'.\"</ref> Several scholars draw similar conclusions.<ref>Whitelam, Keith W., ''The invention of ancient Israel: the silencing of Palestinian history'', Routledge, 1996, especially pp 71\u2013121.

In doing so, the violence perpetrated against these groups is not only justified, but indeed, part and parcel of the original divine plan.
