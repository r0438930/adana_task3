(It is often referred to as \"Roman Catholic\", occasionally as \"Catholic High\", and most commonly as \"Roman\".) The \"Catholic Girls High School\" was founded in 1912. Mary McMichan, one of the school's founders, requested in her last will that the school be renamed in honor of her brother.  The school became \"John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School\" after her death. Both schools are still in existence.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1927 West Catholic Boys and Girls and Northeast Catholic were opened. Despite the economic hardships of the 1930s and 1940s, seven more diocesan high schools were founded. During a 22-year growth period from 1945 to 1967, fifteen high schools were opened.\n\n;Philadelphia\n*[[Archbishop Ryan High School]], established 1966\n*[[Father Judge High School]], established 1954; administered by the [[Oblates of St. Francis de Sales]]\n*[[J.
